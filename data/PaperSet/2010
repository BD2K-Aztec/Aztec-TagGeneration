Genome analysis Genome Fusion Detection: a novel method to detect fusion genes from SNP-array data Motivation: Fusion genes result from genomic rearrangements, such as deletions, amplifications and translocations. Such rearrangements can also frequently be observed in cancer and have been postulated as driving event in cancer development. to detect them, one needs to analyze the transition region of two segments with different copy number, the location where fusions are known to occur. Finding fusion genes is essential to understanding cancer development and may lead to new therapeutic approaches. Results: Here we present a novel method, the Genomic Fusion Detection algorithm, to predict fusion genes on a genomic level based on SNP-array data. This algorithm detects genes at the transition region of segments with copy number variation. With the application of defined constraints, certain properties of the detected genes are evaluated to predict whether they may be fused. We evaluated our prediction by calculating the observed frequency of known fusions in both primary cancers and cell lines. We tested a set of cell lines positive for the BCR-ABL1 fusion and prostate cancers positive for the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. We could detect the fusions in all positive cell lines, but not in the negative controls. Availability: The algorithm is available from the supplement.Genomic alterations are changes within the genomic sequence due to deletions, amplifications, translocations and other genomic rearrangements. These alterations can affect the balance of gene regulation networks and thus the proliferation and survival of cells . In consequence, genomic alterations are often observed in cancer , now widely accepted as a disease with a strong genetic component based on the insight that cancer is almost always accompanied by rather severe changes on the genetic level . Research in the field of oncogenomics focuses on such mutation events most likely to result in deregulation (i.e. inactivation or activation) of genes. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, for example, plays a major role in cancer development . The first detected functional fusion of two genes was found in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It is a genomic translocation, generated on chromosome 22 by a translocation of the long arm of chromosome 9 to chromosome 22, causing a truncated chromosome 22, the so-called Philadelphia chromosome, and an elongated chromosome 9. The resulting fusion is named after the two involved genes, BCR-ABL1. It was shown that this fusion plays an important role in the development of CML . Even though the relevance of translocation events in cancer development was pointed out, it was widely assumed that this is a unique feature of leukemia . One reason for this was the lack of technologies to detect complex structural rearrangements within the genome with high resolution. Hence, fusion genes remained unexplored for some time. This view changed with the decoding of the human genome and the associated substantial progress in the development of laboratory and bioinformatics methods . The advent of high-throughput methods like RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and high-resolution microarrays have enabled accurate descriptions of structural changes within the genome. This advancement in technology facilitated the detection of further fusions, e.g. the EML4-ALK fusion in lung cancer and the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in prostate cancer. Their identification and characterization led to the conclusion that fusion genes also play an important role in solid cancers, dramatically changing the interest in fusion genes . As a consequence, the available information on cancer genomes and their chromosomal aberrations has increased significantly in the past few years, leading to drugs for inhibiting and diagnostic kits for detecting them. Pfizer, for example, developed Crizotinib, a drug to inhibit the ALK part of the EML4-ALK fusion . Novartis AG developed Imatinib (trade-name: Glivec), targeting the protein encoded by BCR-ABL1 and inhibiting the activity of the tyrosine kinase ABL1 . Recently, it was shown that Sorafenib (trade-name: Nexavar, developed by Bayer AG) also inhibits BCR-ABL1 kinase activities, including the Imatinibresistant E255K and T315I mutants of this fusion . The fusion of the TMPRSS2 gene with E-twenty six (ETS) family genes like ETV1, ERG and ETV4 occurs in up to 70 of all prostate cancers and is therefore a specific To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Companies like China Medical Technologies (http://www.china meditech.com) and KREATECH (http://www.kreatech.com) have developed kits to detect the fusion of TMPRSS2 with an ETS family member, increasing the sensitivity of diagnosing prostate cancer . The importance of research in this field is shown by the high success rate of these drugs and diagnostic kits.The BCR-ABL1 fusion was predicted to exist in all BCR-ABL1 positive cell lines , but not in the BCR-ABL1negative cell line KG-1 (Supplementary), as there were no breakpoints in BCR or ABL1 detected (Supplementary). Both segments of the BCR-ABL1 fusion, within the BCRABL1positive cell lines differ in their CN. The CN of both segments is inconsistent across the cell lines. Most of them have a CN between two and five except K-562, which sets itself apart from the others with a CN of 13 for the BCR part and a CN of 12 for the ABL1 part. The absolute correlation coefficient is 0.999 for the BCR-ABL1 fusion in all cell lines. An RMS of 0.7 can be observed for the crossover region of the BCR-ABL1 fusion in K-562 owing to the high CN. In the other cell lines, the RMS is smaller. Given that the BCR-ABL1 fusion results from a translocation of the long arm of chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 and vice versa, there is a BCR-ABL1 fusion on chromosome 22 and an ABL1-BCR fusion on chromosome 9. The ABL1-BCR fusion was predicted in five of seven BCR-ABL1positive cell lines. The CN of all predictions is between one and three with a correlation coefficient of at least 0.98. It can be observed that the CN of both parts from the ABL1-BCR fusion is continuously lower than in the CML-characteristic fusion BCR-ABL1. This is especially true for the CN of the ABL1-BCR fusion in K-562, which has a CN of three for the ABL1 and two for the BCR part and a RMS of 0.7. The ABL1-BCR fusion was predicted in six cell lines shown in, but there are only two subgroups with three and two members reported because the cell line KCL-22 is discarded owing to the constraint that the distance between two fusions of one group has to be at most 40 of the median sequence length.also shows that the start and end positions of this fusion are conserved, whereas the positions within the fusion border vary. The positions of BV-173, MEG-01 and K-562 lie close together, whereas the positions of EM-2 and LAMA-84 differ from the other cell lines. This observation confirms the clustering analysis in. The main differences are in the end position of the ABL1 part, leading to two groups of ABL1-BCR fusions in the clustering. To estimate the quality of SNP6-based fusion prediction, the results of GFD are compared with deFuse, an algorithm detecting fusion proteins in RNA-seq data. deFuse detected 11 fusions in cell line K-562, but only the BCR-ABL1 fusion was detected by both algorithms. The start and end position of the BCR segment differ $4 kb and $87 bp, respectively. The ABL1 segment differs $119 kb at the start position and $1.5 kb at the end position. The fusion length is 258 798 bp for the GFD prediction and 144 320 bp for the deFuse prediction, which is a difference of 114 478 bp. deFuse did not find the ABL1-BCR fusion. Probe intensities of the BCR and the ABL1 gene in K-562 are shown in Supplementary. The main parts of BCR (80 probes) and ABL1 (245 probes) define the BCR-ABL1 fusion, whereas the ABL1-BCR fusion is defined by the smaller remaining parts). No common intrachromosomal fusion was found. BCR-ABL1negative KG-1 has no fusion in common with any other cell line (Supplementary). We found the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in NCI-H660, but not in any other prostate cancer cell line (Supplementary). In the primary prostate samples, we verified the fusion in all fusion-positive samples (i.e. SH32, P9, P55, P68 and P98), but not in any of the matched normal samples or in sample SH36 (Supplementary). The latter harbors a deletion in 21q22.3, but not across 21q22.2 and 22.3 required to constitute the fusion . One of the primary prostate cancer samples is seen as outlier in the clustering due to a violation of a constraint (440 of the median sequence length and no other sample with a fusion of similar length). Here, we found an atypical stretch of the fusion across both genes not seen in any other sample.For evaluation, seven BCR-ABL1positive CML cell lines and one BCR-ABL1 negative AML cell line were used. It was shown that GFD predicts the BCR-ABL1 fusion in all BCR-ABL1positive cell lines. The breakpoint positions of BCR-ABL1 within cell line K-562 on chromosome 22 and chromosome 9 found by GFD are close to the published positions . The ABL1-BCR fusion formed on chromosome 9 was predicted in five of seven cell lines. There is a chance that a gene will still be normally expressed even though it participates in a fusion, owing to a second copy of the same gene that is not involved in a fusion . This could explain the CN difference within the segments of the BCR-ABL1 and ABL1-BCR fusions. In the EM-2 cell line, the CN of the BCR part in both fusions is higher than CN of the ABL1 part in both fusions. This can also be observed within the BCR-ABL1 and ABL1-BCR fusion in K-562. However, in this case, an RMS of 0.7 is observed in both fusions. The difference in the border region indicates least one BCR and one ABL1 gene expressing normal transcripts. As expected, TMPRSS2-ERG fusions could not be detected in negative prostate cancer cell lines PC3, LNCaP, DU145 and 22Rv1, but rather unexpectedly also not in VCaP. This cell line is known to harbor at least one normal TMPRSS2 and ERG gene, making it difficult to study the fusion in vitro . In a clinical dataset of 82 primary prostate samples, we could successfully identify all previously described fusionpositive samples. One of these samples contains the typical deletion, but also unusually long parts of both fusion partners, rendering it an outlier. We have shown that GFD is able to detect functional fusion genes, deriving from unbalanced mutation events in cancer. In addition, we have shown that GFD has a similar accuracy as an approach to detect fusion genes based on RNA-seq. A future application of GFD could be combined run with an RNA-seq-based algorithm. In this case, one can distinguish between functional and non-functional fusions. Also, transcriptional and translational position information of the fusion could be gained. Thus, it would become possible to predictPrediction of the ABL1-BCR fusion subgroups. It should be noted that start and end positions are based on ENSEMBL version 65 and may change slightly in other genome references without an effect on the prediction..

SH32 yields the characteristic deletion required to form the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, whereas SH36 has only a partial deletion
