Systems biology SILVER: an efficient tool for stable isotope labeling LC-MS data quantitative analysis with quality control methods With the advance of experimental technologies, different stable isotope labeling methods have been widely applied to quantitative proteomics. Here, we present an efficient tool named SILVER for processing the stable isotope labeling mass spectrometry data. SILVER implements novel methods for quality control of quantification at spectrum, peptide and protein levels, respectively. Several new quantification confidence filters and indices are used to improve the accuracy of quantification results. The performance of SILVER was verified and compared with MaxQuant and Proteome Discoverer using a large-scale dataset and two standard datasets. The results suggest that SILVER shows high accuracy and robustness while consuming much less processing time. Additionally, SILVER provides user-friendly interfaces for parameter setting, result visualization, manual validation and some useful statistics analyses.

The great advantages in resolution, sensitivity and accuracy make MS the dominating technology in proteomics . As the technology improves, MS-based quantitative proteomics has become an important research field in proteomics. Among the strategies developed for quantitative proteomics, stable isotope labeling strategies have been widely used thanks to their high accuracy and precision. Recently, several software tools have been developed for stable isotope labeling quantification, such as MSQuant and Census , the well-known software package MaxQuant embedded with its own search engine, named Andromeda , as well as a newly published quantification pipeline IsoQuant , which was designed especially for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) . However, there has been little attention to quantitative quality control among these tools and there is hardly any proper algorithm focused on this issue . On the other hand, the rapidly growing amount of large-scale quantitative proteomics data requires faster and more efficient tools. Here, we present a new efficient tool, named SILVER for stable isotope labeling data analysis with special considerations for quality control of quantification. SILVER introduces novel quantification confidence filters and indices, which finally result in accurate and robust quantification for stable isotope labeling experiments. Meanwhile, SILVER is fast and flexible by supporting different types of MS data such as the original raw files and the mzXML format files. SILVER takes the quality control results of PeptideProphet or PepDistiller as the input and provides user-friendly interfaces for parameter setting, result visualization, manual validation and some useful statistical analyses.SILVER was developed for fast and accurate quantification of stable isotope labeling data. The quantitative accuracy of SILVER was evaluated and compared with MaxQuant (v1.3.0.5) and Proteome Discoverer (v1.3, Thermo Scientific) using a large-scale dataset named MaxQuant dataset as well as two standard datasets ( 15 N and 18 O labeling) with different labeling ratios. For MaxQuant dataset, only commonly quantified proteins by the three tools were evaluated for an objective comparison. As shown in Supplementary, the median ratio of SILVERs result is the closest to the theoretical value compared with the other two software packages. For 18 O labeling dataset, SILVER performs as well as MaxQuant for the 1:1 labeling data, and its results are closer to the theoretical ratio for the 1:2 labeling data (Supplementary). Whats more, SILVER can also handle 15 N labeling data that is another advantage over MaxQuant and Proteome Discoverer. There are three different ratios (H/L 1:2, 1:5, 1:10) in the 15 N labeling dataset. The protein ratio medians are all close to the theoretical values, suggesting the high accuracy and sensitivity of SILVER (Supplementary). These results demonstrate that SILVER is able to handle large-scale complex stable isotope labeling data and displays a high quantitative accuracy and sensitivity despite data complexity (Supplementary Methods). In addition, the quantification processing time of the three software tools is compared on MaxQuant dataset. As shown in Supplementary Table S1, the time consumed by SILVER is nearly one third of that consumed by MaxQuant and even nearly one tenth of that of Proteome Discoverer under the same computing conditions. More details are provided in Supplementary Methods.
