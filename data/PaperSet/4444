Structural bioinformatics Structural analysis of the hot spots in the binding between H1N1 HA and the 2D1 antibody: do mutations of H1N1 from 1918 to 2009 affect much on this binding? Motivation: Worldwide and substantial mortality caused by the 2009 H1N1 influenza A has stimulated a new surge of research on H1N1 viruses. An epitope conservation has been learned in the HA1 protein that allows antibodies to cross-neutralize both 1918 and 2009 H1N1. However, few works have thoroughly studied the binding hot spots in those two antigenantibody interfaces which are responsible for the antibody cross-neutralization. Results: We apply predictive methods to identify binding hot spots at the epitope sites of the HA1 proteins and at the paratope sites of the 2D1 antibody. We find that the six mutations at the HA1s epitope from 1918 to 2009 should not harm its binding to 2D1. Instead, the change of binding free energy on the whole exhibits an increased tendency after these mutations, making the binding stronger. This is consistent with the observation that the 1918 H1N1 neutralizing antibody can cross-react with 2009 H1N1. We identified three distinguished hot spot residues, including Lys 166 , common between the two epitopes. These common hot spots again can explain why 2D1 cross-reacted. We believe that these hot spot residues are mutation candidates which may help H1N1 viruses to evade the immune system. We also identified eight residues at the paratope site of 2D1, five from its heavy chain and three from its light chain, that are predicted to be energetically important in the HA1 recognition. The identification of these hot spot residues and their structural analysis are potentially useful to fight against H1N1 viruses.The H1N1 influenza A caused two notable pandemics with substantial mortality in 1918 and 2009. Fortunately, it has been To whom correspondence should be addressed.found that some antibodies can work against the Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins in these two pandemics . HA is a homotrimeric glycoprotein. HA monomers are synthesized as precursors that are then cleaved into two proteins, HA1 and HA2, which form the major surface proteins of influenza A viruses. The infection is started by the binding of HA proteins to the sialic acid-containing receptors of target cells and by fusing the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane of the target cells. The viral genome enters and infects the target cells after the binding. So, inhibiting this binding by antibodies is an important way against flu. Previous works have learned that there is an epitope (binding site) conservation that exists between the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 HA proteins . Such epitope conservation enables the older population to avoid infection from 2009 H1N1 because their pre-existing immunity against 1918 H1N1 can neutralize the 2009 H1N1 HA proteins. Thus, studies on these antibodyHA binding interfaces are crucial to understand how the antibodies recognize the antigens. However, there are few studies on the energetic importance of the binding residues in the HA1 protein in complex with the 2D1 antibody. We apply predictive and comparative methods to examine the interfaces between the 2D1 antibody and the HA1 proteins of 1918 and 2009 H1N1, and to investigate an assumed 2D1 binding to the seasonal influenza virus A/Brisbane/59/2007 to understand why 2D1 did not bind to the 2007 strain . This 2D1 antibody is a monoclonal antibody from a survivor of the 1918 Spanish influenza , which is believed to bind to HA1s in both of 1918 and 2009 H1N1. Of particular interests, we identify binding hot spot residues from the above mentioned two antibodyantigen interfaces. A binding hot spot is a small fraction of interfacial residues that contribute most to binding free energy . Their mutationse.g. alanine mutationscan reduce binding affinity remarkably . We address the problems whether the interfacial mutations from 1918 H1N1s HA1 to 2009s are hot spot residues and whether these mutations make the binding stronger with 2D1. We explain how the computational methods find those antigenic residues that are energetically important in the antibody binding, such as Asn 129 , Lys 157 and Lys 166. These three hot spot residues are actually common between the 1918 and 2009 epitopes of HA1. Their mutations may make the 2D1-antibody binding ineffective.The sequence alignment among 1918HA1, 2007HA1 and 2009HA1 is shown in. There are a total of six interfacial mutations between 1918HA1 and 2009HA1, namely E131D, T133N, S159N, V169I, N171D and T242K. The structural alignment of 1918HA1 and 2009HA1 between their interfacial segments is shown inwhere the structural matchbased on the Cs of these interfacial residueshas an RMSD of 0.725 . Previous works have reported that protein sequences with 50 identity or above in crystallographic models can differ by 1 RMSD, while proteins in NMR models can have even larger deviations . In some cases, sequences with 95 identity can also have an interface RMSD up to 1.2 . Thus, the small 0.725 RMSD suggests that the interfacial segments of the two HA1 proteins have a very good match. This indicates that the mutations from 1918HA1 to 2009HA1 resulted in little structural change at the binding site, and that thePage: 2531 25292536computationally produced binding structure of 2009HA1 and the 2D1 antibody may not have any big deviation from the real one.We have done a structural analysis on the interfaces between the 2D1 antibody and the HA1 proteins of 2009 H1N1 and 1918 H1N1. The cross-neutralization of this antibody is clearly demonstrated by the hot spot residues common in the two binding interfaces. Our comprehensive investigation suggests that there are six outstanding epitope residues whose mutations will help H1N1 evade capture by this antibody. We further pinpointed the hot spot residues at the paratope site of the 2D1 antibody which are responsible for the antigen recognition. The understanding of these hot spot residues can potentially facilitate drug design to neutralize influenza viruses.
