Genome analysis bammds: a tool for assessing the ancestry of low-depth whole-genome data using multidimensional scaling (MDS) We present bammds, a practical tool that allows visualiza-tion of samples sequenced by second-generation sequencing when compared with a reference panel of individuals (usually genotypes) using a multidimensional scaling algorithm. Our tool is aimed at determining the ancestry of unknown samplestypical of ancient DNA dataparticularly when only low amounts of data are available for those samples. Availability and implementation: The software package is available under GNU General Public License v3 and is freely available together with test datasets https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bammds/. It is using R (http://www.r-project.org/), parallel (http://www.gnu.org/-software/parallel/), samtools (https://Population structure plays an important role in determining the evolutionary history of a group. A great deal has been learned from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology providing unmatched information of the population structure of several species [for humans, see (. The advent of new sequencing platforms, which can deliver millions to billions of sequencing reads within days, has shifted the focus from SNP array data to whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data. While the cost has steadily decreased , obtaining many high-depth genomes remains prohibitive for many laboratories, in particular when working with ancient DNA (aDNA) samples where it is often desirable to screen many samples of potential interest while keeping the cost at a minimum. Methods based on non-parametric multidimensional statistics (more specifically principal components analysis, PCA) were first applied to genetic data more than 30 years ago . PCA has since become a standard tool in population genetics owing in particular to (i) the low computational demand of such analyses, (ii) the appealing graphical result and (iii) its ease of use. Here, we describe a tool that allows to assign an ancestry to low-depth mapped WGS data when compared with an existing reference panel of genotype data using multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on genetic distances, a related method that provides results similar to those of PCA .The graphical result with all 10 modern individuals at a depth of 0.1 can be seen on. We find in the simulations that for all but two cases, we recover the geographic region as the first hit for as few as 30 000 reads ($0.001,). In the remaining two cases, the Sardinian and the Karitiana individual, a depth of 0.1 and 0.01, respectively, is enough. The true nearest population was also identified in most cases within the three closest centroids for a depth above 0.01 (7/10 cases). For the second criteria, we find that in 9/10 of the cases, the WGS sample was within the population ellipse at 0.5 and above. Only in one case (San individual) was a depth of 1 necessary to be placed within the population ellipse. For the ancient data, we get similar results for the Aborigine, which is assigned to the correct geographic region (Oceania) as a first hit with a depth of $0.001 and above. At a depth higher than 0.01, we also recover the expected population as the closest population. For the Anzick-1 individual, presumably because of increased damage, a depth of 1 is needed to recover the geographic region as the first hit. On the other hand, a Native American population is among the three closest populations from a depth of 0.1 and above. The results for Gus are given in Supplementary data.The tool we present in this article is based on classical MDS, a technique that originated in the 1930s and is commonly used in other fields [see, e.g. and citations therein]. We present a tool that was designed to be practical to assess the ancestry of mapped WGS data for samples sequenced at low depth, assuming that a relevant reference panel in terms of ancestry is provided. We show through simulations that useful ancestry information can be recovered for as few as 30 000 readscorresponding to a fraction ($1/60 in early 2014) of a HiSeq 2000 lane (www.illumina.com) for a sample with 1 endogenous content (or $1/4800 of a lane for a typical modern sample).
