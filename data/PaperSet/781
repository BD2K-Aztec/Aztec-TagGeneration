BioSynther: a customized biosynthetic potential explorer Motivation: One of the most promising applications of biosynthetic methods is to produce chemical products of high value from the ready-made chemicals. To explore the biosynthetic potentials of a chemical as a synthesis precursor, biosynthetic databases and related chemoinformatics tools are urgently needed. In the present work, a web-based tool, BioSynther, is developed to explore the biosynthetic potentials of precursor chemicals using BKM-react, Rhea, and more than 50 000 in-house RxnFinder reactions manually curated. BioSynther allows researchers to explore biosyn-thetic potentials, through so far known biochemical reactions, step by step interactively, which could be used as a useful tool in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.Biosynthesis has important applications in producing bulk chemicals , biofuels or natural products . There are some biosynthesis informatics tools , such as BNICE , RetroPath , DESHARKY and FMM , to design biosynthesis pathways from a start molecule to a target molecule. In industrial biotechnology applications, researchers usually plan to get value-added chemicals from the ready-made molecules. That is, how to automatically explore the biosynthetic potentials of simple chemical precursors? In the present work, BioSynther is developed to assist researchers to get comprehensive biosynthesis target molecules based on the BKM-React reactions , Rhea reactions and in-house RxnFinder reactions (www.rxnfinder.org).In BioSynther, there are three different kinds of display view options to explore biosynthetic potentials interactively. For example, after users input a starting molecule, vanillin, three different view options (that is, tree, circle or plain page) are available.displays the biosynthetic potentials of vanillin, in which each node or edge is clickable. When the computer mouse moves on a node, the related chemical structure is shown on the computer screen. Each edge represents a biosynthetic reaction converting the starting molecule to a target molecule.When an edge is clicked, the biosynthetic reactions of this edge are displayed with its original references. In another view option such as Tree view, after users input vanillin as a biosynthesis precursor, eight possible chemicals in one reaction step is retrieved. Each tree node is clickable to explore its biosynthetic potentials according to researchers interest interactively. In order to explore the biosynthetic potentials of precursor chemicals, a novel web-based tool, BioSynther, is developed using BKM-react, Rhea, and in-house RxnFinder reactions. BioSynther applies an interactive interface for researchers to explore biosynthetic potentials step by step. BioSynther could be used as a useful tool in metabolic engineering.
