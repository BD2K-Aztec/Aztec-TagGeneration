Phylogenetics spacodiR: structuring of phylogenetic diversity in ecological communities Motivation: SPACODIR is a cross-platform package, written for the R environment, for studying partitioning of diversity among natural communities in space and time. Complementing and extending existing software, SPACODIR allows for hypothesis testing and parameter estimation in studying spatial structuring of species-, phylogenetic-and trait diversities. Availability: Integrated with other software in the R environment and with well documented and demonstrated functions, SPACODIR is an open-source package and available at http://cran.rUntil recently, the formalized importance of historical processes in the development of communities had been largely neglected (see). With ongoing development in the field of community phylogenetics, time-dependent processes can now be directly integrated into the study of community diversity and assembly. Yet, available software for such analyses is often idiosyncratic, requiring unique data formats or a particular platform (but see). Our aim here is to provide a cross-platform package (spacodiR) that can inform the processes contributing to sorting of phylogenetic-, species-and trait diversities among communities. To this end, we use the highly flexible and actively developed R environment (R Development Core), providing spacodiR as an adaptation and extension of the C-coded software SPACoDi (Spatial and Phylogenetic Analysis of Community Diversity) developed by Hardy (2010). Here, we describe the central functionality of the spacodiR package. spacodiR is poised to study scale dependencies of diversity partitioning in space and time. Fast computation for the most demanding tasks is facilitated by compiled C-coded functions.
