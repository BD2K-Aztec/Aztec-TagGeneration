Sequence analysis Advance Access Publication AMPA: an automated web server for prediction of protein antimicrobial regions AMPA is a web application for assessing the antimicrobial domains of proteins, with a focus on the design on new antimicrobial drugs. The application provides fast discovery of antimicrobial patterns in proteins that can be used to develop new peptide-based drugs against pathogens. Results are shown in a user-friendly graphical interface and can be downloaded as raw data for later examination. Availability: AMPA is freely available on the web atThe widespread use of antibiotics has promoted the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains that often pose serious health problems. Many efforts have been directed toward finding alternative antibiotics unaffected by resistance mechanisms. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are regarded as one of the most promising alternatives in this regard . AMPs usually act through membrane permeation, receptorindependent mechanisms that greatly reduce the risk of inducing resistance in microorganisms . Moreover, many AMPs are active against a wide diversity of pathogens, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and parasites. All these features make AMPs attractive candidates for fighting microbial infection. A growing interest, therefore, exists for identifying natural AMP leads that can be developed into novel antibiotics. An increasing number of proteins and peptides with antimicrobial effects have been identified in many organisms, many of such proteins belonging to the innate defense system but others are unrelated to immune response. The design of new AMPs based on these proteins is hampered by the fact that the mechanisms of their
