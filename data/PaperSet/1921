Systems biology GALANT: a Cytoscape plugin for visualizing data as functional landscapes projected onto biological networks The network modeling of biological systems has been demonstrated to be a formidable tool to decipher the collective behavior of various biological processes. However, the construction of a biological network per se is not sufficient to accomplish this task. To better understand the biological systems and their responses, it is necessary to extend and complement these networks with data collected from different sources, such as gene or protein expression profiles . Moreover, owing to the human natural strengths in rapid visual pattern recognition, the visualization of these data through maps overlaid on interaction networks would be an efficient way to extract information that could be missed by a purely statistical or numerical approach. Virtually, all existing tools capable to map data to biological networks perform this task by coloring the nodes according to data values (for a review, see). Although these tools have proven to be useful, these colored networks specially the large and dense networksare often noisy, and, therefore, the visual identification of patterns in the data mapped to these networks are difficult. To facilitate this task, these large colored networks could be transformed in smoothed data maps. To the best of our knowledge, only the ViaComplex , an open source software implemented in Fortran, is currently able to generate smoothed data maps by projecting data as functional landscapes onto biological networks. To expand the collection of tools providing this functionality, we developed in this work a Cytoscape plugin version of ViaComplex: the GrAph LANdscape VisualizaTion (GALANT). Although GALANT provides the same essential functionality found in the original ViaComplex, its main advantage over ViaComplex is the well-known versatile network visualization and data integration environment provided by Cytoscape .
