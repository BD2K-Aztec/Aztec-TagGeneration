PhenoScanner: a database of human genotypeâ€“phenotype associations PhenoScanner is a curated database of publicly available results from large-scale genetic association studies. This tool aims to facilitate phenome scans, the cross-referencing of genetic variants with many phenotypes, to help aid understanding of disease pathways and biology. The database currently contains over 350 million association results and over 10 million unique genetic variants, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms. It is accompanied by a web-based tool that queries the database for associations with user-specified variants, providing results according to the same effect and non-effect alleles for each input variant. The tool provides the option of searching for trait associations with proxies of the input variants, calculated using the European samples from 1000 Genomes and Hapmap. Availability and Implementation: PhenoScanner is available at www.phenoscanner.To illustrate the use of PhenoScanner, we ran the program with rs10840293 (an intronic variant in SWAP70) using proxies from 1000 Genomes and a r 2 cut-off of 0.8. The program found and aligned over 1000 associations with either rs10840293 or a proxy of rs10840293 (r 2 0:8) in 10s (and Supplementary Data). Hence, even though associations between rs10840293 and phenotypes are mostly unavailable, we were able to obtain a range of related associations using proxies (e.g. rs93138 in).In summary, PhenoScanner is a large curated database of publicly available summary results from genetic association studies. This database extends current catalogues of genetic data by including all available results as opposed to filtering on strength of association. Moreover, PhenoScanner aligns genotypephenotype associations across traits and proxies, providing the user with an easily interpretable formatted output file. We anticipate that this tool will make cross-referencing genetic variants with many phenotypes faster and more efficient.
