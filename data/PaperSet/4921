Data and text mining WHIDEâ€”a web tool for visual data mining colocation patterns in multivariate bioimages Motivation: Bioimaging techniques rapidly develop toward higher resolution and dimension. The increase in dimension is achieved by different techniques such as multitag fluorescence imaging, Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization (MALDI) imaging or Raman imaging, which record for each pixel an N-dimensional intensity array, representing local abundances of molecules, residues or interaction patterns. The analysis of such multivariate bioimages (MBIs) calls for new approaches to support users in the analysis of both feature domains: space (i.e. sample morphology) and molecular colocation or interaction. In this article, we present our approach WHIDE (Web-based Hyperbolic Image Data Explorer) that combines principles from computational learning, dimension reduction and visualization in a free web application. Results: We applied WHIDE to a set of MBI recorded using the multitag fluorescence imaging Toponome Imaging System. The MBI show field of view in tissue sections from a colon cancer study and we compare tissue from normal/healthy colon with tissue classified as tumor. Our results show, that WHIDE efficiently reduces the complexity of the data by mapping each of the pixels to a cluster, referred to as Molecular Co-Expression Phenotypes and provides a structural basis for a sophisticated multimodal visualization, which combines topology preserving pseudocoloring with information visualization. The wide range of WHIDEs applicability is demonstrated with examples from toponome imaging, high content screens and MALDI imaging (shown in the Supplementary Material). Availability and implementation: The WHIDE tool can be accessed via the BioIMAX websiteBioimage informatics has been established as a new branch in the tree of bioinformatics fields of research in the last 10 years. The term bioimage comprises all kinds of images generated for To whom correspondence should be addressed. biological samples in a biological or biomedical research context using a large diversity of imaging techniques. The techniques range from standard ones such as bright field imaging or phase contrast to advanced technologies that enable recording many molecular variables for each resolvable volume unit. The latter group of technologies can also be referred to as multivariate bioimages . MBI belong to the so called high-content imaging techniques which apply high resolution imaging in time and/or space and/or variables to close those open gaps in systems biology which cannot be bridged by standard, i.e. non-spatial omics techniques . While these can in principle resolve the almost complete molecular composition in a sample on different levels (genomics, transciptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) they have to leave out the spatial domain. In contrast to that, bioimaging approaches, which usually work with a lower level of molecular resolution, can relate molecular information to spatial features such as morphology. Typical examples for MBI are Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization (MALDI) imaging , vibrational spectroscopy/Raman microscopy (van) or MultiEpitope-Ligand Cartography (MELC)/Toponome Imaging System (TIS) . The first two techniques measure molecular features and interactions in localized spectra, arranged in a pixel grid. The interpretation of the obtained images aims at the identification of pixel groups that share particular or similar spectral features (e.g.) where as the final identification of molecules and a semantic interpretation remains an unsolved problems for most applications. In contrast to that, MELC/TIS (for the sake of compactness we will refer to this technique with TIS) imaging aims at the imaging of a selected set of N proteins using a library of N fluorescent labeled antibodies, lectins or other specific ligands (referred to as tags, in general) in combination with a cyclic protocol of staining, fluorescence imaging and soft bleaching. To unfold the full potential of all these kinds of MBI, new algorithms and software are needed that allow researchers to visually explore the data and to identify the hidden regularities. In this article, we will focus on images recorded using the TIS technology, however our method is definitely applicable to other MBI data recorded with a different multitag technology or MALDI images as well. For one selected field of view (FOV) in the sample, TIS records one multivariate image T (s) which consists of a set of N aligned images g,...,N (with x,y as pixel coordinates) with s (s = 1,...,S) describing the ID of the TIS image/FOV and g The Author(s) 2012.

A H 2 SOM was the results have been visually analyzed regarding different aspects. First, the topology preservation is qualitatively analyzed by moving the mouse cursor along the border of color disc. One can observe the continuous changes in the MCEP patterns while the color changes. Some example CIPRAs are shown as bookmarks in. One can see, that with changing color (from blue to green to yellow to red) some markers go up (such as DAPI) and some are going down and up again (such as EpCAM or CD133) or vice versa (such as KI-67). The color mapping did not show any strong distortions, such as CIPRAs with similar colors but different colocation pattern. The second interesting aspect was how the WHIDE tool reacts to strong noise in the data. In image T (n2) , a strong noise signal can be observed for the CD29 marker showing a large star-shaped group of fully saturated pixels. Such noise can be observed from time to time in TIS imaging and from a data mining point of view these signals form false outlier data clouds in the high-dimensional colocation signal space. The right image of T (n2) inshows this case and some magenta/blue spike of the noise pattern can be observed in the right half of the image. However, the pattern does not have an influence on the global color mapping, since both cases, T (n1) and T (n2) , show equivalent color mappings of their morphology and their MCEP patterns. Third, we investigated WHIDEs potential to reveal differences in MCEP statistics and spatial distribution for cancer and normal tissue. To this end, we apply the special WHIDE feature of a continuous interactive tuning of the color mapping. The color mapping is changed in two ways: the color disc can be rotated as shown in, where we rotate the color disc, so some regions are drawn in yellow, which are visible in T (c1) and T (c2) as a small number of cellular/sub-cellular objects, marked with white ellipsoids. The motivation to move these regions to yellow is that human observers can perceive more color details in the green yellowred interval of the color spectrum than in the bluish region. So the observer might discriminate more colors, i.e. different MCEPs for these regions now. In addition, the Mbius transform is applied to move the nodes from the yellow region toward the center, thereby, squeezing the opposing nodes all into the blue region of the color scale disc (see, a lower row on the right). Please note, that the colors of the bookmarked CIPRAs are adapted accordingly. This transformation has two important consequences: the majority of MCEPs are drawn blue with a low color contrast (so the human observer does not perceive many structural features) and the color contrast for a comparably small subregion of the 11-dimensional colocation feature space, spanned by the rest of the MCEPs is strongly enhanced. The selected individual MCEPs of the selected regions can now be distinguished more easily and analyzed in detail. This way, we enable a kind of a zoom in an N-dimensional space which is interactive and continuously, so the user does not loose the context.In the upper row, the four TIS images T (c1) ,T (c2) ,T (n1) and T (n2) from left to right. The bottom row shows a small set of selected bookmarked CIPRAs. On the right, the color disc is shown with its control buttons below. To change the coloring, the user can combine two functions. First, using the rotate-button, the user can turn the color disc so that of the H 2 SOM grid which is of less interest is mapped to the blue area (since human observers are more sensitive to non-blue colors). Second, the user can use the arrow buttons to change the Mbius projection, i.e. to move H 2 SOM nodes toward the center and squeeze the opposing nodes into a small cloud. In this example, the nodes from the upper right are moved to enhance the color contrast for a chosen region of interest in one image (marked with white ellipsoids). For comparison we show results obtained with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA was performed on the same dataset and the feature vectors were projected onto the eigenvectors of the three largest eigenvalues to map each pixel to three new coordinates (v 1 ,v 2 ,v 3 ) which were used for a RGB pseudocolor mapping for each image (see Supplementary Material C). While we again made the observation of a difference in colocation feature statistics between normal tissue and cancer tissue, the PCA approach does not feature the structural advances of the H 2 SOM which allow resolving non-linear features and dynamic interactive manipulation of the colors.The WHIDE tool shows significant advantages compared with other approaches to MBI analysis. First, it is able to resolve and embed non-linear data structures. This can be seen by browsing the CIPRAs on the H 2 SOM visualization on the color disc. Moving the cursor slowly across the discs shows the CIPRAs of neighboring clusters. The CIPRAs show, that similarity in cluster prototypes is reflected by vicinity in the H 2 SOM grid, i.e. the N-dimensional data topology is preserved regarding local neighborhoods. A second striking feature is the H 2 SOM visualization using the Mbius transform which allows change of zoom in the N-dimensional feature space by mapping a smaller number of neighboring clusters to a larger area in the color scale. This way, particular groups of MCEPs can be pseudocolored in higher color resolution whereas the rest of the TIS image is colored with a very small part of the color scale, i.e. with low contrast. Another positive feature of the WHIDE approach is the reduction of the TIS data using vector quantization as performed by the H 2 SOM algorithm which has shown to resolve even small clusters and organize the clusters in a hierarchical structure. If the CIPRA visualization is compared with two classic methods such as bar graphs and star glyphs, it is evident that in the CIPRADue to advances in machine learning research, present-day internet connection bandwidths and state-of-the-art web graphics technology a new level of MBI analysis is enabled. Web-technology allows a direct connection of researchers to the tools and the result visualizations, independent from their whereabouts and their computer system. Modern RIA technologies allow web-based visualizations to be interactive and dynamic, which are prerequisites for the analysis of MBI data such as TIS. Although, we presented the WHIDE tool in the context of TIS analysis it is evident that the tool is applicable to other MBI data such as MALDI images as well.
