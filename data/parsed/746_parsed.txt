sequence_analysis biogem an effective tool based_approach for scaling up open_source software_development in bioinformatics biogem provides a software_development environment for the ruby programming_language which encourages community_based software_development for bioinformatics while lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging best practices biogem with its targeted modular and decentralized approach software generator tools and tight web integration is an improved general model for scaling up collaborative open_source software_development in bioinformatics availability biogem and modules are free and are oss biogem runs on all systems that support recent versions of ruby including linux mac os x and windows further information atin biomedical_science new technologies data_formats and methods emerge continuously scientists want to take advantage of these developments as soon as possible which requires bioinformatics to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first and last two authors should be regarded_as software to keep up with new requirements we support the notion of the open bioinformatics foundation obf that development of collaborative open_source oss is essential for bioinformatics the obf represents a number of important projects such as bioperl biopython bioruby and biojava these bio star bio projects effectively function as community centres and share a centralized approach in software_development with large source_code repositories bio projects generally aim for consolidated tools a stable application_programming api and backwards compatibility within the bioruby project we experienced the drive for stability easily overwhelmed and discouraged developers not only because of the complexity of the existing code base but also because coding standards are enforced and extensive tests and documentation are required furthermore newly contributed code may be subject to community scrutiny and in many cases further demands for improving the code follow the full process introduces a significant delay between initial idea and final acceptance of the code in the main project months even years may pass between stable releases of main bio projects it may take a long time before a new feature is publicly released to scale up collaborative software_development in bioruby we recognized existing and new developers need to be encouraged to contribute more code to achieve this we created biogem a ruby application framework for rapid creation of decentralized internet published software modules written to lower the barrier to entry biogem was initially inspired by the r bioconductor the developer writes or modifies source_code and quickly and easily publishes the source_code and module online for others to read install and use collaboration is facilitated by publishing source_code and changes to navigationable websites then the workflow continues again at the http biogems info website tracks published modules popularity of each published module is tracked as well as source_code changes updates bugs and issues unlike with the practise of publishing scientific_papers collaboration on software often comes post factum i e after original publishing of a software module therefore it pays to publish software modules early and often this is reflected in the biogem workflow packaging system which encourages software_developers to publish software modules independently using simple rules and ruby on rails plugins which provides a software generator and modular software plugin system biogem provides an environment for rapid bioinformatics software_development with a low barrier to entry biogem frees potential contributors from code maturity expectations that can be deterring and encourages ruby developers to contribute experimental source_code early to the bioruby community through biogem software is published in a modular way and best practises are encouraged through infrastructure for software specification and testing all this results in better utilization of existing and new software_development manpower thereby scaling up oss development in bioinformatics we suggest biogem can serve as a generic model not by replacing existing bio projects but by supplementing them with a decentralized and evolutionary model for collaborative software_development
