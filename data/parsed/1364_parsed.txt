detection of micrornas in color_space motivation deep_sequencing provides inexpensive opportunities to characterize the transcriptional diversity of known genomes the ab solid technology generates millions of short_sequencing in color_space that is the raw_data is a sequence of colors where each color represents nt and each nucleotide is represented by two consecutive colors this strategy is purported to have several advantages including increased ability to distinguish sequencing_errors from polymorphisms several programs have been developed to map short_reads to genomes in color_space however a number of previously unexplored technical issues arise when using solid technology to characterize micrornas results here we explore these technical_difficulties first since the sequenced_reads are longer than the biological_sequences every read is expected to contain linker fragments the color calling error_rate increases toward the end of the read such that recognizing the linker sequence for removal becomes problematic second mapping in color_space may lead to the loss of the first nucleotide of each read we propose a sequential trimming and mapping_approach to map small_rnas using our strategy we reanalyze three published insect small_rna deep sequencing_datasets and characterize new micrornas availability_and a bash shell script to perform the sequential trimming and mapping_procedure called seqtrimmap is available at http www mirbase org tools seqtrimmap so_called next_generation or deep_sequencing permit the fast and comprehensive analysis of genomes and transcriptomes the short_length of the sequence_reads produced is compensated by the capacity to produce millions of reads in a single run thus new strategies to align and assemble highly redundant short_sequence have been developed over the last few years micrornas are endogenous rna_molecules nt in length that repress gene translation in the past_years the overwhelming_majority of novel micrornas have been identified by deep_sequencing reads from deep sequencing_experiments may contain sequences of the short dna adapters termed linkers here used in the sequencing reaction characterization of small_rnas to whom correspondence should be addressed from deep sequencing_datasets requires the removal of these linker sequences from the ends of reads illumina solexa sequencing has been extensively used to detect micrornas and the available data suggest that the linker sequences are easily detected and removed for instance detected linker fragments in of the sequenced_reads by string matching the use of ab solid sequencing to characterize micrornas is on the rise unlike other technologies solid machines produce sequences in color_space each color representing a dinucleotide the rationale behind color_space is that since colors are produced for overlapping dinucleotides each nucleotide is read twice this is purported to reduce sequencing_errors and to permit better distinction between sequencing_errors and polymorphisms the characterization of micrornas in color_space produces two specific issues that have so_far been overlooked one associated with each end of the read first the read_length is longer than the biological sequence such that the end of every read derived from a microrna contains linker sequence that must be removed however detecting and removing adapter sequences in color_space is not as straightforward as in base space as we explore in this work second the first color of each read represents the last base of the adapter and the first of the target_sequence the treatment of this color is controversial since different programs keep or remove it removal of the first color causes the first base to be lost whereas retaining the first color may reduce the proportion of reads that map to the genome the loss of the nt has critical consequences in the characterization of micrornas in this article we address the issues of using color_space sequences to characterize micrornas and other small_rnas and provide a simple strategy to easily map color_space reads from small_rna to whole genomes
