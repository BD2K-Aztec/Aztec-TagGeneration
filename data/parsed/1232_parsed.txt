cytogedevo global_alignment of biological_networks with cytoscape motivation in the systems_biology era high_throughput omics_technologies have enabled the unraveling of the interplay of some biological_entities on a large_scale e g genes proteins metab olites or rnas huge biological_networks have emerged where nodes correspond to these entities and edges between them model their relations proteinprotein_interaction for instance show the physical_interactions of proteins in an organism the comparison of such networks promises additional insights into protein and cell function as well as knowledge_transfer across species several computational_approaches have been developed previously to solve the network_alignment na problem but only a few concentrate on the usability of the implemented tools for the evaluation of proteinprotein_interactions by the end_users biologists and medical researchers results we have created cytogedevo a cytoscape app for visual and user assisted na it extends the previous gedevo methodology for global pairwise nas with new graphical and functional features our main focus was on the usability even by non programmers and the inter pretability of the na results with cytoscape availability_and cytogedevo is publicly_available from the cytoscape app store at http apps cytoscape org apps cytogedevo in addition we provide stand alone command_line executables source_code documentation and step_by user instructions at http cytogedevo an increasing amount of data generated by omics_technologies has become available in recent_years similar to the ubiquitous availability of sequence_data since the mid s individual proteinprotein_interactions ppis have been organized as networks and collected in online_resources understanding networks is crucial to complement our knowledge about protein_function and evolution which was initially gained through the dna sequencing_projects of the last decades we believe that understanding differences and commonalities of the topology of networks from different organisms holds_great to gain deeper insight into how a cell works as a whole network_alignment na is a method to find a mapping between nodes in two or more networks according to some quality criterion this allows transferring knowledge between the aligned nodes na is generally categorized into global and local methods global na results in a one to one mapping between nodes and local na results in either many to many or oneto many mappings depending on the method further distinction ismade between pairwise and multiple na which denotes the number of networks that a method can align at the same time an exhaustive survey on the field is given in most tools are command_line utilities with varying_degrees of stability some are prone to crash even under normal operation and almost none offer a user_interface usable for subsequent network_analysis graphcrunch has the dated graal method built in but lacks visualization some web_servers exist which offer na with limited visualization such as natalieq or netaligner gasoline is a cytoscape app for multiple local na with a user_interface and visualization capabilities with the exception of these none of the existing_tools are particularly user_friendly or perform any other function besides aligning a set of networks given as input_files and return the alignment result in an output_file in addition loading a previous intermediate result or an initially given mapping for further refinement is not often supported by existing software notable exceptions are magna saraph and milenkovi c and piswap respectively which can be used to refine existing alignments most tools rely on complex models i e optimization functions that make it difficult for the user to understand why the algorithm aligns certain nodes this also hinders an intuitive understanding of the output some methods notably mi_graal and magna offer optimizing for multiple scores e g scores derived from network_topology and from protein sequence_alignments which are often contradictory most methods integrate two or more scores using a weighted_sum of the form p a i score i with p a i ghost attempts to solve the disparity by calculating a suitable weight automatically more recently this tradeoff has been thoroughly evaluated for optnetalign and is still an unsolved_problem therefore we have developed cytogedevo as a cytoscape app to make the alignment process more transparent controllable and flexible cytoscape is a popular tool for network_analysis visualization and exploration which can be extended by third_party apps our extension is a user_friendly software for pairwise global na offering a user front end that graphically aids with data analysis and follow_up studies see the advanced tutorial cytogedevo web_site for a case study a summary of and citations for related na tools are provided in supplementary_file s
