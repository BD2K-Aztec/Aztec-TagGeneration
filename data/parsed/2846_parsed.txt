structural_bioinformatics medeller homology_based coordinate generation for membrane_proteins motivation membrane_proteins mps are important_drug but knowledge of their exact structure is limited to relatively few examples existing homology_based structure_prediction are designed for globular water soluble_proteins however we are now beginning to have enough mp structures to justify the development of a homology based_approach specifically for them results we present a mp specific homology_based coordinate generation method medeller which is optimized to build highly_reliable core models the method outperforms the popular structure_prediction programme modeller on mps the comparison of the two methods was performed on targettemplate pairs of mps which were classified into four test_sets by their sequence_identity across all targets medeller gave an average backbone root_mean rmsd of versus for modeller on our easy test_set medeller achieves an average_accuracy of backbone rmsd versus for modeller membrane_proteins mp constitute about of all known proteins and are one of the largest classes of drug_targets they have roles in a multitude of biological_processes such as cell recognition and neurotransmitter transport currently the universal protein resource uniprot contains more than million protein_sequences in comparison the protein_data pdb contains only about thousand known protein_structures both numbers have been following an exponential_growth trend for mps the sequence structure gap is even larger over million uniprot entries contain the word membrane whereas only pdb entries match this criterion and only structures are to whom correspondence should be addressed specifically annotated as belonging to the scop class membrane and cell_surface proteins and peptides the stated numbers were obtained from the respective databases on physically mps differ significantly from water soluble_proteins these differences have been used in various computational_methods e g to identify mps from sequence alone soluble_proteins often adopt a globular conformation with their hydrophobic_residues mainly in the protein core and their polar and charged_residues predominantly on the water exposed surface membrane_proteins sit in a lipid_bilayer and thus contain stretches of residues that are exposed to the hydrophobic environment at the core of the membrane these transmembrane tm segments usually have one of two structure types helices or strands many protein_structure prediction_algorithms have been developed in order to close the gap between the number of known sequences and the number of known structures current structure_prediction can be classified into two main types templatebased and ab_initio modelling so_far ab_initio methods have only been truly successful for small globular_proteins template based modelling_methods however have succeeded in producing high_accuracy models if a good template exists for proteins of almost any type or size casp template based protein_structure for any type of protein can be divided_into several steps for globular water soluble_proteins a multitude of programmes are available to perform each of these separate steps the input to the entire modelling procedure is a single target_sequence whose structure is to be predicted the steps of a typical template based modelling protocol are briefly described below the first step is the identification of a template protein of known structure structural databases are scanned for proteins homologous to the target protein one or more templates are then selected from the homologues by choosing one or more template structures a d fold is implicitly assigned to the target_sequence a targettemplate alignment is then generated the alignment between target and template is one of the major contributors to the accuracy of the final model an incorrect alignment will almost always result in an inaccurate model the final step in modelling is coordinate generation based on the alignment between template protein_structures and the target_sequence the three main approaches to this problem are i assembly of rigid bodies ii segment matching and iii satisfaction of spatial restraints in order to improve the final model this entire procedure may be iterated this has been shown to produce superior results as well as being able to correct errors in the initial alignment between target_sequence and template structures the current computational structure_prediction may not be ideal for tm proteins designed as they are for water soluble_proteins the physical differences between water_soluble and mps may mean that many of the steps in structure_prediction should be approached differently the successful ab_initio fragment assembly method rosetta has been adapted to specifically predict mp structure rosetta membrane the adapted method included an energy function that modelled a multi_layer artificial membrane_environment the performance of rosetta membrane was tested on mps of known structure producing complete models with backbone root_mean deviations rmsds between and sub sets of each model between and residues long achieved rmsds of more recently the method was modified to include experimentally_derived constraints such as known helixhelix contacts the best models selected by the method had rmsds of with all test proteins being single chains of at most amino_acids the authors ventured that for larger proteins multiple constraints were likely to be required in order to obtain accurate results it should also be noted that being a combinatorial ab_initio method rosetta requires large_amounts of computing time and is typically run across large possibly distributed computing clusters homology modelling_methods on the other hand while relying on the availability of a template can be run on a single desktop computer in this article we consider the coordinate generation step in a homology_modelling framework and show how it can be significantly_improved without the use of experimental information by considering the different physical_environment of mps demonstrated that existing coordinate generators on soluble_proteins showed little difference in terms of overall accuracy and none of the methods consistently produced models that were much closer to the native target structure than the template in general the models were also worse than simply copying the backbone co ordinates of the template they identified modeller as one of the best methods due to its reliability and consistent model quality modeller attempts to satisfy spatial restraints in order to build a target protein_structure its probability_density uses data obtained from the input targettemplate alignment as well as prior_knowledge obtained from a database of structural_alignments this original database contained families of soluble_proteins and no mps in this article we use the most up to date version of modeller v at the time of the experiment as a representative of existing modelling_methods and compare it to our own method modellers accuracy for modelling mps has been tested previously it was noted that it was possible to build models whose tm region had c rmsd to the native_structure given a template with sequence_identity the accuracy for the whole protein was much lower than that of the tm region this reflected important local differences in the regions connecting tm segments in mps with similar topology this result indicated that template based_approaches can be successfully_applied to mps however this result also showed that modeller as a representative of the current standard in homology_modelling software in its current state is not ideal for creating complete accurate_models of mps a rmsd in the tm region is surprisingly high given that the problem of tm protein prediction should theoretically be simplified by the additional physical constraints imposed by the presence of the lipid_bilayer modelling errors in the tm region can then propagate to the loops that connect tm segments thus resulting in even lower accuracy outside the tm region nevertheless scientists commonly use modeller and comparable methods to predict mp structure software reviews example case studies we present medeller a new method for coordinate generation specialized for mps the input is a template protein_structure and a sequence_alignment between the target and template proteins this alignment is not altered by medeller the most important part of the method is the identification of the reliable core_structure shared by the template and target_proteins first the template proteins membrane_insertion is calculated using imembrane the core is initially restricted to the template residues buried in the middle layer of the membrane it is then gradually extended using a specialized membrane specific substitution score the model is then completed as far as possible using the loop modelling protocols fread and modeller we test the modelling accuracy of our method on four large test_sets containing a total of targettemplate pairs of tm proteins our method medeller builds highly_reliable core models which usually correspond to a proteins tm region averaged over all test_sets medeller produces more accurate core models and achieves a core model accuracy of rmsd versus for modeller with added high_accuracy loops medeller remains the more accurate method in of test cases and at least as good as modeller in of test cases with an average_accuracy of rmsd versus for modeller we present medeller a new template based coordinate generation protocol for mps first a common core between target page
