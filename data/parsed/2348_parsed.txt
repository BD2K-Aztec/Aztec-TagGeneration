structural_bioinformatics iloops a protein_protein prediction server based on structural_features proteinprotein_interactions play_a in many biological_processes despite that the number of servers that provide an easy and comprehensive method to predict them is still limited here we present iloops a web_server that predicts whether a pair of proteins can interact using local structural_features the inputs of the server are as follows i the sequences of the query proteins and ii the pairs to be tested structural_features are assigned to the query proteins by sequence_similarity pairs of structural_features formed by loops or domains are classified according to their likelihood to favor or disfavor a proteinprotein_interaction depending on their observation in known interacting and non interacting pairs the server evaluates the putative interaction using a random_forest availability iloops is available atproteinprotein interactions ppis mediate almost all processes in living_cells thus the discovery of new ppis is the key to understanding the complexity of biological_systems several experimental methods have been developed to identify new ppis among them yeast_two and tandem_affinity are the most used high_throughput methods however these methods are still economically and time costly and are hindered by the high amount of false_negative interactions mirroring the experimental_techniques computational_methods have also been developed to identify new ppis these computational_methods can be divided_into three main approaches depending on the contextual properties they exploit structural genomic or biological structural context methods such as interprets pipe or struct net extrapolate structural_information of a protein directly from its sequence and predict or score ppis based on the molecular_composition and structural conformation of the partners otherwise genomic_context methods like string or predictome provide predictions of ppis based on gene_fusion gene co localization and phylogenetic profiles finally biological_context methods e g genecensus use bayesian_networks to produce reliable predictions to properly assess the success of any ppi prediction method a reference_set of non interacting_protein nips is required ben the negatome database is a set of protein pairs that are unlikely to engage in physical direct_interactions compiled through manually_curated literature and crystallographic data here we present the iloops web_server a web implementation of our recently_published structural context method that exploits archdb classification of loops to predict ppis our method explores the balance of structural_features sfs observed in ppis and or nips the server provides ppi predictions with an associated precision using a random_forest rf classifier and considering different ratios between ppis and nips
