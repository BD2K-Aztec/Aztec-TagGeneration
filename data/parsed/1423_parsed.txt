disgenet a cytoscape_plugin to visualize integrate search and analyze gene disease networks one of the most challenging problems in biomedical_research is to understand_the of human_diseases great effort has been spent on determining genes associated to diseases however there is more and more evidence that most human_diseases cannot be attributed to single genes but arise due to complex interactions between multiple genetic_variants and environmental risk_factors several databases have been developed storing associations between genes and diseases such as online_mendelian omim each of these databases focuses on different aspects of phenotype to genotype relationships for instance pharmgkb is specialized on how genetic_variation is related to drug response whereas the toxicogenomics database ctd stores information about the effect of environmental_chemicals on human_health hence integration of different databases is needed to allow a comprehensive view of the state of the art knowledge within this research field it is widely established in bioinformatics to represent associations between biomedical entities as networks and to analyze their topology to get a global understanding of underlying to whom correspondence should be addressed relationships cytoscape is a widely used java_based open_source for networks visualization and analysis the cytoscape framework is extendable through the implementation of plugins up to now a vast variety of plugins has been developed ranging from advanced network_analysis tools to webservices in the following we present disgenet a new cytoscape_plugin to query integrate and visualize networks of human genedisease_associations disgenet is a coherent tool for easy analysis and interpretation of human genedisease networks it allows user_friendly access to a comprehensive database comprizing genedisease_associations for mendelian complex and environmental diseases disgenet displays genedisease association networks as bipartite graphs and provides gene centric and disease centric views of the data it assists the interpretation and exploration of human_diseases with respect to their genetic_origin diverse options for generating subnetworks as well as an advanced search tool facilitate not only the analysis of single diseases but also the study of sets of diseases or certain disease classes specified through their associated genes herein the multicolouring of gene and disease nodes offers a convenient visualization of disease classifications in the networks we plan regular updates of the underlying genedisease association database as well as the integration of further data_sources
