data_and maxlink network based prioritization of genes tightly_linked to a disease seed set maxlink a guilt by association_network search algorithm has been made available as a web_resource and a stand alone version based on a user supplied list of query genes maxlink identifies and ranks genes that are tightly_linked to the query list this functionality can be used to predict potential disease genes from an initial set of genes with known association to a disease the original algorithm used to identify and rank novel genes potentially involved in cancer has been updated to use a more statistically sound method for selection of candidate_genes and made applicable to other areas than cancer the algorithm has also been made faster by re implementation in c and the web_site uses funcoup as the underlying_network availability_and maxlink is freely_available maxlink sbc su se both as a web_service and a stand alone application for download the vast amount of gene and protein interaction data emanating from high_throughput experiments have been skillfully compiled into networks of functional_associations such as funcoup these networks combine_information on different types of proteingene interactions from different species data_sources and data types to achieve a much higher quality and interaction coverage than pure proteinprotein_interaction owing to their high coverage such networks have a high potential of yielding predictions about previously un annotated gene function s and or disease associations through guilt by association gba i e assuming related functions of network neighbors maxlink applies a gba algorithm to search the funcoup network to identify and rank genes enriched in connections to a seed set of known disease genes in the original implementation the algorithm was tested and validated on a set of cancer_genes the new version of maxlink has been implemented as a web_resource and has been further generalized to identify and rank potential disease genes of any disease or condition where a seed set of implicated genes can be provided maxlink a network prioritization algorithm for genes identified based on interactions with a seed set has been improved by a statistically more sound specificity filtering it is now released as a much faster c implementation applicable to any set of seed genes and available as an easy to use web_resource the tool can be used in general biological and applied biomedical_research e g prediction of potential disease genes prioritization and or analysis of results from gwas linkage_studies other tools exist for candidate_gene many of which are collected at the gene_prioritization portal these tools use various strategies e g text_mining or functional_annotation analysis and data_sources e g gene_expression and ppi_networks k ohler et_al most of the tools require a distinct region of the genome as input to narrow down the search_space in contrast maxlink prioritizes genes from the whole_genome applying a unique gba algorithm to funcoup that integrates_information on several types of protein and gene_associations from many species and data_sources and is one of the most comprehensive networks available furthermore many of the tools use keywords as input as opposed to maxlink which only uses gene_sets gene_set based tools have been shown to perform better than keyword based ones b performance in general is however heavily dependent on the selection of evaluation datasets but tools relying on more comprehensive data_integration appear to be more powerful b ornigen et_al performance benchmarking remains non trivial owing to the diversity of the ways the tools are to be used lack of solid experimental_validation and knowledge contamination when statistical_methods such as cross_validation are used a future extension of maxlink could be to use other functional_networks than funcoup to evaluate the algorithm on different data this could also provide an even wider coverage of potential geneprotein functional interaction space furthermore search_methods such as shortest_path or pagerank could be implemented to exploit other topological_properties of the network and to test the suitability of different types of search_methods and queries
