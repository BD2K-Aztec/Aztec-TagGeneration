data_and drug_snping an integrated drug based protein interaction based tagsnp based pharmacogenomics platform for snp_genotyping many drug or single_nucleotide snp related resources and tools have been developed but connecting and integrating them is still a challenge here we describe a user_friendly web_based software_package named drug_snping which provides a platform for the integration of drug information drugbank and pharmgkb proteinprotein_interactions string tagsnp selection hapmap and genotyping information dbsnp rebase and snp cancer drugbank based inputs include the following i common name of the drug ii synonym or drug brand name iii gene name hugo and iv keywords pharmgkb based inputs include the following i gene name hugo ii drug name and iii disease related keywords the output provides drug related information metabolizing_enzymes and drug_targets as well as protein_protein data importantly tagsnps of the selected genes are retrieved for genotyping analyses all drug based and proteinpro tein interaction based snp_genotyping information are provided with pcr_rflp pcr restriction_enzyme length polymorphism and taqman_probes thus users can enter any drug keywords brand names to obtain immediate information that is highly_relevant to gen otyping for pharmacogenomics research availability_and drug_snping and its user_manual are freely_available atpharmacogenomics is a type of personalized_medicine that studies drug_therapy in terms of efficacy or adverse_events with respect to each patients genetic_variation such as single_nucleotide snps snp profiling in terms of significantly informative snps is an important factor when carrying out drug_selection assessing dosages and deciding on a therapeutic_approach associating drug_responses with a patients snp genotype for genes related to the drug_metabolism and targeting is straight_forward if the relevant pharmacogenomics information is readily available drugbank and pharmgkb are two notable databases for pharmacogenomics related information although many snp technologies associated with drug_discovery have been widely_discussed experimental information that allows widespread snp_genotyping is unavailable in drugbank and pharmgkb recently many snp related tools such as snp cancer snp rflping seq snps snp id info pinesap seq snping mapnext and candisnper have been developed however these lack the ability to allow communication between snp_genotyping information and drug_targeting metabolism transporter carrier moreover snpsnp and proteinprotein_interactions are not considered in these snp related tools in contrast a powerful mining tool for proteinprotein_interaction named string has been developed but no snp related information is included therefore it is still difficult to integrate cheminformatics with snp interactivity and genotyping for pharmacogenomics purposes to overcome these problems we developed an integrated pharmacogenomics based and protein interaction based platform for snp_genotyping information tagsnps retrieved from hapmap which can provide narrowed down informative snp genotypes have been integrated in the proposed drug_snping system this study presents a novel and user_friendly web_based pharmacogenomics tool that allows the study of drug related snp interactions and related genotyping snp based association studies are common indicators used in personalized_medicine especially for pharmacogenomics although many pharmacogenomics resources and chemoinformatics databases have been developed these are generally focused on data_mining for basic drug information rather than on information that allows snp_genotyping many high_throughput snp_genotyping techniques have been developed such as snp_array pyrosequencing and taqman however the materials for snp_array analysis and the machine for pyrosequencing are more expensive than the taqman method therefore we selected the taqman_probe information for implementation in the drug_snping currently two major resources for snp related taqman_probe information are available namely snp cancer and dbsnp in ncbi abi but neither can provide taqman_probe information for all snps furthermore taqman_probes are sometimes unsuitable for genotyping of some snps to compensate for such problems we also implemented a rflp genotyping module in drug_snping when implementing rflp genotyping some snps do not have natural primers regular pcr_rflp primers as an alternative we introduced mutagenic primers whereby the module computationally introduces mismatched nucleotides into the forward f primer sequence to artificially generate a new restriction_enzyme site for snp_genotyping the lack of natural primers can be overcome by the use of mutagenic primers as can be seen for rs in other examples are presented in the user_manual although drugbank contains a versatile search function for many inputs its gene name input for drug_target is limited to the full name rather than the hugo official gene symbol for example fabp fatty_acid brain padi protein_arginine deiminase type and ptgs prostaglandin g h synthase are listed in the drug cards of db db and db in drugbank respectively but for gene name hugo inputs such as fabp padi and ptgs the appropriate drug records related to representative outputs for snp_genotyping information in drug_snping a natural primers for rs b mutagenic primers for rs snp_genotyping information such as a snp fasta sequence a b taqman_probe from snp cancer ncbi a b natural mutagenic rflp primers and a b restriction_enzymes for natural mutagenic rflp primers are shown these genes can not be found e g http www drugbank ca search search queryfabp http www drugbank ca sea rch search querypadi and http www drugbank ca search search queryptgs in contrast drug_snping allows input based on the hugo gene name which improves the gene centric search for drugs with input drug_targets this is demonstrated in the user_manual for drug_snping in drug_snping we also integrated pharmgkb for annotation of important genes related to drug_responses and pathways as a complement to drugbank the contributions in drug_snping pharmgkb and drugbank are shown in the importance of snpsnp interactions in association studies is increasing but most studies only focus their data analysis on limited and known snps to fill this gap we incorporated a widely used proteinprotein_interaction tool string in drug_snping we perform snpsnp interaction analysis based on the proteinprotein_interaction data from string via online retrieval in the current version of drug_snping however many other proteinprotein_interaction tools are not yet included such as gwidd for genome_wide protein_docking database stitch for an interaction_network database for small_molecules and proteins gene interaction miner for data_mining contextual_information for proteinprotein_interaction analysis path to facilitate pathway based genetic_association and polymorphism interaction analysis pia as a method for investigating complex genegene_interactions and proteinprotein interaction_databases similarly more drug related chemoinformatics resources are also not yet included in the current version of drug_snping such as dcdb as a drug_combination database drug binding databases supersite andre as a dictionary of metabolite and drug binding_sites in proteins and the drug adverse_reaction target_database dart for proteins related to adverse_drug in future we intend to integrate the available ftp data released in these tools in order to add more value to the drug_snping product the performance of the drug_snping was assessed by at least different inputs see the section of assessment of drugsnping at http bio kuas edu tw drug_snping user_manual jsp and all of them were functional to get the output by drug_snping moreover the operating time for integration in drug_snping can save time compared with non integration in this article we developed a novel integrated web_based interface drug_snping that provides user_friendly connections between the tools drugbank for chemoinformatics pharmgkb for pharmcogenomics string for proteinprotein_interaction genotyping information for taqman_probes and pcr_rflp moreover gene centric inputs can also be used as a means of finding corresponding drugs for drug_targeting and metabolism this tool thus provides all the drug orientated and gene centric inputs which are needed to mine all possible metabolic_enzymes and targets for these drugs as well as bench mark information that allows snp_genotyping to be performed this platform will be helpful for the development of pharmacogenomics as part of personalized_medicine
