data_and click words learning to predict document keywords from a user perspective motivation recognizing words that are key to a document is important for ranking relevant scientific documents traditionally important words in a document are either nominated subjectively by authors and indexers or selected objectively by some statistical_measures as an alternative we propose to use documents words popularity in user queries to identify click words a set of prominent words from the users perspective although they often overlap click words differ significantly from other document keywords results we developed a machine_learning approach to learn the unique characteristics of click words each word was represented by a set of features that included different types of information such as semantic type part of speech tag term frequencyinverse document frequency tfidf weight and location in the abstract we identified the most important features and evaluated our model using months of pubmed click through logs our results suggest that in addition to carrying high tfidf weight click words tend to be biomedical entities to exist in article titles and to occur repeatedly in article abstracts given the abstract and title of a document we are able to accurately_predict the words likely to appear in user queries that lead to document clicks contact finding relevant publications is critical for individual researchers to keep pace with the state of the art in their fields most scholars in the biomedical_domain use pubmed a free web_service provided by the us national_center ncbi to access over million biomedical citations improving the retrieval effectiveness of pubmed while accommodating the exponential_growth of biomedical_literature is a challenging and critical task for the ncbi as well as for the researchers in the field of biomedical information_retrieval interaction with pubmed is generally initiated by a user query and that contains three words on average an intelligent system should be able to use this information efficiently to retrieve the citation s to whom correspondence should be addressed which the user is looking for the user may click to view one or more abstracts modify the original query issue a different query or leave the system this sequence of interactions with pubmed is similar to what users experience with general web search_engines however searching the biomedical_literature in pubmed is also unique from at least two perspectives i pubmed_search is built as a boolean systemby default only the documents matching all the words in the query are retrieved and ii pubmed results are listed in reverse chronological_order as a result the top returned documents are the newly indexed citations but not necessarily the most relevant ones on the other hand of retrievals are for the top returned results in pubmed the search in pubmed therefore is much more sensitive to the user selection of query terms than in search systems that weigh and rank results by relevance although a pubmed article can be retrieved by various user queries only certain queries lead to user clicks retrievals for that articlea strong indication of relevance between the query and the clicked document in this work we identify document keywords from a list of pubmed queries that resulted in user clicks and we name such keywords as click words in document retrieval a keyword refers to a term that captures the essence of the topic of a document they are integral to the document management both for indexing and for retrieval one type of keywords used in medline citations is known as medical_subject mesh indexing terms which are assigned by professional indexers another common type of keywords is author keywords provided by authors when submitting an article a third type of keywords may be computed using statistics instead of relying on human annotation for example the classic term frequencyinverse document frequency tfidf weighting schema can be used to identify highly weighted words that stand out in an article when compared to the other articles in the collection comparing click words with other document keywords we found that although there was overlap user click words were quite different from other types of important keywords seefor an illustration document keywords are all meant to capture the important_contributions of a document but they rely on different weighting mechanisms which may be the reason for their difference click words are the product of click through logs and they represent the wisdom of the crowds as to what terms in an article may be important from the users perspective top weighted tfidf words capture the importance of words with respect to other articles in a collection in contrast pubmed relies on indexers to assign an example of click words top scoring tfidf words author keywords and mesh indexing terms for a pubmed article user click words are listed by the frequency in which they appear in user queries for this article tfidf words are listed in decreasing order of their tfidf weight mesh_terms follow the order in which they are listed in pubmed author keywords are listed as they appear in the article the appropriate mesh indexing terms to pubmed articles as a result these words are not immediately available for new articles moreover they are not necessarily found in the title and abstract of the article author keywords on the other hand are not included in the medline citation in addition they are not easily procured we found that they are available for only of the articles in the pubmed central full text database as an illustrative example we randomly_selected an article from medline_pubmed id and identified the document keywords illustrates the relationship between the click words and other keyword types for this article it also shows that the top five tfidf words list has the largest overlap with the click words list three of the four click words of this article arp actin and cofilin were also ranked in the top five tfidf words of this article in contrast the other two words of the top five tfidf list lamellipodium and complex were not popular in user queries our objective is to learn what characteristics make document words important from a collective user perspectivewords used as click words for each word we consider several characteristics including the word itself its part of speech pos its position in the title abstract etc by learning the importance of each characteristic we aim to build a learning system that will be able to predict which words are likely to become click words for a given article thus no search history would be required to automatically predict click words in any documents including those that lack user search history e g new pubmed citations the predicted click words can not only serve as an alternative type of document keywords for indexing but they can also provide assistance in curating mesh_terms or suggesting author keywords moreover as briefly_discussed in section predicted click words could play_important in many pubmed related applications such as ranking relevant results and finding similar documents since top weighted tfidf words provided the largest overlap with the user click words in the documents in our data we built a machine_learning model with novel features to recognize click words from a pool of candidate words with high tfidf weights for example take the five tfidf words in in our proposed approach we aim to identify prediction scores such that the three click words arp cortactin and actin are ranked higher than the other two words lamellipodium and complex the specific contributions of this article are the following bullet we introduce click words as representative document keywords we observed that click words obtained from click through logs can represent the meaning of scientific text from a collective user perspective therefore they are complementary to the current types of document keywords such as mesh and they may serve as an alternative type of keywords for document management bullet we developed and evaluated a machine_learning with novel features for identifying the unique characteristics of click words the proposed approach is capable of automatically finding click words in any document regardless of its search history bullet we performed empirical_studies on large_scale real_world datasets over frequently accessed medline articles over the course of months evaluation results show that the classifier is able to successfully perform automatic assignment of high_quality click words we conducted a wide_range of experiments to identify user click words from pubmed_abstracts and here we present a summary of them we begin the presentation of results by describing the click word prediction results for each individual feature_type this analysis allowed us to understand each of our feature_types and their individual contributions following this analysis we combined all features and learned a click word model consisting of a mix of all features next we performed our iterative feature_selection method we show how we reduced the number of features and the corresponding break even precision_recall point average for each feature selection_step finally we show the results of our selected click word prediction model when applied to evaluation dataset in this work we proposed click words as an alternative representation of document keywords we built a click word model able to identify the words of a document that conveyed the readers interest
