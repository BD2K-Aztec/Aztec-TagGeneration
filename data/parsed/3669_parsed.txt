sequence_analysis prediction of indel flanking_regions in protein_sequences using a variable order markov_model motivation insertion_deletion indel and amino_acid are two common events that lead to the evolution of and variations in protein_sequences further many of the human_diseases and functional_divergence between homologous_proteins are more related to indel mutations even though they occur less often than the substitution mutations do a reliable identification of indels and their flanking_regions is a major_challenge in research related to protein evolution structures and functions results in this article we propose a novel scheme to predict indel flanking_regions in a protein_sequence for a given protein fold based on a variable order markov_model the proposed indel flanking region indelfr predictors are designed based on prediction by partial match ppm and probabilistic suffix_tree pst which are referred to as the ppm indelfr and pst indelfr predictors respectively the overall performance evaluation results show that the proposed predictors are able to predict indelfrs in the protein_sequences with a high_accuracy and f measure in addition the results show that if one is interested only in predicting indelfrs in protein_sequences it would be preferable to use the proposed predictors instead of hmmer in view of the substantially superior_performance of the former contact as new protein_sequences are discovered on an everyday basis and protein databases continue to grow_exponentially with time analysis of protein_families understanding their evolutionary trends and detection of remote homologues have become extremely_important the proteins that evolve from the same ancestor protein are called homologous_proteins a protein molecule is created in a cell as a chain of amino_acids called the polypeptide_chain a polypeptide_chain can be represented as a string of characters by using the letter code of each amino_acid this string of characters is called the primary structure of a protein in addition to the primary structure a protein has secondary_and secondary_structure of a protein refers to well determined local sequence_elements such as an alpha_helix a beta_strand or any other local sequence_element that is neither a helix nor a strand these other local sequences usually called loops or coils may have a large variety of shapes these secondary_structure of a protein can be combined together to create a motif which is a simple combination of a few consecutive secondary_structure with a specific geometric arrangement such as helix_loop or strand loop helix some but not all motifs are associated with specific_biological the tertiary_structure of a protein refers to the dimensional structure of the protein where the secondary_structure form the physical core of the dimensional structure and loops are located on the surface of the tertiary_structure a domain refers to a combination of several secondary elements and motifs which may not necessarily be contiguous and which are usually packed in a compact_structure a protein may contain a single domain or several different domains or several copies of the same domain normally the proteins are classified into families based on the existence of a specific motif or domain in their structure where the existence of such a motif or domain has a major indication about the biological role of the protein the structural_classification of proteins scop database is a comprehensive ordering of all the proteins of the known structures according to their evolutionary and structural_relationships where the fundamental unit of this classification is a domain in this database the proteins have been classified into families superfamilies common fold and finally into classes at the top level of the structural hierarchy it is known that new proteins have evolved mainly through indel mutations indel mutations have been found to occur more often in the loop_regions and mainly in essential proteins and in those proteins that interact highly with others the functional_divergence between homologous_proteins may also be caused by indel mutations that occur in the regions between secondary_structures of a protein further it has been found that differences among species as well as many of the human_diseases are related to indel mutations which occur less often than substitution mutations do sequence_alignment is one of the most commonly performed tasks in bioinformatics and has been used in many applications including sequence_annotation phylogenetic_tree estimation evolutionary_analysis secondary_structure and database_search in recent_years considerable effort has been devoted to the development of protein alignment_algorithms that can efficiently detect mutations and infer structural and functional_relationships among the aligned protein_sequences by using position variant probability to score indel mutations the profile hidden_markov phmm is able to use the fact that indel mutations occur more frequently in some parts of a protein more than other parts e g in the loop_regions several software_packages such as hmmer and sam have implemented the phmmbased alignment_algorithms among these packages hmmer is the most used software_package in protein database_search and comparison a collection of phmms covering many protein_families have been generated using hmmer and they are available in the pfam_database the disadvantage of using phmm based alignments for detecting mutations would be that the corresponding alignment_algorithms assume the occurrence of mutations in the protein_sequence to follow a fixed first order_markov when a pair of protein_sequences has been aligned an indel region is defined as a gap in any of the two sequences segments of protein_sequence immediately before and after an indel region are called flanking_regions see supplementary the database called indelfr indel flanking region database contains sequence and structure information of indels with their flanking_regions including their positions length amino_acid and secondary_structure in the indelfr database the structure based sequence_alignment program pdbefold has been used to align homologous non redundant proteins obtained from the astral database which in turn has used the non redundant protein_domains from the scop database that have similarity levels as high as it has been found that there exists a strong relationship between indels and their flanking_regions the objective of this article is therefore to propose a novel scheme to predict indel flanking_regions in a protein_sequence based on a variable order markov_model vomm of the flanking_regions we propose two indel flanking region indelfr predictors one predictor using prediction by partial match ppm and other using probabilistic suffix_tree pst in conclusion the results show that if one is interested only in predicting the indel flanking_regions in protein_sequences then it would be preferable to use the proposed predictors instead of using hmmer in view of the substantially superior average_accuracy and f measure values for the proposed ppm and pst predictors with d and that obtained using hmmer over all the protein sequences_contained in the selected and protein_folds from the all protein all protein and and protein a b classes respectively for a indelfr database b sabmark superfamily set and c sabmark twilight setperformance of the former it should be noted that if hmmer is used for prediction one would need as many phmms as the number of families in a given fold while only one proposed predictor is needed for a given fold moreover it should be noted that the proposed indelfr predictors are built in a fully_automated manner without using any prior assumption about the occurrence of mutations in the protein_sequences as in the case of scoring_schemes we anticipate that our study will not only enable future_studies on the modeling of indel mutations but will also open up new avenues for research concerning protein evolution structures and functions
