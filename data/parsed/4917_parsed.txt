systems_biology when the web meets the cell using personalized pagerank for analyzing protein_interaction motivation enormous and constantly increasing quantity of biological_information is represented in metabolic and in protein_interaction databases most of these data are freely_accessible through large public depositories the robust analysis of these resources needs novel technologies being developed today results here we demonstrate a technique originating from the pagerank computation for the world_wide for analyzing_large interaction networks the method is fast scalable and robust and its capabilities are demonstrated on metabolic_network data of the tuberculosis bacterium and the proteomics_analysis of the blood of melanoma patients availability the perl script for computing the personalized pagerank in protein networks is available for non profit research applications together with sample input_files at the address the problem of finding important nodes in a large network emerged in several fields but the best solutions to date were appeared in conjunction of the world_wide graph here the nodes are the web_pages and directed edges are the hyperlinks between the web_pages the web search_engine techniques gave motivations to this question since the important web_pages related to a web search need to be returned first to the users of the web search service the most natural measure of importance of a vertex the degree i e the number of connected edges in the case of an undirected graph or the in degree i e the number of incoming edges in the case of directed_graphs is historically well established and corresponds e g in scientometry to the number of citations to a published article however in the case of the web graph the degree proved to be easy to manipulate by simply inserting artificially a large number of referring edges into the graph kleinbergs hits algorithm assigns quality_scores to the nodes and the quality of the referring nodes is inherited by the referred nodes so low quality manipulations can be filtered out it turned out however that the hits algorithm is also prone to more sophisticated manipulations and it is not robust enough
