gene_expression fabia factor_analysis for bicluster acquisition motivation biclustering of transcriptomic_data groups genes and samples simultaneously it is emerging as a standard tool for extracting knowledge from gene_expression we propose a novel generative approach for biclustering called fabia factor_analysis for bicluster acquisition fabia is based on a multiplicative model which accounts for linear dependencies between gene_expression and conditions and also captures heavy tailed distributions as observed in real_world transcriptomic_data the generative framework allows to utilize well founded model_selection methods and to apply bayesian techniques results on simulated_datasets with known true artificially implanted biclusters fabia clearly outperformed all competitors on these datasets fabia was able to separate spurious biclusters from true biclusters by ranking biclusters according to their information content fabia was tested on three microarray_datasets with known subclusters where it was two times the best and once the second best method among the compared biclustering approaches availability fabia is available as an r package on bioconductorrecent technologies such as the affymetrix array plates and next_generation open up new possibilities for highthroughput expression_profiling these technologies in turn require advanced analysis tools to extract knowledge from the huge amount of data if the experimental_conditions are known supervised techniques such as support_vector are suitable to extract the dependencies between conditions and gene_expression or to identify condition indicative genes however conditions may not be known or biologists and medical researchers are interested in dependencies to whom correspondence should be addressed within or across conditions for instance it could be possible to refine pathways across conditions or to identify new subgroups within one condition for these tasks unsupervised methods such as clustering are required which are usually insufficient because samples may only be similar on a subset of genes and vice_versa in drug_design for example researchers want to reveal how compounds affect_gene the effects of compounds however may be similar only on a subgroup of genes under such circumstances biclustering is the proper unsupervised analysis technique a bicluster in a transcriptomic dataset is a pair of a gene_set and a sample set for which the genes are similar to each other on the samples and vice_versa if multiple pathways are active in a sample it belongs to different biclusters if a gene participates in different pathways for different conditions it belongs to different biclusters too thus biclusters can overlap a survey of biclustering approaches has been given by in principle there exist four categories of biclustering methods variance minimization methods two way clustering_methods motif and pattern_recognition methods and probabilistic and generative approaches transcriptomic_data are usually supplied as a matrix where each gene corresponds to one row and each sample to one column the matrix entries themselves are the expression levels variance minimization methods define clusters as blocks in the matrix with minimal deviation of their elements this definition has been already considered byand extended by the cluster methods search for blocks of elements having a deviation variance below one example are ks clusters where the maximum and the minimum of each row need to differ less than on the selected columns a second example are pclusters which are defined as submatrices with pairwise edge differences less than a third example are the cheng and church biclusters having a mean squared error below after fitting an additive_model with a constant a row and a column effect flexible overlapped biclustering floc extend chengchurch biclusters by dealing with missing_values via an occupancy threshold and by using both l and l norms two way clustering_methods apply conventional clustering to the columns and rows and iteratively combine the results coupled two way clustering ctwc iterativelypage we have introduced a novel biclustering method that is a generative multiplicative model it assumes realistic non gaussian signal distributions with heavy tails the generative_model allows to rank biclusters according to their information content model_selection is performed by maximum a posteriori via an em_algorithm based on a variational approach on simulated_datasets with known true biclusters fabia clearly outperformed all competing_methods on three gene_expression with previously verified subclusters it was once page fabia the second best and twice the best performing method the biological_relevance of the fabia biclusters has been demonstrated by go and kegg analyses finally fabia has been successfully_applied to drug_design to find compounds with similar effects on gene_expression
