gene_expression inference of alternative_splicing from rna_seq with probabilistic splice_graphs motivation alternative_splicing and other processes that allow for different transcripts to be derived from the same gene are significant forces in the eukaryotic_cell rna_seq is a promising technology for analyzing alternative transcripts as it does not require prior_knowledge of transcript structures or genome_sequences however analysis of rna_seq in the presence of genes with large_numbers of alternative transcripts is currently challenging due to efficiency identifia bility and representation issues results we present rna_seq models and associated inference algorithms based on the concept of probabilistic splice_graphs which alleviate these issues we prove that our models are often identifiable and demonstrate that our inference methods for quantification and differential_processing detection are efficient and accurate availability software implementing our methods is available at http deweylab an important aspect of eukaryotic molecular_biology is the fact that a single gene can give rise to a wide_variety of transcripts as a result of pre_mrna alternative processing ap events ap events result from the phenomena of alternative_splicing and alternative polyadenylation_sites which can give rise to different mrnas from the same pre_mrna and alternative transcription_start which can lead to different pre mrnas produced from the same gene_locus the alternative transcripts resulting from these processes are important for development and have also been implicated in disease recent_studies that of human genes and of drosophila genes are alternatively_spliced indicating that this phenomenon is the rule rather than the exception the relatively recent technology of rna_seq is revolutionizing the way alternative transcripts are identified and quantified unlike microarrays which can only measure what their probes are designed to detect rna_seq allows for the detection of novel splice_junctions and exonic sequences e g in fact rna_seq is now commonly being used to perform de_novo transcriptome_assembly a powerful approach for studying gene_expression in species without sequenced_genomes in this article we present a novel approach to the tasks of alternative transcript quantification and differential_processing dp detection given rna_seq and fixed gene structures which may be provided by an existing genome_annotation or predicted from the data via transcriptome_assembly our approach is based on a class of models that were first independently described in the context of expressed_sequence est analysis we refer to these models as probabilistic splice_graphs psgs psgs build on the concept of splice_graphs structures that compactly represent the possible isoforms of a gene given a set of known exon boundaries and splice_junctions the primary contribution of this work is efficient methodology for applying psgs to rna_seq which are more powerful than ests for quantifying alternative_splicing owing to larger numbers of reads but more challenging to analyze owing to shorter read_lengths in general psgs provide a statistical_framework for representing dependencies between ap events the existence of dependencies or lack thereof between ap events is currently an active area of research several genes have been found to have independent splicing_events whereas others suggest that dependencies exist however there is currently not enough full_length sequence_data to determine if there are widespread dependencies between ap events as we will discuss our psg based rna_seq analysis methods can be configured to model and detect such dependencies when they exist when processing_events are largely independent of each other a psg allows for a compact statistical_model of the frequencies of a genes isoforms our rna_seq analysis methods take advantage of this strength of psgs to address a number of challenges posed by alternative_splicing that are not thoroughly dealt with by previous methods all of these challenges are rooted by the facts that i rna_seq identify only a small fraction of the transcript from which they are derived and ii alternative transcripts from the same gene typically share a large amount of sequence a first challenge is that a gene may have an exponential number of alternative_splice which makes quantification of individual isoforms extremely_difficult an exponential blowup in the number of possible isoforms occurs when multiple to whom correspondence should be addressed we performed a variety of experiments on both simulated and real rna_seq to analyze the accuracy and performance of our psg methods on simulated_data we first quantify the theoretical advantage of our method over a more simplistic jrbased method for estimating processing event frequencies on real drosophila data we compare the estimates from the psg and jr method and measure the improvement in the convergence rates of our methods estimates with bootstrapping experiments we then evaluate the accuracy of our dp tests through experiments on sets of real and simulated rna_seq samples that include biological and technical_replicates lastly with real_data from the drosophila gene dscam we demonstrate the superior time complexity of using a factorized splice graphbased method
