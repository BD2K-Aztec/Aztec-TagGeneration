sequence_analysis eficaz application of a high_precision enzyme_function predictor to proteomes high_quality enzyme function_annotation is essential for understanding the biochemistry metabolism and disease processes of organisms previously we developed a multi component high_precision enzyme_function predictor eficaz enzyme_function inference by a combined approach here we present an updated improved version eficaz that is trained on a significantly_larger data_set of enzyme sequences and prosite patterns we also present the results of the application of eficaz to the enzyme reanno tation of genomes cataloged in the ensembl_database availability the eficaz server and database is freely_available with a use friendly interface atunderstanding cellular_functions such as metabolic_pathways requires the precise assignment of enzymatic functions to proteins in their respective genomes the ever increasing accumulation of sequence_data that is the result of the genome_sequencing requires rapid computational_methods to assign enzyme functions enzymes are classified by the enzyme commission ec using a hierarchical system of fourdigit codes such as ec for each type of enzymatic_activity high_precision ec_number assignment is of utmost_importance for studies such as metabolic_pathway understanding evolutionary_relationships in pathways and metabolite prediction etc previously we developed an automatic engine for the proteomic scale inference of enzyme_function eficaz enzyme_function inference by a combined approach eficaz combines the predictions from four independent methods namely i chiefc family based functionally discriminating residue fdr identification ii multiple pfam based fdr recognition iii chiefc sit evaluation and iv high_specificity multiple prosite patterns the main strength of eficaz is its ability to identify fdrs as residues that discriminate the members of a homo functional family consisting of members with a specific ec_number from a hetero functional family sequences with another ec_number subsequently we enhanced our approach to eficaz with the inclusion of support_vector svm models for discrimination between homo functional and heterofunctional ec family_members this led to the inclusion of two additional components v chiefc family based svm evaluation and vi multiple pfam family based svm evaluation recent_years have seen a huge influx of sequence_data as a result of automated genome_sequencing and subsequent assignment of new sequences by the ec catfam priam and enzymedetector are some of the programs capable of genome level enzyme prediction however all of them are sequence_similarity based_methods whereas eficaz also uses prosite pfam followed by detection of fdrs and is optimized for high_precision here we present the latest implementation of our enzyme_function prediction engine eficaz using the latest significantly_larger data_set of sequences from swissprot and sequence_patterns from prosite we use enzyme annotations of the swissprot o component of uniprot sequences for training eficaz subsequently we applied eficaz to annotate fully sequenced_genomes in the ensembl_database belonging to bacteria fungi protists metazoans plants and vertebrates the results are cataloged and are available at http cssb biology gatech edu enzymes
