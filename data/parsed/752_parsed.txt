genome_analysis bioinformatics challenges for personalized_medicine motivation widespread availability of low_cost full genome_sequencing will introduce new challenges for bioinformatics results this review outlines recent_developments in sequencing_technologies and genome_analysis methods for application in personalized_medicine new methods are needed in four areas to realize the potential of personalized_medicine i processing large_scale robust genomic_data ii interpreting the functional effect and the impact of genomic_variation iii integrating systems data to relate complex genetic_interactions with phenotypes and iv translating these discoveries into medical_practice we are on the verge of the genomic era doctors and patients will have access to genetic data to customize medical_treatment consumers can already get variant markers analyzed with associated trait information and soon full genome_sequencing will cost less than one group has performed a complete clinical_assessment of a patient using a personal genome and the genomes_project is sequencing individuals genomes in the coming_years the bioinformatics world will be inundated with individual genomic_data this flood of data introduces significant challenges that the bioinformatics community needs to address this review outlines the developments that led to these challenges the previous work that can address them and the need for new methods to address them the challenges fall into four main_areas i processing large_scale robust genomic_data ii interpreting the functional_impacts of genomic_variation iii integrating data to relate complex interactions with phenotypes and iv translating these discoveries into medical_practices to whom correspondence should be addressed
