knowledge based modeling of peptides at protein interfaces pipred motivation proteinprotein_interactions ppis underpin virtually all cellular_processes both in health and disease modulating the interaction between proteins by means of small chemical_agents is therefore a promising route for future novel therapeutic_interventions in this context peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of ppis results we reported a novel computational structure and knowledge based_approach to model orthosteric peptides to target ppis pipred pipred relies on a precompiled and bespoken library of structural_motifs imotifs extracted from protein_complexes and a fast structural_modeling algorithm driven by the location of native chemical_groups on the interface of the protein target named anchor residues pipred comprehensive and systematically samples the entire interface deriving peptide conformations best suited for the given region on the protein interface pipred complements the existing technologies and provides new solutions for the disruption of selected interactions availability_and database and accessory scripts and programs are available upon request to the authors or at http www bioinsilico org pipred proteinprotein_interactions ppis are essential in the shaping of normal and pathological behaviors in cells a new frontier in drug_discovery is therefore the development of new therapeutic_agents to modulate ppis although originally considered undruggable ppis are arising as promising therapeutic_targets as reviewed in wells and mcclendon and they are attracting considerable attention from biotechnological companies as the unmined gold reserve in drug_discovery one part of the problem is that proteins usually interact through large and flat surfaces that lack defining physicochemical traits that can be exploited to attain the required affinities it is becoming clearer that chemistry originating from traditional drug_discovery programs is perhaps not the most suited for targeting ppis and thus new chemotypes should be sought it is in this context and thanks to biotechnology advances that have improved its pharmacokinetic_properties that peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of ppis besides peptide mediated_interactions are common in biology accounting for up to of the interactions that take place inside the cell they are also central to number of essential_cellular such as signal_transduction protein assembly protein_localization and regulation and thus are the more natural candidates for the inhibition of ppis moreover peptides do not preclude traditional chemistry as they can be used as precursors to derive chemical_compounds i e peptidomimetics e g p mdm and bak bh bcl_xl computational_tools can be used to model the structure of peptides targeting protein interfaces such approaches include peptide linking property guided searches optimization and docking while useful these technologies present a number of limitations i the search is usually restricted to a small region of the interface given the time that will be required to fully explore the entire interface ii the structure of peptides tend to be biased toward linear and extended conformations as its maximized the contacts with the target surface however peptides can adopt different conformations including a helix iii do not explicitly exploit the natural repertoire of peptide_sequences which has been proved to increase the chance to identify bioactive_peptides iv some methods require the sequence of the peptides and thus neglecting the discovery of novel sequences and v other methods are based on the optimization of main_chain stretches isolated from its cognate partner s and thus cannot be used to explore novel conformations here we present pipred a novel structure and knowledgebased approach to model the conformation of peptides targeting protein interfaces pipred relies on a bespoken library of structural_motifs derived from interfaces named imotifs and it uses native structural_elements of the interface being targeted targetinterface so_called disembodied anchor residues the search and sampling of peptides covers the entire interface i e a systematic and comprehensive exploration without biases caused by specific location s of the target interface or by the conformation of peptides pipred is therefore a good complement to existing methodologies in this work we present a novel knowledge based computational_method to model and design orthosteric peptides pipred pipred relies on the structural_information of the protein_complexes and on a bespoken library of structural_motifs imotifsdb the residues that mediate the interaction of cognate partner s and target protein i e anchor residues are used to drive a comprehensive and systematic sampling and modelling of peptides derived from imotifs pipred can be applied to any protein complex for which the threedimensional structure is known and thus open a new avenue to exploit the repository of protein_complexes present in structural databases additionally the technology can be easily adapted to ras p ras ral and ras scfv bottom row surface representation of ras gray and switch i ii depicted in red anchor residues and modeled peptides are represented as yellow spheres and ribbon

the complex is not known since individual aminoacids can be placed on the surface of the target protein_structure via single_residue docking e g as in ben finally this new approach could be used in conjunction with high_throughput peptide_synthesis techniques such as peptide microarrays to generate a pool of sequences that are biased toward the targeted surface i e a directed search as opposed to a random peptide screening
