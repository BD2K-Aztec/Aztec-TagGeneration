structural_bioinformatics fingerprinting protein_structures effectively and efficiently motivation one common task in structural_biology is to assess the similarities and differences among protein_structures a variety of structure alignment_algorithms and programs has been designed and implemented for this purpose a major_drawback with existing structure alignment programs is that they require a large amount of computational time rendering them infeasible for pairwise_alignments on large collections of structures to overcome this drawback a fragment alphabet learned from known structures has been introduced the method however considers local_similarity only and therefore occasionally assigns high scores to structures that are similar only in local fragments method we propose a novel approach that eliminates false posi tives through the comparison of both local and remote similarity with little compromise in speed two kinds of contact libraries contactlib are introduced to fingerprint protein_structures effectively and efficiently each contact group of the contact library consists of one local or two remote fragments and is represented by a concise vector these vectors are then indexed and used to calculate a new combined hit_rate score to identify similar protein_structures effectively and efficiently results we tested our method on the high_quality protein_structure subset of scop containing protein_structures for each protein_structure of the subset we retrieved its neighbor protein_structures from the rest of the subset the best area under_the archived by contactlib is as high as this is a significant_improvement compared with the best result achieved by fragbag we also demonstrated that incorporating remote contact_information is critical to consistently retrieve accurate neighbor protein_structures for all query protein_structures availability_and although assessing the similarities and differences between protein_structures is a common practice in structural_biology efficiently performing this comparison is critical in some applications for example once a new protein_structure is determined researchers often need to infer its function or evolution by studying proteins of similar structures a few databases such as scop and cath maintain hierarchical classifications of known protein_structures the need to obtain structures similar to the new protein from these databases motivates the neighbor protein_structure retrieval problem given a query protein_structure and a database of protein_structures retrieve all the structures in the database that are similar to the query structure one intuitive solution to the neighbor protein_structure retrieval problem is to align the query protein_structure and every protein_structure of the database using a pairwise protein_structure alignment_tool one successful approach of pairwise protein_structure is to represent protein_structures as d coordinates and to find the optimal residue mapping and orientation rotation and translation together as stralign combinatorial extension ce local global_alignment lga secondary_structure matching ssm tmalign and spalign proposed an orientation free approach is possible by encoding each structure as a d matrix of residueresidue interaction distances comparison between two structures can be performed by an alignment of their respective matrices as proposed in dali one drawback of adopting these approaches is inefficiency especially when the protein_structure database is large either using d coordinates or using distance_matrices solving the pairwise protein_structure problem is np_hard thus all the aforementioned pairwise protein_structure tools adopt heuristic approaches without global optimality guarantee unfortunately such heuristic approaches are still time consuming the concern for efficiency has prompted the use of d protein_structure profiles which often perform well in particular the current state of the art method called fragbag has been shown_experimentally to be fast and accurate on average specifically fragbag represents a protein_structure as a profile that contains counts of structure fragments in a fragment alphabet learned from known structures then neighbor protein_structures can be retrieved by comparing the profiles efficiently one drawback however is that although fragbag is capable of delivering good average_accuracy its accuracy is sometimes significantly_worse than the average_accuracy as shown in section this accuracy drop occurs when two structures are similar in many local fragments but differ significantly in their overall structure because fragbag compares only local contacts it fails to identify the large non local discrepancy in these structures to whom correspondence should be addressed in this article we present contactlib a complete contact group library defined in section which is to be used as fingerprints of protein_structures fragbag and local feature frequency profile lffp are two promising tools that are closely_related our contactlib is different from fragbag and lffp in following ways i fragbag and lffp are developed on general structure fragments whereas contactlib introduces both local and remote contact groups eliminating potentially weak contact groups ii fragbag and lffp use d coordinates or d distance_matrices whereas contactlib introduces d distance vectors that can be efficiently indexed iii fragbag and lffp require a predefined word alphabet whereas contactlib avoids such word alphabet and introduces some freedom of specifying similarity thresholds at runtime and iv fragbag and lffp use word frequency profiles and distance functions from the text information_retrieval problem whereas contactlib introduces a combined hit_rate scoring_function for the neighbor protein_structure retrieval problem because the word alphabet of lffp is not publicly_available we focus on comparing contactlib and fragbag in this article as an initial study we built two contactlibs contactlib l which models local contacts and contactlib r which models remote contacts using one or both of contactlib l and contactlib r we tested our method on the high_quality protein_structure subset of scop containing protein_structures for each protein_structure we retrieved its neighbor protein_structures from the rest according to the receiver_operating roc_curve analysis in section the best area_under auroc archived by contactlib is as high as this is a significant_improvement compared with the best result achieved by fragbag specifically when contactlib r is used of the aurocs is and the lowest auroc is when contactlib l is used of the aurocs are and of the aurocs are however when fragbag is used of the aurocs are and of the aurocs are therefore the worst_case auroc is significantly_improved by using contactlib and contactlib r is even able to guarantee an auroc higher than a random method which has an auroc equals to we also demonstrated that incorporating remote contact_information is critical to consistently retrieve accurate neighbor protein_structures for all query protein_structures which is more challenging than that for all query protein_structures in section moreover we demonstrated that if two contact groups have similar structures with low root_mean rmsd values they tend to have similar distance vectors which are used to index contact groups in section finally we discussed several future extensions and applications of contactlib in section in conclusion we have shown that contactlib is an effective and efficient neighbor protein_structure retrieval method most importantly contactlib was able to maintain a consistent level of accuracy in our tests the key to consistently retrieve accurate neighbor protein_structures for all query protein_structures is incorporating remote contact_information in contactlib this is b correlation_analysis among rmsd dm and dv of local contact groups where rmsd is a d is the euclidean distance_function m is the distance_matrix used by dali and v is our distance vector a the correlation_coefficient is between dv and dm b the correlation_coefficient is between dv and rmsd roc_curve analysis of all and all query protein_structures the aurocs of all query protein_structures tend to be higher than those of all query protein_structures the impact on the type of query protein_structures is significantly_smaller when contactlib r is used than when contactlib l is used unmatched by existing neighbor protein_structure retrieval method fragbag however our method can be improved in several ways one possibility is to discover and study new types of contact groups we will look for new definitions of distance vectors representing remote contact groups based on free_energies another promising extension of contactlib would be to use contact groups to improve pairwise protein_structure tools such as tmalign one such case is provided in which shows two alignments between scop proteins d cufa and d k aa drawn by the pymol molecular_graphics system schrodingerschrodinger the alignment shown inwas found by tmalign and the alignment shown inwas found by our neighbor protein_structure retrieval method with two extra steps first we clustered the rotation and transition matrices that yield the rmsd of similar contact groups between scop proteins d cufa and d k aa found by our neighbor protein_structure retrieval method second we used the representative rotation and transition_matrix of the largest cluster to generate the alignment we will also look for new applications for contactlib one promising application for contactlib is the structural blast approach of preppi whose performance depends mainly on the accuracy and on the speed of its neighbor protein_structure retrieval moreover contactlib is also capable of finding neighbor protein_structures if the query protein_structure is only partially known in the process of protein_structure or determination then contactlib may use the incomplete c c pairwise distance_matrix to find template candidates to enable it to predict or to determine the query protein_structure funding grf ecs grant no of hong_kong an nserc grant ogp the canada research chair
