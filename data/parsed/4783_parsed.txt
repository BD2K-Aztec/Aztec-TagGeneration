systems_biology understanding the limits of animal_models as predictors of human_biology lessons_learned from the sbv improver species translation challenge motivation inferring how humans respond to external cues such as drugs chemicals viruses or hormones is an essential question in biomedicine very often however this question cannot be addressed because it is not possible to perform experiments in humans a reasonable alternative consists of generating responses in animal_models and translating those results to humans the limitations of such translation however are far from clear and systematic assessments of its actual potential are urgently_needed sbv improver systems_biology verification for industrial methodology for process verification in research was designed as a series of challenges to address translatability between humans and rodents this collabora tive crowd sourcing initiative invited scientists from around the world to apply their own computational methodologies on a multilayer systems_biology dataset composed of phosphoproteomics transcrip tomics and cytokine data derived from normal human and rat bronchial_epithelial exposed in parallel to different stimuli under identical conditions our aim was to understand the limits of species to species translatability at different levels of biological_organization signaling transcriptional and release of secreted_factors such as cytokines participating teams submitted different solutions across the sub challenges two thirds of which were statistically_significantly better than random additionally similar computational_methods were found to range widely in their performance within the same challenge and no single method emerged as a clear winner across all sub challenges finally computational_methods were able to effectively translate some specific stimuli and biological_processes in the lung epithelial system such as dna_synthesis cytoskeleton and extracellular_matrix translation immune inflammation and growth_factor proliferation pathways better than the expected response similarity between species from basic biology to translational_medicine and clinical_trials animal_models have been an invaluable tool for inferring human biological_responses yet in spite of the advances these models have facilitated numerous findings have also been unsuccessfully translated to humans as evidenced by the failure of many clinical_trials these failures could derive from species specific differences in response to perturbations or stimuli that would preclude naively translating information learned in one animal_model directly to another systems_biology offers the means for understanding the limits of translatability of animal_models in different settings from clinical_trials to toxicological assessments to basic cell_biology this approach can provide a more comprehensive predictive_model because it considers changes at different levels of the entire system this is achieved through the development of systematic studies and integration of data over multiple experiments and data generation platforms these more complete models will aid our understanding of at what regulatory levels and to what degree responses to different perturbations are translatable between species when developing models for species translation orthologous_genes are commonly thought to share the same or similar function this assumption does not always hold as several reports show that even among closely_related this is not necessarily the case such divergence goes beyond differences in function and can be seen in changes in essentiality among mouse orthologs of human to whom correspondence should be addressed we organized the stc as part of the sbv improver initiative and provided participants with experimental data_describing multiple_layers of different signaling_pathways the goal was to assess the ability of computational_methods to predict biological_responses in primary nhbe cells based on responses observed in primary nrbe cells several of our observations support the conclusion that changes in phosphorylation status and gene_set activation induced by cellular response to different perturbations in human cells can be predicted to some extent given responses generated in rat cells overall stimuli caused more activation in rat than in human cells for most gene_sets and for all phosphoproteins except for phosphoproteins ks a and hspb supplementary the differences in stimulusinduced activity could be due to a more homogenous biological_sample in rats than in humans or simply to higher sensitivity and faster signaling of nrbe cells compared with nhbe cells interestingly differences between the kinetics of activation of homolog phosphoproteins at the and min time points were minimal pairs for the whole dataset seein in this issue although not statistically_significant the average performance over all participants tended to be higher in sc than in sc this was seen in the higher pr values when predicting stimuli activity across all phosphoproteins or gene_sets and also when predicting the challenges respective signaling layer gene_set activation or phosphorylation responses across all stimuli this observation holds when considering the performance of the best performer in both sub challenges where team amgs prediction pr values were higher for sc versus sc when we considered cases where the majority of participants performed better than species similarity i e a na ve direct translation stimuli and of active gene_sets were well predicted in sc and phosphoproteins and stimulus in sc and d and c and d the greater number ofwell predicted stimuli by gene_set activation may have to do with the relatively lower levels of similarity s g as compared with s p although importantly teams were able to find informative biological signal in spite of these lower levels of response conservation finally teams in sc and teams in sc submitted predictions that were statistically_significantly different from random in two of the three metrics used supplementary tables s s overall for sc about two thirds of the submissions were statistically_significant of this indicates that in sc gex data were sufficiently informative to infer upstream phosphorylation responses and that overall across species predictions were achievable for specific stimuli phosphoproteins and gene_sets while many teams achieved a statistically_significant result when considering random submissions as a null_hypothesis most teams in sc found their methods were unable to outperform a completely na ve approach to the challenge if a team had submitted the rats subset b protein_phosphorylation status in sc and the gene_set activations in sc as their predictions they would have ranked second and fifth respectively however best performer teams used approaches that did significantly better than the na ve approach suggesting that their computational_methods could capture additional informative biological signal in rat data see in this issue interestingly there was also not a statistically_significant between the five teams that used both p and gex data and all others the sc second place team team igb went further to test multiple variations of their neural_network method to include gex data and found it fared worse than methods using phosphorylation data alone see this may be owed to the smaller difference in relative_standard rsd between human and rat phosphorylation response data versus gex data supplementary the similarity in phosphorylation response across species may have been difficult to detect due to the low number of replicate samplesonly these observations suggesting that it was relatively easier to predict a response of the phosphoproteomic layer are also reflected in the median z scoreshierarchical clustering of gene_sets and genes that are present in at least of the top best predicted gene_sets each cell is valued according to gene_set membership and frequency the gene is found as part of that gene_sets gsea core enrichment set gene gene_set pairs are assigned a if the gene is not a member of the challenge metrics where sc z scores were higher than sc for aupr and pcc c these results likely reflect both the larger universe of predictions for sc which were an order of magnitude greater than for sc gene_sets stimuli pairs versus phosphoproteins stimuli pairs and also a higher conservation between rat and human for protein_phosphorylation activation s p compared with the gene_set activation s g it is also possible that the higher similarity in phosphorylation response and smaller difference in the rsd between human and rat in the protein_phosphorylation data with respect to the gex data enabled more accurate_predictions supplementary this is likely due to the greater heterogeneity of human samples coming from two different donors compared with rat samples coming from an inbred laboratory_strain but also given the increased complexity of human signaling transcriptional_responses are a relatively downstream event from phosphorylation in signaling_cascades hence it is possible that when the signal finally propagates to the transcriptional layer many other species specific factors may amplify the differences of response between both species an alternative explanation could be related to platform specific_biases due to inherent_differences in mrnas however we paid special_attention to experimental_design and execution as well as sample and data_processing to minimize as much as possible experimental biases and avoid confounding_effects within and between species additionally phosphorylation response predictions benefited from more targeted experiments which looked at phosphoproteins enriched for active signals while gex data was genome_wide and would only be expected to have a small percentage of genes_differentially an interesting follow_up experiment would be to look at targeted gene_expression for the pathway_components using more specific measurements like qrt_pcr or deep_sequencing more sampled time points for gex could provide greater granularity and may reveal patterns difficult to observe with a single h exposure time point and also confirm whether this choice left transcriptional_responses to particular stimuli undetected the stcs results indicate that gex data were potentially noisier and the numbers of active gene setstimulus pairs were low however participants in sc made better predictions per stimulus than per gene_sets this shows that given sufficiently large_datasets it was still possible to extract a biologically_relevant signal stimuli such as the chemical formaldehyde cholesterol derived taurocholic_acid and the serotonin ht receptor_agonist cisapride were predicted better than the conservation of the response between both species similarly the hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalyglycine the cytokine ccl the tlr activator polyic and the nerve_growth nt were effectively translated and predictable at a level comparable with the observed conservation of response s when based only on activation of protein_phosphorylation when we considered the overall prediction_performance for phosphorylation response and gene_set activation by all teams in sc and sc the antidepressant clomipramine and cytokine il b were better predicted than the levels of response conservation this observation indicates that teams were able to identify human specific signals that were not significantly present in the rat data we also found that predictions based on the two data generating platforms were not always in agreement as in the case of insulin which was well predicted based on protein_phosphorylation but not based on gene_set activation and vice_versa for nacl and b regarding the inference of biological_processes the gene_sets predicted better than species similarity and or best predicted were related to dna_synthesis cytoskeleton and ecm translation immune inflammation and growth_factor proliferation and supplementary the gene_sets associated with growth_factor proliferation processes shared a subset of core driver_genes belonging to the following signaling_pathways pi k ras raf mapk erk and creb when considering only gene_sets that were among the top best predicted and had at least member shared with at least other best predicted gene_sets both creb and akt genes were present in respectively and of gene_sets to note the empirical p values_calculated for their presence across gene_sets was not significant indicating that these genes are frequently present in gene_sets see this may be due to a central role of these genes in many biological_functions leading to a broad representation of those genes through c cp gene_sets at the protein level the activity of creb akt and map_kinases such as mapk and mp k was well translated based on protein_phosphorylation activation showing a consistency in similar pathway perturbation prediction at different layers of the cellular system it is interesting to note that the species similarity of mapk and mp k activation profile across stimuli was low whereas the activation of both proteins was well predicted the best predicted protein activity was that of ks b p s k this protein is activated upstream by pi_k protein_kinases and regulates downstream phosphorylation of p s protein which is directly involved in the translation process found to be among the top best predicted functions at the gene expression_level interestingly eif ebp and eif g factors involved in rate_limiting steps during the initiation_phase of protein_synthesis were identified as core driver_genes of translation related gene_sets and the p value associated to their presence across best predicted gene_sets was significant indicating that those genes were rarely shared with other genes sets and therefore were specific to this biological_function importantly eif g gene also belonged to core genes contributing to the enrichment of translation related gene_sets in rat cells suggesting a conserved role for this gene between human and rat species other proteins such as tf and ikba associated to the nfkb signaling_pathway showed good predictability in their activity in human cells this result was coherent with the observation of good predictability for immune_inflammatory related gene_sets except for some proteins such as mapk and mp k as mentioned above many proteins of our measured panel have a level of species similarity that positively correlated with the level of predictability this suggests that conserved responses at the protein levels possibly drive the translatability between both species in this cellular_context agreement in the biological_processes that are similar between rat and human extends to the results of sc for the insulin il r mapk creb and nfkb pathways see
