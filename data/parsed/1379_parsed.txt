genome_analysis differential_effects of chromatin regulators and transcription_factors on gene_regulation a nucleosomal perspective motivation chromatin regulators cr and transcription_factors tf are important transacting factors_regulating transcription process and many efforts have been devoted to understand their underlying_mechanisms in gene_regulation however the influences of cr and tf regulation effects on nucleosomes during transcription are still minimally understood and it remains to be determined the extent to which cr and tf regulatory effect shape the organization of nucleosomes in the genome in this article we attempted to address this problem and examine the patterns of cr and tf regulation effects from the nucleosome perspective results our results show that the cr and tf regulatory_effects exhibit different paradigms of transcriptional_control in saccharomyces_cerevisiae we grouped yeast genes into two categories cr sensitive genes and tf sensitive genes based on how their expression_profiles change upon deletion of crs or tfs we found that genes in these two groups have very different patterns of nucleosome_organization the promoters of cr sensitive genes tend to have higher nucleosome_occupancy whereas the promoters of tf sensitive genes are depleted of nucleosomes furthermore the nucleosome profiles of cr sensitive genes tend to show more dynamic_characteristics than tf sensitive genes these results reveal that the nucleosome organizations of yeast genes have a strong impact on their mode of regulation and there are differential regulation effects on nucleosomes between crs and tfs transcriptional_regulation in eukaryotic_cells is a very important and complicated process in the model_organism saccharomyces_cerevisiae this process involves a precise orchestration of complex molecular_events and is mediated by a series of regulators to create transcription factories such as transcription_factors tfs chromatin regulators crs and the general transcription_machinery with to whom correspondence should be addressed related regulators such as rna_polymerase molecules many studies have attempted to investigate the mechanisms of tfs and crs and how they work together to regulate the gene_transcription process kim and o in yeast the activation of tfs is usually affected by environmental_stimuli through signaling_pathways which further determines the level of mrna_abundance one common strategy is to use regulatory feedback_loops in which the tfs are embedded in the feedback_loops and tune gene_expression with the corresponding needs crs and tfs are often coupled together and jointly regulate the transcriptional state of specific genes some of the crs can utilize the energy of atp_hydrolysis to affect the interaction of histone and dna as a result of nucleosome delocalization such as histone sliding eviction or replacement this in turn affects the accessibility of tfs to their binding targets leading to transcriptional_activation or repression gene_transcription in the cell need to be tightly_regulated not only to optimize the expression_level at different physiological_conditions but also to provide the cells the capacity to quickly adjust genes expression_level in response to external signals and perturbations it has been recognized that in addition to regulation by tfs crs also play_important gene_expression the arrangements of nucleosomes along the dna_sequences are pivotal mechanism influencing gene_regulation a number of recent genome_wide in vivo and in vitro experiments have revealed some general principles that govern nucleosome_organization although it was considered that dna_sequence itself largely determines the mode of binding by nucleosomes this concept is still under debate for example it has been reported that the nucleosome_positioning can be the consequence of the regulatory_activities of trans_acting among these trans_acting tfs can compete with nucleosomes for accessing to the dna_sequences and crs can help to conduct chromatin assembly and organization leading to nucleosome arrays of uniform spacing such as iswi family page for example whitehouse andshowed that atpase isw acts to position nucleosomes over less favorable sequence_elements at the pot promoter about of isw regulated_genes genes were subject to detectable chromatin_remodeling compared with wild_type cells and the transcription of these genes can be initiated after isw is deleted in this study we analyzed the different effects of cr and tf regulations on nucleosomes e g nucleosome_positioning packing dynamics and histone activities we also described how nucleosomal effects can have an impact on gene_expression our results indicated that tfs and crs might have distinct strategies on the gene_regulation by influencing nucleosome_organization at the promoter_region
