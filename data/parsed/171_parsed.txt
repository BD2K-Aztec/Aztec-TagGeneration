a greedy graph_based algorithm for the alignment of multiple homologous gene_lists motivation many comparative_genomics studies rely on the correct identification of homologous genomic_regions using accurate alignment tools in such case the alphabet of the input_sequences consists of complete genes rather than nucleotides_or as optimal multiple_sequence is computationally impractical a progressive alignment strategy is often employed however such an approach is susceptible to the propagation of alignment errors in early pairwise_alignment steps especially when dealing with strongly diverged genomic_regions in this article we present a novel accurate and efficient greedy graph_based algorithm for the alignment of multiple homologous genomic_segments represented as ordered gene_lists results based on provable properties of the graph_structure several heuristics are developed to resolve local_alignment conflicts that occur due to gene_duplication and or rearrangement events on the different genomic_segments the performance of the algorithm is assessed by comparing the alignment results of homologous genomic_segments in arabidopsis_thaliana to those obtained by using both a progressive alignment_method and an earlier graph_based implementation especially for datasets that contain strongly diverged segments the proposed_method a substantially_higher alignment_accuracy and proves to be sufficiently fast for large_datasets including a few dozens of eukaryotic_genomes availability http bioinformatics psb ugent be software the algorithm is implemented as a part of the i adhore package in the past_decades considerable effort has been devoted to the development of algorithms for the alignment of biological_sequences at the nucleotide or amino_acid level using dynamic_programming techniques optimal pairwise global and local_alignments can be obtained in o l time where l denotes the length of the sequences a straightforward extension of these algorithms to n sequences results in a computational_complexity of o l n which renders the handling of sequences of realistic length impractical therefore most multiple_sequence msa tools are based on progressive alignment in which n sequences are aligned through n applications of a pairwise_alignment algorithm usually guided by a tree that determines the order in which the sequences are combined many msa tools that build on this principle have been implemented such as the well known programs clustal w t coffee muscle and mafft almost without exception msa tools target the alignment of amino_acid or nucleotide_sequences in this article we focus on the alignment of multiple mutually homologous i e derived from a common_ancestor genomic_segments represented as gene_lists this means that the alphabet of the input_sequences consists of individual genes rather than nucleotides_or similarly to msa at the nucleotide or amino_acid level the goal is to align homologous_genes i e place genes that belong to the same gene_family in the same column the homology relationships between the individual genes have been established in a preprocessing_step using sequence_similarity and protein clustering whereas ancestral gene_order reconstruction see e g starts from homologous genomic_segments to infer ancestral_genome states and quantify genome dynamics the objective of our graph based_approach is to create accurate alignments of homologous segments in order to facilitate the detection of additional homologous genomic_segments the multiple_sequence of gene_lists differs_significantly from the alignment of sequences at the nucleotide or amino_acid level first the size of the alphabet of different nucleotides_or is much smaller than the typical number of different gene_families that occur in the genome of an organism this means that a certain gene only has a very limited number of homologous_genes in other gene_lists second through evolution nucleotide_and mainly undergo character substitutions whereas chromosomes mainly undergo gene loss insertion inversion and other types of rearrangements e g reciprocal_translocation these two major differences allow for the development of a graph_based alignment approach which will be demonstrated to have a higher accuracy than a progressive approach in terms of the number of correctly aligned homologous_genes we propose an algorithm similar to the so_called segment based alignment approach that is used in e g dialign the first step in dialign consists of the identification of corresponding gap free local_alignments or fragments between pairs of sequences the alignment of some of these fragments can prohibit the alignment of others finding the largest weighted subset of fragments that can be incorporated into a multiple_alignment is a difficult_task often referred to as the consistency problem in the context of the gene_list alignment problem the fragments correspond to homologous_genes the consistency problem then is to find the maximal number of homologous_genes that can be included in a multiple_alignment optimal_solution methods to this consistency problem exist but are np_hard and therefore in general computationally impractical here fast heuristic methods are developed to remove inconsistent or conflicting homology relationships between genes from a graph_theoretic perspective similar ideas have been developed by the proposed alignment algorithm is part of the iterative automatic_detection of homologous regions i adhore software a map based method to detect homologous genomic_segments within or between the genomes of related organisms rather than identifying primary sequence_similarity map based_methods look for statistically_significant conservation of gene content and gene_order collinearity one of the key features of i adhore is the capability to uncover segmental homology even between highly diverged segments when two homologous segments have been identified a so_called profile is constructed by aligning both segments hence combining the gene_order and content of both homologous segments this genomic profile can then be used by i adhore as a more sensitive probe to scan the genome in order to identify additional homologous segments this iterative process of alignment and detection continues until no additional statistically_significant genomic_segments can be found it is clear that a high_quality alignment of the homologous gene_lists within a profile is imperative for a sensitive detection of additional homologous genomic_segments within the i adhore software the original i adhore implementation relied on profile construction using a progressive application of the needlemanwunsch pnw aligner especially when dealing with strongly diverged segments one of the biggest problems with the pnw method is that erroneous alignment decisions in early pairwise steps propagate to the final alignment causing the alignment_quality to degrade significantly when more segments are added this problem was already partially addressed in i adhore through the introduction of a greedy graphbased gg aligner rather than relying on a progressive adding of segments the gg aligner considers the n segments simultaneously although this gg aligner has its merits compared with the pnw aligner e g it avoids the once a gap always a gap problem it was unable to outperform the latter in terms of the number of correctly aligned genes this article introduces a new greedy graph_based algorithm called gg that builds on the original gg aligner first the basic graphbased alignment algorithm will be explained followed by the development of a heuristic to resolve consistency problems in this graph so_called conflicts in later sections we demonstrate that the new gg aligner outperforms both the pnw method and the original gg aligner in terms of alignment_accuracy the new gg aligner has been implemented in the latest version of i adhore and its c source_code can be downloaded for academic purposes http bioinformatics psb ugent be software we have developed a greedy graph_based algorithm for the alignment of multiple homologous gene_lists several properties of conflicts within the alignment graph have been derived and proved three heuristics for conflict_resolution were developed on these theoretical grounds and have been demonstrated to be able to outperform an older graph_based algorithm and a progressive approach in terms of alignment_accuracy as is often the case a tradeoff between computational requirements and alignment_accuracy can be observed the algorithm has been implemented in the latest_version of i adhore
