structural_bioinformatics structural analysis of the hot_spots in the binding between h n ha and the d antibody do mutations of h n from to affect much on this binding motivation worldwide and substantial mortality caused by the h n influenza a has stimulated a new surge of research on h n viruses an epitope conservation has been learned in the ha protein that allows antibodies to cross neutralize both and h n however few works have thoroughly studied the binding hot_spots in those two antigenantibody interfaces which are responsible for the antibody cross neutralization results we apply predictive methods to identify binding hot_spots at the epitope sites of the ha proteins and at the paratope sites of the d antibody we find that the six mutations at the ha s epitope from to should not harm its binding to d instead the change of binding_free on the whole exhibits an increased tendency after these mutations making the binding stronger this is consistent with the observation that the h n neutralizing_antibody can cross react with h n we identified three distinguished hot_spot including lys common between the two epitopes these common hot_spots again can explain why d cross reacted we believe that these hot_spot are mutation candidates which may help h n viruses to evade the immune system we also identified eight residues at the paratope site of d five from its heavy_chain and three from its light_chain that are predicted to be energetically important in the ha recognition the identification of these hot_spot and their structural analysis are potentially useful to fight against h n viruses the h n influenza a caused two notable pandemics with substantial mortality in and fortunately it has been to whom correspondence should be addressed found that some antibodies can work against the hemagglutinin ha proteins in these two pandemics ha is a homotrimeric glycoprotein ha monomers are synthesized as precursors that are then cleaved into two proteins ha and ha which form the major surface proteins of influenza a viruses the infection is started by the binding of ha proteins to the sialic_acid containing receptors of target cells and by fusing the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane of the target cells the viral_genome enters and infects the target cells after the binding so inhibiting this binding by antibodies is an important way against flu previous_works have learned that there is an epitope binding_site conservation that exists between the and h n ha proteins such epitope conservation enables the older_population to avoid infection from h n because their pre_existing immunity against h n can neutralize the h n ha proteins thus studies on these antibodyha binding interfaces are crucial to understand how the antibodies recognize the antigens however there are few studies on the energetic importance of the binding residues in the ha protein in complex with the d antibody we apply predictive and comparative_methods to examine the interfaces between the d antibody and the ha proteins of and h n and to investigate an assumed d binding to the seasonal influenza_virus a brisbane to understand why d did not bind to the strain this d antibody is a monoclonal_antibody from a survivor of the spanish influenza which is believed to bind to ha s in both of and h n of particular interests we identify binding hot_spot from the above_mentioned two antibodyantigen interfaces a binding hot_spot is a small fraction of interfacial residues that contribute most to binding_free their mutationse g alanine mutationscan reduce binding_affinity remarkably we address the problems whether the interfacial mutations from h n s ha to s are hot_spot and whether these mutations make the binding stronger with d we explain how the computational_methods find those antigenic residues that are energetically important in the antibody_binding such as asn lys and lys these three hot_spot are actually common between the and epitopes of ha their mutations may make the d antibody_binding ineffective the sequence_alignment among ha ha and ha is shown in there are a total of six interfacial mutations between ha and ha namely e d t n s n v i n d and t k the structural_alignment of ha and ha between their interfacial segments is shown inwhere the structural matchbased on the cs of these interfacial residueshas an rmsd of previous_works have reported that protein_sequences with identity or above in crystallographic models can differ by rmsd while proteins in nmr models can have even larger deviations in some cases sequences with identity can also have an interface rmsd up to thus the small rmsd suggests that the interfacial segments of the two ha proteins have a very good match this indicates that the mutations from ha to ha resulted in little structural_change at the binding_site and that thepage computationally produced binding structure of ha and the d antibody may not have any big deviation from the real one we have done a structural analysis on the interfaces between the d antibody and the ha proteins of h n and h n the cross neutralization of this antibody is clearly demonstrated by the hot_spot common in the two binding interfaces our comprehensive investigation suggests that there are six outstanding epitope residues whose mutations will help h n evade capture by this antibody we further pinpointed the hot_spot at the paratope site of the d antibody which are responsible for the antigen_recognition the understanding of these hot_spot can potentially
