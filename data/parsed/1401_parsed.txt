sequence_analysis discovering chimeric_transcripts in paired_end rna_seq by using ericscript motivation the discovery of novel gene_fusions can lead to a better comprehension of cancer_progression and development the emergence of deep_sequencing of trancriptome known as rna_seq has opened many opportunities for the identification of this class of gen_omic alterations leading to the discovery of novel chimeric_transcripts in melanomas breast_cancers and lymphomas nowadays few computational_approaches have been developed for the detection of chi meric transcripts although all of these computational_methods show good sensitivity much work remains to reduce the huge number of false_positive calls that arises from this analysis results we proposed a novel computational framework named chimeric transcript detection algorithm ericscript for the identification of gene_fusion products in paired_end rna_seq our simulation_study on synthetic data demonstrates that ericscript enables to achieve_higher sensitivity_and than existing_methods with noticeably lower running_times we also applied our method to publicly_available rna_seq tumour datasets and we showed its capability in rediscovering known gene_fusions availability the ericscript package is freely_available under gpl v license at http ericscript sourceforge net the identification of genomic_rearrangements in cancer research plays a main role to investigate causes and development of the disease gene_fusions are common alterations in which two genes are fused leading to the production of a chimeric transcript that may have a new or altered activity gene_fusions are well known mechanisms for oncogene_activation in leukaemias lymphomas and sarcomas but recent_studies found novel chimeric_transcripts also in common epithelial_cancers such as prostate_cancers and nonsmall_cell the past_few have seen the emergence of several high_throughput that enable to sequence hundreds of millions of short_sequences reads simultaneously and have routinely being applied to genome epigenome and transcriptome_studies the sequencing of trancriptome known as rna_seq has been widely used for the study of abundance estimation rna_editing identification of novel transcripts and splicing variants detection proposed a new methodology to comprehensively catalogue functional gene_fusions in cancer by using paired_end pe transcriptome sequencing_data the basic idea behind their approach was the identification of paired_reads mapping against different genes discordant alignments following this original approach several studies for the detection of gene_fusions have been carried_out found non ets gene_fusions in human prostate_cancer identified novel melanoma gene_fusions produced by underlying genomic_rearrangements and novel readthrough transcripts detected novel and previously known fusion_genes in breast cancer_cells andfound highly_expressed gene_fusion involving the major_histocompatibility transactivator ciita in km h cells at present several computational_approaches have been developed for the detection of chimeric_transcripts in rna_seq fusionseq identifies gene_fusions by means of a two step analysis identification of potential fusions based on pe mapping and the application of a sophisticated filtration cascade to filter out analysis artifacts defuse is a software_package that uses clusters of discordant paired_end alignments to perform a split read_alignment analysis for finding fusion boundaries chimerascan is a tool that implements the original computational methodology followed by fusionmap is able to search for gene_fusion products in both single_end and paired_end by using seed reads tophat fusion implements several changes to the tophat aligner all designed to enable the discovery of fusion_transcripts shortfuse detects chimeric_transcripts rna_seq by using both to whom correspondence should be addressed unique and ambiguously mapping read_pairs although all of these computational_methods show good sensitivity in discovering chimeric transcript events much work remains to reduce the huge number of false_positive that arises from this kind of analysis here we present a novel computational_method named ericscript chimeric transcript detection algorithm for the detection of chimeric_transcripts in pe rna_seq the novelty of our approach consists in an efficient recalibration process of the exon junction reference that enables to increase sensitivity_and and to reduce running_times moreover we introduce a set of scores that enable to distinguish with high_precision between true chimeric_transcripts and false_positive events and reduce the large amount of calls generated from data analyses to evaluate the performance of ericscript we generated synthetic datasets of different read_length simulating different levels of coverage and we compared it with other four state of the art algorithms the synthetic datasets were also used to train an adaptive boosting adaboost classifier to rank analysis results we implemented the procedure that we used to simulate gene_fusions in the ericscript package our simulation_study demonstrates that ericscript enables to achieve_higher sensitivity_and than existing_methods with noticeably lower running_times we also applied our method to publicly_available pe rna_seq tumour dataset and we showed its capability in rediscovering known gene_fusions
