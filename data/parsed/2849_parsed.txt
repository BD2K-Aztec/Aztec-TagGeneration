data_and medpie an information_extraction package for medical message board posts we have developed medpie a software_package for preparing medical message board corpora and extracting patient mentions and statistics for drugs herbs and adverse_effects experienced from them the package is divided_into web crawling html cleaning de identification and information_extraction modules it also includes a sample controlled_vocabulary of drugs herbs and adverse_effect terms medical message boards mmbs are sites where patients with similar conditions seek and exchange information by posting messages to threads collections of messages with similar topics mmbs can contain a very large number of posts e g over a million messages on http www breastcancer org are often freely_available and contain patient opinions and experiences that would be potentially useful to clinicians and researchers however due to the large number of messages in many mmbs reviewing each message by hand would be prohibitively slow in addition mmb text frequently contains spelling and grammatical errors that may hinder relevant medical_information from being automatically extracted as well as personal identifiers such as mmb users phone numbers e mail address and personal names that should be removed before using these data for research in order to overcome these hurdles we present medpie a software_package that can be used to generate a de identified corpus of mmb posts and then extract information from it although researchers have examined message boards and other online communities they do not generally make their framework available to others we have found medpie useful as a first stage in collecting and analyzing mmbs and believe it could facilitate further research of online communities such as mmbs to whom correspondence should be addressed
