sequence_analysis reditools high_throughput rna_editing detection made easy the reliable_detection of rna_editing from massive sequencing_data remains_challenging and although several methodol ogies have been proposed no computational_tools have been released to date here we introduce reditools a suite of python scripts to perform high_throughput investigation of rna_editing using next_generation data availability_and reditools are in python programming_language and freely_available atrna editing is an important post_transcriptional mechanism that alters primary rnas through the insertion_deletion or modification of specific nucleotides it occurs in a wide_range of organisms and concurrently with alternative_splicing increases the diversity of eukaryotic transcriptomes and proteomes in humans rna_editing affects both coding and non coding transcripts by the deamination of cytosine to uridine c to u or more commonly through the conversion of adenosine to inosine a to i by members of adenosine_deaminase adar family of enzymes which act on double_stranded dsrna editing events can lead to a variety of biological_effects depending on the rna type mrna or ncrna or region utr utr cds intron involved in the rna_editing modification for example changes in utrs can lead to altered expression preventing efficient ribosome binding or recognition by small_regulatory whereas alterations in coding protein regions can induce amino_acid with variable functional consequences in addition rna_editing can influence the activity of ncrnas such as sirnas mirnas and potentially of piwirnas by affecting base_pairing interactions within rna_secondary the importance of rna_editing is underlined by the fact that its deregulation in humans is associated with a variety of neurological or neurodegenerative_disorders and cancer although the identification of sites subject to rna_editing is simple in principle requiring the direct comparison between transcripts and their corresponding genomic_loci of origin accurate genome_wide implementation remains_a few years_ago we published the first attempt to use massive transcriptome_sequencing rna_seq for exploring the rna_editing landscape in mitochondria of grapevine since then rna_seq has become the de facto standard approach to study rna_editing potential in whole eukaryotic_genomes with sometimes questionable results the major_challenge in identifying rna_editing changes by rna_seq is the discrimination of true rna_editing from genome encoded snps and technical artefacts caused by sequencing or read_mapping errors the use of dnaseq data from single individuals annotations in dbsnps and several stringent filters can minimize the detection of false rna_editing although several methodologies to reveal the rna_editing potential in eukaryotic transcriptomes have been proposed no comprehensive software devoted to this aim has been released in the meantime massive transcriptome sequencing_data are routinely produced worldwide and a large number of experiments from different organisms and conditions are freely_available through specialized databases such as the short_read archive at ncbi to promote the investigation of rna_editing at large_scale in the next_generation era we developed the package reditoolscomprising of a suite of scripts written in the portable python language reditools are available under the mit_license at http code google com p reditools are not organism oriented and work with rna_seq and dna_seq data from any sequencing_platform
