gene_expression identifying multi_layer gene regulatory_modules from multi_dimensional genomic_data motivation eukaryotic gene_expression ge is subjected to precisely coordinated multi_layer controls across the levels of epigenetic transcriptional_and regulations recently the emerging multi_dimensional genomic dataset has provided unprecedented_opportunities to study the cross layer regulatory interplay in these datasets the same set of samples is profiled on several layers of genomic activities e g copy_number cnv dna_methylation dm ge and microrna expression me however suitable analysis methods for such data are currently sparse results in this article we introduced a sparse multi block partial_least smbpls regression_method to identify multi_dimensional regulatory_modules from this new type of data a multi_dimensional regulatory module contains sets of regulatory_factors from different layers that are likely to jointly contribute to a local gene_expression factory we demonstrated the performance of our method on the simulated_data as well as on the cancer genomic atlas ovarian_cancer datasets including the cnv dm me and ge data measured on samples we showed that majority of identified modules have significant functional and transcriptional enrichment higher than that observed in modules identified using only a single type of genomic_data our network_analysis of the modules revealed that the cnv dm and microrna can have coupled impact on expression of important oncogenes_and availability_and the source_code implemented by matlab is freely_available at http zhoulab usc edu smbpls eukaryotic gene_expression ge is a complex process controlled at multiple levels including epigenetic transcriptional_and dynamic and precise coordination of these regulatory_processes is essential to maximize the efficiency and specificity in ge recent_studies support the view that rather than a simple step_by production line the ge machine is governed by multiple complex and extensively coupled networks the development of high_throughput has enabled researchers to obtain a global view of gene_regulation microarray and sequencing_technologies can not only measure genome_wide ge levels but also profile dna_modifications e g cnv epigenetic_regulation e g dna methylationand histone_modifications and post_transcriptional e g microrna expression however most genome_wide studies have been restricted to only one aspect of regulation such as studies based on ge profiles recently a new type of large_scale multi_dimensional genomic dataset has been gaining in popularity in these datasets the same set of samples is profiled on several layers of genomic activity e g cnv dm ge and me the cancer genomic atlas tcga project and the nci project provide this type of comprehensive genomic characterization for a cohort of cancer samples and cancer_cell respectively multi_dimensional datasets provide unprecedented_opportunities to discover connections between the different layers of ge regulation the emerging large_scale multi_dimensional genomic_data calls for novel computational_methods in fact as the cost of sequencing falls multi_dimensional characterization of samples will soon become standard practice however suitable analysis methods are currently sparse in particular since the different types of genomic_data have different scales and units we cannot simply aggregate them for analysis previous relevant effort has mostly focused on two_dimensional genomic_datasets for example various eqtl methods can jointly analyze single_nucleotide snp and ge data to identify regulatory snps multivariate_regression can correlate ge and transcription_factor tf_binding data to associate tfs with their target_genes and the ping_pong algorithm integrates ge and drugresponse data recently several methods have been developed to analyze genomic_datasets with more than two dimensions for example the multivariate_model developed byand the sparse regression_method proposed by both can learn multi_dimensional genomic to whom correspondence should be addressed to assess the performance of smbpls we first applied the smbpls to a variety of simulated_data generated with various complexities we then applied smbpls to the multi_dimensional tcga ovarian_cancer data to gain insights into the multi_layer coordination of ge regulations to reveal the advantages of smbpls we also compared our methods to several competing_methods including mbpls sparse pls and biclustering methods
