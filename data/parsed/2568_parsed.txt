i pv a circos module for interactive protein_sequence visualization todays genome_browsers and protein databanks supply vast_amounts of information about proteins the challenge is to concisely bring together this information in an interactive and easy to generate format availability_and we have developed an interactive circos module called i pv to visualize user supplied protein_sequence conservation and snv data in a live presentable format i pv can be downloaded from http www itodays genome_browsers and protein databanks supply vast amount of information about both the structural annotation and the single_nucleotide snv in genes the challenge is to concisely bring together this information in an interactive and easy to generate format several freeware and commercial visualization_tools are available nowadays circos is one of these tools which is largely adopted and utilized in the field of genomics it generates clear and human_readable data visualization in a circular layout moreover due to its circular layout it has a much higher compression_rate of space required per datum compared to classic rectangular representations however images generated in circos are static and requires a specific input file_format we have developed an interactive circos module called i pv to visualize user supplied protein_sequence conservation and snv data while significantly easing and automating input_file requirements and generation all elements rendered in i pv are interactive with mouse over explanations and clickable buttons it allows selective display hiding of amino_acid snv conservation and amino_acid this may be very beneficial for having novel insights into ones protein of interest poi and convey the information efficiently for researchers i pv can be downloaded from http www i pv org in this article we demonstrate the graphs generated by i pv for brca calr and tuba a brca nm np is a dna repairing protein that plays role in type i breast_cancer in supplementary the outermost track shows reported snvs from dbsnp http www ncbi nlm nih gov snp users can click on the automatically generated links to the dbsnp website to have more information about these snvs to have an overview of the distribution of snvs and indels users can refer to the innermost track calr is a protein nm np which is mutated in myeloproliferative_neoplasms supplementaryshows a partial screen shot of calr with the minimum and maximum range of conservation scores dynamically adjusted and plotted so that even when alignments from closely_related are used small differences in conservation scores can be observed supplementaryshows the functionally_important c terminal region of calr tuba a is a protein nm np that if mutated can lead to type i lissencephaly supplementaryshows a partial screen shot of tuba a and the highly_conserved gtp_binding region amongst the species this region is enriched in glycine serine and threonine residues sequence track colored letters with few surrounding amino_acids with aromatic side_chains green hexagons it is often necessary to know the distributions of different amino_acids along a protein of interest for instance you may want to see distribution of specific amino_acid s against some other set of user_defined amino_acid s moreover users can choose to display the amino_acid information with window sizes varying from to residues all data_points belonging to these windows are highlighted with values upon mouse over events in addition to amino_acid distributions in case of single amino_acid comparisons a blosum agreement graph is also shown telling the user if the current distribution is in agreement with the matrix score of that amino_acid pair supplementaryillustrates such example taken from tuba a i pv also comes with tools to extract sequence conservation specific features user selected amino_acids with different properties and snvs between user_defined regions in a formatted text layout with user_defined number of items per line feature_extraction is done simply by clicking on the conservation track and selecting the extract option many sequence visualization_tools focus on certain aspects of proteins such as conservation variations sequence_alignments or topology for instance i coms focus on multiple_sequence and recruits links with outer tracks likewise circoletto parses blast results and visualizes sequence_similarity with interactivity at the level of web_server another software_package ggbio implements circular visualization for genomics and high_throughput data using r programming_language following a different approach rcircos directly integrates circos into r for d plots although more flexible than ipv both tools are limited in providing user_interaction while all aforementioned tools are very useful in their own right we pursued a more interactivity based design therefore i pv is not solely designed for visualization but also for live presentable graphs and information that can selectively be displayed and customized i pv combines major sources of information under one html file that is easy to generate and share on both desktop and mobile environments some visualization_tools come with mouse over or on click explanations however since they are based on image files there are limited userdriven changes that can be performed on the image due to the same reason images from many sequence visualization_tools are limited in diversity whereas in i pv the user can entirely customize the image since she he is in charge of the input_files even after output generation i pv does not use an image map like most conventional visualization_tools rather it links data to scalable_vector svg elements which makes sequence and feature_extraction possible with a few mouse clicks the software_packages that are used in the making of i pv have their own active community such as circos and d which also makes i pv a live framework where new features can be added last but not least many visualization_tools are based on rectangular scroll based representation of information which does not deliver a wide_angle view of the sequence_data unlike circular visualization however as like all other types of visualizations there are also limitations for circular graphs when it comes to conveniently zoom in to a particular region or visually align tracks with different radii we intend to further develop this software with several other features based on end_user needs the current version of i pv can be downloaded from
