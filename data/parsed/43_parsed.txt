structural_bioinformatics accounting for pairwise distance_restraints in fft based protein protein_docking cluspro is a heavily used proteinprotein_docking server based on the fast_fourier fft correlation approach while fft enables global docking accounting for pairwise distance_restraints using penalty terms in the scoring_function is computationally_expensive we use a different approach and directly select low_energy solutions that also satisfy the given restraints as expected accounting for restraints generally improves the rank of near native predictions while retaining or even improving the numerical efficiency of fft based docking availability_and the software is freely_available as part of the cluspro web_based server at http cluspro org the fast_fourier fft correlation approach has proved to be very useful for macromolecular docking the major advantage of the method is the extremely fast evaluation of scoring_functions enabling global systematic sampling of the entire conformational_space defined by the relative orientations of two molecules although the scoring_function must be expressed as a sum of correlation_functions it is possible to represent complex energy_functions based on molecular_mechanics and including solvation terms in a form suitable for fft fft based_methods such as zdock gramm piper dot and dock pierr consistently perform well both as protocols of individual groups and as automatic servers in particular during the latest rounds of the blind protein_docking experiment capri performance of our docking server cluspro based on the piper program was comparable with top human predictor groups the server is heavily used by december the cluspro website registered over unique user ips and completed almost docking_calculations currently adding about per month models_built by the server have been reported in over publications in spite of the significant progress docking generally needs to be complemented by experimental_validation the main_reason is that the current scoring_functions are not accurate enough for finding the best models among the ones generated by the sampling thus additional information can be very useful for improving the reliability of structure_determination accordingly cluspro has the option to apply extra attraction terms to residues that are a priori known to be in the interface conversely repulsion terms are applied to residues that are not expected to be in the interface however what cluspro was lacking so_far was the ability to define distance_restraints between pairs of atoms or residues such restraints can be derived e g from nmr nuclear_overhauser noe experiments or by chemical crosslinking the use of restraints is central to the popular high ambiguity driven biomolecular docking haddock server which incorporates the interaction restraints into the scoring_function to guide the search toward regions of the conformational_space in which the restraints are satisfied while the extra terms in the scoring_function due to the restraints do not significantly increase the computational_burden if the sampling is based on monte_carlo or molecular_dynamics algorithms a similar approach is very costly when used with fft based sampling the problem is that each pairwise restraint in the scoring_function requires a new correlation_function term and thus an additional fourier_transform thereby reducing the numerical efficiency of the method thus it is not surprising that none of the successful fftbased docking programs has the option of accounting for pairwise restraints however since fft performs global sampling there is no need for guiding the search toward feasible regions based on this observation we solve the problem by directly selecting low_energy solutions that also satisfy the restraints as will be shown this implies that frequently only portions of conformational_space needs to be examined and hence the computational efforts can actually be reduced a further advantage is that the scoring_function is not affected and thus we retain the favorable_properties of the cluspro server validated in many rounds of the capri docking experiment we demonstrate the method using both simulated and experimentally_determined distance_restraints
