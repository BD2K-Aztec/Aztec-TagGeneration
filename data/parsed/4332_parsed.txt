somp web_server for in silico prediction of sites of metabolism for drug like compounds a new freely_available web_server site of metabolism predictor to predict the sites of metabolism som based on the structural formula of chemicals has been developed it is based on the analyses of structure som relationships using a bayesian_approach and labelled multilevel neighbourhoods of atoms descriptors to represent the structures of over metabolized xenobiotics the server allows predicting soms that are catalysed by a c c d and a isoforms of cytochrome_p and enzymes of the udp glucuronosyl transferase family the average invariant accuracy of prediction that was calculated for the training_sets using leave_one and evaluation sets is and respectively availability_and freely_available on the web atdrug metabolism affects the drug efficiency and toxicity and is divided_into phase i oxidation hydrolysis reduction and phase_ii conjugation reactions cytochromes p cyp are the main enzymes of phase i which metabolize most drugs glucuronidation is the main reaction of phase_ii which is catalysed by udp_glucuronosyltransferase ugt and serves as a clearance mechanism for drugs from many therapeutic_classes prediction of the sites of metabolism som is important during the drug_discovery to detect possible metabolic hot_spots in lead_compounds that can be modified to obtain more metabolically stable compounds the som prediction can be used for an integral estimation of activity and toxicity of a compound including its possible metabolites there are two freely_available web_servers which allow predicting soms for xenobiotics that are metabolized by p isoenzymes smartcyp predicts soms for compounds that are metabolized by cyp c and cyp d and rs webpredictor predicts soms for nine cyp isoforms a a b c c c d e a we have previously_developed a method to predict soms by using only structural formulae which distinguishes from traditional som predicting methods that use molecular_docking and molecular_dynamics or quantum_mechanical and semi_empirical calculations the detailed_description of the algorithm was published and shown in the supplementary text s in this article we highlight the extension ofour method and show a new freely_available web_server for som prediction for five major_isoforms of p and ugt
