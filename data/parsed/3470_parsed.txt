payao a community platform for sbml pathway model curation payao is a community_based collaborative web_service platform for gene regulatory and biochemical_pathway model curation the system combines web technologies and online model visualization functions to enable a collaborative community to annotate and curate biological_models payao reads the models in systems_biology format displays them with celldesigner a process diagram editor which complies with the systems_biology and provides an interface for model enrichment adding tags and comments to the models for the access controlled community_members availability_and freely_available for model curation service at http www payaologue org web_site implemented in seaser framework with s flex mysql and tomcat with all_major creating an extensive model of gene regulatory and biochemical_networks with the latest data is a painstaking task curation is essential to creating an accurate model yet as science and technology advances rapidly once curated models soon become out of date and need to be revised constantly many pathways and networks are now available online via pathway_databases such as reactome biomodels net panther pathways and many pathway editors are available what is needed is a framework to facilitate tracking and update mechanism for modelers and researchers in the community to contribute to the collaborative model_building and curation process wikipathways is an effort for such a collaborative platform in the wiki style while the wiki system has its strength in collaborative editing and version tracking it does not provide access control or explicit community tagging mechanisms in a community driven model enrichment environment it is effective to differentiate privileges to special interest group sig members for curation activitiescommenting on existing tags adding tags to models annotating individual component inside a model and validating the annotations in view of the complexity of biological_pathways and the expertise of biologists in different areas to whom correspondence should be addressed a community platform for biology requires an exquisite balance of federated resource sharing and quality_control of information by a sig of experts in the particular pathway or process an access control privilege system allows the community to share and disseminate the knowledge while enabling a dedicated sig to maintain high_quality curated information to provide such a curation framework we have developed a system called payao the system is named after a fish aggregating device an artificial floating raft where fish congregate and popular in okinawa philippine area payao aims to become a biological_knowledge aggregating system which enable a community to work on the same models simultaneously insert tags as pop up balloon to the parts of the model exchange comments record the discussions and eventually update the models accurately and concurrently the current workflow for pathway curation has two phases working in a cyclical manner as shown in pathway editing using biological_pathway editors celldesigner and communitydriven pathway enrichment and knowledge sharing payao serves for enrichment phase of the curation payao is a web_based providing an interface for adding tags and comments to the components such as species reactions and specified area of the model as well as community management functionality the information on the users and tag data is stored in a relational_database rdbms on the server payao adopts community standards accepting systems_biology sbml format models and displays them in systems_biology compliant celldesigner graphical notation curation data on payao can be easily reintegrated into the original model via celldesigner page
