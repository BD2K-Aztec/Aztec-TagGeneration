gene_expression a signal noise model for significance analysis of chip_seq with negative control motivation chip_seq is becoming the main approach to the genome_wide study of proteindna_interactions and histone_modifications existing informatics tools perform well to extract strong chip enriched_sites however two questions remain to be answered i to which extent is a chip_seq experiment able to reveal the weak chip enriched_sites ii are the weak sites biologically_meaningful to answer_these it is necessary to identify the weak chip signals from background_noise results we propose a linear signalnoise model in which a noise rate was introduced to represent the fraction of noise in a chip library we developed an iterative algorithm to estimate the noise rate using a control library and derived a library swapping strategy for the false_discovery estimation these approaches were integrated in a general_purpose framework named ccat control based chip_seq analysis tool for the significance analysis of chip_seq applications to h_k and h_k datasets showed that ccat predicted significantly more chip enriched_sites that the previous methods did with the high_sensitivity of ccat prediction we revealed distinct chromatin features associated to the strong and weak h_k sites with the advances of ultra high_throughput in the past_years chip_seq is becoming the main approach to the genome_wide study of proteindna_interactions and histone_modifications in chip_seq analysis the biologically_interesting sites are identified by searching for the genomic_loci where the reads sequenced from chip dna are over represented a number of chip_seq analysis tools have been developed for this purpose to whom correspondence should be addressed all these tools perform well to extract strong chip enriched_sites however two questions remain to be answered i to which extent is a chip_seq experiment able to reveal the weak chip enriched_sites ii are the weak sites biologically_meaningful to answer_these it is necessary to establish a signalnoise model to separate the weak chip signals from background_noise in a chip_seq experiment majority of the unbound dna_fragments are washed out in the immune precipitation procedure the chip processed library is enriched by the fragments pulled down from the genomic_loci with high chance of proteindna_interactions or histone_modifications however considerable nonuseful fragments remain in the library due to the random protein dna or antibodydna contacts that are not position specific reads sequenced from these fragments are widely spread in the genome and are considered background_noise in addition to the real signal of chip enrichment in early chip_seq application without a negative control distribution of the noise was assumed to be uniform however recent_studies showed that the uniform model is too ideal due to the existence of sequencing and mapping biases chromatin_structure and genome copy_number adjustment of these intrinsic biases requires a negative control which could be generated using non specific_antibody or input dna to utilize a negative control in chip_seq analysis suggested normalizing the control to a level equivalent to the background_noise of the chip library they incorporated the normalization factor into the bernoulli probability of a binomial_distribution for statistical_test and computed false_discovery fdr by p value correction we extended their idea to a linear signalnoise model in which a noise rate was introduced to represent the fraction of noise in the chip library we developed an iterative algorithm to estimate the noise rate using a control library and derived a library swapping strategy for the fdr_estimation with spike in simulation datasets we showed the proposed iterative algorithm can well estimate the noise rate with relative_error under practical sequencing_depth moreover spike in simulation also indicated that the library swapping approach outperformed the p value correction_method in fdr_estimation we integrated our approaches in a general_purpose framework named ccat control based chip_seq analysis tool for the significance analysis of chip_seq the ccat framework waspage the goal of the research work presented in this article is to investigate the extent to which the weak chip signals are detectable in a chip_seq experiment for this purpose we proposed a linear signalnoise model for chip_seq analysis with negative control the noise rate defined in the model provides a measurement of the data_quality which determines the capability of chip_seq to detect weak chip enriched_sites we developed an iterative algorithm to estimate the noise rate using control library and derived a library swapping approach for fdr_estimation the performance of the proposed approaches was demonstrated with spike in datasets these approaches integrated in the ccat framework were further applied to h_k and h_k datasets and identified significantly more weak sites than previous predictions two reasons count for the improvement of sensitivity first the estimation of noise page
