redemption reduced dimension ensemble modeling and parameter_estimation here we present redemption reduced dimension ensemble modeling and parameter_estimation a toolbox for parameter_estimation and ensemble modeling of ordinary_differential odes using time series data for models with more reactions than measured species a common scenario in biological modeling the parameter_estimation is formulated as a nested optimization_problem based on incremental parameter_estimation strategy redemption also includes a tool for the identification of an ensemble of parameter combinations that provide_satisfactory goodness_of to the data the functionalities of redemption are accessible through a matlab user_interface ui as well as through programming script for computational speed up redemption provides a numerical parallelization option using matlab parallel_computing toolbox availability_and redemption can be downloaded from http www cabsel ethz ch tools redemption mathematical_modeling plays_an in understanding and predicting biological_phenomena in this regard ordinary_differential ode_models are often created to describe the dynamic_behavior of biological_systems based on mass or molar conservation as follow dxt dt svxt p x x where t denotes time xt is the species concentration vector s is the stoichiometric or connectivity matrix vxt p is the reaction rate or flux equation vector p denotes the kinetic parameter vector and x denotes the initial concentration vector the estimation of unknown kinetic_parameters from time series data is the most challenging step in the creation of such biological_models due to i high_computational associated with global optimizations and with integrating odes and ii the lack of parameter identifiability the high_computational could be addressed by performing the parameter_estimation incrementally here time series data are first smoothened and differentiated and subsequently the dynamic flux_values are computed by viewing equation as an algebraic equation the parameters are estimated one flux at a time while avoiding ode integrations however such an approach_requires that s has a full column rank which is often not satisfied in the modeling of biological_systems we recently_developed incremental parameter_estimation ipe and integrated flux parameter_estimation ifpe to address the limitation related to the matrix s in ipe ifpe we formulated the parameter_estimation as a nested optimization where the outer optimization was performed over a subset of parameters corresponding to the independent integrated fluxes defined such that given their values the remaining integrated fluxes could be estimated from the slope of time series data the inner optimizations involved estimating v c the author published_by
