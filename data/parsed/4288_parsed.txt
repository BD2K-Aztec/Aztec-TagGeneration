databases_and slims a user_friendly sample operations and inventory management system for genotyping labs we present the sample based laboratory_information slims a powerful and user_friendly open_source web_application that provides all members of a laboratory with an interface to view edit and create sample information slims aims to simplify common laboratory tasks with tools such as a user_friendly shopping cart for subjects samples and containers that easily generates reports shareable lists and plate designs for genotyping further key features include customizable data views database change logging and dynamically filled pre formatted reports along with being feature rich slims power comes from being able to handle longitudinal data from multiple time points and biological_sources this type of data is increasingly common from studies searching for susceptibility_genes for common complex_diseases that collect thousands of samples generating millions of genotypes and overwhelming amounts of data limss provide an efficient way to deal with this data while increasing accessibility and reducing laboratory errors however professional lims are often too costly to be practical slims gives labs a feasible alternative that is easily_accessible user centrically designed and feature rich to facilitate system customization and utilization for other groups manuals have been written for users and developers availability documentation source_code and manuals are available atgenetic studies of complex_diseases that interrogate the human_genome are known as genome_wide association gwa studies they require both high_throughput genotyping_platforms and large samples sizeswith thousands of subjects from multiple sources and time pointsto clearly define the contributions of common_alleles associated with common complex_diseases to obtain the large_sample needed gwa studies have led to international consortia formed from smaller studies with differences in study_designs and quality_control procedures if not dealt to whom correspondence should be addressed with appropriately these situations can lead to decreased data accessibility increased laboratory errors and an overall reduction in operational efficiency laboratory information management systems limss provide solutions for these situations however the perception that learning to use new software will be timeconsuming and difficult can be a significant barrier to the adoption of a lims this situation is worsened by the high turnover_rate of research staffresulting in recurrent training costsand the lack of user centric designs in open_source limsresulting in steep learning curves in searching for a solution to the challenges we faced managing our biological_samples we failed to find any open_source systems that would provide adequate functionality for our needs we developed sample based lims slims to make available a feature rich system capable of handling longitudinal data and to increase the presence of user centric design in limss slims is based on a previously_published lims passim the consequences of incomplete user acceptance of a lims are very serious even the best professional systems lose value and can even become detrimentalif they fall out of date because of inconsistent use in a busy laboratory instructing staff to use a new system can only have so much effect successfully achieving consistent usage requires incentives in addition to instruction to this end slims aims to combine record_keeping with features that save time and simplify dailylaboratory tasks we have taken a three pronged_approach to achieve_this first facilitation of bench top procedures is integrated with record_keeping in slims by the automatic production of documents required for procedure completion second we have ensured that the users experience is as easy and efficient as possible by formally involving a broad_spectrum of users in the development process from requirements analysis to interface design and testing this approach allowed us to map different user_groups mental models of a lims system and incorporate them in our design making the system more intuitive for users though focusing development on users instead of programmers reduces a systems learning_curve it cannot be erased our third prong focused on easing and accelerating the learning_process with user manuals and instructional text throughout the system though slims applicable scope may be limited by a setup targeting sample based laboratories and tools targeting genotyping workflows the approaches to lims development described above incorporate widely_applicable well established techniques that are lacking in existing open_source lims documentation source_code and manuals are available at http genapha icapture ubc ca slims index jsp
