sequence_analysis extra binomial variation approach for analysis of pooled_dna sequencing_data the invention of next_generation has made it possible to study the rare_variants that are more likely to pinpoint causal disease genes to make such experiments financially viable dna samples from several subjects are often pooled before sequencing this induces large between pool variation which together with other sources of experimental_error creates over dispersed data statistical_analysis of pooled_sequencing needs to appropriately model this additional variance to avoid inflating the false_positive results we propose a new statistical_method based on an extra binomial model to address the over dispersion and apply it to pooled case control data we demonstrate that our model provides a better fit to the data than either a standard binomial model or a traditional extra binomial model proposed by williams and can analyse both rare and common_variants with lower or more variable pool depths compared to the other methods availability package extrabinomial is on http cran r project org to date numerous common_genetic associated with common disease e g type_diabetes t d have been successfully discovered by genome_wide however linkage_disequilibrium ld means these results may only be used to identify an associated region which usually encompasses several genes to pinpoint the exact causal_genes under the assumption that there may be multiple_variants of common and low_frequency which alter disease risk attention has turned to low_frequency variants that are unlikely to be in ld with other variants associated low_frequency variants are considered more likely to be causal for example several independent rare risk_variants with implied functional_roles were recently associated with inflammatory_bowel using next_generation of pooled_samples a design similar to that ofwho undertook the first such study and whose data we re examine here re sequenced target_regions covering exons and splice_sites of t d candidate_genes that were previously found to be associated with t d or related_diseases the study used sequencing of pools of dna from patients and healthy_controls samples per pool four rare_variants single_nucleotide snps located in the interferon_induced with helicase c domain ifih and the c type lectin domain_family member a clec a genes displayed different frequencies in cases and controls according to fishers_exact and evidence for association of two of these variants within the gene ifih was replicated in independent samples this directly implicates ifih as causal in t d a major_concern with this study is that huge variation exists between pool depths and the variation is especially large for rare snps the variation is derived from both the pooling and the sequencing and this is not accounted for by fishers_exact which assumes a binomial variance within pools and neglects between pool variation the poisson_model has also been employed for sequence count_data as well as analysis of differential_gene with only one parameter the poisson_distribution assumes the variance of reads is equal to its mean however the variance may exceed the mean requiring an over dispersed model as in our data a negative_binomial has been used as an alternative to model the larger variance for example in testing differential_expression for digital gene_expression data given it has one more parameter than the poisson_distribution the addition of this parameter however means the negative_binomial requires a large number of replicates to estimate the two parameters properly another fully mathematically specified over dispersed model is the beta_binomial model which applied to variants derived from pooled case control sequence_data would assume a binomial_distribution within pools and that the expected allele_frequency of each pool is beta distributed used this model and calculated maximized log likelihoods to analyse the effects from seeds and extracts on germination other applications of this model include the analysis of false_discovery fdrs in microarray_data to model the number of false rejections yielding a less biased fdr estimator than the empirical estimator following a binomial_distribution the advantage of to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms

meaningful parameters and a computable likelihood which could be maximized by standard methods to calculate the relating parameters however maximizing a beta_binomial likelihood can be computationally difficult an alternative is to use a model in which only the first two moments are defined we propose to use and extend such an extra binomial model originally described by williams the extra binomial model still assumes the allele counts obey a binomial_distribution within pools and also takes the between pool variance into consideration in this article we compare the performance of statistical_tests assuming simple binomial variation williams extra binomial variation and our modified extra binomial model using quantilequantile qq plots we also extend our study beyond the
