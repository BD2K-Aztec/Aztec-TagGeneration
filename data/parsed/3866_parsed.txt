random_sampling of elementary_flux in large_scale metabolic_networks motivation the description of a metabolic_network in terms of elementary_flux ems provides an important framework for metabolic_pathway however their application to large_networks has been hampered by the combinatorial explosion in the number of modes in this work we develop a method for generating random_samples of ems without computing the whole set results our algorithm is an adaptation of the canonical basis approach where we add an additional filtering step which at each iteration selects a random subset of the new combinations of modes in order to obtain an unbiased sample all candidates are assigned the same probability of getting selected this approach avoids the exponential_growth of the number of modes during computation thus generating a random_sample of the complete set of ems within reasonable time we generated samples of different sizes for a metabolic_network of escherichia_coli and observed that they preserve several properties of the full em set it is also shown that em sampling can be used for rational strain design a well distributed sample that is representative of the complete set of ems should be suitable to most em based_methods for analysis and optimization of metabolic_networks availability source_code for a cross_platform implementation in python is

functional pathways connecting substrates with biomass and products inherent to a metabolic_network ems have been used to understand the cellular_metabolism through analysis of the network_structure regulations and characterization of all possible phenotypes examples of other recent_applications of pathway analysis are in the determination of to whom correspondence should be addressed minimum medium requirements and in the development of reduced kinetic_models they also play_an in the development of modelbased metabolic_engineering strategies for strain optimization by identification of suitable intervention targets a comprehensive_review on elementary mode analysis and other applications of ems can be found in ems are also closely_related to the problem of identifying all transition invariants t invariants in petri_net theory in fact if all reactions are irreversible the set of ems is equivalent to the minimal t invariants of a petri_net thus it is not surprising that the algorithms for computation of ems and t invariants have evolved closelyfor a comparison of despite recent improvements in the algorithms for computation of ems their application to real_world metabolic_networks has been hampered by the combinatorial explosion in the number of modes as the size of the networks increase the enumeration of the complete set of ems for genome_scale networks has been infeasible so_far and perhaps even undesirable due to the hardly manageable number of modes that would be generated an attractive approach is the enumeration of a subset of pathways representing the complete system several approaches have been proposed hereto though none of them provides a purely random_sample of ems current state of the art approaches typically enumerate ems with a certain objective or constraint like the enumeration of the shortest pathways the enumeration of pathways including a specific target reaction enumeration based on available measurements enumeration of all possible pathways through selected reactions that satisfy the steady_state flux of the entire network elementary flux patterns or decomposition of the network in modules these approaches do not represent the full solution_space and hence a number of potentially interesting solutions may be missed one of the key requirements for successful understanding of the cellular_metabolism based on ems is the ability to enumerate a representative subset of modes in this work we develop a method for generating random_samples of ems without computing theiras more data are collected metabolic_models keep constantly growing in size this increases the challenge for em based analysis of metabolic_networks as the number of ems grows exponentially with the network size for that matter the development of em sampling approaches will become increasingly important this work is a contribution in that direction we developed a method that prevents the combinatorial explosion of the number of ems during computation by adding a filtering step that randomly samples among the candidate modes at each iteration unlike other methods for obtaining reduced sets of ems our approach does not use any objective_functions or experimental flux constraints efmevolver is the approach most similar to ours it samples the ems that contain a target reaction rather than the whole solution_space it uses linear_programming lp to find a single em and a genetic_algorithm ga to search different solutions it has the advantage that the procedure can be stopped after a desired number of modes have been collected whereas our approach only yields valid ems after completion on the downside it requires tuning the parameters for the ga and selection of a proper fitness_function whereas or method is tunable by a single_parameter our method can show a bias towards smaller em pathway lengths if the selection probability is too low given its formulation it is likely that efmevolver exhibits the same bias although it is not evaluated how strong that bias can be despite the current shortcomings em sampling is a promising approach for computation of ems at the genome_scale and opens the possibility
