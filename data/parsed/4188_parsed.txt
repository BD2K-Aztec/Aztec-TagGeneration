sensa web_based sensitivity analysis of sbml models sensa is a web_based application for sensitivity analysis of mathematical_models the sensitivity analysis is based on metabolic_control analysis computing the local global and time dependent properties of model components interactive_visualization facilitates interpretation of usually complex results sensa can contribute to the analysis adjustment and understanding of mathematical_models for dynamic_systems availability_and sensa is available atthe understanding of complex systems and their dynamics has greatly_improved with mathematical_modelling with models the dynamics of system components can be analysed hypotheses can be tested and the behaviour of the system can be predicted in different conditions or in response to perturbations these predictions guide future_experiments which can save money and time to mimic the behaviour of the real_biological system model_parameters have to be tuned based on biological observations in this process it is vital to test the effects of changes in parameter_values on the behaviour of the system this test is often referred to as sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the change of a specific system property e g a steady_state concentration reaction flux or the amplitude of oscillations in response to changes in parameter_values thus it shows how sensitive the system is towards a particular parameter it can also be interpreted as fragility or robustness analysis of the system here we implement sensitivity analysis as defined by metabolic_control analysis mca mca defines coefficients that describe the effect of infinitesimal changes of parameters on system properties like reaction fluxes or variable concentrations classical mca is limited to models in steady_state but ingalls and sauro extended the theory to look at the time dependent changes of sensitivities as well mca and its extension provide a sound theoretical_framework for sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the main analysis and the corresponding type of results a user can expect we analysed a model for the extracellular_signal erk cascade from accessible on the biomodels_database biomodels id biomd the model comprises variables and parameters resulting in different tdcrcs a schematic of the model topology and a selection of concentration time courses and computed tdcrcs are shown in looking at the structure of the model and the concentrations it becomes clear that a phosphorylation of praf leads to a number of phosphorylations further downstream using sensa we are now able to observe the inherent relationship between changes in the concentration of praf and perk and pperk over time moderately complex models already produce a large number of tdcrcs that can be problematic to visualize to address this we implemented interactive graphics with a selection matrix and a plotting area the matrix shows all possible tdcrcs when the user hovers over a specific coefficient the line is transiently displayed in the plot this serves as a quick and easy way to scan a large number of coefficients also the user may select to plot all none or the most extreme coefficients sensitivity analysis in general is an important tool in many areas of modern systems_biology and is often used to understand the growing complexity of models especially tdcrcs can give an interesting perspective on signalling models and are an often cited method in the field original paper has citations nevertheless studies that actually use it are rare we provide sensa to close the gap between this sophisticated analysis and a comprehensive way to use it this can enable modellers to use the method and make the results more accessible
