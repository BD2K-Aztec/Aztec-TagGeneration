the gpmdb rest interface the global proteome machine and database gpmdb representational state transfer rest service was designed to provide simplified access to the proteomics information in gpmdb using a stable set of methods and parameters version of this interface gives access to methods for retrieving experimental information about protein post_translational amino_acid variants alternate splicing variants and protein cleavage patterns availability_and gpmdb data and database tables are freely_available for commercial and non commercial use all software is also freely_available under the artistic license http rest thegpm org gpmdb rest service http wiki thegpm org wiki gpmdb rest service description and help and http www thegpm org gpm main project description and documentation the code for the interface and an example rest client is available at ftp ftp the global proteome machine and database gpmdb http thegpm org is a project to collect and disseminate in formation derived from raw_data generated by proteomics experiments that use tandem_mass to analyze protein samples it currently contains the results of analyzing over proteomics datasets and more than billion peptide_identifications the system uses a combination of data analysis servers an xml file storage repository and a set of mysql_database servers to generate and record the results of proteomics experiments it has become part of a larger informal system of data_repositories and information systems widely used by proteomics investigators the original design of the system allowed investigators to use a conventional web_browser html system to select information of interest about individual_peptides or proteins as well as information about particular datasets using forms and url links while this style of interface has proven to be very useful for individuals browsing the information it has become increasingly cumbersome for automated information_retrieval systems where the html pages are being parsed to generate summary information for calculations the rest interface described here is web_service specifically_designed to simplify data access and automate some common tasks in bioinformatics and computational_biology research
