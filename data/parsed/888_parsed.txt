sequence_analysis ccsol omics a webserver for solubility prediction of endogenous and heterologous_expression in escherichia_coli here we introduce ccsol omics a webserver for large_scale calculations of protein solubility our method allows i prote ome wide predictions ii identification of soluble fragments within each sequences iii exhaustive single_point analysis results using coil disorder hydrophobicity hydrophilicity sheet and helix propensities we built a predictor of protein solubility our approach shows an accuracy of on the training_set target track entries validation on three independent sets indicates that ccsol omics discriminates soluble and insoluble proteins with an accuracy of on proteins_sharing sequence_similarity availability_and ccsol omics can be freely ac cessed on the web atalgorithms for prediction of protein solubility and aggregation provide a solid basis to investigate physico_chemical determinants of amyloid_fibril and associated diseases in the past_years an in vitro reconstituted translation system allowed the large_scale investigation of escherichia_coli proteins solubility thus providing the opportunity for the development of predictive methods such as ccsol in ccsol coil disorder hydrophobicity hydrophilicity sheet and helical propensities are combined together into a solubility propensity_score that is useful to investigate protein expression as well as bacterial evolution other methods have been developed to predict protein solubility based on amino_acid characteristics for instance proso ii exploits occurrence of monopeptides and dipeptides to estimate heterologous_expression in e coli proso ii was trained on the pepcdb database now target track that stores target and protocol information provided by protein_structure initiative centers both ccsol and proso ii perform accurate_predictions when used to respectively predict endogenous or heterologous soluble expressions ccsol accuracy proso ii accuracy we found that the experimental status of several target track entries http sbkb org tt has been recently updated and new data are available to train predictive methods see_supplementary here we introduce a novel implementation of the ccsol method called ccsol omics to perform large_scale predictions of endogenous and heterologous_expression in e coli our algorithm has been trained on non redundant target track entries to identify soluble and insoluble regions within protein_sequences we envisage that ccsol omics will be useful for protein_engineering studies as it allows the investigation of sequence_variants in large_datasets
