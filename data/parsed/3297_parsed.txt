structural_bioinformatics nrgsuite a pymol plugin to perform docking_simulations in real_time using flexaid ligand protein docking_simulations play a fundamental role in understanding molecular_recognition herein we introduce the nrgsuite a pymol plugin that permits the detection of surface cavities in proteins their refinements calculation of volume and use individually or jointly as target binding_sites for docking_simulations with flexaid the nrgsuite offers the users control over a large number of important parameters in docking_simulations including the assignment of flexible side_chains and definition of geometric constraints furthermore the nrgsuite permits the visual ization of the docking simulation in real_time the nrgsuite give access to powerful docking_simulations that can be used in structure_guided drug_design as well as an educational tool the nrgsuite is implemented in python and c c with an easy to use package installer the nrgsuite is available for windows linux and macos availability_and http bcb docking_simulations can be used to understand the specificity and selectivity of ligands as well as guide in the identification and design of inhibitors docking_simulations seek to address three interdependent but distinct problems i the prediction of the structure of a ligand protein complex binding_mode ii the discrimination of binders from non binders virtual_screening and iii the prediction of binding_affinities docking methods are not yet successful in these three tasks simultaneously flexaid was primarily developed with the task of predicting binding_modes when docking on non native complex structure i e the structure of the target was not crystallized in the presence of the ligand of interest flexaid has been shown to outperform existing_methods such as autodock vina and flexx irrespective of target flexibility as well as rdock when sidechain conformational changes are crucial pymol delano is a powerful open_source program for molecular_visualization that allows users to extend the capabilities of the program via plugins the source_code of the latest_version of pymol is available in sourceforge two pymol plugins exist for docking_simulations seeliger and de both use autodock vina and require additional software compilation installation the latter permits docking with slide but requires an amber license a number of docking web_servers exist including swissdock istar rosetta and dock blaster primarily focused on virtual_screening in this work we present the nrgsuite an open_source and self contained precompiled pymol plugin for pymol versions and above focused on the prediction of binding poses with docking_simulations the nrgsuite cohesively combines tools we develop
