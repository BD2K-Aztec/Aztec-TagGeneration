manta rapid detection of structural_variants and indels for germline and cancer sequencing_applications we describe manta a method to discover structural_variants and indels from next_generation data manta is optimized for rapid germline and somatic analysis calling structural_variants medium_sized indels and large_insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets of these variant types for example na at genomic coverage is analyzed in less than min manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split_read evidence with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor normal sample_pairs call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to cosmic database variants manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base_pair resolution allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical_significance we provide manta as a community resource to facilitate practical and routine structural variant analysis in clinical and research sequencing scenarios availability_and manta is released under the open_source gplv_license source_code documentation and linux binaries are available from https github com illumina manta whole_genome and enrichment sequencing is increasingly used for discovery of inherited and somatic genome_variation in clinical_contexts however tools for rapid discovery of structural_variants svs and indels in this scenario are limited we address this gap with manta a novel method for accurate discovery and scoring of svs medium_sized indels and large_insertions in a unified and rapid process manta discovers variants from a sequencing assays paired and split read_mapping information using an efficient parallel workflow many advanced structural variant methods are available which focus on research and population_genomics however none to our knowledge combine as many variant types into a rapid workflow focused on individual or small sets of related samples per its focus on clinical pipelines manta provides a complete solution for discovery assembly and scoring using only a reference_genome and alignments from any standard read_mapper it provides scoring models for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumornormal sample_pairs with additional applications under development for rna_seq de_novo variants and unmatched tumors we describemantas methods and compare with representative tools to demonstrate high variant call quality with dramatically_reduced compute cost we describe na variant call performance in the top portion of comparing the results of each method to pedigree consistent calls for this sample see methods the first section_describes large_deletions and duplications showing that mantas results are competitive overall and have a somewhat higher recall or higher rate of pedigree consistency due to correct genotyping manta calls consistently show a higher fraction of calls agreeing with the pedigree consistent set which also have breakends assembled to basepair resolution for deletions and insertions smaller than bases the next section ofreiterates the large sv pattern of strong performance with a trend towards higher recall across these smaller indel variant classes somatic call performance for the hcc hcc bl tumor normal sample pair is described in the final portion of comparing each methods variant_calls to cosmic variant entries for hcc see section in this case the truth set does not reflect a complete catalog of somatic variants for the cell_line however it does provide a useful relative precision estimate reflecting enrichment for known variants here we observe strong performance for manta calls across all variant types with a trend towards a greater fraction of true calls assembled to base_pair resolution consistent with germline variant observations summarizes runtime and memory cost for each variant caller benchmarked in both parallel and serial modes to show workload distribution and methods efficiency by either of these runtime or memory metrics we observe that manta has substantially lower compute cost and turnaround time while providing coverage of more variant types we note that delly is designed to parallelize primarily across instead of within samples so the parallel test reflects a limited use of all server cores when manta is restricted to provide variant call coverage similar to delly variants bases and larger observed compute cost is even lower further highlighting the efficiency of mantas implementation relative to current methods mantas approach is sufficiently flexible to support several types of sequencing assays the primary_focus for rapid analysis and large_scale sv calling has been whole_genome but manta is routinely used to analyze exome and other enrichmentbased targeted_sequencing assays the method is not designed for targeted amplicon_sequencing but successful results have been reported we additionally note that manta has been extensively optimized to handle the shorter fragment_lengths and higher chimera rates found in highly degraded ffpe_samples as part of an ongoing focus on clinical sequencing workflows conflict of interest all authors are employees of illumina inc a public company that develops and markets systems for genetic_analysis
