inhibition of hiv_protease the rigidity perspective motivation hiv_protease is a key drug_target due to its role in the life_cycle of the hiv_virus rigidity analysis using the software first is a computationally inexpensive method for inferring functional information from protein crystal_structures we evaluate the rigidity of high_resolution or better x_ray crystal_structures of hiv_protease and compare the effects of different inhibitors binding to the enzyme results inhibitor binding has little effect on the overall rigidity of the protein homodimer including the rigidity of the active_site the principal effect of inhibitor binding on rigidity is to constrain the flexibility of the hairpin flaps which move to allow access to the active_site of the enzyme we show that commercially_available antiviral_drugs which target hiv_protease can be divided_into two classes those which significantly affect flap rigidity and those which do not the non peptidic inhibitor tipranavir is distinctive in its consistently strong effect on flap rigidity hiv_protease is a key drug_target due to its role in the life_cycle of the hiv_virus and many protease_inhibitors have been designed to block its function and to prevent virus_replication hiv is a retrovirus after it enters a host_cell its viral_rna is reverse_transcribed into double_stranded and then integrated into host dna the host_cell subsequently transcribes this integrated virus specific dna and translates the transcribed message into a single extended translation product containing the sequences of all the viral encoded_proteins required to make further copies of the virus the role of hiv_protease is to cleave this product at specific cleavage_sites to generate the individual functional viral_proteins successful inhibition of the protease prevents this maturation step and hence blocks proliferation of the virus many x_ray crystal_structures of hiv_protease have been resolved and deposited in the rscb protein_data pdb the wild_type protease is a symmetric homodimer with a largely sheet secondary_structure the active_site of the protease lies in a cleft where the two chains meet this cleft is covered by hairpin flaps to whom correspondence should be addressed experimentally nuclear_magnetic nmr and fluorescence_spectroscopy have been used to study the flexibility of the protein the flaps have been found to be highly_flexible in the unbound enzyme with internal flap motion occurring on a sub ns timescale on a timescale of s they undergo a different large_amplitude motion in slow dynamic equilibrium between semi open and less ordered open conformations the conformational_dynamics of the protease have also been investigated using molecular_dynamics simulations and coarse_grained models again the flaps have been found to be highly_flexible with distances between their tips ranging from to the conversion between closed semi open and fully open flaps has been simulated in qualitative agreement with experimental_data here we examine hiv_protease by performing rigidity analysis on a set of x_ray crystal_structures that have been solved to a resolution of or better and made available in the pdb in our analysis we determine the locations of flexible regions within the protein and hence study the potential for motion first identifies rigid clusters and flexible regions by matching atomic degrees_of with the constraints present due to bonding we examine the effect of inhibitor binding on flap rigidity using a comparative_approach for each structure crystallized with an inhibitor bound we perform rigidity analysis on the structure with the inhibitor present and on the same structure with the inhibitor deleted
