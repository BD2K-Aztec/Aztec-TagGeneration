human cancer alterations of mirnas are involved in both the initiation and progression of human cancer and the link between deregulated mirnas expression and cancer had been well established understanding gene_regulatory grns by tfs and mirnas will shed light on the mechanisms of cancer including breast_cancer breast_cancer is the most common cancer in women and million new breast_cancer cases were diagnosed each year worldwide recent_studies provided_valuable on the molecular_mechanism of breast_cancer via integrating information from genome transcriptome to proteome of representative numbers of breast_cancer patient samples cancer genome gene regulations by tfs and mirnas have been linked to breast_cancer several tfs e g oestrogen_receptors are known to be important

breast_cancer is a remarkably heterogeneous disease breast_cancer and primary breast_tumors were found to be consistently classified into three major_subtypes luminal lu basal a baa and basal b bab the breast_cancer were found to compromise a system exhibiting the substantial genomic transcriptional and biological_heterogeneity properties of primary breast_cancers breast_cancer classifier genes bccgs involved in the differentiation status of the cell_type and or tumor_biology were identified to be able to classify breast_cancer into lu baa and bab groups investigating the pattern and feature

in this study we revealed the architecture and feature of grns by tfs and mirnas in breast_cancer via systematically investigating grns composed of tfs mirnas and bccgs across breast_cancer representing three major breast_cancer lu baa and bab first tfs mirnas and bccgs were collected from public database and published works and the relationships among them were analyzed via computational_methods combined with gene_expression data second for each breast_cancer subtype the correlation between tfs mirnas and their targets was calculated after that enrichment of mirna target_gene in bccgs was analyzed to whom correspondence should be addressed and the correlation between tfs and mirna host_genes was calculated finally node co regulatory_motifs were identified and used to construct co regulatory_networks the workflow was deciphered in and the detailed information was provided in section our current work presented the architecture and feature of grns by tfs and mirnas in breast_cancer at system level numerous_cellular and every process of life are affected by grns precise and coordinated control of gene_expression is required for an organism to grow develop and function normally it is known for decades that a failure of normal regulation of expression of genes in cell_growth leads to the appearance and behavior of cancer_cells abnormities in grns causing gene_expression abnormities play_important in human cancer including breast_cancer breast_cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer_types in the world and is one of the most investigated areas of oncology although there are published_papers on breast_cancer in the past_decade and grns were claimed to be a new conceptual_framework to analyze breast_cancer behaviors the study on the architecture and the feature of the grns in breast_cancer is still limited grns can provide explanations of developmental and physiological_functions at system level grns contain many layers of gene_regulation including cell_signaling mrna_splicing polyadenylation and localization chromatin_modifications and mechanisms of protein_localization modification and degradation tfs and mirnas are two of the best studied gene regulatory_mechanism tfs are considered as key intrinsic regulators of cell_fate via controlling gene_expression directly compared with tfs that regulate_gene at the level of transcriptional_regulation mirnas regulate_gene at post_transcriptional level and raised entirely new mechanisms of gene_regulation more than of human protein_coding were predicted to be regulated by mirnas thus investigation on grns by tfs and mirnas will provide_valuable for understanding the gene regulation_mechanism of cancer including breast_cancer in breast_cancer grns by tfs have been the subject of intense scientific investigation over the past several decades and the related studies also lead to the improvement of breast_cancer treatment take oestrogen_receptor esr which is one of the most extensively_studied tfs in breast_cancer as an example esr is found to be the driving tf in majority of breast_cancer and to target_genes dictating cell_growth and endocrine responsesbaa

nucleotides regulatory_rnas that cause destabilization or translational_repression of target_mrnas are rising to be important new mechanisms of gene_regulation in breast_cancer le quesne and caldas it has been mostly investigated on the role of individual mirnas in breast_cancer and a new framework for studying the biology of mirnas in breast_cancer was presented recently via analyzing the mirna_expression of breast_tumors with matching detailed clinical annotation longterm follow_up and genomic and mirna_expression data several studies have demonstrated the regulation between tfs and mirnas in breast_cancer for examples c_myc directly transacted the mir cluster to modulate e f expression in breast_cancer o and mir directly target esr mrna to function in tamoxifen resistance in breast_cancer however little is known on the pattern and features of grns by tfs and mirna in breast_cancer besides targetscan integrative approaches have been developed for mirna_target in these approaches approaches including mmia mirconnx and magia were correlation based_approaches which directly consider the correlation between mirna and mrna_expression besides correlation based_approaches linear mode approaches including genmir and bayesian_network approach predict mirna_target via formulating mrna and mirna_expression with linear_model with latent_variables and via using bayesian_network to model the mirnamrna regulatory_network respectively regarding to the tfs and their targets many approaches and databases including ucsc database have been developed however none of these was able to be directly applied for analyzing grn by mirna and tf to investigate the grns by the mirna and the tf in breast_cancer and among breast_cancer a pipeline shown inwas designed to integrate the established approaches from mirna_target to transcription targets analysis to decipher the architecture and features of grns consisted of mirnas tf and bccgs in breast_cancer and among breast_cancer there are two types of grms in breast_cancer type_i grms all the three breast_cancer baa bab and lu have the two grm types with significant variation number of nodes and edges and supplementary basal subtype baa andbab has significantly more nodes and edges in co regulatory motif group than luminal subtype lu and supplementary to study the combinatorial regulation pattern of grns by mirnas and tfs in breast_cancer for each breast_cancer the grns by mirnas and tfs were created via joining all node co regulatory_motifs and merged three co regulatory_networks into the entire grns and supplementary figs s and s the number of intersection nodes and edges between baa and bab is much higher than that between lu and baa and between lu and bab figs and different breast_cancer have their unique nodes and edges and supplementary tables s and s these features support the significant differences between breast_cancer on many aspects from molecule to prognosis to some extent interestingly a much smaller gene_list containing only protein_coding nodes from the grns is able to classify breast_cancer as efficient as the gene_list containing all bccgs supplementary figs s and s this result indicates that it might be potentially used analysis of the architecture and features of the grns in breast_cancer and among breast_cancer to build a more accurate and efficient breast subtype discriminator interestingly most common nodes are tfs or mirnas this might be the consequence of restriction to bccgs as tfs and mirna_targets in current study further studies would be required to confirm whether this phenomenon is a feature of breast_cancer identification of breast_cancer driver_genes will lay the ground for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment in the grns by tfs and mirnas genes were common in grns across all breast_cancer and designated nonsubtype specific genes nsg nine of these nsgs are tfs in the nine tfs eight creb esr fosl pbx pou f sox sp and zeb were reported to play roles in breast_cancer creb was reported to be a positive transcription regulator of aromatase and its expression was correlated with the prognosis of breast_cancer esr roles in breast_cancer were well established fosl was found to modulate growth vacuolization and death of ant estrogen resistant mcf_cells pbx pre_b leukemia homeobox was reported to act as a tf to function as a pioneer factor defining aggressive er_positive pou f was found to be a hub gene in grns across all breast_cancer and supplementary pou f octamer tf oct is reported to be associated with epithelial_mesenchymal emt and breast_tumor malignancy sox was recently reported to cooperate with slug to determine the mammary stem_cell state sp was reported to interact with esr and play_important in breast_cancer zeb was reported to control proliferation and epithelial tomesenchymal transition of breast cancer_cells besides the eight tfs in nsgs as discussed above little is known about roles of ank and pou f in breast_cancer and ank and pou f are considered to be new breast_cancer gene_candidates in comparison the eight mirnas in nsgs are much less studied only two mirnas in nsgs were reported to play roles in breast_cancer has mir a was recently reported to modulate hoxa which is a critical mediator of a breast cancer_chemoprevention agent retinoic_acid induced cell_growth and has mir a was found to target pten to play a role in breast_cancer chemoresistance and regulate the expression of tissue_factor which is an important regulator of tumor_angiogenesis and metastasis in both luminal and basal breast cancer_cells the remaining six mirnas has mir has mir c hsa_mir hsa_mir hsa_mir and hsa_mir c in nsgs are new mirnas that could be play roles in breast_cancer besides nsgs the remaining genes were designated as breast_cancer subtyperelated genes srgs and although srgs cannot be simply interpreted as breast_cancer subtype specific genes whose functions are limited to specific breast_cancer srgs would also play roles in breast_cancer and further studies are needed to validate whether the functions of srgs in breast_cancer are highly depended on the context of breast_cancer mirna_regulatory were found to alter their configuration to conform to the stable tf regulatory_networks with an increased circuit redundancy and a marked reduction in the repertoire of composite feed_forward circuits targeted genes and this redundancy adding role is preferentially attributable although it is difficult to compile human_breast to other mammals including mice to study evolution of related grns our grns by tfs and mirnas in breast_cancer and subtypes might be likely to retain similar properties further investigations are required to verify whether the redundancy adding role would serve as a niche for many mirna connections to survive avoiding conflicts with the stable tf regulatory_networks in breast_cancer more importantly the grns raise important_clues for further functional_validation the grns by certain tfs and mirnas and facilitate profound understanding of the functions of breast cancer_genes several regulatory_relationships have been experimentally_validated for example a recent study showed that microrna directly targets fosl to suppress breast_cancer invasion and metastasis thus our results give important clue for the experimental_validation of grns in breast_cancer our results reveal that the architecture and feature of grns by tfs and mirnas in breast_cancer have both distinct and common features among breast_cancer in addition our results raise abundant clues for further experimental_investigation of gene_regulation by tfs and mirnas in breast_cancer via providing the new candidate breast cancer_genes and regulatory relationship taken together our results shed light on the mechanism of breast_cancer development and subtyping
