gene_expression mirontop mining micrornas targets across large_scale gene_expression studies current_challenges in microrna mirna research are to improve the identification of in vivo mrna_targets and clarify the complex_interplay existing between a specific mirna and multiple biological_networks mirontop is an online java web_tool that integrates dna_microarrays or high_throughput sequencing_data to identify the potential implication of mirnas on a specific biological system it allows a rapid characterization of the most pertinent mrna_targets according to several existing mirna_target prediction_approaches it also provides useful representations of the enrichment_scores according to the position of the target_site along the utr where the contribution of the sites located in the vicinity of the stop_codon and of the polya tail can be clearly highlighted it provides different graphs of mirna enrichment associated with up or down_regulated transcripts and different summary tables about selections of mrna_targets and their functional_annotations by gene_ontology mirnas appear capable to block translation and also stimulate mrna_degradation with translational_repression often preceding mrna_degradation several mechanisms of mirna action including block of cap binding or elongation increased ribosome drop off rate or increased de adenylation have already been proposed it remains however that target_recognition follows a complex set of rules dominated by the existence of a perfect match between and nt located in the region of the mirna called the seed and the target_mrna the ability of mirnas to interact with many targets and the possibility for some of them to share a same target increase tremendously the complexity of many biological_networks in that context an experimental_validation of in silico predictions appears quite necessary many available target prediction softwares combine a search for a perfect seed match between mirna and untranslated_region utr and a conservation of the interaction across species in fact comparison of results to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as obtained with several of these computational_tools show significant divergences mirontop aims at detecting influence of mirnas on gene_expression by analyzing potential overrepresentation of specific_mirnas targets across an experimental gene_set other tools have been recently described to explore mirna influence on datasets mirontop provides several novel and complementary information including i the possibility to screen and compare mirna_signatures using different target prediction_tools ii options to calculate enrichment_scores according to the spatial distribution of predicted targets sites along the transcript since true sites may be preferentially located in close_vicinity of stop_codons and polyadenylation_sites and iii access to gene_ontology functional_annotations of the different gene_lists overall these different modes of representation increase the sensitivity of the research in order to define a set of either mrna or mirnas associated with the selected experiment mirontop is an online application allowing the detection of mirnas that significantly affect_gene at a large_scale the flexibility of the interface allows a fine_tuning of the down and up gene_sets according to three parameters that correspond to the level of expression the extent of differential_expression and a significance index such a selection allows experimenters to easily explore a large_scale experiment and get a summary report of the different predictions made by several mirna target_identification softwares recent investigations on other datasets have indicated that mirontop is not only useful in experiments of mirna overexpression knock_down but can also detect more subtle mirna activities in a physiological context in the future mirontop will be easily updated in order to integrate any additional predictions made publicly_available such as experimentally_validated pairs of mirna and mrna that could now be provided by recent experimental_approaches
