sequence_analysis discretized gaussian mixture for genotyping of microsatellite_loci containing homopolymer runs motivation inferring lengths of inherited microsatellite alleles with single_base from short_sequence is challenging due to several sources of noise caused by the repetitive nature of microsatellites and the technologies used to generate raw_sequence results we have developed a program genotan using a discretized gaussian_mixture combined with a rules based_approach to identify inherited variation of microsatellite_loci from short_sequence without paired_end information it effectively distinguishes length variants from noise including insertion_deletion errors in homo polymer runs by addressing the bidirectional aspect of insertion and deletion errors in sequence_reads here we first introduce a homopo lymer decomposition method which estimates error bias toward insertion or deletion in homopolymer sequence runs combining these approaches genotan was able to genotype of microsatellite_loci accurately from simulated_data with x sequence_coverage quickly while the other programs showed correct calls for the same data and required more computational time than genotan it also showed the highest true_positive for real_data using mixed sequence_data of two drosophila inbred_lines which was a novel validation approach for genotyping availability genotan is open_source available at http gen otan sourceforge net since many inherited variants of microsatellite_loci are known to be associated with several human_diseases such as colorectal_cancers and various neurological_disorders the variants can act as important biomarkers to identify risk of disease development the advent_of ngs_technologies allows for a robust comparison of large_numbers of microsatellite_loci from several individuals in a quick and cost_effective way which then allows the discovery and use of microsatellites as biomarkers or causative_agents of disease unfortunately inferring precise lengths of inherited microsatellite alleles with single_base from short_sequence remains a challenge due to the repetitive nature of microsatellites and the technologies used to generate raw_sequence homopolymer sequences which are the most dominant class in the microsatellite family are especially difficult to analyze in this article we discovered that of microsatellite_loci showing variants in a human_genome contain homopolymer sequences bases which underscores the importance of properly calling the genotype for this class of polymorphism repetitive_sequences often result in insertion_deletion indel sequencing_errors at homopolymers and incorrect mapping of sequence_reads compounding the issue biological or technological mutants at microsatellite_loci due to individual cell mutation or pcr_amplification artifacts are also frequently observed substitution_errors sequencing or biologically derived in the repeat sequences themselves also greatly affect the quality of alignment a few methods such as samtools gatk and dindel can be used to genotype microsatellite_loci with single_base without paired_end information but they have been principally designed to identify short indels in non repeat sequences although lobstr has been developed to profile short_tandem loci it is limited to only analyzing mer motif repeat loci recently repeatseq has been developed to genotype microsatellite_loci but it does not provide a training module to adjust parameters to different sequence_data conditions the genotyping programs including dindel employ local_alignment based_methods and assume mainly sequencing_errors cause the indel_errors if the mapping quality is high however distant variants at microsatellite_loci often fool mapping programs into assigning high quality_scores to incorrectly mapped_reads when the sequence_reads from the repeat loci are very different from the reference_sequence which results in incorrect genotyping especially accuracies of genotyping programs using a bayesian_approach are significantly affected by a few incorrectly mapped_reads supplementary_material individual cell mutations and polymerase_chain pcr_amplification errors also frequently alter lengths of reported microsatellites resulting in falsely calling genotypes different from the inherited alleles in addition as homopolymer sequences induce not only indel_errors but also substitution_errors during sequencing supplementary and indel_errors in reads containing homopolymers are to whom correspondence should be addressed frequently recurrent in other reads_mapped to the same locus supplementary local_alignment based_approaches often fail to correctly identify inherited alleles further the programs weight the final call towards the reference_sequence which may result in an artificial selection against novel non reference allele calls since mapping or alignment_algorithms are mostly biased to the reference_sequence long homopolymers frequently induce false_positive allele calls and it is challenging to distinguish them from true variants the reasons for homopolymer error occurrence are different for each sequencing_technology the pyrosequencing technology utilized by life_sciences generates high signal_intensity for a repeating sequence of a single base type then base_calling software estimates the number of bases in the sequence proportional to that intensity supplementary as a result this technology shows a higher rate of indel sequencing_errors than other sequencing_technologies sanger_sequencing and illumina sequencing_technologies employ a dye terminator sequencing method which shows a significantly_lower indel error_rate however this sequencing approach also shows increased indel error_rate as homopolymer length in sequence_reads increases in sanger_sequencing intensities from repetitive bases often merge to make a continuously high signal peak or affect intensities of neighborhood peaks thus the boundaries or heights of peaks for individual bases that compose the repeat become ambiguous supplementary base_calling programs for this method use spacing information estimated from unambiguous peaks to identify the number of repetitive bases from the merged intensities and can predict more or fewer bases than the actual number of bases ilumina sequencing also has been reported to generate homopolymerrelated errors in the study of this article supplementary and other studies and it may be caused by several noise factors such as lagging or leading of nucleotide extension in this article we utilize a gaussian_distribution to compensate for a common characteristic of several different sequencing_technologies in which indel events at a single nucleotide repeat are caused by incorrect signal_intensities and the chances of insertion errors and deletion errors in a repeat are proportional when the rate of insertion errors increases deletion errors also increases supplementary bidirectional indels have also been observed from mutations at microsatellite_loci caused by polymerase slippage during dna_replication to fully address_this we have combined the discretized gaussian_mixture with a rules based_approach to genotype length_variation of microsatellites loci from short_sequence the genotyping method is composed of two regression steps and c and a homopolymer decomposition step which effectively filters out noise reads resulting in low false_positive our method genotan was compared to gatk v with t unifiedgenotyper glm indel dindel v with options in supplementary_materials samtools v with the varfilter post filter and repeaseq v in genotyping performance using four different test_sets including simulated_data mixed sequence_data of two drosophila inbred_lines sequence_data of a single drosophila inbred line and sequence_data of a human sample for the performance test we compared indel lengths in microsatellite_loci identified by the programs in simulated_datasets true_positive alleles do not have indels at multiple positions in their sequences partial genotypes called by genotan were counted as the homozygous calls to follow the traditional classification of the other programs lobstr could not be included in most tests since its target_loci were limited only analyzing mer motif repeat loci
