gene_expression omiras a web_server for differential_expression of mirnas derived from small rna_seq small_rna is widely used to characterize non_coding ncrnas differentially_expressed between two conditions e g healthy and diseased individuals and to reveal insights into molecular_mechanisms underlying_condition specific phenotypic_traits the ncrnaome is composed of a multitude of rnas such as transfer_rna small_nucleolar and microrna mirna to name few here we present omiras a web_server for the annotation comparison and visualization of interaction networks of ncrnas derived from next_generation experiments of two different conditions the web_tool allows the user to submit raw_sequencing and results are presented as i static annotation results including length_distribution mapping statistics alignments and quantification tables for each library as well as lists of differentially_expressed ncrnas between conditions and ii an interactive network visualiza tion of user selected mirnas and their target_genes based on the combination of several mirnamrna interaction_databases availability_and the omiras web_server is implemented in python postgresql r and can be accessed at http tools genxpro net omiras
