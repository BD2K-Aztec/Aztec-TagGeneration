gene_expression biological assessment of robust noise models in microarray_data analysis motivation although several recently_proposed analysis packages for microarray_data can cope with heavy tailed noise many applications rely on gaussian assumptions gaussian_noise models foster computational_efficiency this comes however at the expense of increased sensitivity to outlying observations assessing potential insufficiencies of gaussian_noise in microarray_data analysis is thus important and of general interest results we propose to this end assessing different noise models on a large number of microarray_experiments the goodness_of of noise models is quantified by a hierarchical bayesian analysis_of model which predicts normalized expression values as a mixture of a gaussian density and t distributions with adjustable degrees_of inference of differentially_expressed is taken into consideration at a second mixing level for attaining far reaching validity our investigations cover_a of analysis platforms and experimental_settings as the most striking result we find irrespective of the chosen preprocessing and normalization method in all experiments that a heavy tailed noise model is a better fit than a simple gaussian further investigations revealed that an appropriate choice of noise model has a considerable influence on biological interpretations drawn at the level of inferred genes and gene_ontology we conclude from our investigation that neglecting the over dispersed noise in microarray_data can mislead scientific discovery and suggest that the convenience of gaussian based modelling should be replaced by non parametric approaches or other methods that account for heavy tailed noise the importance of microarray_data for the biological_sciences has generated a large number of sophisticated analysis methods approaches like t tests linear_models and many bayesian_methods consider data to be approximately gaussian distributed recent investigations have to whom correspondence should be addressed however cast doubt on the correctness of the gaussian assumption by testing for gaussianity hardin and wilson find that microarray_data does not follow a gaussian_distribution the observed overdispersion leads to a large number of outlying values which can have a considerable influence on the inference results the cost of measurements and the possibility that outlying data_points are caused by biological_processes rule out that such samples get removed all samples must thus be taken into account carefully as excluding outlying values or including them based on incorrect distribution assumptions would falsify the biological findings the adverse_effects of outliers in microarray_data can be overcome with non parametric approaches cf non parametric methods replace the restrictive assumptions linked with the gaussian_distribution with very general ones however at the expense of losing some power of tests cf alternatively we can analyze overdispersed data with robust parametric noise models like students t distributions cf the issue of appropriate noise models led to an ongoing discussion witharguing that microarray_data are gaussian distributed similar methods let hardin andconclude that microarray_data require heavy tailed noise models the conclusion ofwas that of genes are non gaussian distributed with the majority following gaussian_distributions finding such diverse conclusions about noise in microarray_data suggest an in depth investigation of this issue we propose to this end inferring the appropriate degree of overdispersion in microarray_data with a hierarchical_bayesian which is inspired by the proposal of builtin means for ranking genes according to differential_expression enable investigations of the biological_implications of deviating from the optimal noise model the essential components of the proposed model are thus two indicator variables one decoding whether a gene is differentially_expressed the other decoding the most appropriate noise model these variables are built into a hierarchical bayesian analysis_of anova model which can be used for analyzing a variety of experimental_designs inferring the proposed model with uninformative prior settings provides reliable probability measures which quantify the suitability of competing noise models this mode of operation compares the goodness_of of a gaussian_noise model with t distributions of different degrees_of and infers the appropriate robustness level required for analyzing a microarray_dataset the ultimatepage this article provides an in depth assessment of two competing assumptions about the noise_characteristics in microarray_data assuming gaussian_noise has the benefit of leading to highly_efficient analysis methods a considerable sensitivity to outlying observations is however an unfortunate weakness of gaussian_noise based data analysis this weakness may be overcome with non parametric methods or by methods which assume heavytailed noise distributions applying robust analysis methods to microarray_data has the disadvantage of introducing more involved computations the application of non parametric methods is in addition limited to problems with sufficiently many samples comparing robust analysis methods with gaussian based microarray_data analysis has to provide conclusions which are relevant for biological practise certain technical_aspects can be tested by gold_standards like the spike in data from other aspects like for example biological_variation are only captured by data analysing real_world biology although certain facts about individual experiments are well known complete knowledge of ground_truth is not available for any biological microarray experiment an assessment of biological_implications has thus to resort to indirect strategies the route chosen in this article first compares the technical suitability of gaussian_noise and heavy tailed t distributions this requires a mode of operation in data analysis which allows comparing different noise models once we established which noise model is preferred for technical reasons we can turn to investigating the biological_implications caused by changing the noise model this mode of operation relies in our analysis on counting the number of genes which show a noise modeldependent difference in differential_expression these gene counts are complemented by investigating which go terms are significantly affected from the noise model dependent gene_lists for providing conclusions of far reaching validity we analysed carefully_chosen microarray_experiments covering a wide_range of model_organisms and measurement platforms to avoid reporting spurious_results our simulations included careful tuning of hyperparameters to minimize model sensitivity steps for assessing convergence of the algorithm and applied different normalization and preprocessing methods the arresting result of our assessment is that we find highly decisive evidence in favour of t distributions with high kurtosis for every experiment we looked at the significance of this finding is backed up by the observation that the choice of error_model considerably influences the biological conclusions drawn from the analyses gene_lists differ in dependence of the noise model by between and genes these differences have a substantial influence on the conclusions we draw on a higher_level of biological abstraction the number of differences in the go term lists we find in dependence of the chosen noise model ranges from to for many datasets the number of go terms with noise model dependent equivocal assessment is larger than the number of go terms we can unambiguously assign to these experiments irrespective of the chosen noise model we may thus conclude that a substantial number of outlying measurements is present in many microarray_studies relying on implicit gaussian assumptions means ignoring the heavy tails of the residuals and that can have adverse_effects on biological conclusions drawn from microarray_data practitioners should thus apply robust approaches for microarray_data analysis which work reliably irrespective of whether noise is gaussian or heavy tailed we suggest for this purpouse considering non parametric approaches cf or for small_sample apply bayesian approaches likeor the matlab_implementation which accompanies this paper at http bioinf boku ac at alexp robmca html
