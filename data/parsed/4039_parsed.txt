rna seqc rna_seq metrics for quality_control and process optimization rna_seq the application of next_generation to rna provides transcriptome_wide characterization of cellular activity assessment of sequencing performance and library quality is critical to the interpretation of rna_seq yet few tools exist to address_this we introduce rna seqc a program which provides key measures of data_quality these metrics include yield alignment and duplication rates gc bias rrna content regions of alignment exon intron and intragenic continuity of coverage bias and count of detectable transcripts among others the software provides multi sample evaluation of library_construction protocols input materials and other experimental parameters the modularity of the software enables pipeline integration and the routine monitoring of key measures of data_quality such as the number of alignable reads duplication rates and rrna contamination rna seqc allows investigators to make informed decisions about sample inclusion in downstream_analysis in summary rna seqc provides quality_control measures critical to experiment_design process optimization and downstream computational_analysis availability_and see www genepattern org to run online or www broadinstitute org rna seqc for a command_line rna_seq is a highly parallelized sequencing_technology that allows for comprehensive transcriptome characterization and quantification as with all forms of parallelized sequencing significant computational processing is required to unlock transcript_abundance levels and other measures for biological_interpretation however prior to the calculation of biologically_relevant data such as transcript_abundance presence of novel isoforms and genotype identity it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the rna_seq experiment itself summary_statistics and quality_control scores provide insight into inherently complex data prior to downstream_analysis here we present rna seqc a metrics tool with application to two domains experiment_design and process optimization and quality_control prior to computational_analysis metrics such to whom correspondence should be addressed a rna seqc will work with one or more input samples to produce both a comparative summary across samples as well as a more detailed report for each sample b the comparative summary report_includes an extensive range of metrics in addition to those shown as well as coverage plots c for each sample additional reports quantify the coverage profile variation gaps etc for individual transcripts as duplication rate rrna abundance alignment rates coverage continuity and correlation to reference expression_profiles are highly informative during selection of experiment conditions and library_construction methods rna seqcs multisample input feature allows for direct comparison across samples additionally a single sample mode can be used to monitor samples on an ongoing basis to rapidly assess the quality of a particular sequencing run and to monitor and optimize these measures in production over time and prior to downstream_analysis rna seqc provides a suite of experiment quality_measures many of which are currently not provided by other available tools supplementary_material
