systems_biology a lasso regression_model for the construction of microrna target regulatory_networks motivation micrornas have recently_emerged as a major class of regulatory_molecules involved in a broad range of biological_processes and complex_diseases construction of mirna_target regulatory_networks can provide useful information for the study and diagnosis of complex_diseases many sequence_based and evolutionary_information based_methods have been developed to identify mirnamrna targeting relationships however as the amount of available mirna and gene_expression data grows a more statistical and systematic method_combining sequence_based binding predictions and expression based correlation data becomes necessary for the accurate identification of mirnamrna pairs results we propose a lasso regression_model for the identification of mirnamrna targeting relationships that combines sequence_based prediction information mirna co regulation risc availability and mirna mrna_abundance data by comparing this modelling approach with two other known methods applied to three different datasets we found that the lasso regression_model has considerable advantages in both sensitivity_and the regression_coefficients in the model can be used to determine the true regulatory efficacies in tissues and was demonstrated using the mirna target_site type data finally by constructing the mirna_regulatory in two stages of prostate_cancer pca we found the several significant mirna hubbed network modules associated with pca metastasis in conclusion the lasso regression_model is a robust and informative tool for constructing the mirna_regulatory for diagnosis and treatment of complex_diseases availability the r program for predicting mirnamrna targeting relationships using the lasso regression_model is freely_available along with the described datasets and resulting regulatory_network at http biocompute bmi ac cn czlab alarmnet the source_code is open for modification and application to other mirna mrna_expression datasets micrornas mirnas are nt rnas that derive from distinctive hairpin precursors in animals plants and fungi and can bind to complementary_sequences on target_mrnas in recent_years mirnas have emerged as a major class of regulatory_elements of gene_expression computational predictions of mirna_targets estimate that each mirna regulates hundreds of different mrnas and of human protein_coding are subject to mirna regulation mirnas are involved in a broad range of biological_processes including development differentiation apoptosis and proliferation several studies have shown that mirnas are involved in the initiation and progression of cancer significantly differing mirna profiles in various types of tumors suggests that mirna_profiling has diagnostic and perhaps prognostic potential mirnas use base_pairing to guide rna induced silencing complexes riscs to specific_mrnas with imperfect complementary_sequences the recruitment of risc commonly leads to the repression of targeted mrna through inhibition of translation_initiation and or mirna mediated mrna destabilization the argonaute protein in the risc complex is crucial for gene_silencing to occur for its capability of endonucleolytic cleavage in human there are four ago proteins where ago is the sole protein required for the risc activity a mirna can directly destruct the target_mrna through mrna cleavage when the pairing is extensive this kind of repression dominates in plants in animals however it was once thought mirnas repress protein output with little or no influence on mrna_levels because in animals only a few targets satisfy the extensive pairing required for cleavage however a number of microarray_data showed that mirnas decrease the levels of many targeted mrnas only recently it became clear that similar as in plants mirnas predominantly exert their effects in mammalian_cells through decreasing the levels of target_mrnas and the mrna destabilisation that accounts for most of the decreased protein production a number of computational_prediction have been introduced to identify the targets of mirnas the first generation of mirna_target prediction_methods were primarily based on watsoncrick base_pairing rules and free_energy for
