genome_analysis qualimap evaluating next_generation alignment data motivation the sequence_alignment sam and the binary align ment map bam formats have become the standard method of representation of nucleotide sequence_alignments for next_generation data sam bam_files usually contain information from tens to hundreds of millions of reads often the sequencing_technology protocol and or the selected mapping algorithm introduce some unwanted biases in these data the systematic detection of such biases is a non trivial task that is crucial to drive appropriate downstream_analyses results we have developed qualimap a java_application that supports user_friendly quality_control of mapping data by considering sequence_features and their genomic properties qualimap takes sequence_alignment data and provides graphical and statistical analyseswith the advent_of ngs a number of novel alignment_methods have been developed seefor a review the sequence_alignment sam and the binary alignment map bam formats have become the standards used for representation of nucleotide sequence_alignments for these algorithms the results from such alignments can be used in subsequent analyses such as genome_wide comparative_studies to drive conclusions concerning a variety of biological_processes such as gene_expression and epigenomic modifications sam bam_files usually contain the information from tens to hundreds of millions of reads and the quantity of data contained in these files is continuously increasing unfortunately sam bam data_files frequently contain biases that are introduced by sequencing_technologies during sample_preparation and or the selected mapping algorithm therefore one of the fundamental requirements during analysis of these data is to perform quality_control i e to get an idea of how reliable mapping data are and how well data fit with the expected_outcome to these ends we have developed qualimap a java_application that aims to facilitate the quality_control analysis of mapping data recently some efforts have been made to facilitate this task for example see samstat rna seqc or picard qualimap advances this area by providing some additional features supplementary
