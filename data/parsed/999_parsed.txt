genome_analysis clever clique enumerating variant finder motivation next_generation techniques have facilitated a large_scale analysis of human genetic_variation despite the advances in sequencing speed the computational discovery of structural_variants is not yet standard it is likely that many variants have remained undiscovered in most sequenced individuals results here we present a novel internal segment size based_approach which organizes all including concordant reads into a read_alignment graph where max cliques represent maximal contradiction free groups of alignments a novel algorithm then enumerates all max cliques and statistically evaluates them for their potential to reflect insertions_or for the first time in the literature we compare a large range of state of the art approaches using simulated illumina_reads from a fully annotated genome and present relevant performance statistics we achieve superior_performance in particular for deletions or insertions indels of length nt this has been previously_identified as a remaining major_challenge in structural_variation discovery in particular for insert_size based_approaches in this size_range we even outperform split read_aligners we achieve competitive results also on biological data where our method is the only one to make a substantial amount of correct predictions which additionally are disjoint from those by split read_aligners availability clever is open_source gpl and available fromseefor performance figures see also section e in the supplementary_material for a further subdivision of the bp part boldface numbers designate the best approach and italic numbers the best insert_size based_approach if not the best approach overall comparing absolute_numbers of true indels in the biological data with the simulated data_points out immediately that the vast_majority of annotations is bp clever outperforms all other approaches on the simulated_data and is the best insert_size based_approach also on the biological data pindel achieves best rates on the biological data also clever makes a substantial amount of exclusive calls in all categories tables in the supplementary_material subsection f points out that of clevers indel calls come significantly close to a real indel further analyses supplementary_material section h demonstrate that of clevers false_positives are due to misalignments and mapping ambiguities see external sources of errors below obviously many of those extremely close but not truly hitting calls are due to external errors breakdancer makes little and highly_precise calls at the expense of reduced accuracy in terms of indel breakpoint placement and length see_supplementary section g bp here clever achieves substantially better recall and more exclusive calls than pindel on the biological data on the simulated_data clever again achieves best overall performance in contrast to bp however breakdancer and vh already make significant_contributions although vh achieves good overall performance breakdancer mostly excels in precision as before when allowing a certain offset of breakpoints supplementary_material subsection f or when integrating correct alignments supplementary_material section h clevers precision substantially rises from to across the categories bp also clever is best while other tools breakdancer hydra vh also make decisive contributions this documents that the current_challenges for indel discovery are rather in the size_range of bp note that none of the tools makes predictions for insertions longer than bp see section e in the supplementary_material modil we compared modil with all other tools on chromosome alone because of the excessive run time requirements of modil clever is faster by a factor of see_supplementary section i overall modil incurs certain losses in performance with respect to clever across all categories but outperforms the other insert_size based_approaches apart from larger indels bp it is noteworthy that modil makes a substantial amount of exclusive calls for insertions of bp accuracy of breakpoint and length predictions see section g for related numbers the split_read based_approaches outperform the insert_size based_approaches among the latter clever and gasv are most precise for and bp for bp calls breakdancer achieves favorable values external sources of errors see_supplementary section h for related results and a detailed discussion on to what degree misalignments and multiply mapped_reads alignment hamper computational sv discovery conclusion we have presented a novel internal segment size based_approach for discovering indel variation from paired_end data in contrast to all previous whole_genome applicable approaches our tool takes all concordant read data into account we outperform all prior insert_size based_approaches on indels of sizes bp and also achieve favorable values for long indels we outperform the split_read based_approaches considered on medium_sized bp and larger bp indels in addition our approach detects a substantial amount of variants missed by all other approaches in particular in the smallest size_range considered bp in conclusion clever makes substantial contributions to sv discovery in particular in the size_range of bp our approach builds on two key_elements first an algorithm that enumerates maximal statistically contradiction free ensembles as max cliques in read_alignment graphs in short time and second a sound statistical_procedure that reliably calls maxcliques that indicate variants our approach is generic with respect to choices of variants max cliques in the read_alignment graphs can also reflect other variants such as inversions or translocations for future work we are planning to predict inversions and to incorporate split_read information as a unifying approach conflict of interest none declared
