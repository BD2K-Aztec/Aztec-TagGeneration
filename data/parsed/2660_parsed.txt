lamplink detection of statistically_significant snp combinations from gwas data one of the major_issues in genome_wide is to solve the missing her itability problem while considering epistatic_interactions among multiple_snps may contribute to solving this problem existing software cannot detect statistically_significant high order interactions we propose software named lamplink which employs a cutting_edge method to enumerate statistically_significant snp combinations from genome_wide casecontrol data lamplink is implemented as a set of additional functions to plink and hence existing procedures with plink can be applicable applied to the genomes_project data lamplink detected a combination of five snps that are statistically_significantly accumulated in the japanese_population availability_and lamplink is available at http a terada github io lamplink
