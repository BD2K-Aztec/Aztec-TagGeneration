genome_analysis identification of trans_acting sirnas and their regulatory cascades in grapevine motivation transacting small_interfering ta_sirnas play_an in the regulation of plant gene_expression but relevant reports are still limited bioinformatic_analyses indicate that many ta sirna producing loci tass are present in plants implying the existence of as yet undiscovered ta_sirnas and related regulatory_pathways to expand_our of these plant gene_regulators we applied high_throughput computational and experimental methods to grapevine vitis_vinifera l results based on bioinformatic predictions we identified tass from small_rna clusters using rna degradome analysis we experimentally_validated tass ta_sirnas and ta sirna targets the cis activities of ta_sirnas were also confirmed which suggested an inactive mechanism of tas transcription and a produced mechanism of multiple forms of small_rna from same tas we examined the conservation of newly_identified ta sirna regulatory cascades and found that while the cascade related to vvitas was conserved cascades related to vvitas vvitas vvitas and vvitas were grape specific these results broaden the known scope of ta sirna regulation endogenous small_rnas srnas are key post_transcriptional and transcriptional_regulators of plant gene_expression they include micrornas mirnas heterochromatic small_interfering sirnas natural antisense sirnas nat sirnas and trans_acting sirnas ta_sirnas mirnas which are generated by cleavage of single_stranded stemloop structures by dicer like play_pivotal development and stress_responses by targeting the transcripts of transcription_factors that mediate the transition between various developmental_stages or regulate responses to biotic or abiotic stimulation heterochromatic sirnas trigger dna_methylation and histone_modification and are involved in heterochromatin formation of repeated genomic_regions and the silencing of other genomic_regions including the control of transposon movement katiyar natsirnas consist of two types of sirnas i e nt nat sirnas and nt nat sirnas they are processed from pairs of natural cis antisense_transcripts by cleavage with dicer like and dicer like respectively the nt natsirnas play_a in environmental stress_response and in reproduction by targeting unlinked transcripts and guiding cleavage to produce nt nat sirnas whose function is still not clear ta_sirnas play_an in regulating plant development metabolism and responses to biotic_and they are produced from ta sirna producing locus tas genes a single_stranded is first transcribed from a ta sirna locus and then cleaved by a phase initiator a mirna or in some cases a ta sirna rdr dependent conversion of the resulting fragments into double_stranded and subsequent cleavage by dicer like generates nt phased ta_sirnas these ta_sirnas then combine with argonaute_proteins to form risc complexes and cleave targeted mrnas to date several mirna ta sirna target_gene cleavage cascades have been identified as important elements of gene_regulatory tas a tas b tas c and tas are four ta sirna loci targeted by mir and their cleavage products produce six ta_sirnas that target at least two transcripts with unknown function and two transcripts of pentatricopeptide_repeat genes tas another ta sirna locus is targeted by mirna its cleavage product produces two ta_sirnas that target_transcripts of auxin response factors arf arf and arf a fourth ta sirna locus tas is targeted by mirna its cleavage product produces one ta sirna that targets three myb gene_transcripts another tas gene also named tas has been identified in moss it produces ta_sirnas targeting a putative transcription_factor similar to ap erebp suggesting a function in plant development it has been reported that ta_sirnas from tas regulate leaf morphology and juvenile to adult vegetative stage transitions ta_sirnas from tas regulate anthocyanin flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and may also be involved in regulating leaf_senescence computational_analysis indicates that many tass to whom correspondence should be addressed exist in plants suggesting they may play a more fundamental role than currently understood identification and functional characterization of new ta_sirnas is therefore needed grapevine vitis_vinifera l is a model system for studying fruit bearing agricultural crop_plants and based on fruit consumption and wine yield is also of great economic importance many biological_processes including those involving ta_sirnas generated from tas and tas greatly affect grape yield and quality the identification of grapevine ta_sirnas and their regulatory cascades is thus important in efforts to improve grape cultivation and breeding recent_publication of deep_sequencing srna libraries especially a degradome library generated from cleaved mrna fragments opens_the to the identification of grapevine ta_sirnas and their cascades because ta_sirnas are produced from tas tas is rich in srnas we can thus detect tass by initially searching for regions containing large_numbers of srnas using this approach a total of regions were found when we counted the number of clusters overlapped to annotated gene_loci and exons we found nt clusters were much more likely than nt clusters to overlap with exon regions in previous_studies nt clusters have been implicated in transcriptional_silencing of transposon regions the grapevine nt clusters are seldom associated with gene regions consistent with their roles in directing silencing of transposable_elements to further identify tas loci from regions highly_enriched in srna we used an improved computational_method that allows for a variable tas length to predict tass compared with current strategies the greatest advantage of this improved method is that it is not constrained by a bp length requirement this leads to a more accurate tas prediction especially for the tass with lengths longer or shorter than bp and has great_potential for future use however because the cleavage position cannot be offset it still requires further refinement to further validate the cleavage_sites of tass targeted by phase initiators an rna degradome was used because the rna degradome was obtained from high_throughput of products generated from race the degradome can be used to analyze rna degradation patterns which is helpful for identifying sirna cleavage_sites on mrna or other cdnas here we used it to determine phase initiator and ta sirna cleavage_sites we identified ta_sirnas produced from vvitass and trans cleaved targeted transcripts the targeted transcripts are involved in a wide_range including basic biochemical_responses such as those related to ribosomal_protein s dna_damage protein rad calciumtransporting atpase fatty_acid cellulose synthase catalytic_subunit and chloroplast ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and development related processes such as those related to senescence associated protein din auxin response factor and pathogenic defense related protein lrpk this wide_range suggests that ta_sirnas play a basic regulatory_role in plant_growth ta_sirnas have been suggested as key_factors conferring regulatory diversity in members of multi gene_families involved in auxin_signaling because leucine rich receptor like kinases make up one of the largest protein_families with at least members in arabidopsis_thaliana and are targeted by ta_sirnas they may also be diversely regulated any regulatory_control by mirnas and other endogenous srnas is still speculative however the function of ta sirna trans activity has been the focus of many studies but its cis activity has rarely been investigated in a previous study a function was suggested but the phase initiator was not found the cis cleavage position was validated and a secondary sirna product was detected but that was not enough information to establish the cis_acting role of ta sirna in this study we have confirmed the cis activity of ta_sirnas by identifying the phase initiator as well as detecting degradation_products and determining the site of cis cleavage the biological role of ta sirna regulatory cascades is also interesting in this article we have reported five cascades and evaluated their expressions in various species and tissues the results indicate that the vvitas related cascade is conserved across species in contrast the cascades related to vvitas vvitas vvitas and vvitas are found only in grape there is a previously known cascade in which ath mir targets ath tas and triggers production of ta_sirnas which in turn regulate a group of myb genes the cascade related to vvitas is similar to the ath mir associated cascade in that the phase initiators for both cascades belong to the mir family however the tass ta_sirnas produced and ta_sirnas targets are all different indicating the discovery of a new mir regulation pathway previous_studies have posited that viral sirnas are abundant in plants which implies that ta sirna cascades may be involved in antiviral_defense our findings further suggest that different ta sirna cascades might be specific to different species or tissues opening the possibility that some might have specialized developmental regulatory_roles surprisingly vvimirna has lower copy_numbers in certain arabidopsis mutant libraries than in wild_type libraries supplementary we believe that this situation stems primarily from the different experimental_conditions used to produce the various libraries for example srna libraries with lower numbers of vvimirna copies including gsm gsm gsm gsm gsm gsm gsm gsm gsm gsm gsm gsm and gsm were all published by the james lab at oregon state_university while the wild_type library gsm was published by the hannon lab at cold spring harbor laboratory for those arabidopsis libraries created under_identical the reason that few or no vvimir reads were detected is simply due to sequencing_depth libraries from the james lab were generated using sequencing in the total number of reads in several of those libraries is below which may be too low to detect vvimir when we compared the number of sequenced ta_sirnas from vvitas vvitas vvitas vvitas and vvitas we found very different numbers in each library from grapevine this is very surprising as they are all produced from the same tas transcript simultaneously this suggests a potentially different degradation_rate in addition among ta_sirnas from the same position such as vvitas tasirp a vvitas tasirp b vvitas tasirp c and vvitas tasirp d that all originate from vvitas d the nt ta sirna is always the most abundant this suggests that the degradation_rate of nt ta sirna is very slow and that its function might be more long_lasting than its other analogs further studies are required to obtain better insights into the mechanism of ta sirna degradation
