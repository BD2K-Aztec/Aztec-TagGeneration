gene_expression frma st frozen robust multiarray analysis for affymetrix exon and gene st arrays frozen robust multiarray analysis frma is a single array preprocessing algorithm that retains the advantages of multiarray algorithms and removes certain batch_effects by downweighting probes that have high between batch residual variance here we extend the frma algorithm to two new microarray platformsaffymetrix human exon and gene stby modifying the frma probe level model and extending the frma package to work with oligo exonfeatureset and genefeatureset objects availability_and all packages are implemented in r source_code are freely_available through the bioconductor_project convenient links to all software and data packages can be found at
