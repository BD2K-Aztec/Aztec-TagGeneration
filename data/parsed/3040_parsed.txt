systems_biology modeling community_wide molecular_networks of multicellular systems motivation multicellular systems such as tissues are composed of different cell_types that form a heterogeneous community behavior of these systems is determined by complex_regulatory within intracellular networks and between intercellular networks cells increasingly more studies are applying genome_wide experimental_approaches to delineate the contributions of individual cell_types e g stromal epithelial vascular cells to collective behavior of heterogeneous cell communities e g tumors although many computational_methods have been developed for analyses of intracellular networks based on genome_scale these efforts have not been extended toward analyzing genomic_data from heterogeneous cell communities results here we propose a network based_approach for analyses of genome_scale from multiple cell_types to extract community_wide molecular_networks comprised of intra and intercellular interactions intercellular interactions in this model can be physical_interactions between proteins or indirect interactions mediated by secreted metabolites of neighboring_cells applying this method on data from a recent study on xenograft mouse_models of human lung_adenocarcinoma we uncover an extensive network of intra and intercellular interactions involved in the acquired_resistance to angiogenesis inhibitors individual cells within a heterogeneous cell_population interact with each other through secreted molecules and membrane_proteins sometimes referred to as cross_talk at the molecular level this population can be viewed as a communitywide network of molecular_interactions comprising intracellular interactions within each cell as well as intercellular interactions of molecules of different cells since population characteristics as a whole are highly dependent on the intra as well as intercellular networks the global architecture of the communitywide molecular_network cmn made of intra and intercellular to whom correspondence should be addressed molecular_interactions can determine the collective behavior of heterogeneous cell communities network based analyses of genomic_data have shed light on the global organization of intracellular networks contributing to normal and malignant_behavior of cells mounting evidence now suggests that interplays of cells within a microenvironment can give rise to complex population behavior such complex interactions of cells within a population have been observed in developmental_processes in stem_cell and in tumor microenvironments however most of the studies on deciphering the complex pattern of molecular_network interactions in such multicellular systems and their role in population wide collective behavior have been focused on a limited number of molecules although some notable large_scale studies in some experimental_systems have been undertaken the computational methodology of analysis primarily involved candidate based_approaches limiting the scope of analysis more powerful computational_methods for analyses of genomic_data from heterogeneous_cell would therefore greatly enhance our ability to gain insight into the organization of cmns and their role in the collective population behavior here in order to enable modeling of molecular_networks of whole cell_populations we developed a network model of community_wide molecular_interactions by combining intracellular interactions from each cell_type and their intercellular connections into a single global network community molecular_network we use this global network in conjunction with the genome_wide gene_expression data from different cell_types to extract networks of interest showing community_wide molecular_interactions most highlighted by the data we integrate genomic_data with the global network using netwalk a computational algorithm for seamless_integration of genomic_data with molecular_networks the advantage of netwalk compared to other network_analysis tools is that netwalk takes_into the whole data distribution without requiring statistical cutoffs or predetermined gene_lists of interest netwalk output is a distribution of edge flux ef values containing numeric score of relevance assigned to each interaction in the network ef values just like in gene_expression data can be used for further statistical_analyses allowing for direct network based statistical_analyses using this platform we present an analysis of recently_published gene_expression data from epithelial andare extracellular protein in one cell_type can interact with protein in the other and vice_versa in addition since the metabolite c is secreted into the extracellular_space the reaction performed by enzyme in one cell can affect the reaction performed by enzyme in the other stromal_cells of a mouse_xenograft of acquired_resistance to bevacizumab angiogenesis inhibitor and identify previously_unrecognized cmns of stromal and epithelial_cells involved in acquired_resistance to this targeted_therapy as a proof_of analysis using our cmn model we chose to use the data from a recent study utilizing mouse xenograft_models to study acquired_resistance of human lung_adenocarcinomas to angiogenesis inhibitors the authors in the aforementioned study injected h cells human non_small cell_line that is sensitive to bevacizumab into mice and after a while started treating them with a vehicle_control or bevacizumab despite initial response majority of tumors developed resistance to the drug gene_expression microarray_analyses were then performed on control and bevacizumab resistant_tumors n for each using illumina mouse specific wg v and humanspecific wg v arrays mouse specific arrays were used to measure stromal gene_expression and the human array was used to measure the tumor gene_expression in order to identify community_wide molecular_networks involved in the acquired_resistance to bevacizumab we first performed t tests on each gene in the stromal and tumor datasets to score the extent of their change in resistant versus control cases the resultant t values the value of t statistic from t tests for tumor and stromal gene_expression data had different distributions stromal_cells had a wider t value distribution not shown consistent with the original studys report that stromal gene_expression changes were more pronounced than that in tumor data therefore we transformed the two t value distributions using quantile normalization to obtain identical distributions for tumor and stromal t values these t values two sets one for stromal and one for tumor_cells were used as node weights for our netwalk based network_analyses in this study we proposed a modeling_approach of multicellular systems as community_wide molecular_networks to increase ourunderstanding of the complex_interplay between intracellular networks of different cell_types within the community using our previously_developed data biased random_walk approach netwalk together with cmn we were able to obtain a view of the complex_interplay between intracellular networks of tumor and stromal_cells in acquired_drug in addition to identifying the previously_reported findings from the original study of cascone et_al our approach uncovered several novel intercellular interactions involving physical as well as indirect metabolic cross_talk with potential_roles in the drug_resistance phenotype although experimental_validation of these findings is beyond the scope of the current study which is to demonstrate the use of cmn in conjunction with netwalk the analyses presented here show that the results faithfully reflect the data distribution that was used as input for netwalk and supplementary although the analyses demonstrated here used netwalk for network integration other methods such as those based on data cutoffs could be used although insightful community networks can be constructed by using gene_lists from such data cutoffs most of the genes within these lists will not be used for network construction and therefore will not be accounted for during analyses supplementary however the interactions with highest ef values generated by netwalk contain most of the genes with highest data values and therefore information_loss is minimized in netwalk based network_analyses supplementaryand legend the community network model that we present here takes_into both physical and indirect interactions mediated by secreted metabolites between different cells within the community although physical_interactions through ecm components have been well characterized in several systems intercellular interactions at the metabolite level have not been studied to a similar extent leaving much room for exploration our model enables analyses of large_scale functional_genomics data from multicellular systems for the identification of complex scenarios involving functional interplay at the physical and metabolic levels between different cells of the multicellular system overall our community_wide molecular_network model is an invaluable tool in genome_wide studies of multicellular systems
