drug_induced adverse_events prediction with the lincs l data motivation adverse_drug adrs are a central consideration during drug_development here we present a machine_learning classifier to prioritize adrs for approved drugs and pre clinical small_molecule compounds by combining chemical_structure cs and gene_expression ge features the ge data is from the library of integrated_network based cellular signatures lincs l dataset that measured changes in ge before and after treatment of human cells with over small_molecule compounds including most of the fda_approved using various benchmarking methods we show that the integration of ge data with the cs of the drugs can significantly improve the predictability of adrs moreover transforming ge features to enrichment vectors of biological terms further improves the predictive_capability of the classifiers the most predictive biological term features can assist in understanding the drug mechanisms of action finally we applied the classifier to all small_molecules profiled and developed a web_portal for browsing and searching predictive small_molecule adr connections availability_and the interface for the adverse_event predictions for the lincs compounds is available at http maayanlab net sep l adverse_drug adrs are harmful or unpleasant unintended side_effects resulting from drug intervention adrs are a major_concern for both public_health and the drug_development process failure to identify severe adrs in clinical_trials can lead to significant morbidity and drugs withdrawn from the market can carry a substantial negative economic_impact despite such harmful consequences adrs can provide useful information about drug humanphenotype relationships adrs and human_diseases can often overlap for example common adr phenotypes such as neuropathy or long_qt can manifest as genetically inheritable diseases therefore better understanding drug humanphenotype connections from a network perspective can lead to improved understanding of human_diseases various efforts have been made to predict adrs using the properties attributes of drugs generally the attributes of drugs used so_far to predict adrs can be categorized into two types i those that mostly consider the chemical aspect of the drug and ii those that consider the biological aspects of the drug once such attributes are organized into attribute tables a binary classification_problem can be established for each adr initially chemical_features of drugs alone were used to predict the association between drugs and their known adrs under the assumption that adrs may correlate with the chemical fragments of the drugs that induce them for example were able to map the chemical substructure of drugs described by the extended connectivity fingerprints ecfps to different system organ classes adrs defined by the medical dictionary for regulatory_activities meddra extending this method a step further used the bit pubchem cactvs chemical algorithms construction threading and verification system chemical fingerprints as drug attributes and sparse canonical_correlation scca to improve the predictive classification of adrs using the biological feature_space approach showed that drugs with similar adr profile tend to share similar protein targets similarly gene adr connections were elucidated through a text_mining effort byplaced targets of drugs in the context of human curated biological_pathways to predict adrs whereasused drug_induced gene_expression ge changes in human cell_lines from the connectivity_map to predict adrs datasets generated from large_scale nih funded multi institute projects such as library of integrated_network based cellular signatures lincs and ctd produce rich_information about the response of different types of human cells to drug and smallmolecule perturbations for instance for the lincs project members of the broad institute utilized the l technology to profile ge changes before and after treating many different types of human cells with a large panel of fda_approved and other smallmolecule compounds integration of such data to predict adrs can improve the quality of predictions as well as lead to new insights about drug mechanisms of action the primary aim of this study is to develop an unbiased high performance predictive_model for adrs that is scalable to thousands of preclinical compounds to fulfill this aim we developed a machine_learning classifier that primarily utilizes the ge data from the lincs l project to predict adrs the advantage of using this newly available ge dataset to predict adrs lies in its comprehensiveness and the void of literature research_focus biases that exist for target pathway and protein_protein ppi knowledge in this way we can circumvent the limitation of the target based_approach to adr prediction that dominates the field moreover our classification model is scalable to predict adrs for all small_molecule compounds that have ge data profiled by applying the small_molecules to treat human cells in a dish drug_safety is central to public_health and drug_development in this study we presented a scalable computational_approach that improves the prediction of adrs using the newly available lincs l dataset the classifier we developed only requires the molecular structureand ge profiles for small_molecules so it can be applied to a large panel of investigational drug like compounds to prioritize their potential adrs this alleviates the requirement of knowing the targets of the potential drug which are difficult to identify and when they are known such knowledge is often partial therefore we reason that target based predictive_models are heavily dependent on the size completeness and quality of drug_target datasets however targetbased information may help to alleviate the incapability of ge based models to predict certain adrs despite the scalability of the classifiers we developed we are aware that some adrs cannot be predicted by our model this can be due to several reasons the adrs can be a result of a systemic malfunction that cannot manifest at the cellular ge level the receptors for the drugs are not present in the profiled cell_lines the adrs are highly dose_dependent and the drug may be processed and metabolized into various forms before inducing its global adr effect although in our approach we do not predict which individuals may be more susceptible to manifest a side effect for a specific drug our enrichment vector approach takes a step in this direction the genes that are differentially_expressed by the drugs that have known association with the side effect could contain single_nucleotide that may predispose individuals to manifest the adrs or expression signatures from individual patients in their response to drugs can be mapped to predict adrs in individuals such hypotheses remain to be evaluated once we have sufficient data about associations between individuals their sequenced dna and rna and their propensity to manifest adrs for specific drugs it should be noted that although we used sider and faers as gold_standards to predict adrs such resources are not set in stone and should not be considered as reliable the classifiers that we developed can potentially systematically fill in the gaps between established drugadr associations and new ones predicted from the data overall we have developed a potentially useful resource and we present ideas on how to link cellular molecular expression signatures with the human phenotype although we have focused on the prediction of adrs with some simple modifications a similar approach can be used to predict novel indications for drug_repurposing as well as to identify new drugs and small_molecules for the treatment of many diseases
