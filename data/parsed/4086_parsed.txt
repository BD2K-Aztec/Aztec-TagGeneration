rtandem an r bioconductor_package for ms_ms protein identification rtandem is an r bioconductor_package that interfaces the x tandem protein identification algorithm the package can run the multi_threaded algorithm on proteomic data_files directly from r it also provides functions to convert search parameters and results to from r as well as functions to manipulate parameters and automate searches an associated r package shinytandem provides a web_based graphical_interface to visualize and interpret the results together those two packages form an entry_point for a general ms_ms based proteomic pipeline in r bioconductor availability_and rtandem and shinytandem are distributed in r bioconductor protein identification and analysis by tandem_mass relies mostly on matching spectra to a database of protein_sequences and scoring those matches the resources of the r statistical language and its platform bioconductor have proven to be well suited for this kind of data manipulation and statistical scoring with regard to genomic_data however those resources remain largely untapped with regard to proteomic_data this is partly explained by the lack of tools to perform protein identification directly from r rtandem fills this gap by implementing in r the tandem algorithm and various associated scoring_functions rtandem also provides functions for conversion to from r this brings to proteomics the many advantages of building an analysis_pipeline in the r bioconductor statistical platform easy deployment on high_performance and cloud_computing through bioconductor cloud amazon machine image ami fully open_source workflows interconnectivity of annotation and analytic packages full reproducibility of analysis etc resources of r and bioconductor for example protein accession can be retrieved and passed to biomart to retrieve cross_references or annotation which in turn can be passed to packages like topgo to calculate annotation enrichment and ramigo to display the gene_ontology go tree the online supplementary_material provides a short tutorial that demonstrates this kind of workflow rtandem was tested on a recently_published dataset of breast_cancer tissues and compared with the reported results obtained with maxquant v we used raw_data obtained from four whole tissue lysate of breast_cancer samples rtandem obtained an average of unique peptide_spectrum at an expect value for those samples supplementary this represents a noticeable increase compared with the original results from maxquant which reported an average of peptides per sample at p the bioconductor_package rtandem and its associated graphical_interface shinytandem form an entry_point to build complete proteomics workflows in the r statistical language they provide ways to perform protein identification directly from r and to convert search results to from r object the s result data_structure makes it easy to use r bioconductor to build complex processing pipelines around proteomic_datasets further statistical_tests for quantification in rtandem are currently under development
