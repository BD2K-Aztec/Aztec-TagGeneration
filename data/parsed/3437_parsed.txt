pasha a versatile r package for piling chromatin hts_data we describe an r package designed for processing aligned_reads from chromatin oriented high_throughput sequencing_experiments pasha preprocessing of aligned sequences from hts analyses allows easy manipulation of aligned_reads from short_read sequencing_technologies chip_seq faire seq mnase seq and offers innovative approaches such as chip_seq reads elongation nucleosome midpoint piling strategy for positioning analyses or the ability to subset paired_end by groups of insert_size that can contain biologically relevant_information availability_and pasha is a multi_platform r package available on cran repositories under gpl license https cran r project org_web pasha transcription_regulation analyses benefited from the transition to high_throughput hts technology which offers an unprecedented coverage by sequencing a large number of small sequences in parallel however while library_preparation protocols recommend the selection of sheared dna_fragments ranging from less than bp to more than bp the read size generated by the sequencing_process is often shorter bp as a consequence typical single_end sequencing_reads will display a gap between enrichments on both strands after alignment to the reference_genome in most analyses scenarios peak detection_algorithms are making use of the lag between the strands to infer the theoretical center of enrichment however while the localization of binding_events is a crucial step for analyzing stable binding factors in chip_seq an additional layer of qualitative_and analyses are often required for an exhaustive description of transient or dynamic chromatin association e g rna_polymerase to characterize such profiles it is critical torestore the missing coverage_information from read sequences in order to preserve the qualitative_and aspect of the data here we describe a piling tool that addresses this question by transforming aligned_reads to piled enrichment_scores the modular_structure of this pipeline makes it adaptable to most experimental scenarios for chromatin oriented analyses as well as short rna_sequencing pasha pipeline is for instance able to process seamlessly paired ends or single ends dataset by loading appropriate module and allows the user to focus on biologically relevant_parameters importantly a versatile set of options decorates the core pipeline and enables innovative approaches for downstream_analyses such as an alternative midpoint piling strategy often used for nucleosome_positioning analyses or the ability to subset paired_end by groups of insert_size for a finer analysis of fragments population finally in order to maximize the compatibility with public tools and facilitate the integration to existing pipelines a broad range of input and output file_formats were implemented supplementary
