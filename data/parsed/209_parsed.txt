alignment_free detection of local_similarity among viral and bacterial_genomes motivation bacterial and viral_genomes are often affected by horizontal_gene observable as abrupt switching in local homology in addition to the resulting mosaic genome_structure they frequently contain regions not found in close_relatives which may play a role in virulence mechanisms due to this connection to medical microbiology there are numerous methods available to detect horizontal_gene however these are usually aimed at individual genes and viral_genomes rather than the much larger bacterial_genomes here we propose an efficient alignment_free approach to describe the mosaic_structure of viral and bacterial_genomes including their unique regions results our method is based on the lengths of exact_matches between pairs of sequences long matches indicate close homology short matches more distant homology or none at all these exact match lengths can be looked up efficiently using an enhanced suffix_array our program implementing this approach alfy alignment_free local homology efficiently and accurately detects the recombination break_points in simulated dna_sequences and among recombinant hiv_strains we also apply alfy to escherichia_coli genomes where we detect new evidence for the hypothesis that strains pathogenic in poultry can infect humans in contrast to most eukaryotes viruses and bacteria reproduce asexually nevertheless their genomes are littered with evidence of occasional and localized recombination usually referred to as horizontal_gene horizontal_gene is observable as an abrupt change in homology along an alignment of two or more sequences the importance of horizontal_gene for the evolution of immune_evasion and antibiotic_resistance of pathogenic to whom correspondence should be addressed microbes has been known for decades correspondingly there has been and still is a lot of interest in devising computer programs to automate the detection of mosaic gene or genome_structure most of the current methods for annotating mosaic genome_structure are based on alignments and target viral_genomes or individual bacterial genes these methods are highly_accurate but tend to be too slow for the analysis of whole bacterial_genomes recently expanded their original monte_carlo markov_chain method for inferring recombination_rates by also localizing the recombination_events in alignments of whole bacterial_genomes however even given such an alignment the computational_burden of their again highly_accurate coalescent_based method is considerable if speed is of concern dramatic_improvements are possible by simplifying or eliminating altogether any explicit model under which inference is made and in addition by not basing the analysis on a full multiple_sequence provide a web_based genotyping tool for viral_genomes hosted by the ncbi their algorithm essentially consists of sliding a window across the query_sequence and blasting the windows against the set of subject sequences to determine the closest homologs across the query an even more radical departure from model and alignmentbased treatment of mosaic genome_structure is the alignment_free method for hiv typing proposed by alignmentfree methods of sequence comparison tend to be very fast albeit less accurate than alignment based sequence comparison best known among the alignmentfree approaches are those based on k word composition which is also whathave used here all substrings of length k are counted in the two sequences compared and a distance between the vectors of word counts is defined unfortunately it is difficult to convert distances between word count vectors to true evolutionary_distances we have recently_developed two methods that start from the lengths of exact_matches between pairs of sequences and convert these to substitutions per site the advantage of this approach is that exact match lengths can be looked up efficiently using suffix_trees implemented as their more recent abstractions known as enhanced_suffix and compressed suffix_arrays in this article we use exact match lengths between a query and a potentially large set of subject sequences to solve a specialized page in the following sections we first apply alfy to simulated and then to empirical data to explore the efficiency and accuracy of the program the conversion of data to knowledge is perhaps the greatest challenge in the field of genomics this conversion depends on the availability of computational_tools that match the
