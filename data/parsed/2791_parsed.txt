systems_biology mantra an online collaborative resource for drug mode of action and repurposing by network_analysis elucidation of molecular_targets of a compound mode of action moa and its off targets is a crucial step in drug_development we developed an online collaborative resource mantra that supports this process by exploiting similarities between drug_induced transcriptional_profiles drugs are organized in a network of nodes drugs and edges similarities highlighting communities of drugs sharing a similar moa a user can upload gene_expression before and after drug treatment in one or multiple cell_types an automated processing pipeline transforms the gene_expression into a unique drug node embedded in the drug network visual_inspection of the neighbouring drugs and communities helps in revealing its moa and to suggest new applications of known drugs drug repur posing mantra allows storing and sharing user generated network nodes thus making mantra a collaborative ever growing resource availability_and the web_tool is freely_available for academic use at http mantra tigem it we developed a computational_approach to predict drug mode of action moa and drug_repurposing from the analysis of the connectivity_map a compendium of gene_expression geps following drug treatment of human cell_lines with bioactive_small the approach was based on generating for each drug a single prototype ranked_list prl of differentially_expressed following drug treatment across multiple cell_lines or at different dosages we devised a drug similarity measure based on gene_set gsea to compute similarity between two prls transcriptional similarities were represented as a network the position of a drug within the network was shown to provide insights about its moa by exploiting previous_knowledge on neighbouring drugs here we introduce a collaborative online resource named mantra implementing our computational_approach to drug_discovery integrated with a relational_database engineered to analyse and store user provided geps and metadata following small_molecule treatments single gene perturbations or disease_states an example of a workflow can be found in the help section of the mantra website mantra guides the user beginning with gep upload and annotation which are then automatically transformed into a node in the network by connecting it to similar nodes according to our similarity measure the result is visualized as an interactive network that can be explored to reveal similarities among drugs genes and diseases mantra is a collaborative resource for elucidating drug moa and for drug_repurposing the network framework makes it easy to discover unexpected relationships among drugs genes and diseases the possibility of uploading and sharing users data allows for the growth of the network thus making mantra an ever growing collaborative resource for drug_discovery
