databases_and funcbase a resource for quantitative gene function_annotation computational gene_function can serve to focus experimental resources on high_priority experimental_tasks funcbase is a web_resource for viewing quantitative machine_learning gene function_annotations quantitative annotations of genes including fungal and mammalian genes with gene_ontology are accompanied by a community feedback system computational predictione g of gene function gene phenotype protein interactions or genetic interactionsoffers a statistically sound form of triage for reducing experimental_tasks that would be prohibitive otherwise for example in genetic disease mapping a candidate_gene approach can reduce the study size required to establish significance this is critically_important since large association studies are costly and may be infeasible for rare_diseases functions are commonly represented by gene_ontology go terms which encompass molecular_functions cellular locations and biological_processes experimentalists differ in their requirements for function prediction to maximize new discoveries some will wish to cast a wide net that may include many false_positives others for whom follow_up experiments are more resource_intensive will wish to proceed conservatively therefore funcbase displays quantitative confidence measures by which predictions may be ranked because users typically have additional domain_knowledge that they can draw upon to filter out unlikely predictions funcbase shows predictions in the context of underlying evidence funcbase currently displays function_annotations for several species for each species annotations are based on machine_learning applied to an integrated data_collection including protein motif annotation phenotype and disease association phylogenetic profiles protein interactions and gene_expression full descriptions for the underlying machine_learning algorithm are provided in
