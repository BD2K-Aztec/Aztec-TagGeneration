databases_and systems_biology model repository for macrophage pathway simulation the macrophage pathway knowledgebase macpak is a computational system that allows biomedical_researchers to query and study the dynamic behaviors of macrophage molecular_pathways it integrates the knowledge of reviews that were carefully checked by specialists for their accuracy and then converted to dynamic mathematical pathway_models macpak comprises a total of entities and processes and is described in the cell system markup_language csml an xml format that runs on the cell illustrator platform and can be visualized with a customized cytoscape for further analysis availability macpak can be accessed via an interactive web_site at http macpak csml org the csml pathway_models are available under the creative commons license the immune system has evolved as a defense mechanism against pathogenic microbes it consists of both i innate_immunity which is evolutionary ancient and ii adaptive_immunity which provides specific recognition and immunological memory cellular participants in the immune_and include antigen_presenting and phagocytic_cells such as macrophages significant progress has been made recently in understanding the biochemical_mechanisms by which lipopolysaccharide lps a bacterial_endotoxin which activates immune_cells particularly macrophages leads to sepsis septic_shock or systemic_inflammatory lps is a major component of the outer_membrane and one of the most potent microbial initiators of inflammation despite much effort unfortunately there is no effective therapy for this problem it is estimated that people die each year only in the usa of septic_shock or systemic inflammatory_syndrome thus a more detailed understanding of the molecular_mechanisms pathways underlying activation and deactivation of macrophages in response to lpson the id the description of the pathway is displayed in this page the user can find the paper information from where the information about this pathway was retrieved links to pubmed or details about the processes present in the model each process is represented by a unique icon detailed_descriptions of the used icons can be found at http macpak csml org statistics there are also links to several visualization simulation platforms such as cytoscape cell illustrator online and cell illustrator player users can also download the csml model from this page c the simulatable csml pathway model on cell illustrator player here is possible to run the simulation and observe what happens in the biological system d the pathway can be visualized on cytoscape and then saved in the numerous file_formats available by this platform for example after uploading on cytoscape the user can export the csml model in the xgmml vizmap sif and gml formats and use this file for further downstream_analysis in other platforms e the simulation of the pathway on cell illustrator online by using cio one can change the parameters of the model and visualize the results under different perturbations available then the provided value is used otherwise the quantity is set to a default value automatically by cell illustrator currently the knowledgebase contains pathways one for each review summing a total of entities i e mrna protein modified protein and complex processes binding phosphorylation activation ubiquitination for instance and connectors reactant process and processproduct relationship each reaction in this repository is annotated with one or more facts derived from the original literature as evidence since macpak is manually_curated by four researchers that built checked and double checked the csml models the quotations from the original publication can be used as a benchmark to test and evaluate the performance of text_mining tools that try to reconstruct pathways by using literature information for example consider the following process pmid in the facts section there is the sentence adaptor_protein called tab that mediates activation of tak by linking tak to traf this sentence was copied and pasted from the corresponding paper and used by the annotators to construct the csml model therefore text_mining researchers can evaluate their methods using these facts texts as inputs and evaluate the performance by comparing the output of their methods with the csml models that can be downloaded for non commercial use under the creative commons license in order to access each macrophage pathway the user only needs to input the name of the gene protein of interest or click on the suggested links in the web_page http macpak csml org then a list of pathways that contains the gene protein of interest is shown after selecting the pathway to be analyzed the web_page containing the information about the process is shown which has links to external databases like entrez_gene interpro and pubmed and an executable file that can be simulated under cytoscape cell illustrator online and cell illustrator player platforms shows an example of model that was obtained by analyzing the myd pathway using cell illustrator player is the output of cytoscape andis the simulation result using cell illustrator online
