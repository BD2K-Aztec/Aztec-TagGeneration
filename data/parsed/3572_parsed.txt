sequence_analysis ping an r bioconductor_package for nucleosome_positioning using next_generation data mnase seq and chip_seq have evolved as popular techniques to study chromatin and histone_modification although many tools have been developed to identify enriched regions software_tools for nucleosome_positioning are still limited we introduce a flexible and powerful open_source r package ping for nucleosome_positioning using mnase seq data or mnase or sonicated chip_seq combined with either single_end or paired_end ping uses a model based_approach which enables nucleosome predictions even in the presence of low read_counts we illustrate ping using two paired_end datasets from saccharomyces_cerevisiae and compare its performance with nucler and chipseqr availability ping is available from the bioconductor website at http bioconductor org it can run on linux mac and windows the nucleosome is the basic structural_unit of chromatin which is composed of a nucleosomal core including bp of dna wrapped around a central histone_octamer h a h b h and h and linker dna connecting nucleosomal core to the next nucleosomes control cellular_processes by affecting the accessibility of proteins to the dna which can act on gene_expression and other dna dependent_processes projects like encode encode_project have generated large_amounts of chip_seq and mnase seq data that can be used to improve our understanding of nucleosome_positioning and its impact on gene_regulation however these data require efficient tools that can be used regardless of the experimental_protocols employed several statistical_approaches were recently_developed for analyzing nucleosome based data introduced the template filter method that models forward and reverse reads based on predefined peak shapes developed the nucleosome_positioning from sequencing nps method that uses read pile ups followed by wavelet de_noising for identifying positioned nucleosomes more recent pile upbased approaches include the chipseqr and nucler r packages available from bioconductor in a bayesian context have developed normal which uses mixture_models to infer nucleosome_positions all the tools described above were originally developed for single_end se sequencing_data where data provide only one side of dna_fragments and as such the length of the dna_fragments must be provided as input or estimated from the data to resolve this ambiguity and give more information paired_end pe protocols have been developed and are gradually being highlighted in experiments because pe data provide_important about dna_fragment length they can potentially lead to more precise estimates of nucleosome_positions though formal comparisons of nucleome positioning obtained from se and pe data are still lacking here we present a new software_tool for nucleosome_positioning ping which extends our probabilistic_framework for se chipseq and mnase seq data ping is a major update of an early unpublished version of the software and includes a novel statistical_framework for pe data new functions for pre_processing and reading raw_data and better integration with other bioconductor_packages the result is a complete framework for nucleosome_positioning within bioconductor that can handle sonicated and mnase protocols combined with either se or pe sequencing we compare ping with two other bioconductor_packages nucler and chipseqr using two novel pe saccharomyces_cerevisiae datasets available from geo gse generated specifically for this work we applied ping to two pe s cerevisiae datasets generated for this article total and h a z mnase and compared its performance with nucler and chipseqr as can be seen in the pe version of ping leads to the detection of more nucleosomes that are supported by additional variation in the pile up profile however the se version also leads to accurate nucleosome_positioning this is confirmed in our comparison study where we show that ping se based_predictions match their pe based ones well and better than nucler and chipseqr in particular nuclers pe predictions appear to be biased toward high_density regions where the algorithms tend to predict many overlapping nucleosomes supplementary figs s and s in our comparison we also looked at the stability of the predictions when the datasets are subsampled globally nucler and ping lead to stable predictions for both se and pe while chipseqrs predictions are more noisy and poorly match the results from the full data see_supplementary for more details nucleosome_positions identified by ping in a subset of chri from our total mnase data using both se and pe data the se data were generated by simply discarding one pe read at random and the corresponding pile up profile was obtained by extended reads to an average length of the pe dna_fragments the number of nucleosomes estimated from pe is greater as it provides more detailed information as shown by the pe pile up profile
