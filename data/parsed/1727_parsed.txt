systems_biology facets multi_faceted functional decomposition of protein_interaction motivation the availability of large_scale curated protein interaction datasets has given rise to the opportunity to investigate higher_level organization and modularity within the proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network using graph_theoretic analysis despite the recent_progress systems level analysis of high_throughput ppis remains a daunting task because of the amount of data they present in this article we propose a novel ppi_network decomposition algorithm called facets in order to make sense of the deluge of interaction data using gene_ontology go annotations facets finds not just a single functional decomposition of the ppi_network but a multi_faceted atlas of functional decompositions that portray alternative perspectives of the functional landscape of the underlying ppi_network each facet in the atlas represents a distinct interpretation of how the network can be functionally decomposed and organized our algorithm maximizes interpretative value of the atlas by optimizing inter facet orthogonality and intra facet cluster modularity results we tested our algorithm on the global networks from intact and compared it with gold_standard datasets from mips and kegg we demonstrated the performance of facets we also performed a case study that illustrates the utility of our approach contact the massive amount of biological interaction datasets presents the opportunity to study higher_order organization and modularity of interaction networks high_throughput interaction experiments however introduce new challenges to visualization and analysis of biological interaction data a common thread that runs through high_throughput generated data is information overload i e the explosion of data that makes intuitive and meaningful functional analysis difficult even overwhelming in case of proteinprotein_interaction ppi data decomposing the network into functional_modules is often the key_step to understanding the overall picture of the functional_relationships that underlie the data consequently graph clustering_methods that decompose ppi_networks into their functional constituents are increasingly pertinent in general graph clustering_algorithms discover regions of dense connectivity that represent protein_complexes or functionally coherent processes unfortunately these methods output only a single optimal functional decomposition of the ppi_network consequently a ppi_network can only be decomposed and viewed from a single perspective whereas in reality there are often multiple different perspectives decompositions associated with the functional_organization of the underlying_network all of which are distinct and equally valid we refer to each of these decompositions as a facet because they visualize the organization of a ppi_network from a unique view providing a distinct interpretation of the organization of the underlying_network for example consider the toy transcriptional_regulatory depicted in a typical decomposition based on an existing graph_clustering technique e g mcode in identifies dense regions of the network which correspond to the decomposition of protein_complexes as shown in facet however this network can also be viewed from other different perspectives for instance it can be organized by the types of signaling_pathways involved in it facet notice that the decomposition from this perspective is markedly different from the complex based decomposition furthermore different proteins in the network may undergo various modifications such as acetylation phosphorylation and ubiquitination hence yet another way to decompose the network is by their modification effects as depicted in facet clearly in larger real_world networks the possibility of uncovering multiple distinct_functional decompositions are real at first glance it may seem that we can tune the clustering parameters of existing graph_clustering techniques in order to generate multiple facets or decompositions unfortunately such tuning only generates an exponential number of slightly perturbed decompositions with incremental differences see_supplementary in other words such strategy does not generate functionally unique decompositions in contrast it is imperative to ensure that the decompositions or facets are distinctive i e they are maximally different from each other this is because every facet should provide a fresh and informative perspective to the organization of the network rather than providing just incremental differences with respect to other facets to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license

that discovers an atlas of functionally unique decompositions from a ppi_network portraying alternative views of the functional landscape of the network detailed in section each decomposition or facet represents a distinct interpretation of how the network can be functionally decomposed and organized since a key objective is to obtain n unique facets that are informative and orthogonal we use the term orthogonal to describe the idea of distinctive clusters rather than its precise mathematical meaning our algorithm maximizes interpretative value of the atlas by optimizing intra facet cluster modularity and inter facet orthogonality intra facet cluster modularity captures the aim of decomposing a ppi_network g based on a particular functional and or structural view for instance based on complexes and localized structures g can be decomposed into protein_complexes if we consider regulatory_processes as a functional concept then g can be decomposed into signaling and regulation pathways an entirely different decomposition inter facet orthogonality on the other hand demands that each of the n facets are structurally distinctive and functionally apart from each other we propose a novel objective_function that models these intuitions and facets exploit it to discover a set of distinct facets specifically we exploit both the ppi graph_structure and the rich functional information provided by gene_ontology go annotations to guide facets construction in section we evaluate the performance of facets on real_world ppi datasets we also compare facets generated decompositions against several gold_standard datasets we demonstrate its superiority over tested graph clustering_methods we illustrate the robustness of facets against noise finally we conduct a case study to illustrate how multi_faceted decompositions identified multiple organization maps of the human autophagy system related work multi view clustering is a poorly_studied problem in the data_mining community still there are several works that have focused on multi view clusterings in image and text_mining domain one approach projects data into an alternative subspace another approach generates alternative clustering through the use of must link and cannot link constraints in meta clustering a large number of clusters are generated and clusters which are truly different are selected all of the aforementioned approaches however assume data_points in the vector space that allow the notion of metric distances in a euclidean geometry on the other hand our problem demands a multi view clustering methodology on attributed graphs which requires a graph_clustering paradigm on both structure and annotation to the best of our knowledge multi view clustering paradigm has not been applied in clustering biological_networks to identify pertinent functional_modules from multiple_perspectives ensemble clustering_methods generate an ensemble of nearoptimal decompositions these methods have been used to increase the quality and confidence of the decomposition and understand network_dynamics the nearoptimal decompositions generated however have no notion of the orthogonality that this work is seeking instead ensemble clusterings create a large number of perturbed solutions making them unsuitable as an atlas of functionally_distinct decompositions for instance in a small network of nodes generated at least permutations of clusterings in this article we propose facets a data_driven and generic algorithm for generating multi_faceted functional decompositionsof a ppi_network providing multiple_perspectives of the functional_organization landscape of the network our experimental_validation with real_world ppi_networks demonstrates effectiveness of facets in generating functionally distinctive facets as future work we intend to extend facets to evaluate both annotated and unannotated regions of the ppi_network conflict of interest none declared
