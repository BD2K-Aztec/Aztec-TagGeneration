databases_and codnas a database of conformational diversity in the native_state of proteins motivation conformational diversity is a key concept in the understanding of different issues related with protein_function such as the study of catalytic processes in enzymes protein protein recognition protein evolution and the origins of new biological_functions here we present a database of proteins with different degrees of conformational diversity conformational diversity of native_state codnas is a redundant collection of three_dimensional structures for the same protein derived from protein_data structures for the same protein obtained under different crystallographic conditions have been associated with snapshots of protein dynamism and consequently could characterize protein conformers codnas allows the user to explore global and local structural_differences among confor mers as a function of different parameters such as presence of ligand post_translational changes in oligomeric states and differences in ph and temperature additionally codnas contains information about protein taxonomy and function disorder level and structural_classification offering useful information to explore the underlying mechanism of conformational diversity and its close relationship with protein_function currently codnas has structures integrating entries with an average of confor mers per protein availability the database is freely_available www codnas com ar it is well established that the native_state of a protein is represented by an ensemble of conformers in equilibrium different factors such as ligands post_translational or ph variations could shift this equilibrium toward a given conformer following conformational selection theory the change in the dynamic landscape and the re distribution of conformer population is a key feature to understand protein_function it has been shown that different structures for the same protein obtained under different conditions represent snapshots of protein dynamism and then characterize putative structural conformers here we describe the design development and use of a database of proteins showing different degrees of conformational diversity conformational diversity of native_state codnas is a collection of redundant structures obtained from different experimental_protocols for the same protein codnas is a database of complete proteins linked with protein conformational database a previous development from our group oriented to the analysis of conformational diversity in protein_domains the database is extensively linked with physicochemical and biological_information and it is designed to allow the user to explore how different parameters could modulate protein conformational diversity conformational diversity is a key feature to understand protein_function and evolution enzyme catalysis and molecular_recognition recently it has been shown that explicit consideration of conformational diversity improves prediction of disease related mutations and protein_protein and molecular_docking as computational_prediction of large conformational changes could be challenging e g using molecular_dynamics codnas database could provide a useful dataset to test new tools to predict and explore possible causes of conformational diversity in proteins
