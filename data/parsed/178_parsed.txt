a hierarchical_bayesian for flexible module discovery in three way time series data motivation detecting modules of coordinated activity is fundamental in the analysis of large biological studies for two_dimensional data e g genes patients this is often done via clustering or biclustering more recently studies monitoring patients over time have added another dimension analysis is much more challenging in this case especially when time measurements are not synchronized new methods that can analyze three way data are thus needed results we present a new algorithm for finding coherent and flexible modules in three way data our method can identify both core modules that appear in multiple patients and patient specific augmentations of these core modules that contain additional genes our algorithm is based on a hierarchical bayesian data model and gibbs_sampling the algorithm outperforms extant methods on simulated and on real_data the method successfully dissected key components of septic_shock response from time series measurements of gene_expression detected patient specific module augmentations were informative for disease outcome in analyzing brain functional_magnetic time series of subjects at rest it detected the pertinent brain_regions involved availability_and r code and data are available atidentifying modules of elements acting in concert is a fundamental paradigm in interpreting visualizing and dissecting complex biomedical data for two_dimensional data e g genes versus conditions clustering is the simplest way to group the elements of one dimension biclustering seeks row and column subsets that manifest similarity such analysis has become standard in computational_biology algorithms for finding biclusters differ in how they define and identify biclusters for example biclusters were defined as sub matrices with constant values row or column additive or multiplicative values and submatrices with order preserving values recent_studies have extended the idea of biclustering to more complex input structures beyond the standard rowcolumn data extended the classic iterative signature algorithm isa to analyze a single matrix of time series data together with prior_knowledge on gene function to detect temporal transcription modules that are biologically_meaningful li and tuck introduced an algorithm for joint analysis of chip_chip and gene_expression data to find biclusters that are likely to be regulated by similar transcription_factors andproposed threeway clustering of gene condition organism data the algorithm ofuses sequence_information to integrate data across species and a post_processing step allows detection of species specific information cluster tissues hierarchically and then find the representative gene_set of each tissue cluster in the hierarchy a common data source that calls for three way analysis is a collection of gene_expression measured for a set of subjects over a series of time points hence the data are represented by a v c the author published_by we presented a novel problem formulation and algorithm for flexible three way clustering of multi matrix time course data we defined a core module as i a set of rows that are likely to be active together across a set of subjects and ii a set of active time points in each covered subject in addition each core module has subject specific private modules that can contain additional genes and have high overlap with the core module the set of active time points of a module can vary in size and times among subjects our model is much more flexible than existing_models first it allows different active time points for each subject thereby accommodating heterogeneity and asynchrony in the response of different subjects second different subjects can differ in their underlying features rows and time points columns the row set of a particular subject in a module does not necessarily cover all core module rows this property was crucial in the analysis of fmri data where it allowed discovering core modules that better covered active brain_regions in addition the row set of a private module can contain additional rows that represent subject specific signal this property was crucial in the gene_expression case as it allowed discovering patient specific up regulated immune_processes we compared twigs to seven other methods and showed that extant methods have difficulties in finding modules that cover many subjects whereas twigs easily finds modules that represent a biological_function shared by many subjects in addition our method outperformed other methods in terms of enrichment_analysis we employed additional metrics for evaluation in each domain other comparison criteria can be used in the future e g test likelihood or perplexity our current analysis has some limitations that can be addressed by future_studies first we assume that the data originated from two distributions f and f other approaches could be considered such as row based or column based additive models second our basic model deals with only a single module at a time more complex models and algorithms could be proposed to directly model multiple modules finally additional_tests are needed to fully_exploit the abilities of the model for example we focused only on testing a time window of size to find homogenous highly activated private modules
