primerdesign m a multiple_alignment based multiple primer_design tool for walking across variable genomes analyses of entire viral_genomes or mtdna requires comprehensive design of many primers across their genomes furthermore simultaneous optimization of several dna primer design_criteria may improve overall experimental efficiency and downstream bioinformatic processing to achieve these goals we developed primerdesign m it includes several options for multiple primer_design allowing researchers to efficiently design walking primers that cover long dna targets such as entire hiv genomes and that optimizes primers simultaneously informed by genetic_diversity in multiple_alignments and experimental_design constraints given by the user primerdesign m can also design primers that include dna_barcodes and minimize primer dimer ization primerdesign m finds optimal primers for highly_variable dna targets and facilitates design flexibility by suggesting alternative designs to adapt to experimental_conditions availability_and primerdesign m is available as a webtool at http www hiv lanl gov content sequence primer_design primer_design html contact tkl lanl gov or seq info lanl gov primer_design is complicated by many factors including desired primer specificity or promiscuity restrictions in polymerase_chain pcr or sequencing lengths matching of melting_temperatures heterogeneous evolutionary_rates across genomes avoiding primerprimer dimerization and integrating bio barcodes typically the process of finding the optimal placements for primers is a serial process in which each of the design_criteria are optimized one at a time this is unfortunate as one design step may influence another thus designing primers while optimizing all design_criteria simultaneously is desirable because no existing software was able to do that we recently_developed a tool that could include all these factors given a multiple_alignment and user input on desired constraints to design primer_pairs for single fragment analyses however with the increased abilities of next_generation ngs a need to design optimal multiple fragment analyses such as tiled fragments that cover entire small_genomes has rapidly emerged many previous primer_design software have focused on special purposes such as multiplexing degenerate sites discriminate amplification nested_pcr single_nucleotide snp protocols and hybridization analyses such as micro arrays and in situ_hybridization and dna_sequencing more generic software such as primer base their design on a single_sequence which inadvertently could place primers in more variable_regions leading to annealing failure with some templates or selective amplification in diverse populations motivated by the large genetic_diversity found in human_immunodeficiency hiv and simian_immunodeficiency siv and the need for a generic design tool that could dynamically optimize primers across their genomes we developed primerdesign m it can be used to design single or multiple fragment primers to any aligned set of dna_sequences regardless of diversity level and organism primerdesign m can design primers for both single fragment analyses as well as multiple fragment walking primer analyses of highly_variable genomes and the designed primers have been experimentally confirmed to work primerdesign m should be useful to researchers in all fields of biology who need to design dna primers to make access easy guarantee that the latest_version of the tool is used and make the program independent of computer platform the software is available as a web_tool at the lanl hiv database conflict of interest none declared multiple fragment design of walking primers to analyze a large part of the genome of hiv subtype g the x axis shows alignment position according to the original input multiple_alignment and y axes show entropy green complexity red log scale and tm blue the grey region is the user specified roi primer_pairs for each designed fragment are displayed as green forward and red reverse arrowheads
