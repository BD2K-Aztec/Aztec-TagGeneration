genome_analysis estmoi estimating multiplicity of infection using parasite deep sequencing_data individuals_living in endemic_areas generally harbour multiple parasite strains multiplicity of infection moi can be an indicator of immune_status and transmission_intensity it has a potentially confounding_effect on a number of population_genetic which often assume isolates are clonal polymerase_chain based_approaches to estimate moi can lack sensitivity for example in the human_malaria genotyping of the merozoite_surface msp genes is a standard method for assessing moi despite the apparent problem of underestimation the availability of deep coverage data from massively parallizable sequen_cing technologies means that moi can be detected genome_wide by considering the abundance of heterozygous genotypes here we present a method to estimate moi which considers unique combinations of polymorphisms from sequence_reads the method is implemented within the estmoi software when applied to clinical p falciparum isolates from three continents we find that multiple_infections are common especially in regions with high_transmission availability_and estmoi is freely_available from http pathogenseq
