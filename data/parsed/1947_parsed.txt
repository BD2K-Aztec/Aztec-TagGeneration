geiger v an expanded suite of methods for fitting macroevolutionary models to phylogenetic_trees phylogenetic_comparative are essential for addressing evolutionary hypotheses with interspecific data the scale and scope of such data have increased dramatically in the past_few many existing_approaches are either computationally infeasible or inappropriate for data of this size to address both of these problems we present geiger v a complete overhaul of the popular r package geiger we have reimplemented existing_methods with more efficient algorithms and have developed several new approaches for accomodating heterogeneous models and data types availability_and this r package is available on the cran repository http cran r project org_web geiger all source_code is also available on github http github com mwpen nell geiger v geiger v depends on the ape package contact in the past_few phylogenetic_trees have become a key_component of evolutionary research this development has been fueled by the increased availability of robust time calibrated phylogenies for many groups in addition to an expanding number of statistical_techniques for inferring patterns and processes from comparative_data reviewed in among the many r packages developed for phylogenetic and comparative_data e g geiger has been a primary utility for making macroevolutionary inferences from phylogenetic_trees however in the years since the initial release of geiger the data available for comparative biology have changed substantially for some groups we now have phylogenies and corresponding trait data with thousands and even tens_of of species e g geiger v is a complete overhaul of the previous release designed to scale up comparative_methods to large_datasets to do so we have taken two complementary tacks the first is to improve algorithms and implementations to increase computational_efficiency of existing_methods the second is to expand the suite of statistical_approaches to allow for heterogeneity in both models and data types across the phylogeny in this applications note we briefly describe the methods now in geiger with a particular focus on novel implementations and algorithms most of these methods have been previously_published elsewhere in some form and we refer readers to the relevant publications for full explanations for an overview of the main features of the package see appendix in supplementary_material the function fitdiscrete we have rewritten this function for geiger v again using an alternative more efficient algorithm for calculating the likelihood of observing trait_values under a model in the new version of fitdiscrete the computational time required for the likelihood calculation scales approximately linearly with the number of character states whereas the previous version scaled superlinearly see appendix in supplementary_material for details this improvement allows for more complex models to be efficiently fit to large phylogenies in this note we provide a broad overview of the methods now available in geiger we have not discussed some methods implemented in geiger e g congruification for time scaling large trees and many of the nuances of the methods described here have been left out we refer readers to associated publications and the package documentation for more information it is an exciting time for macroevolutionary research we now have access to datasets of unparalleled size and a wide_variety of new statistical_approaches with which to analyze them we hope that the software presented here will help researchers address some fundamental and long_standing questions in macroevolution
