detecting and understanding genetic and structural_features in hiv b subtype v underlying hiv co receptor usage motivation to define v genetic_elements and structural_features underlying different hiv co receptor usage in vivo results by probabilistically modeling mutations in the viruses isolated from hiv b subtype patients we present a unique statistical_procedure that would first identify v determinants associated with the usage of different co receptors cooperatively or independently and then delineate the complicated interactions among mutations functioning cooperatively we built a model based on dual usage of cxcr and ccr co receptors the molecular basis of our statistical predictions is further confirmed by phenotypic and molecular model ing analyses our results provide new insights on molecular basis of different hiv co receptor usage this is critical to optimize the use of genotypic tropism testing in clinical practice and to obtain molecular implication for design of vaccine and new entry inhibitors hiv is the etiological_agent of the acquired_immunodeficiency affecting million people worldwide world_health http www who int hiv en hiv is an enveloped virus with a single_stranded rna_genome that mainly infects cd lymphocytes and macrophages hiv_entry is a complex and intricate process that facilitates the delivery of hiv_genome into the host_cell the only viral surface protein envelope env is composed of a trimer of gp and gp heterodimers to enter the target cell hiv requires a coordinated interaction of the envelope_glycoprotein gp with the cd receptor and with one of the chemokine_receptors mainly cc_chemokine type ccr or c x c chemokine_receptor type cxcr hiv_strains can be phenotypically classified according to virus ability to use the ccr and or cxcr co receptor thus pure r tropic and pure x tropic virus can use only the ccr and cxcr co receptors to enter the target cell respectively whereas dual tropic virus can use both co receptors hiv co receptor usage is so_far of central pathological importance it has been shown that r tropic viruses are generally responsible for the establishment of the initial infection and predominate in the majority of newly hiv_infected whereas the use of the cxcr co receptor is generally observed in more advanced_stages of disease and it has been associated with a more rapid cd decline and progression to aids the determination of hiv co receptor usage is also critical as the ccr co receptor has recently become the target of a new class of anti_hiv drugs that specifically inhibit the entry of ccr tropic hiv_strains into the target cells by allosteric inhibition of the ccr co receptor maraviroc is the first approved ccr antagonist that entered clinical practice in its administration is so_far recommended only in patients with pure r tropic viruses among the different domains of hiv_gp the v loop is so_far the focus_of efforts because it is the primary_determinant for hiv co receptor usage nevertheless a comprehensive map of v genetic_markers and structural_features underlying individually or in network the pure or dual usage of ccr and cxcr co receptor is still missing in particular limited information is available regarding v genetic_determinants underlying dual tropism this is critical as different studies have shown that high proportion of patients harbor dual mixed tropic viruses with prevalence ranging in drug navenave and in treatment experienced patients in this light using unique computational_methods along with structural analysis and docking_simulations this study is aimed at defining the v genetic_determinants and the structural_features underlying the ability of hiv to use the ccr and cxcr co receptors to whom correspondence should be addressed in this article we described a systematic approach for a better definition of v genetic_determinants underlying different co receptor usage in vivo this approach enabled us to capture sophisticate associations of v genetic_determinants among the usage of co receptors ccr and cxcr and even dual usage of them this information is critical to optimize the use of genotypic tropism testing in clinical practice and to obtain molecular implication for design of vaccine and new entry inhibitors in particular the current_algorithms for tropism prediction classify the virus with respect to its co receptor usage genetic using statistical_learning methods based on specific v sequence feature and in particular on amino_acid observed at specific v positions the genetic_determinants identified and characterized in this study can be used to improve predictive performances of such algorithms we proposed an advanced model to detect mutation associated with different co receptor usage and to infer detailed interaction structures among these mutations we focused on three cases viruses using ccr co receptor cxcr co receptor only or dual of ccr cxcr co receptor a bpducm seeking possible partitions was applied to define v genetic_determinants either independently or interactively associated with the usage of those three cases efforts were also being taken to infer dependency_structure among cooperative associations through rms procedure positions and were further partitioned into two interaction subgroups and and and the molecular_basis the mechanisms of action of such determinants has been further unraveled by docking analysis and free_energy specifically our thermodynamic results confirmed the observation that mutations at positions and were found almost exclusively in cxcr using or dual tropic viruses supplementary in particular g e i m and i t substitutions were found to be associated with remarkably favorable cxcr affinity profiles such a finding could be related to a strong electrostatic contribution of r for the co receptor_recognition in presence of the negatively_charged glutamate that acts as a bridge between r and cxcr n terminus supplementary by contrast in the i m and i t best poses this weight decreased as the co receptor was able to establish one hb with c and good contacts with a supplementary another interesting result was obtained in cxcr gp recognition in presence of the s r substitution associated with a favorable thermodynamic profile of the co receptor specifically in the best optimized configuration we observed a strong electrostatic repulsion between the positively_charged r and r such a finding was related to a shift of the arginine at position and its consequent involvement in an hb with a glutamic residue of the cxcr n terminus interaction not found in the wt sequence moreover in the wt gp cd ccr complex serine at position was involved in hb with threonine at position interestingly in the wt gp cd cxcr optimized configuration in addition to these hydrogen_bonds s established other hb with n consequently we noticed a remarkable shift of the terminal part of v loop in gp cd cxcr complex with a conformational fold responsible for a rmsd root_mean calculated on v residues with respect to gp cd ccr complex equal to a interestingly position was found to be related to the best cxcr affinity profile in particular when mutation h y n was associated with substitutions at position analyzing the component interaction data such a finding could be justified by the strong contribution of c and s residues in cxcr recognition in particular the co presence of mutations h n q k associated with cxcr usage was involved in the most significant affinity improvement because of the co receptor ability in establishing two hb with c moreover the comparison of such a mutated complex with respect to the wt revealed some interesting structural_insights in fact in the wt best pose cxcr was found able to establish two hb and several vdw interactions with q whereas hystidine at position resulted implicated in an intramolecular hb with n this contacts network could probably explain the conformational_change observed in presence of the double_mutation h n q k in particular in this case no intramolecular interaction was noticed and cxcr was found to get closer to the gp c conserved domain not involved in the co receptor_recognition of the wt complex supplementary a previous study highlighted the presence of genetic_determinants in c domain critical for co receptor usage even independently from the use of cd here we provide structural basis explaining the involvement of c domain in mechanisms_underlying the usage of cxcr co receptor some interesting structural details were also revealed in presence of q k r and h y mutations with a particular remark when they were associated specifically in q k and h y mutated complexes ccr n terminus was able to establish an hb with c and k respectively by means of its tyrosine terminal residue these interactions were probably responsible for the co receptor shift from the gp v loop with the superimposition of gp cd ccr complex cyan with respect to gp cd cxcr complex light magenta in wt sequence the glycoprotein is shown as ribbon whereas the gp residues involved in hbs indicated as black dashed lines are represented as cyan and light magenta carbon sticks respectively the rmsd value is reported and expressed in angstrom consequent loss of crucial contacts with e and r and a final unfavorable thermodynamic profile if compared with the wt sequence interestingly the co presence of q k and h y substitutions associated with an increased ccr binding_affinity with respect to the wt and to the single_mutations was related to a significant co receptor conformational_change because of a better accommodation of the sulfotyrosine at position able to establish an additional hb with r conversely when the glutamine at position was replaced by an arginine we observed a remarkable conformational_change of the ccr sulfotyrosine at position in particular with respect to the wt complex where huangs geometries were well reproduced tys dihedral_angle resulted completely inverted with respect to the wt causing the lack of crucial hb with r supplementary moreover ccr n terminus terminal tyrosine was able to establish an additional hb with k with the co receptor shift from the gp v loop and a final destabilizing effect in the glycoprotein recognition step in cxcr gp mutated complexes we observed that the increased co receptor_affinity versus gp could be attributed to a conformational rearrangement of the sulfotyrosines in particular in presence of the single_mutations q k and q r tys resulted closer to v loop with remarkable co receptor stabilization because of its additional hb with s interestingly the presence of h y mutation single or associated with the substitutions at position caused a further conformational accommodation of cxcr n terminus with a shift of tys which was well stabilized by several hb with n n n and t residues such an additional conformational_change allowed us to assume that the remarkably_increased cxcr affinity mainly depends on the mutation at position rather than at position in conclusion new genetic_determinants of tropism within the v domain have been detected and confirmed by phenotypic and molecular_modeling analysis additionally our gbpm analysis led us to recognize the most relevant structural_features of gp v loop associated with both co receptors and the most pivotal proteinprotein occurring interactions into all the analyzed complexes independently from their chemical nature these observations could clear the way for the application of a virtual_screening method able to identify novel scaffolds as potential entry inhibitors and for the development of new pharmacophoric models helpful in the drug_discovery vaccine_design and clinical disease management
