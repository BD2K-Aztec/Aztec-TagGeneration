structural_bioinformatics oxfold kinetic folding of rna using stochastic_context and evolutionary_information motivation many computational_methods for rna_secondary and in particular for the prediction of a consensus structure of an alignment of rna_sequences have been developed most methods however ignore biophysical factors such as the kin etics of rna_folding no current_implementation considers both evolutionary_information and folding kinetics thus losing information that when considered might lead to better predictions results we present an iterative algorithm oxfold in the framework of stochastic_context that emulates the kinetics of rna_folding in a simplified way in combination with a molecular_evolution model this method improves considerably on existing grammatical models that do not consider folding kinetics additionally the model compares favourably to non kinetic thermodynamic models the function of ribonucleic_acid molecules rna is known to depend on their d structure which in turn depends on their secondary_structure a scaffold of base_pairs formed by hydrogen_bonds between nucleotides for thermodynamic_stability and molecular_function accurate prediction of rna_secondary however falls short of being adequately solved by contrast the spreading of next_generation and new methods in transcriptomics has increased the importance of rna_secondary this is exemplified by the growing amount of biological rna data available in databases such as rfam and rna strand computational rna_secondary prediction_methods have been used for a number of years some of the first attempts e g simply evaluate the free_energy of all possible secondary_structures postulating that the minimum_free is the functional one these thermodynamic models were later refined to take into account biological and thermodynamic principles and are used to great effect in algorithms such as rnafold and unafold which rely on a large number of experimentally_determined parameters alternative_approaches use the framework of stochastic_context scfgs to find the most likely structure given their training data postulating that this is the functional structure among the first to describe such models were eddy and durbin many different grammatical models for rna_secondary have been implemented if one seeks to build better grammatical models for rna_secondary one can take essentially two different routes build more complex grammars that express higher_order dependencies such as base_pair stacking and for instance thereby emulate the nearest_neighbour model underlying thermodynamic approaches include additional biological and physical information about the sequences for example at the level of the previous pairing and unpairing probabilities of the grammar the former approach has been taken by nebel and scheid and the latter developed a language to translate a wide_variety of probabilistic and thermodynamic models for rna_secondary into the language of scfgs yielding highly complex grammars with a large number of parameters however we follow the latter approach which was pioneered by who coupled a simple grammar to an evolutionary model to obtain better estimates of the previous base_pairing probabilities when folding an alignment of rna_sequences most current approaches to rna_secondary are static insofar as they assess structures based on their constituent elements like base_pairs and loops but with no contribution from the path followed to form these to whom correspondence should be addressed elements insofar as they fold sequences in one go and thereby ignore the mechanisms of folding the importance of folding mechanisms was noted by who studied the folding of intermediary stems we note that the differences between real structures and the minimum energy states are believed to be determined mainly by defects in the energy rules used or by the existence of specific folding pathways capturing molecules in local_minima just as comparative structure_prediction is based on the observation that structure is important for function and hence conserved as folding kinetics is important for either guiding or determining structure formation we would expect evolution to exert selection on the kinetics too previously evolutionary_models and kinetic_models e g have been implemented but they have not been combined it is therefore important to implement folding kinetics in an evolutionary framework in this article we work in the framework of the fundamental problem of predicting a consensus structure for a given fixed alignment of rna_sequences we incorporate folding kinetics in a simplified way into an evolutionary grammatical model in an iterative framework further we introduce a distance_function to incorporate information about the relationships between different pairs of columns thus adopting the second of the aforementioned approaches the resulting model is benchmarked against ppfold sukosdsuko a parallelized implementation of the pfold algorithm of additionally we compare it with a thermodynamic_model rnaalifold
