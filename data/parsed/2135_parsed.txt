group combined p values with applications to genetic_association motivation in large_scale genetic_association with tens of hundreds of single nucleotide poly morphisms snps genotyped the traditional statistical_framework of logistic_regression using maximum_likelihood mle to infer the odds_ratios of snps may not work appropriately this is because a large number of odds_ratios need to be estimated and the mles may be not stable when some of the snps are in high linkage_disequilibrium under this situation the p value combination procedures seem to provide good alternatives as they are constructed on the basis of single marker analysis results the commonly used p value combination methods such as the fishers combined test the truncated product method the truncated tail strength and the adaptive rank truncated product may lose power when the significance_level varies across snps to tackle this problem a group combined p value method gcp is proposed where the p values are divided_into multiple groups and then are combined at the group level with this strategy the significance values are integrated at different levels and the power is improved simulation shows that the gcp can effectively control the type_i and have additional power over the existing methodsthe power increase can be as high as over under some situations the proposed gcp method is applied to data from the genetic_analysis among all the methods only the gcp and artp can give the significance to identify a genomic_region covering gene dsc being associated with rheumatoid_arthritis but the gcp provides smaller p value availability_and in the past_two more than ten thousands genetic_markers have been identified to be associated with many human complex_diseases using genome_wide where single marker analysis was adopted in the post genome era the use of multimarker analysis where several markers are analyzed in the same model provides a powerful solution in large_scale genetic_association to detect the association between a gene or a genomic_region which may host tens of hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphismssnps and complex human_diseases in large_scale genetic_studies the traditional method of logistic_regression may not work appropriately this is because it employs the likelihood_function and uses the maximum_likelihood approach to estimate the odds_ratios and a high_dimensional problem needs to be optimized the global solution is difficult to find and also in some cases when the snps are in high linkage_disequilibrium ld the hessian matrix derived from the likelihood_function may be singular and thus the solution is not stable a useful alternative strategy is to analyze the snps one by one and then combine the p values together for combining the p values one popular choice is the fishers method also referred to as the fishers combined test fct if the m p values to be combined are independent the fct statistic follows the chi_squared distribution with m degrees_of if these m p values are correlated the re sample methods are recommended to obtain the empirical distribution of the fct otherwise the type_i may be inflated the fct has been widely_applied in genetic_association however it may lose power when the degrees_of are large and most of the snps are not significant to tackle this problem combining the truncated p values have been recommended proposed to combine the k smallest p values as the test_statistic however the power of this approach is very sensitive to the value of kan inappropriate k results in combing some non significant p values and power_loss especially when m is large suggested using multiple candidate truncation points and proposed an adaptive rank truncated product method artp this method can efficiently and flexibly accumulate association evidence across snps and remove the subjectivity of choosing k to some extent instead of combining the k smallest p values zaykin proposed a truncated product method tpm by using the product of only those p values smaller than a specified threshold by choosing a proper cut point such as the tpm increases power recently jiang proposed a truncated tail strength statistic tts which was proved to have higher power than the tail strength method and the fct under certain scenarios chen proposed a sequential test which was shown to have almost the same power with the artp taking a closer look at the truncated combined p value procedures we found that the p values are divided_into two groups and that the group with smaller p values is used to construct the test_statistics to develop a more powerful test for identifying genetic_association our proposal is to divide the p values into three or more groups in each group a test_statistic is constructed the test_statistics are then combined to form an omnibus test the proposed grouping strategy has sound basis biologically snps in a certain genomic_region can be divided_into multiple blocks with high_ld within blocks and low ld between blocks in one block if there is a snp associated with a disease then it is likely that all snps in this block are associated with the disease because of ld statistically such snps form the groups of interest in fact any p value combination procedures can be seen as different combinations using functions the fct uses f p the artp can also be regarded as hp p p m min j j b qk j where b qk j is the estimated p value for the statistic q kj i p i and k j j j are a set of prespecified candidates since there does not exist the uniformly optimal function of combining p values as an extension of the tpm with setting j in our method where the number of group is one we use two functions log and the cumulative_distribution of two degrees_of to combine the p values when the p values are independent and each p value has the significance the fct is more powerful than the gcp and if these p values are correlated and few p values show significances the gcp is more powerful than the fct extensive computer simulations show that the proposed test is more powerful than the existing combined tests while maintaining a good control of type_i in the analysis of the genetic_analysis data the proposed method can successfully detect the association between a genomic_region covering gene dsc and rheumatoid_arthritis which might be missed by some other existing p values combination methods in large_scale genetic_association usually tens of hundreds of snps are genotyped and tested the traditional statistical_framework such as the logistic_regression needs to solve a multidimensional optimization_problem on odds_ratios it is difficult to find the global solution and sometimes the solution is not stable or there may be multiple solutions when the snps are in high_ld to tackle this problem we have developed a gcp method this method is built on single marker analysis and can be easily applied to testing a large number of snps advancing from the existing alternatives the the empirical powers of the fct the tpm the tts the artp and the gcp for m or the data were generated using gaussian copula tcopula with the

valuesgcp integrates the information significance at different levels and improves power the proposed gcp can have applications far beyond this article as the first example we consider the analysis of different complex human_diseases which can be correlated simultaneously analyzing genetic_variants associated with multiple correlated diseases or traits can help investigators understand the genetic_architecture of diseases and improve the power to identify deleterious genetic_variants in such analysis quite often more than phenotypes and a genetic_variant are studied at a time the proposed gcp can be directly applied to this example in addition the proposed gcp can also be used to detect the associations between multiple genetic_variants and multiple_phenotypes one can first use a multistep combined principal component method or multivariate linear_mixed to obtain the p value for the association between each variant and multiple_phenotypes and then employ the gcp to combine them to obtain the p value under the gcp potentially a two layer resampling procedure needs to be conducted first an inner layer of bootstrap or permutation procedure is required to obtain the distribution of test_statistic at the group level then a second layer of bootstrap or permutation procedure is needed to obtain the distribution of the gcp this can be computational intensive especially when the nominal significance_level is small one needs to conduct millions of bootstrap or permutation steps to obtain a valid p value to overcome this obstacle we proposed a one layer permutation procedure to obtain the p value in this work the simulations and data analysis have been focused on binary_traits it is noted that the gcp is flexible and can be applied to other types of phenotypes in large_scale genetic_studies if the trait is quantitative we can first use the linear_regression to obtain the p value for each snp when the normal assumption holds and then combine them together when the normal distribution does not hold even after transformation one can use the nonparametric trend tests to analyze one snp at a time with or without considering the genetic_models and then employ the proposed method to construct the omnibus test if the phenotype is ordinal the score test derived from the proportional odds model can be first used to obtain the p value for each snp and then the p values can be combined using the proposed method from the simulations the power difference between the gcp and other methods may be attributable to the number of markers associated with the diseases for the dependence on the data_structure the gcp can obtain more power than other methods when each group has a certain amount of p values the distributions of pvalues have been shown inandin the online supplementary_material while as the increasing of the number of associated markers the power of all the methods will increase and then the power difference between the gcp and others may reduce the simulation_results also show that the gcp performs better than the fct tpm and tts consistently towards the artp the gcp has obtained a uniformly higher power when the data are generated using t copula for the gaussian copula the gcp and artp have its own sweet spots but overall the power difference between the gcp and artp is larger for t copula than that for gaussian copula please see figures therefore our method is more robust than the artp if the assumption of normality is not considered however the proposed method has some drawbacks first as difficulty of deriving the exact distribution of the gcp we need to use empirical cumulative distribution to obtain its p value in a large_scale genetic_association study for example when m is large say a million or bigger the computation can be very intensive also the distribution function of the gcp cannot be computed second theoretically the number of groups j does not depend on the number of snps however in practice we dont know j the data_driven selection of j might be slightly correlated with the number of snps third the proposed method is constructed based on the individual p values which can be obtained by single marker analysis for the selection of the thresholds we proposed to use and they are not optimal and depend on the structure of the data to overcome it one possible scheme is to adopt some alternative thresholds and use the maximum of the gcp on these thresholds as the final test_statistics and use the bootstrap or permutation to assess its statistical_significance
