combined prediction of tat and sec signal_peptides with hidden_markov models_motivation computational_prediction of signal_peptides is of great_importance in computational_biology in addition to the general secretory_pathway sec bacteria archaea and chloroplasts possess another major pathway that utilizes the twin_arginine translocase tat which recognizes longer and less hydrophobic signal_peptides carrying a distinctive pattern of two consecutive arginines rr in the n region a major functional differentiation between the sec and tat export pathways lies in the fact that the former translocates secreted_proteins unfolded through a protein conducting channel whereas the latter translocates completely folded_proteins using an unknown mechanism the purpose of this work is to develop a novel method for predicting and discriminating sec from tat signal_peptides at better accuracy results we report the development of a novel method pred tat which is capable of discriminating sec from tat signal_peptides and predicting their cleavage_sites the method is based on hidden_markov and possesses a modular_architecture suitable for both sec and tat signal_peptides on an independent test_set of experimentally_verified tat signal_peptides pred tat clearly outperforms the previously_proposed methods tatp and tatfind whereas when evaluated as a sec signal_peptide predictor compares_favorably to top scoring predictors such as signalp and phobius the method is freely_available for academic users at http www compgen org tools pred tat in all domains of life bacteria eukarya and archaea the majority of secreted_proteins are synthesized as precursors that carry a cleavable n_terminal signal_sequence the signal_peptide possesses a modular_architecture with a positively_charged region at the n terminus n region a hydrophobic region h region that spans the membrane and a c region of mostly small and uncharged residues ending at the characteristic cleavage_site the signal_peptide is necessary for targeting the protein to to whom correspondence should be addressed the membrane_embedded export machinery in bacteria eukaryotes and archaea upon translocation across the membrane the signal_peptide is cleaved from the precursor via a membrane_bound signal_peptidase in eukaryotes proteins targeted to the organelles of bacterial origin mitochondria and chloroplasts also contain cleavable n_terminal targeting_sequences although they are in general different from those found in the eukaryotic or bacterial secreted_proteins in addition to the general export pathway sec bacteria archaea and chloroplasts possess another major pathway that utilizes the twin_arginine translocase tat tat recognizes longer and less hydrophobic signal_peptides carrying a distinctive pattern of two consecutive arginines rr in the n region a major functional differentiation between sec and tat export pathways lies in the fact that the former translocates secreted_proteins unfolded through a protein conducting channel whereas the latter translocates completely folded_proteins using an unknown mechanism interestingly in halophilic archaea the components of the tat pathway are essential for viability and there is evidence that tat dependent_translocation is widely used as part of a mechanism for adaptation to extreme saline environments computational_prediction of signal_peptides was performed initially using weight matrices however neural_networks nns as well as hidden_markov hmms introduced by the signalp method have been proven to be the most successful methods currently available recently signalp was retrained and mainly due to better annotation and selection of the training_set yielded an even better accuracy the phobius and philius methods followed a different approach in which a graphical_model hmm and bayesian_network respectively was used to predict at the same time the presence of a secretory signal_peptide and transmembrane tm topology of a given protein minimizing thus the number of signal_peptides predicted as tm segments and vice_versa other methods such as lipop and pred lipo were developed during the last years for predicting lipoprotein signal_peptides which possess a distinctive cleavage_site with an indispensable cysteine responsible for anchoring to the membrane page and discriminate them from secretory signal_peptides although most of the methods mentioned so_far are capable up to a certain degree of predicting the tat signal_peptides only a few attempts were made toward predicting specifically this class of proteins tatfind was presented initially combining regular expression_patterns and hydrophobicity analysis whereas few years later tatp was presented using a combination of regular expression_patterns and nns tatp has been shown to be more reliable whereas tatfind is not capable of predicting the cleavage_site but only recognizes the existence of the n and h region another problem is that these methods are not trained to discriminate at the same time tat from sec signal_peptides and thus there is a need for combining these predictors with a generic signal_peptide predictor such as signalp in this work we present a novel method pred tat based on hmms which is capable of predicting and discriminating tat and sec signal_peptides we show that this new method is more accurate than the previously_developed methods and additionally compares_favorably to the top scoring_methods for the prediction of sec signal_peptides the prediction method is available for non commercial users at http www compgen org tools pred tat and we expect it to be useful to both experimentalists and bioinformaticians the detailed results obtained from the hmm method pred tat on the fold_cross procedure are presented in the form of a confusion matrix in supplementary table a whereas those concerning the independent test_set in supplementary table b in the cross_validation the model performs very well correctly classifying the out of the tat signal_peptides and predicts falsely only tat substrates all are actually sec signal_peptides yielding this way an mcc equal to pred tat in the cross_validation clearly outperforms the other available methods tatp tatfind and the profile_hmms being equally specific but far more sensitive even though the results obtained for these methods are not cross_validated i e some of the proteins tested were previously used for training these methods tatfind seems to perform better compared to tatp a fact mainly caused by tatps lower specificity in excluding sec signal_peptides interestingly the profile hmm that we created using hmmer pred tat hmmer outperforms both the other profile_hmms as well as tatfind and tatp being almost equally good to the custom hmm pred tat concerning the sec signal_peptides pred tat also produces satisfactory_results predicting correctly the presence of a signal_peptide in out of the proteins and excludes non signal_peptides with a rate of giving an overall mcc of these results compare favorably to those obtained by the other methods trained specifically page
