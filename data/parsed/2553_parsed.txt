structural_bioinformatics introducing drugster a comprehensive and fully integrated drug_design lead and structure optimization toolkit drugster is a fully interactive pipeline designed to break the command_line barrier and introduce a new user_friendly environment to perform drug_design lead and structure optimization experiments through an efficient combination of the pdb pqr ligbuilder gromacs and dock suites our platform features a novel workflow that guides the user through each logical step of the iterative d structural optimization setup and drug_design process by providing a seamless interface to all incorporated packages availability drugster can be freely downloaded via our dedicated server system at http www bioacademy gr bioinformatics drugster contact dvlachakis bioacademy gr drugster is a fully integrated perl tcl tk based interactive platform combining in a rational pipeline the algorithms of pdb pqr v ligbuilder v and v gromacs v and dock v all previously mentioned algorithms remain a native set of numerous unix based modules lacking a comprehensive and objectoriented graphical_user gui therefore drugster was developed to ease and automate the full task of setting up drug_design lead and structure optimization experiments all major d molecular viewers can be used for visualization purposes in this study we used pymol as molecular viewer in the beginning drugster addresses all common problems associated with pdb_file formatting and partial charges subsequently the receptor will be structurally optimized by energy_minimization using a variety of different force_fields as implemented into gromacs upon structural optimization the ligbuilder algorithm is used to generate novel molecules for the given site or to improve an existing lead compound dock is used to verify and evaluate the potential of each newly_designed ligand as it is used to re score all candidate compounds and search for better docking interactions finally the receptor_ligand complex is energetically minimized to reduce any residual geometrical strains and subsequently subjected to molecular_dynamics simulations mds allowing full degrees_of to both the ligand and the receptor there is an option for a final energy_minimization step after the mds of the scaffolding common core_structures that will be later generated and analysed then the user has the choice of either the growing or the linking algorithms of ligbuilder the combination of molecular_fragments starts automatically as soon as the user has completed the parameters setup section i e molecular_weight number of donors acceptors logp and other chemical_properties the third phase is the compound screening function where the elite molecules are selected for the next step ligand optimization and re scoring all ligand candidate molecules prepared in the previous step are subjected to docking_simulations using dock which are followed by energy minimizations em within the receptor the ligand_molecules are then re scored and re ranked notably at this stage em is performed allowing full degrees_of for both the ligand and the receptor this way a certain degree of receptor flexibility is allowed to the iterative drug_design process the re scoring approach is based on free_energy and compoundreceptor interaction analysis the scoring_functions included in dock are fast and versatile offering a reliable set of tools for scoring and re ranking our candidate compounds finally ligand topologies can be either automatically assigned or manually using freely_available dedicated software complex optimization the final step of the drugster pipeline is the automatic error_prone feeding of the top scoring candidate compounds to the docks molecular_dynamics engine here options include a force_field selector generator for the coordinate and topology files the setup of a periodic system solvation and the actual molecular_dynamics simu
