genome_analysis bwtool a tool for bigwig files bigwig files are a compressed indexed binary format for genome_wide signal data for calculations e g gc percent or experiments e g chip_seq rna_seq read_depth bwtool is a tool designed to read bigwig files rapidly and efficiently providing functionality for extracting data and summarizing it in several ways globally or at specific regions additionally the tool enables the conversion of the positions of signal data from one genome_assembly to another also known as lifting we believe bwtool can be useful for the analyst frequently working with bigwig data which is becoming a standard format to represent functional signals along genomes the article includes supplementary examples of running the software availability_and the c source_code is freely_available under the gnu public license v atfor many laboratories it has become an everyday task to generate or to analyze genome_wide data such as chip_seq read_depth to facilitate visualization of these data with tools such as the ucsc_genome or ensembl or for further processing it is common to use the wiggle wig file_format this format is not without a few disadvantages principally that the files can become large particularly when care is not taken to store the data at a minimally necessary decimal precision another disadvantage is that wiggles exist in three different forms the choice of which depends on the sparseness of the data programs that expect wig data do not always allow all three formats interchangeably the bigwig format was created as a means for the ucsc_genome to access real valued signal data remotely hosted on http ftp servers worldwide the format is binary compressed indexed and allows random_access to directly query a subset of the larger dataset in general programs designed to read bigwig files should treat remote urls of bigwigs the same as they would treat urls local to that computer bigwig uses an indexing strategy similar to other binary indexed formats such as bigbed binary sam bam and tabix based formats but unlike bam or tabix based formats bigwig is specific to numerical_data wig and bam are both common data_formats and are used by many applications e g model based analysis of chip_seq macs and mixture of isoforms miso respectively but to date there are not many applications that accommodate bigwig data we have created command_line software under the unix operating system called bwtool in a similar spirit to bedtools or samtools that offers the possibility to carry out a number of diverse operations on bigwigs in a convenient way until now the common procedure to access the data within bigwig files has been to use the tools available from ucsc bigwigtowig bigwigsummary bigwigaverageover bed bigwigmerge bigwigcorrelate or bigwiginfo these offer some basic usability for bigwigs bigwiginfo provides instant information about a bigwig file and is useful for glancing at the overall mean and standard_deviation as well as seeing how many bases are covered by the signal bigwigtowig is indispensible as it is occasionally necessary to convert a bigwig into the original wig to use legacy software beyond those two bwtool provides additional features and flexibility not found in other software
