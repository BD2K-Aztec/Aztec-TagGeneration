igrepertoireconstructor a novel algorithm for antibody repertoire construction and immunoproteogenomics analysis the analysis of concentrations of circulating antibodies in serum antibody repertoire is a fundamental yet poorly_studied problem in immunoinformatics the two current approaches to the analysis of antibody_repertoires next_generation ngs and mass_spectrometry ms present difficult computational challenges since antibodies are not directly encoded in the germline but are extensively diversified by somatic recombination and hypermutations therefore the protein database required for the interpretation of spectra from circulating antibodies is custom for each individual although such a database can be constructed via ngs the reads generated by ngs are error_prone and even a single nucleotide error precludes identification of a peptide by the standard proteomics tools here we present the igrepertoireconstructor algorithm that performs error_correction of immunosequencing reads and uses mass_spectra to validate the constructed antibody_repertoires availability_and igrepertoireconstructor is open_source and freely_available as a c and python program running on all unix compatible platforms the source_code is available from http bioinf spbau ru igtools until the computational_analysis of antibodies had been performed via proteomics techniques and had not utilized dna_sequencing were the first to demonstrate the power of dna_sequencing for analyzing antibody_repertoires and to open a next_generation ngs era in antibody analysis although this study was quickly followed by many other immunosequencing ig seq studies until there were no attempts to integrate ngs and mass_spectrometry ms approaches for antibody analysis such integration immunoproteogenomics is important since it represents a bottleneck for an emerging approach that promises to transform the antibody industry from focusing on single monoclonal_antibodies toward analyzing polyclonal_antibodies pioneered a new immunoproteogenomics approach for identification of circulating monoclonal_antibodies from serum that enables high_throughput antibody development although sequencing purified monoclonal_antibodies has now become routine sequencing multiple antibodies from a complex sample represents a breakthrough with great biomedical potential the important conclusion inour study is the first to validate the constructed antibody_repertoires by using complementary proteomics_data that confirmed that igrepertoireconstructor generates accurate repertoires with an accurate tool for constructing antibody_repertoires we can move to studies of evolution of antibody_repertoires the analysis that has not been possible in the past because analysis of antibody_repertoires is not unlike analysis of repeat subfamilies the existing algorithms for analyzing repeat evolution can be applied to study evolution of antibodies we also addressed the problem of peptide_identification in large and highly repetitive databases by designing multi_layer immunoproteogenomics search algorithm finally we revealed an alarming lack of correlation between ngs based and ms based quantitation of antibodies
