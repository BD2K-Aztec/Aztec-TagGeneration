structural_bioinformatics clips d a classifier that distinguishes structurally and functionally_important residue positions based on sequence and d data motivation the precise identification of functionally and structurally important residues of a protein is still an open_problem and state of the art classifiers predict only one or at most two different categories result we have implemented the classifier clips d which predicts in a mutually exclusively manner a role in catalysis ligand_binding or protein_stability for each residue position of a protein each prediction is assigned a p value which enables the statistical assessment and the selection of predictions with similar quality clips d requires as input a multiple_sequence and a d structure of one protein in pdb format a comparison with existing_methods confirmed state of the art prediction quality even though clips d classifies more specifically than other methods clips d was implemented as a multiclass support_vector which exploits seven sequence_based and two structure based features each of which was shown to contribute to classification quality the classification of ligand_binding profited most from the d features which were the assessment of the solvent_accessible and the identification of surface pockets in contrast five additionally tested d features did not increase the classification_performance achieved with evolutionary signals deduced from the multiple_sequence availability clips d is available as a web_service at http www bioinf uni regensburg de an important goal of computational_biology is the comprehensive annotation of proteins which requires to predict a function and to identify all crucial residues to assign function to a query_sequence blast and other more sensitive algorithms of sequence comparison are of utmost value however these methods are per se not capable to identify residues which are critical for function or stability thus alternative_approaches are needed one technique is the mapping of known functional sites based on a sequence_alignment which is named homology transfer alternatively if the d structure of a query is available algorithms can exploit structural correspondences with annotated active_sites to identify functional_residues more generally_applicable are methods that do not require annotated proteins for comparison but assess each individual residueposition by means of a knowledge based_scoring system owing to the relevance of this task a large number of such in silico approaches have been introduced which are sequence_based or combine_information from sequence and structure of a protein to predict one or two functional_categories as we were interested to classify more specifically we have recently_introduced a multiclass support_vector mc svm which we named clips d in contrast to other approaches clips d predicts in a mutually exclusively manner a role in catalysis ligand_binding or protein_structure by analyzing a multiple_sequence msa interestingly not more than seven carefully selected_features related to the conservation and the abundance of residues at individual sites and their local sequence neighborhood were sufficient to attain state of the art performance many of the inferred d features are orthogonal to the sequence_based features exploited by clips d and therefore we expected an increase of classification quality for a combination of both this is why we have systematically determined the classification_performance for combinations of d and d features and selected an optimal_combination for a novel classifier which we named clips d this program uses the d structure of a single protein chain to deduce the local environment of each residue and does not use the position of ligands a comparison with clips d made clear that the prediction of ligand_binding profited most from the integration of d features our approach compares_favorably with state of the art algorithms although this mc svm distinguishes catalytic ligand_binding and structurally relevant residue positions to whom correspondence should be addressed
