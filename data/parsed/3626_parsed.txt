structural_bioinformatics ppfold fast rna_secondary using phylogeny and auxiliary data ppfold is a multi_threaded implementation of the pfold algorithm for rna_secondary here we present a new version of ppfold which extends the evolutionary_analysis with a flexible probabilistic_model for incorporating auxiliary data such as data from structure probing experiments our tests show that the accuracy of single_sequence secondary_structure using experimental_data in ppfold is comparable to rnastructure furthermore alignment structure_prediction quality is improved even further by the addition of experimental_data ppfold therefore has the potential of producing more accurate_predictions than it was previously possible availability_and ppfold is available as a platform independent java_application and can be downloaded fromthe pfold package predicts non pseudoknotted rna_secondary by combining a stochastic context free grammar scfg with an evolutionary model ppfold is a recent multi_threaded re implementation of pfold sukosdsuko the pfold model has been shown to result in highly accurate_predictions when the input alignment is of high_quality in a different approach data from high_throughput quantitative rna_structure probing methods have also recently been used in thermodynamic prediction_methods to increase prediction_accuracy however phylogenetic and probing_data have only been used independently in rna_secondary so_far here we present ppfold which integrates these different sources of information at the level of the model this is expected to increase prediction_accuracy beyond what is possible with either evolutionary_information or experimental_data alone
