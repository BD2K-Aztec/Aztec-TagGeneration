statistical_distribution of amino_acid a proof of darwinian evolution motivation the article_presents results of the listing of the quantity of amino_acids dipeptides and tripeptides for all proteins available in the uniprottrembl database and the listing for selected species and enzymes uniprottrembl contains protein_sequences associated with computationally generated annotations and large_scale functional characterization due to the distinct metabolic_pathways of amino_acid syntheses and their physicochemical_properties the quantities of subpeptides in proteins vary we have proved that the distribution of amino_acids dipeptides and tripeptides is statistical which confirms that the evolutionary biodiversity development model is subject to the theory of independent events it seems interesting that certain short_peptide combinations occur relatively rarely or even not at all first it confirms the darwinian theory of evolution and second it opens up opportunities for designing pharmaceuticals among rarely represented short_peptide combinations furthermore an innovative approach to the mass analysis of bioinformatic data is presented according to the theory of independent events the change of an observed quantity with respect to the reference quantity is proportional to the observed quantity the theory is reflected for example in thermal_conductivity statistical thermodynamics chemical kinetics and the lambertbeer law in mathematical terms this means logarithmic decay of the observed quantity dx in our computational experiment the distribution of dipeptides and tripeptides represented in the trembl database is logarithmic with the regression_coefficient r higher than the percentage correlation between the theoretical number of di and tripeptides and values_calculated using the programme shows a linear relation with the regression_coefficient r higher than the theoretical number of di and tripeptides was calculated from the formula page where aapercentage amino_acid in the whole trembl database naatheoretical content of a dipeptide n or a tripeptide n the major reason for the discrepancy of correlation between the theoretically calculated number of di or tripeptides is that a lot of sequences with unknown amino_acids x or alx b and glx z not included in the analysis occur in the uniprottrembl database the programme deletes all di or tripeptides which contain x b or z amino_acids amino_acid and di and tripeptide counting was performed for selected species similar to that for the whole trembl database shows amino_acid di and tripeptide distribution for h sapiens and its selected enzymes the distribution for the other species from the table is available in the supplemental material when the trembl database is divided_into species and enzyme classes amino_acid distribution close to theoretical number is obtained it is noted that amino_acid in a species decreases with the length of its biosynthesis pathway due to this certain sequences occur more frequently while other very rarely or not at all a number of natural toxins metabolites and protein inhibitors are composed of polypeptides or their natural modifications it can be then argued that processed and highly hydrolyzed food was the first source of inhibitors and natural medicines which protected species against fungi bacteria and viruses many authors claim that food_processing heat_treatment contributed to the rapid brain development
