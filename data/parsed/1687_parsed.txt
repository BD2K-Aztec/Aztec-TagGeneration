expitope a web_server for epitope expression motivation adoptive t cell therapies based on introduction of new t cell receptors tcrs into patient recipient t cells is a promising new treatment for various kinds of cancers a major_challenge however is the choice of target_antigens if an engineered tcr can cross react with self antigens in healthy_tissue the side_effects can be devastating we present the first web_server for assessing epitope sharing when designing new potential lead targets we enable the users to find all known proteins containing their peptide of interest the web_server returns not only exact_matches but also approximate ones allowing a number of mismatches of the users choice for the identified candidate_proteins the expression values in various healthy_tissues representing all vital human organs are extracted from rna_sequencing rna_seq as well as from some cancer tissues as control all results are returned to the user sorted by a score which is calculated using well established methods and tools for immunological predictions it depends on the probability that the epitope is created by proteasomal cleavage and its affinities to the transporter associated with anti gen processing and the major_histocompatibility alleles with this framework we hope to provide a helpful tool to exclude potential cross_reactivity in the early_stage of tcr selection for use in design of adoptive t cell immunotherapy availability_and the expitope web_server can be accessed via http webclu bio wzw tum de expitope in adoptive_immunotherapy engineered t cell receptors tcrs are introduced into natural patient cytotoxic_t after this treatment the t cells recognize a specific tumor antigen and will thus start to target cancer_cells it is vital for the success of the therapy that the antigen is only expressed in cancer_cells or non vital tissue otherwise the effects can be devastating for the patients recent_studies showed that not only the expression of the direct target has to be examined across all vital tissues but also approximate sequences have to be considered as tcrs are not perfectly exact in their epitope choice in one study reported cross recognition of a mage a tcr with a mage a epitope that was later found to be expressed in the brain the mage a epitope had one mismatch when compared with the initial target of the study but was apparently recognized by the tcr and the treatment was fatal for some patients in another case used a different mage a specific tcr that was found to show cross recognition of an epitope present in titin a protein expressed in the heart although the titinassociated epitope had four mismatches compared with the originalmage a epitope nevertheless titin was targeted by the engineered t cells and the patients suffered cardiac_arrest in order to see potential off target_recognition when designing new lead targets until now one needed to search protein databases for approximate hits and than evaluate each hit for its potential to be an epitope our expitope web_server combines all these searches and evaluation in one place and even reports the expression of the associated transcripts in all vital human tissues to facilitate tcr selection
