metmsline an automated and fully integrated pipeline for rapid processing of high_resolution lc_ms metabolomic datasets metmsline represents a complete collection of functions in the r programming_language as an accessible gui for biomarker_discovery in large_scale liquid_chromatography high_resolution mass_spectral datasets from acquisition through to final metabolite_identification forming a backend to output from any peak_picking software such as xcms metmsline automatically creates subdirectories data tables and relevant figures at the following steps i signal smoothing normalization filtration and noise transformation preproc qc lsc r ii pca and automatic outlier removal auto pca r iii automatic regression biomarker selection hierarchical_clustering and cluster ion artefact identification auto mv regress r iv biomarkerms ms fragmentation spectra matching and fragment neutral loss annotation auto ms ms match r and v semi targeted metabolite_identification based on a list of theoretical masses obtained from public_databases dbannotate r availability_and all source_code and suggested parameters are available in an un encapsulated layout on http wmbedmands github io metmsline readme files and a synthetic dataset of both x variables simulated lcms data y variables simulated continuous variables and metabolite theoretical masses are also available on our github repository untargeted metabolite_profiling is a promising approach to discover novel risk_factors for chronic_diseases and biomarkers for disease diagnosis liquid_chromatography to high_resolution lchrms instrumentation is being more routinely used for dataacquisition for metabolomic analyses in large_scale studies e g samples raw_data need to be processed via computational_tools to extract relevant_information and meaningful biological conclusions processing of lchrms raw_data is currently facilitated by softwares such as xcms mzmine metaboanalyst and maven however an automated software pipeline with minimal manual interaction for efficient reproducible and objective large_scale metabolomic_data analysis is also desirable software_tools can systematically perform all downstream aspects of metabolomic_analysis following peak_picking development of such a workflow in the r language can offer several advantages such as availability of modular packages for functional programming and graphics and the ease of accessibility of a gui for non specialists we have developed novel software metmsline coded in the r language which automates the process of untargeted metabolomic_data analyses of large_datasets from acquisition of data from lchrms platforms through to unknown biomarker identification an overview of data processing_steps that are integrated by metmsline is shown in use of the software via gui requires a clear understanding of data processing_steps in metabolomics metmsline presents a complete data_processing method it is easy to use as a gui and should be very beneficial to researchers to rapidly process large_scale lchrms dataset it potentially requires minimal manual interaction with the software when compared with the high manual interaction required by commonly used softwares for lchrms datasets such as metaboanalyst maven aplcms mzmine and ideom the rapidity of the process allows great scope for parameter_optimization and the subsequent ability to dedicate more time to result interpretation
