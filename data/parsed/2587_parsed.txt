is rsnp a novel technique for in silico regulatory snp_detection motivation determining the functional impact of non coding disease associated single_nucleotide snps identified by genome_wide gwas is challenging many of these snps are likely to be regulatory snps rsnps variations which affect the ability of a transcription_factor tf to bind to dna however experimental_procedures for identifying rsnps are expensive and labour_intensive therefore in silico methods are required for rsnp prediction by scoring two alleles with a tf position_weight pwm it can be determined which snps are likely rsnps however predictions in this manner are noisy and no method exists that determines the statistical_significance of a nucleotide variation on a pwm score results we have designed an algorithm for in silico rsnp detection called is rsnp we employ novel convolution methods to determine the complete distributions of pwm scores and ratios between allele scores facilitating assignment of statistical_significance to rsnp effects we have tested our method on experimentally_verified rsnps correctly predicting the disrupted tf in cases we also analysed disease associated snps with no known functional impact in an attempt to identify candidate rsnps of the significantly_predicted disrupted tfs had previous evidence of being associated with the disease in the literature these results demonstrate that is rsnp is suitable for high_throughput of snps for potential regulatory_function this is a useful and important tool in the interpretation of gwas availability is rsnp software is available for use at www genomics genome_wide gwas aim to find single_nucleotide snps that are linked to a particular disease or trait phenotype disease associated snps residing in coding_regions specifically non synonymous mutations are generally easy to interpret in terms of their likely functional impact however unravelling the functional impact of snps residing outside coding_regions is more challenging one appealing functional role for non coding disease associated snps is that they are regulatory snps rsnps that is they alter the binding_affinity of a transcription_factor tf to the dna which in turn alters the expression of certain genes consequently contributing to the to whom correspondence should be addressed disease phenotype finding these rsnps is difficult since they can be obscured by the potentially large number of snps present in a linkage_disequilibrium block and the experimental_procedures involved can be expensive and labour_intensive therefore in silico approaches for identifying candidate rsnps are required to improve the efficiency of interpretation of non coding disease associated snps previous attempts at finding rsnps have relied largely on prediction of tf_binding that overlap snps this approach typically produces large_numbers of false_positives as many snps will not significantly alter the binding_affinity of a tf given the degenerate nature of tf_binding an improvement to this approach looked at the difference in binding_site score between two alleles using a position_weight pwm the reasoning here is that snps generating larger pwm score differences are considered more likely to be rsnps than those generating smaller differences however the paper presenting this method demonstrated that without the use of additional information such as phylogenetic_footprinting discovery of rsnps was not possible considering only differences in binding score affinities using pwms more recently however a method which looks at normalizing the score distributions of pwms was used so that observed changes were comparable between pwms in this case the pwm scores are not used directly but a modified affinity score is used to represent the binding_affinity a fourier_transform is used to calculate the complete distribution of affinity scores consequently allowing the computation of a p value for observed scores the ratio of p values of affinity scores between two alleles can then be used to determine if the tf_binding is likely to be disrupted this approach is shown to be successful through comparison against a set of known rsnps the output of this approach however is a large list of pwms ranked by the log_ratio of the score p values unfortunately in this case there is no clear way of an appropriate cutoff_point to distinguish true and false prediction this makes interpretation of results difficult especially when screening large_numbers of snps in this article we propose a new technique for in silico rsnp detection called is rsnp while our approach is similar to that of there are some essential differences notably our approach yields predictions with statistical_significance facilitating interpretable screening across and comparison between large_numbers of snps rather than an affinity score we use scores generated from the pwm directly this facilitates a simple and efficient approach for calculating the distribution pwm scores via direct computation of convolution this method also allows the computation of distributions of p valuepage i i i we evaluated the performance of is rsnp on two types of data first we compiled a set of known rsnps from the literature and from oreganno for which there was empirical_evidence showing the impact of the allelic_variation on the binding of a functionally critical tf we ran is rsnp on each of these snps to see if the correct tf was identified we also analysed the same data using strap and compared the output with is rsnp secondly we extracted disease associated snps from the published catalogue of gwass that had been classified as intergenic and screened them for potential rsnps the goal here was to see if the tf predicted by is rsnp as being disrupted had prior evidence of being associated with the disease if this association was present it would suggest that our predicted rsnps are likely to have a functional impact on the disease via a disease associated tf note a comparison with strap was not done using this data as the lack of statistical_significance associated with predictions output by strap makes it unsuitable for this type of analysis shows the results of applying is rsnp to four different rsnps each of these rsnps has previous empirical_evidence to show that the nucleotide variation disrupts the binding of a particular tf is rsnp was used to screen each snp with all human pwms in the transfac database this resulted in a ranked_list of pwms that have a significant change in pwm score between the alleles for each rsnp the predictions were thresholded at bh corrected p and are reported in in each of four cases there is a match between the predicted disrupted tf and the tf reported to be disrupted in the original studies highlighted in bold in the case of the fetal_growth disorder rsnp and the blood_pressure regulation rsnp the most significant hit matches the reported tf an interesting point to note is that there are multiple positive hits for oct ap and e f this is due to the fact that many matrices are similar for the same tf family these multiple matrices provide additional evidence for a bona_fide binding_site in addition to these four rsnps we also analysed known rsnps extracted from oreganno out of those snps had the matching tf bound pwm score p bh corrected to one of the alleles and in each of these cases a significant i isrsnp n personalized_medicine aspires to develop a panel of targeted_drugs that can correct imbalances in biochemical and cell biological_processes that lead to disease_states for example cancers that arise from brca_mutations are specifically prone to parp_inhibitors to exploit disease associated snps to derive novel drug_targets insight to the mechanistic link between the allelic_variation and the disease is required this link is particularly difficult to derive when a snp is positioned between genes also attenuating progress in the field is the immense difficulty to functionally validate the biological impact of single base substitution in a regulatory_element in the genome as knock in experiments are very expensive and labour_intensive thus identifying in silico means to assess the likelihood of allelic_variation to impact the function of a given tf on a specific target_gene could accelerate the progress from gwas to personalized_medicine this work offers to capitalize on the central dogma of transcription_regulation and identify novel links between targetable tfs and disease_states if their cognate binding to critical targets in the genome is affected by the dna sequence_variation we show here that it is possible with high degree of confidence to identify novel tf disease links through the comparison of the allelic_variation with the sequence constraints of all known tfs beyond reproducing validated cases we further identify such links there are multiple matrices for a single tf the same tf may be reported for the same snp these snps show particularly strong evidence for altering the tfbs b when the risk is allele is not known the variation is ordered by frequency common rare only results that show a significant bh corrected p change in tf binding_affinity between the alleles are included columns and provide information about the disease and associated snp columns and state the base change between normal and disease_state and whether this results in a loss or gain in binding_site columns outline the tf predicted to be disrupted by the allele and the p value associated with the change column if present contains a reference to prior evidence that the predicted tf is known to be associated with the disease the final column provides the p value of the enrichment of tf_binding around genes shown to be differentially_expressed in the disease significant values bh corrected p are highlighted in bold published disease associated snps for which the disrupted tf is reported to be associated with the disease in the literature following on from these significant predictions further rsnps for the same disease and same tf can be identified yy aids hiv oct asthma supplementary threshold p this is a proof_of that the aim of is rsnp is achievable however we envisage a few improvements to is rsnp that would increase its value significantly only of the snps inshowed both forms of evidence of the predicted disrupted tf being associated with the disease this is not unexpected as most of the gwas_studies use bulk
