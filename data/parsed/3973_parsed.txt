genome_analysis repeatexplorer a galaxy based web_server for genome_wide characterization of eukaryotic repetitive_elements from next generation sequence_reads motivation repetitive_dna makes up large portions of plant and animal nuclear genomes yet it remains the least characterized genome component in most species studied so_far although the recent availability of high_throughput sequencing_data provides necessary resources for in depth investigation of genomic repeats its utility is hampered by the lack of specialized bioinformatics_tools and appropriate computational_resources that would enable large_scale repeat analysis to be run by biologically oriented researchers results here we present repeatexplorer a collection of software_tools for characterization of repetitive_elements which is accessible via web_interface a key_component of the server is the computational_pipeline using a graph_based sequence clustering_algorithm to facilitate de_novo repeat identification without the need for reference_databases of known elements because the algorithm uses short_sequences randomly_sampled from the genome as input it is ideal for analyzing next generation sequence_reads additional tools are provided to aid in classification of identified repeats investigate phylo genetic_relationships of retroelements and perform comparative_analysis of repeat composition between multiple species the server allows to analyze several million sequence_reads which typically results in identification of most high and medium copy repeats in higher plant_genomes implementation and availability repeatexplorer was implemented within the galaxy environment and set up on a public server atin spite of the recent_progress in genome sequencing_technologies accurate quantification and sequence characterization of repetitive_dna in complex plant and animal_genomes remains_a most of the existing bioinformatics_tools either require completed genome_assemblies for repeat identification or rely on similarity_searches to databases of known repetitive_elements however the number of fully assembled_genomes is still small and many exhibit poor assembly_quality across repetitive_regions where highly repetitive_elements are mostly omitted on the other hand database scanning enables repeat identification in any type of sequence_data but it in principle does not allow detection of novel repetitive_elements that lack similarity to the database consequently both of these methods work well for extensively investigated groups of model species but their application to a broader range of diverse taxa is limited a principally different approach for global repeat analysis that allows for de_novo repeat identification and is suitable for utilizing unassembled reads was developed by it is based on finding and quantifying similarities between individual sequence_reads typically obtained by next_generation of randomly sheared genomic_dna these similarities are used to construct a graph in which the vertices correspond to sequence_reads overlapping reads are connected with edges and their similarity_scores are expressed as edge_weights graph topology is then analyzed to identify and separate clusters of frequently connected reads that represent individual families of repetitive_elements this strategy proved to be efficient in analyzing repeat composition of both plant and animal_genomes here we report on the development of a computational_pipeline implementing an improved version of graph_based clustering and a number of additional tools for downstream_analysis of the identified repeats all tools were adapted to run under the online data analysis platform galaxy which provides a_user and facilitates easy execution documentation and sharing of analysis protocols and results
