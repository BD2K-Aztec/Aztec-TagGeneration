detection of significant protein coevolution motivation the evolution of proteins cannot be fully understood without taking_into the coevolutionary linkages entangling them from a practical point_of coevolution between protein_families has been used as a way of detecting protein interactions and functional_relationships from genomic_information the most common approach to inferring protein coevolution involves the quantification of phylogenetic_tree similarity using a family of methodologies termed mirrortree in spite of their success a fundamental problem of these approaches is the lack of an adequate statistical_framework to assess the significance of a given coevolutionary score tree similarity as a consequence a number of ad_hoc filters and arbitrary thresholds are required in an attempt to obtain a final_set of confident coevolutionary signals results in this work we developed a method for associating confidence estimators p values to the tree similarity_scores using a null_model specifically_designed for the tree comparison problem we show how this approach largely improves the quality and coverage number of pairs that can be evaluated of the detected coevolution in all the stages of the mirrortree workflow independently of the starting genomic_information this not only leads to a better understanding of protein coevolution and its biological_implications but also to obtain a highly_reliable and comprehensive network of predicted interactions as well as information on the substructure of macromol ecular complexes using only genomic_information availability_and the software and datasets used in this work are freely_available atcoevolution is a widespread phenomenon with important implications at all biological levels at the molecular level coevolution plays a fundamental role in key cellular_systems allowing their components to change and evolve while maintaining their interactions quantifying the ongoing coevolution between different molecular_features has been proposed as a proxy to predict different types of interactions among the most successful_approaches are those applied for detecting proteinprotein_interactions and functional_relationships and more recently for the accurate prediction of residue_contacts in individual proteins the evolutionary_histories of interacting protein_partners are not independent but entangled in many different ways coevolutionbased approaches benefit from this observation in order to detect protein interactions as the predictions are only based on the vast amount of genomic and sequence_information available nowadays these methods are suitable for the systematic detection of interactions in a wide_range of organisms such as bacteria fungi or human protein coevolution is reflected in different genomic and sequence_features a popular_approach for inferring coevolution is to evaluate the similarity of phylogenetic_trees phylogenetic_trees represent the putative evolutionary_histories of the corresponding protein_families and consequently similar protein trees imply similar evolutionary_histories this is the basis of the mirrortree and related methods for detecting protein interactions using genomic_information see for a recent review in its simplest form mirrortree related approaches represent a phylogenetic_tree of a family of orthologs as a distance_matrix and quantify the similarity between two trees as the pearsons linear correlation between the sets of values of their corresponding matrices in spite of their success in detecting interactions this approach has a number of methodological and biological_problems which were partially overcome with different variations of the original method on the methodological side it is well known that the internal codependencies between the values of distances matrices burden the significance assessment of a given correlation_coefficient the tabulated p values regularly used to assign correlation significances assume the independence of the vectors components since the distances in the phylogenetic_trees cannot freely change to adopt any possible value strictly speaking these p values are not adequate in spite of having shown an improvement on the interaction prediction another consequence of the incompleteness of this null_model is that these methods required a minimum number of organisms in common between the two trees generally around in order to take into consideration a given correlation this additional requisite drastically decreases the coverage of the methods the number of protein pairs that can be evaluated moving into the biological_problems the distances within the matrices are also constrained by the evolutionary characteristics of the trees they come from for example the limits in the divergence between homologous_sequences constrain the observed distances to certain values moreover tree leaves corresponding to evolutionary close species will present a strong tendency to be close in all phylogenetic_trees regardless of the proteins they represent and vice_versa for distant_species as a consequence all trees of orthologs have a certain level of similarity between them and with the canonical species_tree this background similarity reflected in correlation values relatively higher even for non interacting pairs has been corrected using external representations of the tree of life or removing the common signal in a large collection of trees another problem is related to the presence of redundant taxa on the sets of organisms used for constructing the trees as the sequencing_efforts are biased to certain organisms phylogenetic_trees become populated in an unbalanced way indeed previous_analyses have shown that using trees based on nonredundant sets of organisms increased the performance of the basic mirrortree approach some of these problems are alleviated in the recent context based mirrortree variations these approaches use all pairwise tree similarities of a given proteome to reassess a given coevolutionary signal largely improving the predictions these context based_approaches also help to disentangle direct coevolutionary signals from those due to third proteins indirect which is important since the latter are not always related to protein interactions indeed in the case of residueresidue coevolution recent methods characterized by this capacity to filter indirect coevolutions are able to predict contacts in protein_structures with very high_reliability when fed with enough sequences here we propose a new approach p mirrortree pmt which aims at correcting in a single_shot all these problems associated with the quantification of tree similarity and the assessment of its significance pmt generates null distributions of tree similarities correlation_coefficients obtained from large sets of shuffled phylogenetic_trees from which empirical p values can be derived we show that this approach overcomes previous mirrortree versions and produces predictions of high_quality and coverage the latest due to not requiring a threshold of minimum number of organisms in common to evaluate tree similarity the improvement is particularly high when this approach is coupled to the modern context based_methods moreover pmt is largely insensitive to the characteristics of the set of organisms used to build the trees number and taxonomic redundancy in order to assess these improvements under different scenarios of available genomic_information we perform a retrospective_analysis of the predictive_power of several mirrortree based_approaches when fed with the genomic_information available at different time points in the past consequently this work also evaluates for the first time how the non homogeneous exploration of the bacterial taxonomy in terms of sequenced_genomes affects the detection of coevolution and which trends are expected for the future coevolution takes_place at all biological levels species proteins amino_acids this evolutionary linkage between the biological_entities is crucial for maintaining relationships and interactions while allowing the two partners to evolve and change in this sense coevolution is fundamental for evolutionary innovation at the molecular level protein coevolution has provided a wealth of information about different systems recent_advances on the detection of residue_contacts have joined the detection of protein interactions as some of the most popular applications based on coevolution for a recent review see the maturity of coevolution based_approaches together with the increase in the genomic_information that feeds them has led in recent_years to the quotidian application of these approaches to many protein_families of interest in many cases directing orcombined with experimental_approaches see for example and for a review nevertheless the observed proteinprotein coevolution quantified as the similarity of the corresponding phylogenetic_trees is influenced by many factors complicating the disentanglement of those more directly related to the interaction the results presented here demonstrate that the prediction of protein interactions at different levels pairs complexes and whole networks is clearly improved when the statistical confidence of the pairwise tree similarity is evaluated based on a background distribution of tree similarities assessing the significance of a given tree similarity using this distribution of expected correlations corrects in a natural way many of the confounding_factors that affect the performance of the original mt including the background similarity due to the underlying speciation process the redundancy of the set of organisms used for building the trees and the different range of organisms in which the two proteins are present previous attempts to correct these factors implied workarounds pre_and filtering arbitrary thresholds and other ad_hoc heuristic approaches pmt intrinsically corrects all these factors producing an estimation of the likelihood of the co evolution under a solid statistical_framework this is especially important taking_into that the genomic_information used as input by these methods will change constantly due to the stream of newly sequencing genomes whereas heuristic approaches would have to change and adapt constantly to these new data our results show how pmt is robust to this change in the input genomic_information the pmt method does not require an artificial threshold on the minimum number of organisms to evaluate a given pair of trees leaving apart the difficulty in deciding such a threshold which depends on the characteristics of the dataset as we show not requiring it has two main advantages both related with the increase in coverage number of pairs that can be evaluated on one hand the results are not biased to central proteins these proteins involved in core cellular_processes are present in many organisms and consequently pairs involving them would more probably pass that threshold of minimum number of organisms on the other hand that increase in coverage is crucial to the context based_methods which use the whole network of pair_wise tree similarities as input with pmt this network is much more populated and that together with the intrinsic better performance of pmt at the pair level makes these context based_approaches render better results when coupled with pmt this new method is not only better for detecting interacting pairs but can be used to get insight into the substructure and functioning of macromolecular_complexes as illustrated for the atpase as well as to obtain a highly_reliable network of protein interactions at a genomic_scale as exemplified by the e coli network generated here in the latter case the pmt method presented here is crucial since previous_approaches were either highly_reliable but presented a low coverage or the other way around pmt has a high performance specially when coupled with context based_methods and can be applied to pairs of trees never explored before e g those with a small number of species in common these improvements and advantages come at no cost in terms of applicability since no additional restrictions are required to run pmt apart from the contextual_information necessary to generate the null distributions background set of trees as presented in this work this can be seen as a drawback since trees for the whole proteome of interest are required to be used as background on one hand this is common to previous context based_approaches on the other hand it remains to be explored whether other more restricted sets of trees can eventually be used as background e g trees for the membrane_proteins or for those in a given biological_process with better results as they could serve as a better background for representing the characteristics of the system of interest as a side result the historical_perspective of our analysis allows to foresee a continuous increase in the performance of co evolution based_approaches as more genomes are sequenced highlighting the value of the ongoing genome_sequencing there is a plethora of approaches based on the original mirrortree method see for a review the results presented here indicate that the pmt approach which touches the base of the methodology itself could improve all of them that was the case for the two context based mirrortree variations evaluated here although all the quantification of performances presented are based on the methods ability to detect interactions we are confident that this approach goes beyond the practical applicability in interaction prediction and will serve to better understand the complex phenomenon of protein coevolution as well
