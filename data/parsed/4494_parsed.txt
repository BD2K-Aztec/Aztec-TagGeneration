structural_bioinformatics swarmdock a server for flexible protein protein_docking proteinprotein_interactions are central to almost all biological_functions and the atomic details of such interactions can yield insights into the mechanisms that underlie these functions we present a web_server that wraps and extends the swarmdock flexible protein protein_docking algorithm after uploading pdb files of the binding_partners the server generates low_energy and returns a ranked_list of clustered docking poses and their corresponding structures the user can perform full global docking or focus on particular residues that are implicated in binding the server is validated in the capri blind docking experiment against the most current docking benchmark and against the cluspro docking server the highest performing server currently available availability the server is freely_available and can be accessed at http bmm cancerresearchuk org eswarmdock the great majority of biological_functions are mediated not by isolated proteins but by their interactions physically any two proteins can interact however interactions of biological_significance exist via the pairing of complementary surfaces and modelling the three_dimensional structure of proteinprotein_complexes remains a highly_active research field we recently described the swarmdock flexible docking algorithm for docking and clustering this algorithm has been used in the capri blind docking experiment http www ebi ac uk msd srv capri where experimentally_determined proteinprotein_complexes are held in confidence by the organizing committee while the prediction community are invited to predict their structure since the last assessment period in may swarmdock correctly_identified interfaces in seven of the nine targets a success_rate that surpasses all but one of the other participating teams we have now automated the docking pipeline from structure preparation to clustering we present here the swarmdock server which provides the research_community with a simple and easy to use interface to the methodology this automated server has been used in capri without human intervention since round and has correctly_identified the structure of all three targets two of which were not found by any other server a typical docking run using the server will take up to h depending on the size of the complex and whether the resources are shared the server does not at this time support non protein_docking
