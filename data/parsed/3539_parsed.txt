phraider pattern hunter based rapid ab_initio detection of elementary repeats motivation transposable_elements tes and repetitive_dna make up a sizable fraction of eukaryotic_genomes and their annotation is crucial to the study of the structure organization and evolution of any newly sequenced_genome although repeatmasker and nhmmer are useful for identifying these repeats they require a pre compiled repeat librarywhich is not always available de_novo identification tools such as recon repeatscout or repeatgluer serve to identify tes purely from sequence content but are either limited by runtimes that prohibit whole_genome use or degrade in quality in the presence of substitutions that disrupt the sequence_patterns results phraider is a de_novo te identification tool that address the issues of excessive runtime without sacrificing sensitivity as compared to competing tools the underlying model is a new definition of elementary repeats that incorporates the patternhunter spaced seed model allowing for greater sensitivity in the presence of genomic substitutions as compared with the premier tool in the literature repeatscout phraider shows an average speedup on any single human_chromosome and has the ability to process the whole human_genome in just over three hours here we discuss the tool the theoretical_model underlying the tool and the results demonstrating its effectiveness availability_and phraider is an open_source tool available from https github com karroje phraider transposable_elements tes are genomic_sequences that had or have the capacity to insert themselves or copies of themselves into other genomic_locations present in almost every higher_order genome and covering as much as of the human_genome and of the maize genome tes have proved an important source of data in numerous studies of genomic_structure they are also frequently a source of noise that needs to be masked unfiltered tes can disrupt annotation tools resulting in large false_positive when subjected to automated gene_finding tools as well as inflated runtimes for the annotation tools the most commonly used tools for repetitive_dna identification such as repeatmasker and nhmmer use precompiled descriptions of sequences in the family e g an ancestral sequence or profile hmm to aid in the identification of more instances of that family but much like the question how does the snow plow driver get to work we might ask how these libraries are compiled repeatmasker requires these libraries to work but we cannot use repeatmasker to generate them initial libraries were compiled as a result of wet_lab work using tes identified through sequencing and biological study in the era of bioinformatics we would prefer an automated solution when first examining a newly sequenced_genome we can frequently rely on a library already compiled for a closely_related genome if such a genome has already been sequenced and annotated within mammals this works well as such genomes are usually available in plants we are less likely to find a well sequenced organism of sufficiently close evolutionary distance to be of use for example a rice based te library will only lead to the identification of of the tes in thephraider is a new tool for the de_novo identification of genome repeat elements that is applicable to assembled_genomes we have empirically demonstrated that it is orders_of than the premier tool in the literature repeatscout yet still improves on that tools ability to mask out tes and other genomic repeats specifically we have developed a formal mathematical_model combining the concept of spaced seeds with that of elementary repeats in addition we have implemented a tool around this model and we have used that tool to demonstrate that i the identification of elementary repeats is useful in the context of de_novo repeat masking ii the introduction of spaced seeds improves results without significant adverse_effects on runtime iii the resulting tool produces results of a quality on par with the leading tool in the literature but works at a speed significantly_faster with an average speedup over repeatscout for the human_chromosome we have produced a freely_available implementation of phraider distributed from https github com karroje phraider under the gnu_general version all code is implemented in c and tested on os x and various flavors of linux the tool will provide a list of elementary repeats with the coordinates of each instance and will optionally produce a masked genomic_sequence phraider is the first step towards a full identification tool for tes and repetitive_dna but leaves considerable room for improvements the use of multiple spaced seeds has been highly_successful in other applications and we are in the process of implementing thisbut doing so requires modifications to both the algorithm and the underlying theoretical_model and is beyond the scope of this work we are also developing tools to aid in seed selection and to assemble elementary repeats into contiguous testhus implicitly addressing the problems with indels as well preliminary tests indicate that this last improvement while not significantly increasing computation time will considerably improve phraiders performance in generating repeatmasker libraries i c e
