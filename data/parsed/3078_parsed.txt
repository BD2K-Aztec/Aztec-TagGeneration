monalisa visualization and analysis of functional_modules in biochemical_networks structural_modeling of biochemical_networks enables qualitative as well as quantitative analysis of those networks automated network decomposition into functional_modules is a crucial point in network_analysis although there exist approaches for the analysis of networks there is no open_source tool available that combines editing visualization and the computation of steady_state functional_modules we introduce a new tool called monalisa which combines computation and visualization of functional_modules as well as an editor for biochemical petri_nets the analysis techniques allow for network decomposition into functional_modules for example t invariants elementary modes maximal common transition sets minimal_cut and t clusters the graphical_user provides various functionalities to construct and modify networks as well as to visualize the results of the analysis availability_and monalisa is licensed under the artistic license it is freely_available atthe development of powerful experimental high_throughput supports the development of large_scale biochemical_network models with hundreds to several thousands of reactions however because detailed kinetic_data are often incomplete structural and stoichiometric properties become critically_important for the analysis and validation of these networks various visualization and or analysis tools for biochemical hypergraphs as well as bipartite graphs have been developed such as celldesigner copasi vanted cytoscape cellillustrator and snoopy the petri_net pn formalism implements bipartite directed_graphs and provides a rich variety of rigorous_analysis methods in the past_decades pn has been applied to various biochemical_systems for example to signal_transduction gene_regulatory and metabolic_models for an overview see functional_modules at steady_state have been defined in several concepts such as transition and place invariants t invariants and p invariants elementary modes minimal_cut mcs enzyme subsets maximal common transition sets mct sets and transition clusters t clusters because the number of invariants exponentially grows up to millions the computation and evaluation of all invariants is still a challenging_task there exist tools for the automated_detection of functional_modules but none of them comprises so many concepts and provides a suitable visualization combined with a graphical editor we want to fill this gap by providing an open_source tool for functional analysis without prior_knowledge of detailed kinetic_data monalisa is partly based on earlier implementations in pina and tina
