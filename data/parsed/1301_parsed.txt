deep models for brain em image_segmentation novel insights and improved_performance motivation accurate segmentation of brain electron_microscopy em images is a critical step in dense circuit reconstruction although deep neural_networks dnns have been widely used in a number of applications in computer vision most of these models that proved to be effective on image classification tasks cannot be applied directly to em image_segmentation due to the different objectives of these tasks as a result it is desirable to develop an optimized architecture that uses the full power of dnns and tailored specifically for em image_segmentation results in this work we proposed a novel design of dnns for this task we trained a pixel classifier that operates on raw pixel intensities with no preprocessing to generate probability_values for each pixel being a membrane or not although the use of neural_networks in image_segmentation is not completely new we developed novel insights and model architectures that allow us to achieve superior_performance on em image_segmentation tasks our submission based on these insights to the d em image_segmentation challenge achieved the best performance consistently across all the three evaluation metrics this challenge is still ongoing and the results in this paper are as of june availability_and https github com ahmed fakhry diveanatomical connections between neurons in the brain form circuits that are responsible for the rapid information_flow knowledge of the circuit structure is crucial for the investigation of its function mapping the structure and components of these circuits is one of the top priority research_areas in neuroscience it provides a foundation for understanding what the brain is made of at the cellular and structural levels and how these properties change across the normal life_span and in brain_disorders the reconstruction of such circuits at a very high_resolution using electron_microscopy em is considered to be the gold_standard for circuit mapping brain research through advancing innovative neurotechnologies brain currently sparse circuit reconstruction has been widely used on a small_scale most of the studies focused on the very smallcaenorhabditis elegans or small parts of the nervous_systems of the drosophila recently some of those efforts were extended to reconstruct the inner_plexiform in the mouse retina using em data in large_scale studies are currently a challenge where the main bottleneck is data analysis better automatic image_segmentation techniques would substantially amplify the impact of dense em reconstruction machine_learning and artificial_intelligence approaches are expected to be the main driver for the desired advancements in this area in this work we focused on the automatic_segmentation of serial_section transmitted electron_microscopy sstem images we provided a novel design of deep neural_networks dnns that extends the techniques described in a we built a pixel dnn classifier that predicts the probability of every individual pixel in a given image being a membrane border pixel or not our dnn classifier accepts raw pixel intensities as input without any preprocessing and learns highly discriminative features automatically before producing final probability maps these probability maps were fed later to another machine_learning classifier based on random_forests to produce final segmentations dnns have been widely used in a number of applications in computer vision it achieved the state of the art performance on tasks like large_scale image and video recognition digit recognition and object_recognition tasks recently many attempts have been made to extend the usage of these models to the field of image_segmentation leading to improved_performance although some of the existing popular models have proved the ability to generalize well for different recognition tasks like the model in most of these models that excelled on image classification and recognition tasks cannot be applied directly to em image_segmentation tasks given the difference in objectives between those tasks as well as the difference between em and natural_images more details in section as a result it is desirable to develop an optimized architecture that utilizes the full power of dnns and tailored specifically for em image_segmentation in this work we developed a dnn model architecture that is highly optimized for sstem image_segmentation the key contribution is in the model itself and the novel insights about the specific kernel configuration leading to substantially improved results we evaluated the effect of model configuration along with kernel structures and depth on the final segmentation outcome we validated our approach by applying it to the isbi em segmentation challenge http brainiac mit edu isbi challenge achieving the best performance on all evaluation metrics out of more than participating groups more groups are participating as the challenge is ongoing our model was one of the few that were able to beat the performance of a second human_observer the key contributions of our work are to provide novel insights on dnn for brain em image_segmentation and to provide recordbreaking results our network is deep wide and carefully_designed to achieve the full performance power of dnn we achieved the best results in the challenge without having to combine several models together which makes the approach even more efficient we believe that pretraining of our model on other data_sets like imagenet and combining the results of several models would further improve the accuracy in addition our model can generalize easily to different em segmentation tasks due to the nature of dnns which learn features from data we are also extending this deep_learning scheme on the vaa d platform for other neuron images in large brain projects such as the bigneuron we list only the top groups
