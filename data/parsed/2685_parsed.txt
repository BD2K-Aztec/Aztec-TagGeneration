genetics_and ldlink a web_based application for exploring population specific haplotype_structure and linking correlated alleles of possible functional_variants assessing linkage_disequilibrium ld across ancestral_populations is a powerful approach for investigating population specific genetic_structure as well as functionally mapping regions of disease_susceptibility here we present ldlink a web_based collection of bioinformatic modules that query single_nucleotide snps in population groups of interest to generate haplotype tables and interactive plots modules are designed with an emphasis on ease of use query flexibility and interactive_visualization of results phase haplotype_data from the genomes_project are referenced for calculating pairwise metrics of ld searching for proxies in high_ld and enumerating all observed haplotypes ldlink is tailored for investigators interested in mapping common and uncommon_disease susceptibility_loci by focusing on output linking correlated alleles and highlighting putative functional_variants availability_and ldlink is a free and publically available web_tool which can be ac cessed at http analysistools nci nih gov ldlink genome_wide gwas have identified robust genotype_phenotype for a range of disease_phenotypes linkage_disequilibrium ld the non random association of regional variants due to the low_probability of meiotic_recombination has facilitated gwas by enabling the search for markers of risk_alleles based on the principle of indirect testing namely identification of a proxy for the underlying variant biologically responsible for the phenotype this can be accomplished with a small fraction of known variants that tag other highly_correlated variants once disease susceptibility_loci are identified however the process of choosing plausible variants to explain the observed signal requires a careful assessment of all correlated variants based on local ld_structure knowledge of populationspecific ld_structure and intuitive bioinformatic_tools for interrogating ld are therefore essential for designing association studies and localizing functional_variants bioinformatic_tools are available for assessing ld but not specifically_designed to winnow down perspective candidates to putative functional_variants existing_tools report standard measures of ld with different levels of functional_annotation but none report which alleles are correlated between two single_nucleotide snps in ld knowing which proxy allele is correlated with a risk_allele from a gwas associated variant is essential for functional studies especially when plausible functional_variants are not directly genotyped while at times this relationship can be accurately inferred when correlations are high and minor_allele are low additional bioinformatic_analysis is needed when correlations are modest and minor_allele approach such analyses can be timepublished by oxford university press this work is written by us government employees and is in the public_domain in the us consuming and technically_difficult for researchers who lack computational training ldlink is a web_based ld analysis tool designed to easily query pairwise linkage_disequilibrium between snps the web_based modules ldhap ldmatrix ldpair and ldproxy utilize reference haplotypes from different population groups in phase of the genomes_project g to produce haplotype tables and interactive plots ldlink fills in current gaps of existing ld analysis tools by integrating expanded population reference sets updated functional_annotations and interactive output to explore possible functional_variants in high_ld a thorough exploration of the variation and linkage structure that exists across populations should facilitate fine_mapping disease_susceptibility regions and assist researchers in characterizing functional_variants based on genotype_phenotype with potential clinical_utility
