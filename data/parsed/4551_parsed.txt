teqc an r package for quality_control in target capture experiments teqc is an r bioconductor_package for quality_assessment of target enrichment experiments quality_measures comprise specificity and sensitivity of the capture enrichment per target read_coverage and its relation to hybridization probe characteristics coverage uniformity and reproducibility and read duplicate analysis several diagnostic plots allow visual_inspection of the data_quality availability_and teqc is implemented in the r language version and is available as a bioconductor_package for linux windows and macos from www bioconductor org next_generation have made it possible to sequence efficiently a whole_genome however in population studies the current cost for sequencing entire human_genomes at sufficient read_coverage is still prohibitively_expensive alternatively targeted_sequencing is a promising approach to identify variants in large_numbers of individuals focusing on specific regions of interest e g linkage regions or the complete exome that are selected and enriched previous to deep_sequencing a frequently used application for the enrichment of the target_sequences is based on hybridization with pre_designed probes either on microarrays or in solution the hybridized molecules are captured i e eluted from the microarrays or pulled down from the solution respectively and are then amplified and sequenced many tools exist to check the quality of the sequenced data quality_criteria can be sequencing_error per base phred scores total number of sequenced_reads and fraction of reads aligning to the respective reference_genome however in target enrichment experiments it is additionally crucial to assess whether the capture of the targeted_regions was successful here we have developed teqc an r bioconductor_package that enables users to leverage a multitude of methods to monitor the target enrichment process our tool allows to answer specific technical questions among others whether most of the sequenced_reads actually fall on the target and whether most of the targeted bases reach sufficient to whom correspondence should be addressed coverage for follow_up analyses like variant detection moreover teqc allows to evaluate the amount of read_duplication and its effect on target_coverage as well as the relation between gc_content of the capture hybridization_probes and coverage for the respective bases
