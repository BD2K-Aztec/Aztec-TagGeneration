deuteration distribution estimation with improved sequence_coverage for hx ms experiments motivation time resolved hydrogen exchange hx followed by mass_spectrometry ms is a key_technology for studying protein_structure dynamics and interactions hx experiments deliver a time dependent distribution of deuteration levels of peptide_sequences of the protein of interest the robust and complete estimation of this distribution for as many peptide_fragments as possible is instrumental to understanding dynamic protein level hx behavior currently this data interpretation step still is a bottleneck in the overall hx ms workflow results we propose hexicon a novel algorithmic workflow for automatic deuteration distribution estimation at increased sequence_coverage based on an l regularized feature_extraction routine hexicon extracts the full deuteration distribution which allows insight into possible bimodal exchange behavior of proteins rather than just an average deuteration for each time point further it is capable of addressing ill posed estimation problems yielding sparse and physically reasonable_results hexicon makes use of existing peptide sequence_information which is augmented by an inferred list of peptide candidates derived from a known protein_sequence in conjunction with a supervised_classification procedure that balances sensitivity_and hexicon can deliver results with increased sequence_coverage availability the entire hexicon workflow has been implemented in c and includes a graphical_user it is available atthe determination of protein_structure and dynamics is a key issue for the understanding of living_systems s the isotope envelope shifts to higher m z values because of deuterium incorporation the deuteration content is encoded in a complex_mixture of isotope distributions due to the noise and overlapping isotope clusters the separation of individual_peptides is non trivial the abundance of the spectrum is labeled as y by combining the information of the protein dynamics and other classical functional data a more complete understanding of protein_function can be obtained in many cases protein dynamics are directly related to specific protein functions such as conformational changes during enzyme_activation and protein movements during binding hydrogen exchange hx followed by mass_spectrometry ms hx ms has become a standard approach for interpreting hx experiments the location and rate of deuteration are indicative of solvent_accessibility and in particular hydrogen_bonding and hence of conformation and dynamics they can be estimated by tracking the mass shift of peptide_fragments in mass_spectra over samples with different incubation_times in comparison to nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy ms requires lower protein concentrations and amounts provides higher measurement speed and better scalability in terms of protein size and detects coexisting conformations whereas manifold improvements in experimental methodology and instrumentation have been implemented for hx ms experiments page hexicon has been evaluated on two protein datasets of different complexity c terminus of hsp interacting_protein chip and high_temperature protein g htpg in each experiment protein samples were first incubated in heavy water to induce a certain amount of exchange before being subjected to pepsin_digestion to identify peptic peptides from the investigated proteins we digested the undeuterated protein under the same conditions as later used for the exchange experiments we then analyzed the peptic peptides by automated ms_ms using a h acetonitrile gradienteither on a nanolc qstar ms system chip htpg and on a nanolc orbitrap ms system htpg subsequently we determined which of the identified peptides could be found consistently on the hplc qstar ms system using a min acetonitrile gradient both datasets have been processed manually yielding average deuterations for selected peptide_sequences that we use as ground_truth segment retention time extensions are between and s as shown in section to avoid_overfitting chiks approach_requires padding optimization by user input or pre_processing the reason is that the least_squares regression attempts to use each predictor without any restriction and thus overfits the data and causes several spurious basis_functions to be selected as shown in marked by the proposed approach benefits from the sparsity of the l regularization and discards those spurious deuteration levels automatically and thus requires no additional processing such as thresholding or any further user_interaction this overfitting problem becomes worse when overlapping patterns occur as shown in chiks approach with padding optimization gives a reasonable distribution for aaererele but yields an unrealistic estimate for iakkkrwnsieer i e the large gaps between neighboring deuteration levels hexicon on the other hand keeps the intrinsic smoothness and sparsity of the deuteration levels although the estimate for the lowintensity iakkkrwnsieer is subject to low snr it is still represented by a compact deuteration distribution at the most relevant positions and appears to be physically reasonable while maximum_entropy deconvolution based_methods might theoretically be appealing they are not applicable to the problem since they require a pre defined noise_level which is usually not available to the users and may vary among different m z regions or experiments further these approaches are prone to overfitting and are computationally_expensive the improved sequence_coverage provided by hexicon is particularly helpful to gain a more complete and detailed understanding of a dataset due to under segmentation of crowded regions in the lc_ms data hexicon did not recover all manually selected peptide_sequences from the htpg dataset but it still managed to yield a higher sequence_coverage because other peptide_sequences were selected to compensate for the missing ones further as shown in hexicon finds more than twice the number of peptide_sequences selected by human_experts which allows exchange behavior prediction in finer regions for instance the estimation of exchange_rate at positions can be inferred from both hlqrvghfdpvtrspltqeqlipnl position and hlqrvghfdpvtrspltqe position since we only considered those hexicon results with the highest quality_score for the computation of the sequence_coverage this number can be regarded as a conservative estimate additional lower_quality results provided by hexicon can guide users towards further targeted experiments for instance ambiguous results when multiple peptide_sequences could be assigned to the same spectrum might motivate additional ms_ms run on specific peptide_sequences of interest and thereby allow further improvement on the sequence_coverage
