systems_biology paintomics a web_based for the joint visualization of transcriptomics and metabolomics_data motivation the development of the omics_technologies such as transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics has made possible the realization of systems_biology studies where biological_systems are interrogated at different levels of biochemical activity gene_expression protein activity and or metabolite_concentration an effective approach to the analysis of these complex datasets is the joined visualization of the disparate biomolecular data on the framework of known biological_pathways results we have developed the paintomics web_server as an easy to use bioinformatics resource that facilitates the integrated visual_analysis of experiments where transcriptomics and metabolomics_data have been measured on different conditions for the same samples basically paintomics takes complete transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets together with lists of significant gene or metabolite changes and paints this information on kegg_pathway maps availability paintomics is freely_available atbiological research in the post genomics era has been characterized by the extensive use of omics_technologies the general availability of transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics platforms together with the development of user_friendly data analysis solutions da wei has boosted the adoption of high_throughput towards the understanding of the relationships between the genome and the phenotype integrated approaches that combine transcriptome proteome and metabolome profiling have gained popularity and have proven to provide novel insights in the understanding of the biological_systems a first approach to the interpretation of complex omics experiments is the joined visualization of the data on templates that collect previous_knowledge graphical display is an effective tool to assist human reasoning and when different layers of biomolecular activity are presented in the context of the biological_pathways they operate much can be gained at the interpret ability of these large_datasets to whom correspondence should be addressed to date the number of bioinformatics_tools that offer integrated visualization of omics_datasets is limited kappa view and mapman are plant specific tools that display metabolite and transcript_levels on predefined pathway blocks the masstrix software translates nmr_spectra into metabolic compounds and maps them into kegg_pathways together with genome information the tool is specially suited for exploring the metabolic repertoire of sequenced_genomes but does not incorporates gene_expression a recent development is prometra that accepts pre_computed and custommade pathway maps in scalable_vector svg format and is able to display dynamics data the application is restricted microbial_genomes and offers direct access to different omics experimental databases although these tools make an interesting use of visualization strategies we found that available resources are either restricted to specific biological domains and or have limitations for representing omics measurements we have developed paintomics to provide a simple but effective resource for integrated visualization in genomics studies where transcriptomics and metabolomics_data are generated on the same set of samples basically the application accepts gene_expression and metabolite quantifications and displays data on kegg maps the main distinctive_features of paintomics are painted kegg maps supported for a large range of organisms joint visualization of different types of omics_data displaying both significant and non significant changes computation of pathway enrichment based on both transcriptomics and metabolomics_data interactive images with link outs to kegg info and experimental values and easy to download mapped data for further analysis paintomics is available at http www paintomics org
