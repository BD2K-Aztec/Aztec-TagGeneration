refined elasticity sampling for monte_carlo identification of stabilizing network patterns motivation structural kinetic modelling skm is a framework to analyse whether a metabolic steady_state remains_stable under perturbation without requiring detailed knowledge about individual rate_equations it provides a representation of the systems jacobian matrix that depends solely on the network_structure steady_state measurements and the elasticities at the steady_state for a measured steady_state stability criteria can be derived by generating a large number of skms with randomly_sampled elasticities and evaluating the resulting jacobian matrices the elasticity space can be analysed statistically in order to detect network positions that contribute significantly to the perturbation response here we extend this approach by examining the kinetic feasibility of the elasticity combinations created during monte_carlo sampling results using a set of small example systems we show that the majority of sampled skms would yield negative kinetic_parameters if they were translated back into kinetic_models to overcome this problem a simple criterion is formulated that mitigates such infeasible models after evaluating the small example pathways the methodology was used to study two steady_states of the neuronal tca_cycle and the intrinsic_mechanisms responsible for their stability or instability the findings of the statistical elasticity analysis confirm that several elasticities are jointly coordinated to control stability and that the main source for potential instabilities are mutations in the enzymemetabolic systems tend to exhibit steady_states that can be measured in terms of the concentrations and fluxes of the metabolites involved these measurements can be regarded as a phenotypic representation of all the complex interactions and regulatory_mechanisms taking_place in the underlying metabolic_pathway such interactions determine the systems response to external_perturbations and are responsible for example for its asymptotic stability or for oscillatory trajectories around the steady_state however determining these perturbation responses in the absence of fully specified kinetic_models remains an important challenge of computational_systems structural kinetic modelling skm is a framework to analyse such responses to perturbations without requiring detailed knowledge about individual rate_equations it provides a parameterized representation of the systems jacobian matrix in which the model_parameters encode information about the enzyme metabolite interactions stability criteria can be derived by generating a large number of structural kinetic_models skms with randomly_sampled parameter_sets and evaluating the resulting jacobian matrices the parameter_space can be analysed statistically in a monte_carlo experiment in order to detect pathway positions that contribute significantly to the perturbation response because the sampled parameters are equivalent to the
