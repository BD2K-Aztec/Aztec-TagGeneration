gene_expression parseq reconstruction of microbial transcription landscape from rna_seq read_counts using state_space models_motivation the most common rna_seq strategy consists of random shearing amplification and high_throughput of the rna fraction methods to analyze transcription_level variations along the genome from the read_count profiles generated by the rna_seq protocol are needed results we developed a statistical_approach to estimate the local transcription_levels and to identify transcript borders this transcrip tional landscape reconstruction relies on a state_space model to describe transcription_level variations in terms of abrupt shifts and more progressive drifts a new emission model is introduced to capture not only the read_count variance inside a transcript but also its short range autocorrelation and the fraction of positions with zero counts the estimation relies on a particle gibbs algorithm whose running time makes it more suited to microbial_genomes the approach outper formed read overlapping strategies on synthetic and real microbial datasets sequencing_technologies play_an in the investigation of gene_expression rna_sequencing the most common rna_seq strategy is based on random shearing amplification and high_throughput of the rnas yielding millions of sequence_reads that serve to characterize wholegenome transcriptional_profiles current protocols provide strand specific data after mapping onto a reference genome_sequence the number of reads found at each position of the genome is recorded and those counts can be used to derive estimates of gene_expression up to the isoform level under the assumption that read_counts are proportional to transcript length and transcription_level the read_coverage along the genome also provides a rich_information that is often used to map new transcriptionally active_regions despite the amount of data collected in the past_decade initially with microarrays and now with sequencing for most of the organisms there are still no or incomplete annotations of their transcripts even the most studied model_organisms are lacking a full characterization of their transcriptome architecture not only the complete condition_dependent repertoire of transcripts proves difficult to establish but also the biological meaning of important transcripts categories such as pervasive transcription in eukaryotes and antisense rnas in bacteria remains elusivehence the importance of developing new computational_approaches that could help to extract more information from rna_seq a major research direction toward the identification of transcript structures is based on read assembling reference based_methods begin with the alignment of reads on the genome fragments are constructed by joining reads on the basis of paired_end or fragment length information fragment overlapping is then examined to build a connection graph at the end the connected reads are predicted to belong to the same transcript isoform structure can be inferred from the path of fragment contigs and expression levels can be estimated after allocation of the reads to the inferred transcripts although this approach provides insightful results at a computationally affordable cost and can use reads overlapping exon_junctions as direct evidence for splicing it has also some intrinsic limitations the most obvious is that limited depth of sequencing combined with technical biases may cause gaps that lead to artificial splits in transcript structure irrespective of the sequencing_depth this approach is also unable to point to overlapping transcripts caused by promoter multiplicity and incomplete termination however these two mechanisms contribute substantially to the transcriptomes complexity in organisms with compact sized genomes our aim in this study is to develop a principled strategy for analyzing changes in expression levels whose output could help to identify the variety of mechanisms shaping the transcriptional landscape the task is complicated because of the existence of several types of protocol induced biases that cause longitudinal variability of coverage along the chromosome part of these artifacts can be explained by the influence of the local nucleotide to whom correspondence should be addressed this article_presents a model based_approach for analyzing the rna_seq read_count profiles along the genome the model aims for an account of artifactual longitudinal variabilitys sources via a new model of overdispersion able to capture not only the variance versus mean relationships but also the fraction of zero counts and the short range autocorrelations from a methodological standpoint our work also demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing genome_scale within the framework of ssms the recently described pg algorithm was instrumental in this success running time does not depend on the depth of the sequencing but is proportional to genome length which makes it more suited to microbial_genomes the method outperforms a read assembly approach at low sequencing_depth and shows a clear improvement on real_data even for high sequencing_depth we believe that the availability of such a tool will become increasingly useful as the use of rnaseq becomes more popular in particular the availability of confidence_scores and credibility intervals will be relevant to build a reference annotation from a compendium of experiments as done from tiling_array data and also to compare global rna_seq profiles with the results of protocols targeting more specifically the sequencing of transcript ends in principle one could also envision to extend the model for situations where data would be collected with distinct rna_seq protocols on the same biological_sample
