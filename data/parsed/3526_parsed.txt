genetics_and phenoman phenotypic_data exploration selection management and quality_control for association studies of rare and common_variants motivation next_generation and other high_throughput technology advances have promoted great interest in detecting associations between complex_traits and genetic_variants phenotype selection quality_control qc and control of confounders are crucial and can have a great impact on the ability to detect associations although there are programs to perform association_analyses e g plink and genabel they cannot be used for comprehensive_management and qc of phenotype data to address this need phenoman was developed to select individuals based on multiple phenotype criteria or population membership control for missing cov ariate data remove related individuals duplicate samples and individuals with incorrect sex specification recode primary traits and covariates transform data remove or winsorize outliers select cov ariates for analysis and create residuals to ensure consistency and harmonization between analyses a report is generated for every data_set summary_statistics are also provided in graphical or text format phenoman can be used for selection and manipulation of quantitative disease and control data summary phenoman is freeware that provides approaches for efficient exploration and management of phenotype data proper qc of phenotypes before proceeding to the association analysis is critical to ensure control of type i and ii errors reliable effect_estimates and consistent results between studies phenoman is highly_beneficial for the preparation of qualitative_and trait data for association studies using new datasets as well as those obtained from public_repositories availability_and code google comin recent_years next_generation have generated vast_amounts of exome and genome sequence_data to be used for the detection of complex_trait associations although association_analyses play_a in elucidating the genetic_etiology of complex_traits type_i can be increased and power may be profoundly weakened by phenotypic outliers related individuals missing phenotypic values population_stratification inclusion or exclusion of covariates to control for confounders and so forth additionally often between studies analysis of phenotypes are not consistent e g phenotype selection inclusion of covariates treatment of outliers it is important that all analysis steps e g determining which study subjects and covariates to include in the analysis are fully documented so results are reproducible and additionally analyses are consistent between datasets which is a key for both meta_analysis and replication studies although programs such as plink and genabel can be used for association analysis they cannot be used for comprehensive_management and quality_control qc of phenotype data additionally r www r project org could be used for data exploration but it is not readily suitable to perform all necessary tasks to prepare phenotype data for association analysis additionally the user must have expertise in writing r scripts the phenoman software was developed to provide a universally powerful framework with simple commands to integrate both quantitative and qualitative phenotype data exploration qc and sample_selection into a unified program phenoman an interactive command_line driven program is written in python and r for association studies qc can be time consuming but it is necessary before the onset of data analysis proper qc of phenotypes before proceeding to association analysis is critical to ensure control of type i and ii errors reliable effect_estimates and consistent results between studies phenoman is designed to provide a convenient and comparable manner to obtain analysisready phenotype data performing this important process contains two steps i explorationuse statistics and graphics to overview the data and ii solutionscorrect transform select and or remove identified erroneous entities ultimately we expect that phenoman will enhance the analysis of association data
