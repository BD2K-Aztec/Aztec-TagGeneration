identification of cell_types from single_cell transcriptomes using a novel clustering method motivation the recent_advance of single_cell technologies has brought new insights into complex biological_phenomena in particular genome_wide single_cell measurements such as transcrip tome sequencing enable the characterization of cellular_composition as well as functional variation in homogenic cell_populations an important step in the single_cell transcriptome_analysis is to group cells that belong to the same cell_types based on gene_expression the corresponding computational_problem is to cluster a noisy high_dimensional dataset with substantially fewer objects cells than the number of variables genes results in this article we describe a novel algorithm named shared nearest_neighbor snn cliq that clusters single_cell transcriptomes snn cliq utilizes the concept of shared nearest_neighbor that shows advantages in handling high_dimensional when evaluated on a variety of synthetic and real experimental_datasets snn cliq outperformed the state of the art methods tested more importantly the clustering_results of snn cliq reflect the cell_types or origins with high_accuracy availability_and the algorithm is implemented in matlab and python the source_code can be downloaded at http bioinfo uncc edu snncliq the recent_advance of single_cell measurements has deepened our understanding of the cellular_heterogeneity in homogenic populations and the underlying_mechanisms raser and o with the rapid adaption of single_cell techniques enormous transcriptome datasets have been generated at single_cell resolution these datasets present a tremendous opportunity and challenge to the computational_biology community for their analysis to reveal new insights into many biological_problems for example to elucidate cell_types in complex tissues a straightforward approach to this problem would be to partition the cells into well separated groups via clustering techniques so that cells data_points in the same group exhibit similar gene_expression levels attributes however the high variability in gene_expression levels even between cells of the same type can confound this seemly straightforward clustering approach in addition single_cell is generally in tens_of dimensions which can substantially further complicate the clustering problem in particular usually only a few out of genes are significantly_differentially in distinct cell_types consequently when clustering on the whole transcriptome many genes would be regarded as irrelevant attributes and may even impede the identification of cell_types it has been claimed that for a broad range of data distributions the conventional similarities such as euclidean norm or cosine measure become less reliable as the dimensionality increases the reason is that all data become sparse in highdimensional space and therefore the similarities measured by these metrics are generally low between objects accordingly many clustering_methods based on these measures are v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com doi bioinformatics btv
