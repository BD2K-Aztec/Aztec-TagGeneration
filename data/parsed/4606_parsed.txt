systems_biology the identification of short_linear motif mediated interfaces within the human interactome motivation eukaryotic_proteins are highly modular containing multiple interaction interfaces that mediate binding to a network of regulators and effectors recent_advances in high_throughput have rapidly expanded the number of known protein_protein ppis however the molecular basis for the majority of these interactions remains to be elucidated there has been a growing appreciation of the importance of a subset of these ppis namely those mediated by short_linear slims particularly the canonical and ubiquitous sh sh and pdz_domain binding_motifs however these motif classes represent only a small fraction of known slims and outside these examples little effort has been made either bioinformatically or experimentally to discover the full complement of motif instances results in this article interaction data are analysed to identify and characterize an important subset of ppis those involving slims binding to globular_domains to do this we introduce ielm a method to identify interactions mediated by slims and add molecular_details of the interaction interfaces to both interacting_proteins the method identifies slim mediated interfaces from ppi data by searching for known slimdomain pairs this approach was applied to the human interactome to identify a set of high_confidence putative slim mediated ppis availability ielm is freely_available elmint short_linear slims are compact domain binding interfaces ubiquitous in eukaryotic proteomes they mediate a range of important_cellular including protein scaffolding to whom correspondence should be addressed e g sos sh motifs cell_signalling e g pdz motifs subcellular compartment targeting e g nuclear_localization post_translational e g sumoylation and cleavage e g caspase cleavage_sites slims consist of amino_acids though usually only residues are strictly required for binding as a result of the limited number of residues contacting their binding_partner slims bind with low_affinity usually between and micromolar distinguishing them from domaindomain interactions that often have an affinity in the nanomolar_range this attribute of a weakbinding affinity renders slim mediated_interactions difficult to detect experimentally a number of resourceand time intensive experiments are therefore required to properly validate a slim ranging from mutational_analysis to structural studies the use of bioinformatics is therefore an important technique to direct or augment the experimental elucidation of slims a number of databases have been developed to facilitate our understanding of slims the eukaryotic linear motif elm resource contains over experimentally_validated slim instances while the minimotif miner database has collected over consensus_sequences these datasets generate insights into the attributes of slims such as their conservation among homologues and enrichment in disorder this enables the development of prediction servers within both the elm and minimotif miner resources to filter novel instances based on the attributes of the curated regular expressions however both servers have issues with over prediction the slimsearch resource expands this methodology to whole proteome searches this method scores a slim instance by assessing the sequence_conservation of the motif in its orthologous_proteins however disordered_regions are often poorly aligned and this can lead to an artificially low score for some motifs the anchor predictors rely on the propensity for slims to undergo a disorder to order transition upon binding and morf pred identifies patterns in a disorder prediction output other resources have focused on a subset of slims for example
