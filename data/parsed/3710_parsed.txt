probabilistic_models of genetic_variation in structured populations applied to global human studies motivation modern population_genetics studies typically involve genome_wide genotyping of individuals from a diverse network of ancestries an important problem is how to formulate and estimate probabilistic_models of observed genotypes that account for complex population_structure the most prominent work on this problem has focused on estimating a model of admixture proportions of ancestral_populations for each individual here we instead focus on modeling variation of the genotypes without requiring a higher_level admixture interpretation results we formulate two general probabilistic_models and we propose computationally_efficient algorithms to estimate them first we show how principal_component can be utilized to estimate a general model that includes the well known pritchardstephensdonnelly admixture model as a special_case noting some drawbacks of this approach we introduce a new logistic factor_analysis framework that seeks to directly model the logit transformation of probabilities underlying observed genotypes in terms of latent_variables that capture population_structure we demonstrate these advances on data from the human_genome diversity panel and genomes_project where we are able to identify snps that are highly_differentiated with respect to structure while making minimal modeling assumptions availability_and a bioconductor r package called lfa is available atone of the most important goals of modern human_genetics is to accurately model genome_wide genetic_variation among individuals as it plays a fundamental role in disease gene_mapping and characterizing the evolutionary_history of human populations in this article we develop latent_variable probabilistic_models and estimation methods of genetic_variation that provide allele_frequency estimates of each individual snp combination in the presence of arbitrarily complex population_structure accurate estimates of allele_frequencies in this setting allow for improved tests of genetic_associations with complex_traits and other population_genetic which do not rely on overly restricted models of population_structure for example the models and methods developed here provide the key estimation step in the implementation of a new framework for association testing in the presence of arbitrarily complex structure other applications we explore here are to v c the author published_by we applied our methods to a comprehensive set of simulation_studies and to the hgdp and tgp datasets
