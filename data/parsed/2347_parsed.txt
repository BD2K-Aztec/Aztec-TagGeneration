ikap a heuristic framework for inference of kinase_activities from phosphoproteomics data motivation phosphoproteomics measurements are widely_applied in cellular_biology to detect changes in signalling dynamics however due to the inherent complexity of phosphorylation patterns and the lack of knowledge on how phosphorylations are related to functions it is often not possible to directly deduce protein activities from those measurements here we present a heuris tic machine_learning algorithm that infers the activities of kinases from phosphoproteomics data using kinasetarget information from the phosphositeplus database by comparing the estimated kinase_activity profiles to the measured phosphosite profiles it is furthermore possible to derive the kinases that are most likely to phosphorylate the respective phosphosite results we apply our approach to published datasets of the human cell_cycle generated from helas cells and insulin_signalling dynamics in mouse hepatocytes in the first case we estimate the activities of at six cell_cycle and derive new kinasephosphosite links that can be validated through either database or motif information in the second case the activities of kin ases at eight time points are estimated and new kinasetarget links are derived availability_and the algorithm is implemented in matlab and be downloaded from github it makes use of the optimization and statistics toolboxes https phosphoproteomics is a branch of proteomics that identifies catalogues and characterizes proteins containing a phosphate_group as a post_translational since intracellular signal_transduction is primarily mediated by the reversible phosphorylation of various signalling_molecules data generated by phosphoproteomics approaches is commonly used to study the dynamics of signalling_networks a major_challenge in the analysis of such data lies in the high combinatorial complexity of the observed signalling_networks the human genome_encodes roughly kinases that phosphorylate proteins at probably more than phosphosites hence the number of possible targets per kinase tends to be high and the majority of proteins acting as kinasetargets can be phosphorylated at multiple sites where each site can potentially be targeted by several kinases resulting in an intricate network of kinases target_proteins and phosphatases which remove the attached phosphorylations again both kinases and phosphatases can thereby themselves be phosphorylated the situation gets further complicated by the fact that mostknown phosphosites can so_far not be related to a distinct protein_function thus most research up to the present focuses on individual phosphoproteins and kinases or is restricted to clustering and enrichment_methods which group the detected sites according to their behaviour and relate the proteins they are localized on to cellular_processes like canonical pathways transcriptional_networks or disease mechanisms via statistical_testing against databases modelling of phosphoproteomics networks is usually limited to few components and rather includes single phosphosites than whole proteins due to the lack of functional information to address these challenges we developed the machine algorithm ikap inference of kinase_activities from phosphoproteomics that estimates the activities of all kinases that are known to phosphorylate at least one phosphosite in a phosphoproteomics dataset ikap takes information from the phosphositeplus psp database as input and uses a non linear optimization routine to minimize a cost_function that relates kinase_activities and affinities to phosphosite measurements the predicted activities directly display the engagement of signal_transduction such as camp_pka ca pkc mtor or akt_kinase pathways if data for multiple time points or conditions are available each kinase receives a unique activity profile which depicts the change of cellular function over all conditions furthermore these profiles can be used as an input for mathematical_modelling which enables the usage of protein nodes instead of phosphosite nodes making the model more meaningful and predictive another application lies in the inference of possible new kinasetarget links by correlating the calculated kinase_activity profiles to the measured phosphosite profiles the kinases that are most likely to phosphorylate a respective phosphosite can be derived to demonstrate the capabilities of ikap we applied it to two previously_published phosphoproteomics datasets the first comprises a study of the human cell_cycle in helas cells eukaryotic_cells replicate by a complex series of evolutionarily_conserved events that tightly regulate defined stages of the cell_division progression through this cycle involves a large number of dedicated protein_complexes and signalling_pathways and deregulation of this process is implicated in tumourigenesis global analyses of transcriptome dynamics during the cell_cycle have been performed in microarray_studies however in addition to changes in messenger_rna mrna_abundance protein_phosphorylation and targeted protein_degradation are also important regulators of cell_cycle to examine the influence of protein phosphorylations on the progression of the cell_cycle the phosphoproteome was measured through a combination of immobilized_metal and stable_isotope labelling of amino_acids at the six phases g g s early s late s g and m further details can be found in the second dataset is a study of insulin_signalling dynamics in the mouse_liver here the phosphoproteome was measured after and min after stimulation with insulin phosphorylation of serine threonine and tyrosine plays significant roles in cellular_signal and in modifying multiple protein functions phosphoproteins are coordinated and regulated by a network of kinases phosphatases and phospho binding_proteins which modify the phosphorylation states recognize unique phosphopeptides or target_proteins for degradation detailed and complete information on the structure and dynamics of these networks is required to better understand fundamental_mechanisms of cellular_processes and diseases high_throughput have been developed to investigate phosphoproteomes in model_organisms and human_diseases among them mass_spectrometry based_technologies are the major platforms and have been widely_applied which has led to explosive_growth of phosphoproteomic data in recent_years new bioinformatics_tools are needed to analyse and make sense of these data moreover most research has focused on individual phosphoproteins and kinases to gain a more complete knowledge of cellular_processes systems_biology approaches including pathways and networks modelling have to be applied to integrate all components of the phosphorylation machinery including kinases phosphatases their substrates and phospho binding_proteins we developed here a machine_learning algorithm that estimates the activities of all kinases which are known to phosphorylate sequences occurring in a phosphoproteomics dataset the algorithm thus reduces the dimensions of the parameter_space to the number of kinases and renders the data easier to display and analyse the estimated activities can then be used for modelling or inference of new kinasetarget links previous_approaches to infer kinase_activities from phosphoproteomic data only rely on the number of targets in the sample without taking the detected amounts of phosphorylation into account or solely deliver relative activities from one condition to another and do not include affinity parameters for kinasetarget interactions ikap however calculates the absolute activities for each condition separately and thus provides a more precise picture of pathway engagement in biological_samples furthermore in opposition to previous_approaches an arbitrary number of kinases can be assigned to each phosphosite which makes the approach more realistic compared with sorting phosphosites into distinct kinase groups and considers uncertainties in kinase specificities for certain targets especially in the case of time resolved data the computed kinase_activities are directly applicable as an input to subsequent dynamical modelling the calculated affinities can thereby be used as starting points for parameter calibration and through the use of identifiability analysis it is possible to determine how reliable the computed activities are the derivation of novel kinasetarget pairs as it is described in is an in vitro method that has to be performed for each kinase individually thus it is much more time consuming furthermore ikap provides a ready to use framework whereas previous_approaches need to be implemented by the user from scratch although the approach does not include phosphatases both the estimated kinase_activities and the newly derived links proved to be reliable in literature and motif based validation our conclusion is that at least in helas cells and murine hepatocytes phosphatase_activity could rather be considered as a factor which removes phosphorylations at a constant_rate than a mechanism which is under sophisticated regulation since this can be different in other cell_types the findings that are generated through the application of our method should always be critically_appraised and validated the algorithm represents a step towards a system wide understanding of signal_transduction within a cell in the near future we will further test it on other phosphoproteomics datasets and implement versions in other programming_languages like python and r to make it available to a larger community of scientists
