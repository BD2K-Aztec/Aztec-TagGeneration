databases_and a fast peptide match service for uniprot knowledgebase we have developed a new web_application for peptide matching using apache lucene based search_engine the peptide match service is designed to quickly retrieve all occurrences of a given query peptide from uniprot knowledgebase uniprotkb with iso forms the matched proteins are shown in summary tables with rich annotations including matched sequence region s and links to corresponding proteins in a number of proteomic peptide spectral databases the results are grouped by taxonomy and can be browsed by organism taxonomic_group or taxonomy tree the service supports queries where isobaric leucine and isoleucine are treated equivalent and an option for searching uniref representative sequences as well as dynamic queries to major proteomic databases in addition to the web_interface we also provide restful web_services the underlying data are updated every weeks in accordance with the uniprot releases availability http proteininformationresource org locating occurrences of a specific peptide in a protein_sequence database is important for protein identification in proteomics_studies as well as for sequence_based protein retrieval the protein information resource has hosted a peptide match service for years it is one of the most popular tools on the protein information resource website although exact peptide matching is algorithmically simple quickly locating a peptide in a large protein_sequence database has become challenging as the number of protein_sequences exponentially increases so_far to our knowledge no other peptide match services provide all of the key_characteristics in our new service including search speed support for any query peptide of amino_acids coverage of all uniprotkb sequences including isoforms and frequent update other major peptide match methods are unipept which indexes in silico digested tryptic_peptides and pep pro which uses indexes based on mers a detailed comparison of these and our method is provided in the supplementary_material supplementary another related work is sans which uses suffix_arrays to effectively_identify protein sequence_similarities in the range of identity as brute_force peptide matching is slow we need effective_ways to index protein_sequences analogous to indexing in relational databases the recent_advance in search_engine technology such as the apache lucene tm information_retrieval software library provides a scalable and high performance index structure as well as powerful and efficient_search algorithms to build a fast search_engine for our peptide match service here we present our new peptide matching application with an enhanced web user_interface experiments we provide a dynamic search of the query peptide against four major proteomic peptide spectral databases gpmdb nist peptide_libraries peptideatlas and pride from our web_application using the search_engines of those individual databases the current_implementation of peptide match service uses apache lucene and apache solr tm for indexing and searching the web_application is developed in java server pages servlets running on apache tomcat the search_engine is fast and accurate a typical peptide match from our web_interface takes only a second including time spent rendering the results on the search time itself our test results showed an average of s from a random_sample of million peptides of mers derived from the uniprotkb human complete proteome for uniprotkb release containing million protein_sequences with annotations gb the index size is gb and the indexing time is h on a linux server with intel_xeon ghz cpus and gb ram the peptide match web_interface provides multiple functionalities both for input query and output navigation a user can input a query peptide and specify whether to search the entire uniprotkb or limit the search to sequences from one or more selected organisms for the latter a user can either enter an organism name taxonomic id of a uniprot complete proteome or select a set of organisms from the uniprot reference proteomes additional options are provided to i restrict the matches in uniref representative sequences to reduce redundancy and ii equate isobaric leucine and isoleucine to support ms based proteomics the match results are summarized by organism and taxonomic_group as pie charts and listed as tables the matched proteins are shown in paginated tables along with annotations matched region s in the protein_sequence and hypertext links to corresponding databases the match results can be sorted by different fields and browsed by organisms taxonomic_group or taxonomy tree as an example peptide aaveegivlgggcallr matches proteins in uniprotkb among which are from mammals and have links to corresponding proteins in pride nist peptide_libraries and iedb respectively for direct proteomic evidence of the query peptide the dynamic search using search_engines of the proteomic peptide spectral databases further displayed the peptide with links to the source ms data for a given peptide the matching protein entries from uniprotkb database can be directly accessed using a simple url e g http proteininformationresource org peptide svqy ddvpeyk and used for other servers as in peptideatlas we also provide a web_interface for batch submission of peptides to our service as well as restful web_services the underlying data of our new peptide match server are updated every weeks in accordance with the uniprot releases the peptide match services will be forthcoming from the uniprot website www uniprot org
