phylogenetics evolutionary footprint of coevolving positions in genes motivation the analysis of molecular coevolution provides information on the potential functional and structural implication of positions along dna_sequences and several methods are available to identify coevolving positions using probabilistic or combinatorial approaches the specific nucleotide or amino_acid profile associated with the coe volution process is however not estimated but only known profiles such as the watsoncrick constraint are usually considered a priori in current measures of coevolution results here we propose a new probabilistic_model coev to identify coevolving positions and their associated profile in dna_sequences while incorporating the underlying phylogenetic_relationships the process of coevolution is modeled by a instantaneous rate matrix that includes rates of transition as well as a profile of coevolution we used simulated empirical and illustrative data to evaluate our model and to compare it with a model of independent evolution using akaike_information we showed that the coev model is able to discriminate between coevolving and non coevolving positions and provides better specificity and specificity than other available approaches we further demonstrate that the identification of the profile of coevolution can shed new light on the process of dependent substitution during lineage evolution coevolution is defined as the modification of a biological object triggered by the change of a related object this process of dependent evolution has been described in various biological_systems and can be an essential process behind changes occurring at both morphological level e g coevolution of female and male genital morphology and molecular level e g ligandreceptor interactions at the molecular level studies of dependent substitutions have gained importance in evolutionary_biology because of the potential functional and structural interpretations that can be made on the positions identified as coevolving for example coevolving positions in proteins are known to be involved in allosteric communication to create physically connected networks that link distant functional positions in the tertiary_structure and to modify the structure of the protein further it has been shown recently that coevolving fragments within protein_sequences can also be involved in binding_specificity and folding constraints they are thus good indicators to explain folding_intermediates peptide assembly and key mutations with known roles in genetic_diseases coevolution within rna_sequences also revealed structurally and functionally_important positions which are often located on helices and are subject to watsoncrick constraint i e guaninecytosine and adeninethymine complementarity for example the positions and of the s ribosomal_rna in thermus_thermophilus coevolved under the specific watsoncrick profile cc uu respectively to maintain the specific hydrogen_bonds necessary for the stability of the helix hairpin like structure current methods designed to detect coevolution focus primarily on the identification of pair of positions along the aligned sequence by evaluating a score of coevolution some methods consider solely the set of aligned sequences to estimate these coevolving positions while others take into account the evolutionary_history of the observed sequences the score of coevolution usually represents the correlation of the nucleotide or amino_acid found at two different positions along a multiple_alignment this correlation can be considered as the outcome of the dependent evolutionary_process that is depicted by coevolution and the correlated pairs constitute the set of coevolving nucleotides_or this set is defined here as the profile of coevolution and is similar to the profile of site classes present in phylogenetic mixture_models e g while current methods designed to detect coevolving positions have proven very useful they do not estimate the coevolving profile that corresponds to the structural or functional constraints involved in the evolutionary_process this lack of a mechanistic component induces the use of arbitrary rules to identify the profile of coevolution for protein_coding such as using the most frequent pattern within a pair of coevolving positions alternatively the profile of to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com coevolution can be set a priori like in the case of rna_sequences where watsoncrick profiles are known to be important setting a profile a priori was done in a bayesian context by constraining the mapping of substitutions that occurred independently at each site on the branches of the phylogenetic_tree using as weights the biochemical_properties of the nucleotides defining the watsoncrick constraint similarly this constraint was used as modifiers of the rate parameters of a dependent model describing the process of coevolution state_transitions that establish or maintain watson_crick were favored and coevolution under this specific constraint was assessed through likelihood_ratio these two approaches confirmed that a well known coevolving pair was constrained by a watsoncrick profile in s rna_sequences however other known types of constraints such as the hoogsteen base_pairing were not explicitly incorporated in the model and thus not identified in these analyses furthermore the integration of particular constraints in the models may be difficult in the case of amino_acid or proteincoding dna_sequences for which little a priori information is available regarding the coevolving profiles thus the coevolving profile should be considered as a parameter to be estimated from the data rather than being defined on the basis of the frequencies of coevolving patterns or of known constraints methods that estimate coevolving profiles in dna rna or protein_sequences are currently not available however some methods have been developed for binary encoded data where coevolving profiles represent presence_or of characters such as genes restriction_sites introns indels and methylation_sites identifying the profiles of binary character states involved in correlated_evolution is also an important part of the analyses of phenotypic_data these approaches have progressed from using maximum_parsimony criteria to a full probabilistic_framework in which the dynamics of presence and absence of events are assumed to follow a continuous_time process along the phylogenetic_tree in this context it is possible to define a dependent substitution model which is expressed as a matrix of instantaneous transition_rates to explain the correlated_evolution of two binary characters each row and column of this matrix specifies a pair of character states built on an alphabet of size i e the character states of binary_traits which defines two possible profiles of coevolution or this model can be compared to an independent model of evolution which assumes a single substitution matrix through likelihood_ratio it is possible to apply the ideas used for binary_data to identify profiles in molecular data the nucleic or proteic alphabet can be reduced to an alphabet of size two using the physico_chemical behind the nucleotides_or this reduction is however arbitrary and could omit important factors that play a role in the evolution of the molecular sequences for this reason we propose in this study a new markov_model that describes the evolutionary_process of coevolving positions along dna_sequences because correlated positions within nucleotide and protein_sequences are the result of an evolutionary_process a better understanding of the coevolving profile should be obtained by incorporating the underlying evolutionary_history of the sequences i e their phylogenetic_relationships and the associated profile we thus developed a dependent model of nucleotide_substitutions based on a instantaneous rate matrix that includes four substitution_rates s d r r and a fifth parameter representing the profile of coevolution we implemented the model in maximum_likelihood and bayesian frameworks the performance of the model was tested simulated_datasets and we compared the models predictions with existing methodologies on empirical data we presented a new dependent model of evolution coev based on the broad class of markov_models coev can reliably identify the coevolving pairs of nucleotide positions and their molecular footprint expressed by the profile of coevolution the coev model incorporates free_parameters that are easily interpreted from an evolutionary perspective and that govern the change of one combination into another within pairs of coevolving positions our model is mechanistic and describes the process of evolution that is responsible for the simultaneous evolution of dependent sites along dna or amino_acid the profile of coevolution is explicitly incorporated in the model as a discrete parameter and thus can be estimated from the data it is an essential parameter in our model since it shapes the instantaneous rate matrix at the base of coev supplementary supplementary_material and defines the number of occurrences of the rate parameters s d r and r supplementary supplementary_material the parameter s is the rate of transition from a coevolving combination to a noncoevolving one this parameter thus represents the rate of a necessary step yielding conflict that precedes the shift to a new coevolving combination a new substitution is then required to re establish the coevolving profile and this event is modeled by the parameter d this parameter d therefore represents the rate of transition from a non coevolving combination to a coevolving one parameters s and d describe the two temporally successive substitutions that are the minimum requirement to shift from one coevolving combination to another in the profile the additional parameters r and r represent the rates of independent substitution between non coevolving combinations performance sensitivity_and plots sensitivity_and plots comparing the performance of the coev model to comap s comp and co for each dataset and tips we simulated an alignment of positions coevolving positions and independently evolving scomp i is the performance of s comp method when only maximal scores of are considered whereas scomp ii considered the top scores comaps performance where evaluated when considering coevolving pairs with a stat score and a p value while the specificity does not strikingly change across datasets and methods the sensitivity is higher for the coev when compared to the other methods conflictual substitutions in each site are modeled by a single independent rate regardless of the type of substitution e g transition transversion thus resembling a jc model the model can however be extended to incorporate more complex nucleotide_substitution models such as the gtr we presented a new fully mechanistic model that describes the processes governing the coevolution of a pair of positions conserved sites have been extracted from gene_families for more than years but we propose that the evolutionary profile of coevolving sites should be added to these known signatures this will help the community to classify highly_divergent sequences and better interpret the function of new ones
