sequence_analysis tissue_specific prediction of directly regulated_genes direct binding by a transcription_factor tf to the proximal_promoter of a gene is a strong evidence that the tf regulates the gene assaying the genome_wide binding of every tf in every cell_type and condition is currently impractical histone_modifications correlate with tissue cell condition specific tissue_specific tf_binding so histone chip_seq can be combined with traditional position_weight pwm methods to make tissue_specific predictions of tfpromoter interactions results we use supervised_learning to train a nave_bayes predictor of tfpromoter binding the predictors features are the histone_modification levels and a pwm based score for the promoter training and testing uses sets of promoters labeled using tf chip_seq and we use cross_validation on such datasets to measure the accuracy a pwm histone nave_bayes predictor using a single histone_modification h_k is substantially more accurate than a pwm score or a conservation based score phylogenetic motif model the nave_bayes predictor is more accurate on average at all sensitivity levels and makes only half as many false_positive at sensitivity levels from to on average it correctly_predicts of bound promoters at a false_positive of accuracy does not diminish when we test the predictor in a different cell_type and species from training accuracy is barely diminished even when we train the predictor without using tf chip_seq chromatin_immunoprecipitation combined with deep_sequencing chip_seq has been applied to the prediction of transcription_factor tfbss allowing the creation of genome_wide maps of in vivo binding_sites these maps however are both tissueand condition specific requiring chip_seq to be performed in each different tissue and condition of interest the large number of tissues and conditions and the associated cost suggest that there is a strong continued role for in silico tfbs scanning fortunately with the advent of chip_seq and other technologies such as protein binding microarray pbm there has been a rapid expansion in the number to whom correspondence should be addressed of high_quality transcription_factor tf_binding motifs available as position_weight pwms widening the applicability of motif based in silico prediction_methods most in silico methods that aim to predict tf_binding and hence gene_regulation however are not tissue or condition specific which we will abbreviate as tissue_specific they base their tfbs predictions solely on the genomic_dna of the organism in some cases also considering conservation in the dna of related species this approach fails to account for tissue_specific epigenetic changes to genomic_dna which contribute to the well known tendency of these methods to overpredict binding_sites more to the point tfbs predictions that do not take dynamic epigenetic changes into account cannot be tissue_specific a major type of tissue_specific epigenetic change affecting tf_binding involves proteins called histones around which genomic_dna is wrapped to form chromatin in the eukaryotic nucleus approximately one third of histone protein_sequence comprises a tail that is subject to many different covalent post_translational approximately different histone_modifications have been mapped genome_wide allowing the link between the different histone_modifications and gene_transcription to be extensively_studied generally acetylation and phosphorylation are indicative of active_transcription sumoylation is usually found in transcriptionally_silent regions and methylation and ubiquitination are implicated in both activation and repression of transcription together a combination of only three of these modifications was found to be highly_predictive of gene_expression our goal is to predict the gene_promoters bound by a given tf in a given tissue several studies have shown that the use of tissue_specific histone_modification data can improve the prediction of tfbss these studies however have either used a relatively crude threshold filtering based_approach or have made genome_wide low_resolution predictions of binding in bp regions here we expand on previous_research by developing a chromatin_modification based tissue_specific predictor of tf_binding in promoter_regions we restrict our attention to binding in the region bp to bp around the transcriptional_start tss this allows us to more confidently associate predicted tf binding_events to a particular tss and increases our confidence that the tf regulates a particular gene focusing separately on tf_binding in promoters rather than genome_wide also eliminates the effects of differences in chromatin_modifications between active promoters and enhancers our new method for predicting if a promoter is bound by a tf computes a score that combines the promoters maximum pwm score and the total chip_seq tag counts of histone_modifications within the promoter in the tissue of interest a single histone modificationh k me appears to be as informative about the presence of tf_binding as any of the combinations of histone_modifications we tested this means that our approach is immediately practical since genome_wide chip_seq for h_k in many tissues is already available the software we make available dr gene can be used to make tissue_specific predictions of binding of a tf for which a pwm is available and for which h_k chip_seq exist in the tissue of interest as the results inshow the accuracy of predictions will be improved if tf chip data are available for at least one tf in the tissue of interest but this is not necessary our predictor can be trained and used in tissues for which no tf chip data yet exists the effectiveness of combining pwm scores with h_k scores for predicting tf_binding is consistent with our previous work there we filtered out regions with low h_k scores and then made binding predictions based on pwm scores a drawback of this earlier approach is that regions with marginal h_k scores are treated as unbound without considering their pwm score at all our current method removes this drawback and also focuses exclusively on predicting bound promoters the surprising ability of the h_k score of a promoter to predict whether it is bound by any tf see green curve in indicates that this score could function as an extremely good prior for predicting tf_binding evaluating in silico methods for predicting tf_binding is problematic we have chosen to consider all core promoters as bound that contain the midpoint of a tf chip_seq peak however some chip_seq may represent indirect binding by the tf so the core_promoter may not contain a strong match to the tfs pwm it is tempting therefore to remove promoters lacking strong pwm matches from the list of bound core promoters in a given reference_set we feel that doing so would give an unfairly optimistic estimate of the accuracy of pwm based prediction_methods including our nave_bayes score reference sets constructed using a given pwm method would be biased in favor of that pwm since any core promoters that are directly bound by the tf but do not match the possibly inaccurate pwm would be eliminated our method of evaluation therefore considers all promoters as bound for which tf chip_seq indicates binding within the core_promoter even though such binding may be indirect and thus impossible for the tfs pwm to detect in addition we recognize that some directly bound promoters will be labeled as unbound in our reference sets due to missing peaks caused by limitations in the raw chip_seq e g sequencing_depth and by the accuracy of the algorithms used to determine chip_seq both conservation based prediction_approaches that we test here are on average actually less accurate than using a pwm to predict the core promoters bound by a tf this does not necessarily mean that conservation based_predictions of tf_binding are less accurate than pwm based_predictions if one is trying to predict all sites bound in any tissue however because we use tissue_specific chip_seq to label core promoters sites that are not bound in the tissue of interest but are highly_conserved because of function in a different tissue or tissues will be treated as false_positives this potentially explains the slightly_lower accuracy of the conservation based prediction_methods tested here it is still somewhat unexpected that combining a conservation based binding score with the h_k score monkey h_k is no more accurate than the nonconservation based pwm h_k score this may be due to characteristics of our reference setssuch as the problems of indirectly bound promoters and missing peaks discussed above limiting the accuracy attainable by any pwm based prediction method
