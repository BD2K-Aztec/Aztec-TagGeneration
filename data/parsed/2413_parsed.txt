incorporating key position and amino_acid features to identify general and species specific ubiquitin conjugation sites motivation systematic dissection of the ubiquitylation proteome is emerging as an appealing but challenging research_topic because of the significant roles ubiquitylation play not only in protein_degradation but also in many other cellular_functions high_throughput experimental_studies using mass_spectrometry have identified many ubiquityla tion sites primarily from eukaryotes however the vast_majority of ubiquitylation sites remain undiscovered even in well studied systems because mass spectrometrybased experimental_approaches for identifying ubiquitylation events are costly time consuming and biased toward abundant proteins and proteotypic peptides in silico prediction of ubiquitylation sites is a potentially useful alternative strategy for whole proteome annotation because of various limitations current ubiquitylation site prediction_tools were not well designed to comprehensively assess proteomes results we present a novel tool known as ubiprober specifically_designed for large_scale predictions of both general and species specific ubiquitylation sites we collected proteomics_data for ubiquityla tion from multiple species from several reliable sources and used them to train prediction_models by a comprehensive machine_learning approach that integrates the information from key_positions and key_amino cross_validation tests reveal that ubiprober achieves some improvement over existing_tools in predicting species specific ubiquitylation sites moreover independent_tests show that ubiprober improves the areas under receiver_operating by by using the combined model availability the ubiprober server is freely_available on the web atthe nobel_prize in chemistry was awarded to aaron ciechanover avram hershko and irwin rose for their discovery of ubiquitin mediated protein_degradation in eukaryotes numerous studies subsequent to their original work showed that the ubiquitinproteasome system ups plays_a in regulating a variety of biological_processes such as the cell_cycle and division the immune_response inflammation and signal_transduction further analysis proposed that ubiquitin mediated ubiquitylation was a ubiquitous post_translational in eukaryotes ubiquitylation has a conserved proteasome system in which the conjugation of ubiquitin to substrates usually involves three steps ubiquitin is first activated by a ubiquitin activating_enzyme e then conjugated to a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme e and finally transferred to a substrate molecule with the assistance of a ubiquitin_ligase enzyme e forming an isopeptide bond with an internal lysine of the target protein in the ups ubiquitylation regulates a variety of biological_processes thereby aberrations of ups function in all of the above_mentioned processes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human_diseases ranging from inflammatory neurodegenerative_diseases to various forms of malignancies to further decipher the mechanism of the ups or other regulatory_roles of ubiquitylation at the molecular level an initial but crucial step is to identify ubiquitylation substrates and the corresponding ubiquitylation sites researchers have used several experimental methods to purify ubiquitylation sites such as the use of affinity tagged ubiquitin ubiquitin antibodies and ubiquitinbinding proteins and highthroughput mass_spectrometry ms technique unfortunately experimental identification of ubiquitylation sites in a global manner is still a difficult expensive_and task hence in silico prediction of ubiquitylation events can be highly_valuable in many cases tung anddesigned the first ubiquitylation sites predictor ubipred using a support_vector svm with informative physicochemical features selected from the published amino_acid indices subsequently proposed a random_forest based predictor called ubpred in which sequence attributes were used as the input feature_vectors developed a method ubsite using an efficient radial_basis rbf network to identify protein ubiquitylation sites cksaap ubsite was constructed byfor identifying ubiquitylation sites by using the composition of k space amino_acid surrounding a query site with the assistance of a svm recently presented a method based on multi sequence_features and the nearest_neighbor algorithm these computational_methods can be divided_into two categories methods of ubiquitylation site prediction for single species and multispecies ubpred and cksaap ubsite fall into the first category the latter category includes ubipred ubsite and the method of cai et_al more information about these tools or methods is given in supplementary table s despite the availability of various ubiquitylation site prediction_methods they have limitations when applied to whole proteomes the first limitation of ubiquitylation site prediction is accuracy the overall performance of the several aforementioned predictors is still not fully satisfactory and there is still room to improve_the the second limitation is that the ubiquitylation relationships among different species are not discussed in these methods additionally there is no systematic species specific model to maximize the predictor performance of ubiquitylation sites the third limitation is the training data deficiency and homology bias that lead to lack of statistical_significance furthermore some of these tools were only published as a method and did not provide a user_friendly web_service and this makes predictions a laborious or impossible task even those tools with web_services either do not support stringency adjustment or only support several predefined stringency levels from which a user can choose that may not meet every users requirement user control of the prediction stringency is important especially for large_scale predictions because typically a user is interested only in predictions above a certain confidence threshold to address the limitations of the existing_methods we developed a new tool known as ubiprober which is specifically_designed to predict both general and species specific ubiquitylation sites reliable and large_scale experimental ubiquitin proteomics_data from multiple species were collected from several sources and used to train the ubiquitylation site prediction_models three sets of features k nearest_neighbor knn feature physicochemical property pcp and amino_acid aac were extracted from the training data and combined using a svm to make predictions the knn features capture the local sequence_similarity around sites that are ubiquitylated by the same enzyme or enzyme_family regardless of whether the enzymesubstrate interactions are known pcps and aacs reflect the biochemical environment of the regions_surrounding ubiquitylation sites and these regions play various roles in the structure and function of a protein additionally to extract the meaningful_information and enhance the overall accuracy of the predictor the information_gain ig method was first used to choose some key_positions and key_amino to optimize each feature_set furthermore we discussed the relationship of ubiquitylation in different species our analysis shows the following i the ubiquitylation patterns are conserved across different species ii some key_positions and key_amino are essential for improving the prediction_performance of a ubiquitylation model and iii the physicochemical_properties of residues in the flanking_sequences are important for the ubiquitylation process finally the software system and web_service of ubiprober were implemented in net framework and are freely_available to academic researchers in ubiprober we have trained the general prediction model for a eukaryotic proteome and species specific prediction_models for three species specific proteomes in addition ubiprober supports continuous stringency adjustment to meet the various confidence requirements of users cross_validation tests and comparisons with other tools show that ubiprober performs better at general prediction and is comparable with existing_methods at species specific predictions we believe that ubiprober could serve as a powerful and complementary tool for in vivo or in vitro ubiquitylation site identification additionally the combination of computational_analyses with experimental_verification could greatly speed up our systematic understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of ubiquitylation
