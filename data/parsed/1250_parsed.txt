damidseq pipeline an automated pipeline for processing damid sequencing_datasets damid is a powerful technique for identifying regions of the genome bound by a dna_binding or dna associated protein currently no method exists for automatically processing next_generation damid damid seq data and the use of damid seq datasets with nor malization based on read_counts alone can lead to high background and the loss of bound signal damid seq thus presents novel challenges in terms of normalization and background minimization we describe here damidseq pipeline a software pipeline that performs automatic normaliza tion and background reduction on multiple damid seq fastq datasets availability_and open_source and freely_available from http owenjm github io damidseq pipeline the damidseq pipeline is implemented in perl and is compatible with any unix based operating system e g linux mac osx contactdamid is a well established technique for discovering regions of dna bound by or associated with proteins van it has been used to map the genome_wide binding of transcription_factors chromatin proteins nuclear complexes associated with dna and rna_pol for e g the technique can be performed in cell_culture whole organisms van or with cell_type specificity and requires no fixation or antibody purification damid involves the fusion of a bacterial_dna adenine methylase dam to any dna associated protein of interest the bacterial dam protein methylates adenine in the sequence gatc and given that higher_eukaryotes lack native adenine methylation the dnabinding footprint of the protein of interest is uniquely detectable through isolating sequences flanked by methylated gatc sites however a major consideration with damid is that any dam protein within the nucleus will non specifically methylate adenines in gatc sequences at accessible regions of the genome for this reason damid is always performed_concurrently with a dam only control and the final dna_binding profile is typically presented as a log dam fusion dam only ratio although the majority of published damid experiments have used tiling microarrays for data analysis next_generation ngs allows greater sensitivity and higher accuracy although several recent_studies have used ngs with damid these have relied upon a comparison of peak binding intensities between read_count normalized dam fusion and dam samples depending on the characteristics of the dam fusion_protein see later this approach may lead to real signal being lost and correct normalization of the datasets is required to detect all binding by many damfusion proteins here we describe a software pipeline for the automated processing of damid sequencing damid seq data including normalization and background reduction algorithms
