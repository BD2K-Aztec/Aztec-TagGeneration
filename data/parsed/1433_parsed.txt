genome_analysis dist direct imputation of summary_statistics for unmeasured snps motivation genotype imputation_methods are used to enhance the resolution of genome_wide and thus increase the detection rate for genetic signals although most studies report all univariate summary_statistics many of them limit the access to subject level genotypes because such an access is required by all genotype imputation_methods it is helpful to develop methods that impute summary_statistics without going through the interim step of imputing genotypes even when subject level genotypes are available due to the substantial computational_cost of the typical genotype_imputation there is a need for faster imputation_methods results direct imputation of summary_statistics dist imputes the summary_statistics of untyped variants without first imputing their subject level genotypes this is achieved by i using the conditional expectation formula for multivariate_normal variates and ii using the correlation_structure from a relevant reference_population when compared with genotype imputation_methods dist i requires only a fraction of their computational_resources ii has comparable imputation_accuracy for independent subjects and iii is readily_applicable to the imputation of association_statistics coming from large pedigree data thus the proposed application is useful for a fast imputation of summary results for i studies of unrelated subjects which a do not provide subject level genotypes or b have a large size and ii family association studies availability_and pre compiled executables built under commonly used operating_systems are publicly_available atgenome wide association studies gwass have been successful in detecting associations between genetic_variants and complex_diseases however gwass genotype only a fraction of the tens of millions of single_nucleotide snps found in the human_genome to increase resolution and thus the detection rate for genetic signals researchers proposed imputing genotypes at numerous untyped unmeasured snps most commonly used genotype_imputation tools e g impute mach bimbam and beagle are based on hidden_markov hmms although these methods are accurate due to their need for haplotypic phasing of all subjects in the study they are extremely burdensome computationally their computational_burden would become even more extreme with the ever increasing size of studies and reference_panels other genotype imputation_methods plink snpmstat unphased and tuna are based on multinomial models mms of haplotype_frequencies instead of hmm these methods are simpler and faster but their imputation_accuracy is generally lower than the accuracy of hmm based_methods recently researchers proposed a new mm based imputation method called blimp which imputes genotypes allele_frequencies for unmeasured snps by using the conditional expectation formula for multivariate_normal variates regardless of their model usage all these imputation tools require a twostage procedure that i imputes subject level genotypes at the unmeasured snps on the basis of genotypes at measured snps and a relevant reference_population e g genomes kg and ii tests for association between imputed genotypes and phenotype of interest however this procedure requires access to subject level genotypes which are often unavailable to directly impute summary_statistics while i substantially reducing the computational_burden and ii retaining imputation_accuracy we propose direct imputation of summary_statistics dist dist avoids the imputation of subject level genotypes by directly applying to unmeasured snp statistics the classical conditional expectation formula for multivariate_normal variates we compare the performance of dist with the performance of typical hmm and mm methods given the speed and accuracy of shapeit phasing we chose impute as the representative for the hmm based_methods given its wide availability we chose plink as the representative for the mm based_methods thus we compare the performance of dist impute and plink at default_settings to predict imputed height snps in realistic simulations under both the null and the alternative hypothesis the phenotypes height of subjects are simulated as a function of the effects at the significant snps from the height metaanalysis section in supplementary_material imputations used europeans in kg as the reference_sample and were performed on a single linux machine intel_xeon ghz processor and gb of ram the average_accuracy of imputed z scores in the above simulations as measured by the squared correlation_coefficient r between imputed and true z scores is high for dist and impute and moderately_high for plink the average running time per simulation was min for dist min for imputing pre phasing for impute and min for plink the maximum memory requirement was mb for dist mb for impute and mb for plink dist and impute were also used to impute the statistics for snps missing at random on chromosome of a dataset of subjects which included the data described in the next paragraph dist required min of running time and at most mb of memory and impute required min for imputation pre phasing and mb of memory to impute untyped statistics dist requires only the joint correlation_matrix for the statistics at typed and untyped snps because this matrix does not depend on the relationship between subjects in the study unlike genotype imputation_methods dist can be readily used to impute statistics for family association studies we illustrate this advantage by applying the method to a proprietary irish alcohol_dependence study sample consisting of controls and cases from irish families the subjects were genotyped using affymetrix snp_array and the association_statistics were computed using mqls to impute unmeasured snps we used uk k www uk k org as the reference_panel supplementary
