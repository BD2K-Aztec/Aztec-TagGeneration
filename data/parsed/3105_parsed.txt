gene_expression mrmre an r package for parallelized mrmr ensemble feature_selection motivation feature_selection is one of the main challenges in analyzing high_throughput minimum redundancy maximum relevance mrmr is a particularly fast feature_selection method for finding a set of both relevant and complementary features here we describe the mrmre r package in which the mrmr technique is extended by using an ensemble approach to better explore the feature_space and build more robust predictors to deal with the computational_complexity of the ensemble approach the main functions of the package are implemented and parallelized in c using the openmp application_programming results our ensemble mrmr implementations outperform the classical mrmr approach in terms of prediction_accuracy they identify genes more relevant to the biological_context and may lead to richer biological interpretations the parallelized functions included in the package show significant_gains in terms of run time speed when compared with previously released packages in genomic_data analysis phenotype associated feature_selection is of utmost_importance in understanding the biological_processes underlying the relevant phenotype and in building accurate predictive_models this is not a trivial task for high_throughput microarray next_generation etc as they are high_dimensional noisy and have complex intercorrelational structures because feature_selection is an nondeterministic polynomial time np_hard one must resort to the use of heuristics which find suitable and sub optimal sets of relevant_features in high_dimensional among these heuristics the minimum redundancy maximum relevance mrmr feature_selection technique is particularly appealing because of the relatively low computational_complexity of its algorithm for finding a set of relevant and complementary features from which accurate predictive_models are developed the challenge lies in that mrmr like all feature_selection in a low sample to dimensionality ratio setting produces highly_variable results and small changes in sample data often lead to dramatically different sets of selected_features in the past_decade a new trend has emerged whereby highly_accurate ensemble classifiers are produced by combining less accurate ones on the grounds that model variance is reduced without affecting bias however the computational_cost of an ensemble variant of the mrmr method is high as multiple mrmr feature selections must be done this was the primary motivator for the development of a new r package mrmre which implements an ensemble variant of mrmr in which multiple feature_sets rather than a single list of features is built also included in the package is a function for computing a mutual_information matrix mim based on the appropriate estimators for each variable type i e continuous discrete and survival data both these package features have been adapted to fully use multicore platforms the r package mrmre provides functions to efficiently perform ensemble mrmr feature_selection by taking full advantage of parallel_computing ensemble mrmr can be beneficial from both a predictive lower bias and lower variance and biological more thorough feature_space exploration point_of which makes it particularly attractive for high_throughput analysis
