genome_analysis a link between h_k mark and exon length in the gene_promoters of pluripotent and differentiated_cells we conducted a reanalysis of genome_wide histone h tail methylation data in mammalian pluripotent and differentiated_cells we show that the promoters marked with histone h lysine trimethylation h_k tend to have more exonic positions in the promoter_regions however this is not due to any preferential marking on exons over introns by h_k the relationship is also independent the status of histone h lysine trimethylation h_k mark cpg content and the platforms used in the high_throughput profiling of histone_modifications it provides evidence for the link between histone_modifications and transcribed exons in promoter_regions contact histone_modification is closely_related to cellular_states and gene_regulation chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip combined with chip or sequencing_technologies has been a powerful_tool to map the genome wide_distribution of histone_modifications the highresolution maps of several key histone_modifications have been obtained for the embryonic_stem es_cells and the differentiated cell_lineages among the modifications on histone_tails histone h lysine and lysine methylation are of particular interest genes with the promoters marked by histone h lysine trimethylation h_k but not histone h lysine trimethylation h_k are actively expressed genes with the promoters marked by both h_k and h_k termed bivalent domains are poised for expression and those with only h_k marks are stably repressed reviewed in these modifications are catalyzed by trithorax and polycomb_group proteins respectively the proteins mediate the epigenetic inheritance of lineage_specific gene_expression and have important function in development all of these reflect the central role of h_k and h_k in the maintenance of pluripotent_state and the lineage potential to whom correspondence should be addressed another histone_modification h_k has been reported to be associated with transcriptional elongation more recent_studies show that exons are preferentially marked with h_k relative to introns which indicates a dynamic link between transcription and splicing intragenic histone hyper acetylation affects nearby alternative_splicing which further indicates the coupling of transcription and splicing through histone_modifications in addition it has been reported that rna directed transcriptional gene_silencing tgs can be initiated through promoter targeted sirnas and the targeted promoters are marked with silent histone h_k and h_k during tgs low_copy of promoter associated rnas are transcribed e g rnas transcribed from upstream promoter in close_proximity and recognized by the antisense strand of the sirna to mediate tgs these results indicate that transcribed rnas are closely_related to histone_modifications here we explore the relationship between h_k modification and the rna transcribed from the same promoter specifically we found that the promoters marked by h_k tend to have more exonic positions in the promoter_regions which further indicates the potential relationship between histone_modifications and transcribed rnas we observed that the h_k enrichment was associated with the number of exonic positions in the promoter_region pexonlength plot the pexon lengthfor the promoters marked with h_k and the promoters without h_k mark the promoters were from the full promoter sets it clearly shows that the promoter marked with h_k tended to have more exonic positions the p values based on the wilcoxon_test if a promoter was consistently marked with h_k acrossmultiple tissue and cell_lines it tended to have more exonic positions among the mouse promoters with the pexon_length equal to kb i e the first exon is kb of them were marked with h_k in at least one cell_line or tissue for the remaining promoters with the pexon_length kb only of them were marked with h_k in at least one cell_line or tissue the p value based on the test is this association was also observed in human es_cells for both chip_seq and chip_chip data it shows that the association between pexon_length and h_k is independent of the high_throughput platforms similarly the test was performed to compare the proportion of the marked promoters among the promoters with the pexon_length equal to kb and the proportion among the promoters with the pexon_length kb the p value is for the chip_seq and for the chip_chip data for the conservative promoter sets the results were similar supplementary lists the correlations between the histone_modification signals and the pexon_length and other parameters the modification signal was the number of sequence reads_mapped to the promoter for the chip_seq or the average probe intensity in the promoter for the chip_chip data the pexon_length had a significant_positive with the h_k signal for all of the considered cell_lines and for both the full promoter sets and the conservative promoter sets however the correlation between the pexon_length and h_k was positive for some cell_lines and negative for other cell_lines indicating inconsistent patterns between cell_lines the magnitude of the correlation was small and the p value could be as high as for the human es_cells in addition the h_k signal had a stronger association with the pexon_length than with the utr length in the promoter_region p utr length and the length of the first exon st exon length the latter two were highly_correlated with the pexon_length the correlations among these three parameters were page histone_modification signal was the number of sequence reads_mapped to the promoter or the average probe intensity for the promoter pearsons correlation_coefficients were calculated between the number of exonic positions overlapping with the promoter_region pexon_length and the h_k signal between the pexon_length and the h_k signal between the length utr region overlapping with the promoter_region p utr length and the h_k signal between the length of the first exon st exon length and the h_k signal between the length of other exonic region except the first exon overlapping with the promoter potherexon length and the h_k signal and between the length of the whole transcript trs length and the h_k signal about if we removed the contribution from the first exon to the pexon_length calculation the potherexon length still had a significant_positive with the h_k signal all p values were it indicates that the first exon length is probably the most important but not the only reason for the correlation between the pexon_length and the h_k signal in addition we considered the whole transcript length trs length the correlations between the h_k signal and the trs length were small and were not consistent between the high_throughput platforms and some of the p values were to understand whether the association between h_k and the pexon_length is a secondary effect of nucleosome_occupancy we studied the profile of non modified histone positions we investigated the relationship between nucleosome density and pexon_length profiled the histone h positions in the mouse_es using the pan h antibodies by analyzing the data we found that the correlation between the histone h occupancy and the pexon_length was for the full promoter set and for the conservative promoter set when we normalized the h_k signal by the pan h signal the h_k reads_mapped to the promoter the pan h reads_mapped to the promoter the correlation between the normalized h_k signal and the pexon_length was and for the full and conservative promoter sets the p values for the correlations the results indicate that the correlation between h_k and the pexon_length is not due to the correlation between h_k and the nucleosome_occupancy it may be noteworthy to mention that the nucleosome_occupancy level tends to be higher in internal exons than in introns here we focused on the promoter_region exons instead of the internal exons promoters can be marked by both h_k and h_k the association between the pexon_length and the h_k signal in the promoter_region was however independent of the h_k status as shown in the full promoter set was used when comparing the pexon_length of h_k and h_k promoters and the pexon_length of h_k and h_k promoters the p values based on the wilcoxon tests were cpg islands are important epigenetic and functional regulatory_elements and it has been shown that the h_k signals are enriched in the promoter cpg islands to study whether the association between the pexon_length and the h_k signal is dependent on the cpg percentage we divided our promoters into hcps and non hcps shows that the association was independent of the cpg percentage if the hcps or the non hcps wereconsistently marked with h_k they tended to have longer pexon_length the results for the conservative promoter set was similar supplementary besides the promoter cpg level we also considered the gc_content outside of the promoter_regions specifically we calculated the gc_content in the downstream and kb_region of the transcript start site the gc_content in the large region contains information about the genomic compositional structures we studied the correlation between the h_k signal in the upstream promoter_region and the downstream gc_content most of the correlations were between and however the correlation for the human chip_seq was as low as for the full promoter set and for the conservative promoter set p values were and the results indicate that the genomic compositional structures may be related to h_k modification but the association was not significant for the human chip_seq one possible explanation for such an association is that the h k m signal is higher in exonic_regions than in intronic_regions thus we investigated whether the h_k signal was different between the intronic_regions and the exonic_regions of promoters for the promoters marked with the h_k modification the sequence read_coverage at the exonic positions of the promoter was compared with the sequence read_coverage at the intronic positions of the promoter there was no significant_difference of the h_k signal between exonic positions and intronic positions of promoters the p values based on the paired wilcoxon tests are for both the full and conservative promoter sets when the h_k signal was high at the exonic positions of a promoter the signal at the intronic positions of this promoter was also high seefor the full promoter set and supplementaryfor the conservativepromoter set the results indicate that the exon length of the promoter_region is involved in the h_k modification but this modification on the histone does not distinguish exonic and intronic positions genes with multiple alternative promoters may have distinct chromatin status we suspected that alternative promoters distinctly marked by h_k might have different pexon lengths in our study there were mouse genes and human genes with more than one promoter from the full promoter sets these genes had a total of and alternative promoters for mouse and human respectively the alternative promoters marked with h_k tended to have longer pexonlength than the alternative promoters unmarked with h_k the p values based on the one sided wilcoxon tests to compare the two groups were all for mouse and human pair_wise comparison was also conducted we selected the pairs of alternative promoters that belong to the same gene but with distinct h_k signals for the mouse promoters we pooled the sequence_reads from three cell_lines and brain_tissue together the read_counts were multiplied by a constant to make the total reads equal to million for each cell_line and tissue a total of million_reads for the pooled sample for the human promoters we also multiplied the read_counts by a constant to make the total reads equal to million if a pair of mouse alternative promoters had a read_count difference we called them having distinct h_k patterns if a pair of human alternative promoters had a read_count difference we called them having distinct h_k patterns then the pexon_length of the promoter with higher h_k readswas compared with that of the promoter with lower h_k reads and belonging to the same gene the p value based on the paired one sided wilcoxon_test was and for the mouse and human promoters respectively however we should note that the alternative promoter information based on the refseq annotation is far from complete we show several examples in which genes have alternative promoters and the pexon_length and h_k signal were different for these alternative promoters in specificallyshows the h_k signal for gnas transcript_isoforms in mouse_es np cells mef cells and brain the promoters with longer exonic_regions were marked with h_k in all four conditions however the promoter with shorter exonic region was marked with h_k only in escs shows the h_k signal for runx transcript_isoforms in mouse_es np cells mef cells and brain the promoter with longer exonic region was marked with h_k in es_cells and brain however the promoter with shorter exonic region remained unmarked under these four conditions here we analyzed the relationship between the exonic positions and the histone_modifications in gene promoter_regions we found that although h_k marks do not distinguish exonic or intronic positions the number of exonic positions is positively associated with the h_k signal this association is independent of the h_k status nucleosome_occupancy cpg content and highthroughput platforms
