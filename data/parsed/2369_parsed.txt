gene_expression improved_performance on high_dimensional survival data by application of survival svm motivation new application areas of survival analysis as for example based on micro array expression data call for novel tools able to handle high_dimensional while classical semi_parametric techniques as based on likelihood or partial likelihood functions are omnipresent in clinical studies they are often inadequate for modelling in case when there are less observations than features in the data support_vector svms and extensions are in general found particularly useful for such cases both conceptually non parametric approach computationally boiling down to a convex program which can be solved efficiently theoretically for its intrinsic relation with learning theory as well as empirically this article_discusses such an extension of svms which is tuned towards survival data a particularly useful feature is that this method can incorporate such additional structure as additive models positivity constraints of the parameters or regression constraints results besides discussion of the proposed methods an empirical case study is conducted on both clinical as well as micro array gene_expression data in the context of cancer studies results are expressed based on the logrank statistic concordance_index and the hazard_ratio the reported performances indicate that the present method yields better models for high_dimensional while it gives results which are comparable to what classical techniques based on a proportional hazard model give for clinical data survival analysis concerns the study of the time to occurrence of a certain event it is best known in cancer studies where one is interested in characterizing which patients will relapse after surgery or pass away other applications can be found in electronic or mechanic components where the characterization of the lifetime is useful for optimizing maintenance_strategies typically survival data contain censored observations censoring indicates a lack of information on the outcome for example in a clinical study to whom correspondence should be addressed examining relapse of breast_cancer patients where patients are included between and and followed until not all patients will have experienced relapse for these patients the failure time is right censored the statistical literature_describes different models for the analysis of failure time data an overview of which can be found in the largest breakthrough in modelling survival data came in when cox proposed his proportional hazard model ph the ph model is a semi_parametric model assuming that the hazard of an observation the instantaneous risk of occurrence of the event given that the event did not occur before is proportional to a baseline hazard common to all observations proportionality is modelled as the exponential of a linear function of the covariates the semi_parametric character of this model comes from the fact that the baseline hazard is left unspecified success of this model is to a certain extend due to the description and analysis of a corresponding partial likelihood_function whose properties are proven to be quite similar to ordinary likelihood functions although the ph model is perhaps the most common survival model some drawbacks remain at first the model is based on the assumption that hazards for different subjects are proportional to each other an assumption which is not always realistic a second drawback is the restrictive parametric form in which the variables affect the outcome during the last decade different methods dealing with one or both of those drawbacks have been proposed the linear parametric form was generalized by means of anova models splines and artificial_neural models dealing with non linear covariate_effects and not imposing the proportional_hazards assumption were proposed in the field of artificial_neural due to the good performances obtained with machine_learning in regression and classification ideas underlying methods of machine_learning started to pervade also traditional modelling areas support_vector svm regression for censored_data was proposed bypage in subsection the performance of ssvm ph and plannard approaches are compared based on clinical datasets in subsection ssvm is compared with other methods able to deal with highdimensional data the design_parameters and s are tuned using a fold_cross criterion the different methods will be compared using three performance_measures clinicians are typically interested in groups of patients with higher or lower risk_profiles therefore a first performance measure denotes the concordance between the predicted and observed order of relapse the concordance_index c index in the same perspective patients are divided_into two risk groups according to the prognostic_index obtained with each model the median prognostic_index is used as threshold for defining the two groups the logrank test_statistic measuring the difference in survival between both groups will be reported as a third measure the hazard_ratio as calculated by a univariate ph model using the estimated prognostic indices normalized to the unit interval is reported for all three measures a higher value corresponds to a better performance in all experiments datasets were times randomly divided_into training of the data and test of the data_sets models were estimated based on the training data results are calculated based on the test data gives an overview of the different methods and their properties complementary to the reported figures relating performance and clinical usefulness of the presented methods a comparison regarding the effective cpu time required to train each method is reported in the supplementary_material those results confirm the claim of fast and effective implementations compared with state of the art approaches if a suitable contemporary optimization solver is used
