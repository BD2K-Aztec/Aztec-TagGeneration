structural_bioinformatics multiple structure single_parameter analysis of a single protein nano environment descriptor characterizing a shared loci on structurally aligned_proteins downloaded from motivation a graphical_representation of physicochemical and structural_descriptors attributed to amino_acid occupying the same topological position in different structurally aligned_proteins can provide a more intuitive way to associate possible functional_implications to identified variations in structural_characteristics this could be achieved by observing selected characteristics of amino_acids and of their corresponding nano environments described by the numerical value of matching descriptor for this purpose a web_based called multiple structure single_parameter mssp was developed and here presented results mssp produces a two_dimensional plot of a single protein descriptor for a number of structurally aligned protein_chains from a total of protein descriptors available in mssp selected of parameters stored in the sting database it is possible to create easily readable and highly informative xy plots where x axis contains the amino_acid position in the multiple structural_alignment and y axis contains the descriptors numerical_values for each aligned structure to illustrate one of possible mssp contributions to the investigation of changes in physico_chemical and structural_properties of mutants comparing them with the cognate wild_type structure the oncogenic mutation of m t in ret kinase is presented the comparative_analysis of wild_type structures shows great changes in their electrostatic_potential these variations are easily depicted at the mssp generated xy plot availability_and the web_server is freely_available www cbi cnptia embrapa br sms stingm mpa index html web_server implemented in perl java and javascript and jmol or protein viewer as structure visualizers contact while sequence_alignments are useful to detect mutations and conserved amino_acids structural_alignments are useful to investigate conformational changes due to different reasons such as mutations inhibition and allosteric changes however some functional differences between two or more similar protein_structures may not be identified and or explained by using only this kind of information requiring instead some complementary_methods in many studies the overall effects on protein_function caused by mutations are not sufficiently understood requiring some complementary analysis of specific environments of amino_acids residues by means of observing changes in their physicochemical and structural_properties based on that we propose a web_based which can easily pinpoint changes in selected protein descriptors multiple structure single_parameter mssp is a graphical tool for visualizing the numerical value of a single selected protein descriptor for a set of structurally aligned protein_chains allowing the direct comparison of changes in that specific descriptor caused by amino_acid relative to the wild_type protein however mssp is not limited to compare only mutantsit can compare any set of structurally_similar protein_chains
