sequence_analysis accurate identification of polyadenylation_sites from end deep_sequencing using a na vena ve bayes classifier motivation end_processing is important for transcription_termination mrna_stability and regulation of gene_expression to identify ends most techniques use an oligo dt primer to construct deep_sequencing libraries however this approach can lead to identification of artifactual polyadenylation_sites due to internal priming in homopo lymeric stretches of adenines although heuristic filters have been applied in these cases they typically result in a high proportion of both false positive_and classifications therefore there is a need to develop improved algorithms to better identify mis priming events in oligo dt primed sequences results by analyzing sequence_features flanking ends derived from oligo dt based sequencing we developed a navenave bayes classifier to classify them as true or false internally primed the resulting algorithm is highly_accurate outperforms previous heuristic filters and facilitates identification of novel polyadenylation_sites end_processing of pre mrnas influences transcription_termination mrna_stability and localization and dynamic_regulation of translation in plants yeast and metazoans sequence_elements in the untranslated_region utr direct cleavage and polyadenylation reviewed in among these elements is the polyadenylation_signal pas a defined hexameric sequence located nucleotides nt upstream of the cleavage and polyadenylation site pa site which binds cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor complex the pas predominantly comprises the sequence aauaaa although single_nucleotide are also functional in addition to the pas a guanine uracil or uracil rich downstream sequence_element can be found nt downstream of the pa site that is recognized by cleavage stimulatory_factor in some instances a uracil rich sequence_element is present upstream of the pas which may also act to enhance usage of a specific pas by recruiting cleavage factor i in combination these sequence_elements help define the site of cleavage and polyadenylation at the end of a pre_mrna most efforts to identify ends of mrnas have relied on priming with an oligonucleotide of deoxythymines oligo dt these efforts include early studies relying on expressed_sequence ests as well as more recent work using deep_sequencing reviewed in these include poly a site sequencing pas seq and polya seq which rely on oligo dt containing primers for first strand cdna synthesis while these approaches are technically straightforward oligo dt binding can occur in internal homopolymeric stretches of adenines leading to identification of false_positive pa sites a more selective method is poly a position profiling by sequencing referred to as pseq where a splint rna dna oligonucleotide with overhanging thymines is hybridized and ligated to the polyadenylated tail of mrnas to prevent internal priming however pseq is technically_demanding and most laboratories are more likely to use oligo dtprimed approaches in these latter cases internal priming events are generally filtered from datasets based on the number of adenines in the genomic_sequence downstream of the cleavage_site however the strict definition of these heuristic filters inevitably misses some internal priming events false_positives and also excludes true ends false_negatives thus additional methods are needed to easily analyze oligo dt primed deep sequencing_data to identify true pa sites a navenave bayes classifier based on bayes theorem is a supervised_learning algorithm in which the features used to predict the class are considered conditionally independent navenave bayes classifiers are computationally_efficient require relatively small training_datasets handle both continuous and discrete features and ignore non relevant_features here we demonstrate the effectiveness of a navenave bayes classifier to identify internal priming events in oligo dt primed sequencing_data we find that our trained algorithm outperforms heuristic filters and enriches for ends in oligo dt sequencing_data that bear canonical motifs important for cleavage and polyadenylation biological_validation shows that our method is highly_accurate facilitating identification of novel utrs and ends in multiple animal_species
