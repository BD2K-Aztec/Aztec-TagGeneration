keggtranslator visualizing and converting the kegg_pathway to various formats the kegg_pathway provides a widely used service for metabolic and nonmetabolic pathways it contains manually drawn pathway maps with information about the genes reactions and relations contained therein to store these pathways kegg uses kgml a proprietary xml format parsers and translators are needed to process the pathway maps for usage in other applications and algorithms we have developed keggtranslator an easy to use stand alone application that can visualize and convert kgml formatted xml files into multiple output_formats unlike other translators keggtranslator supports a plethora of output_formats is able to augment the information in translated documents e g miriam annotations beyond the scope of the kgml document and amends missing components to fragmentary reactions within the pathway to allow simulations on those availability keggtranslator is freely_available as a java web start application and for download atmany academic researchers who want to use pathway based information utilize the kegg_pathway the database established in contains manually created maps for various pathways these maps are visualized on the web and can be downloaded free of charge for academics as xml files in the kegg markup_language kgml the elements in a pathway xml file such as reactions or genes are usually identified by a kegg identifier only thus kegg_pathway is strongly related to other kegg databases that resolve and further describe the identifiers however the content of these kgml formatted xml files itself is limited gene names are often encoded as barely readable abbreviations and elements are only annotated by a single kegg identifier by improving the annotation and translating the kgml files to other file_formats researchers could use the kegg_database for many applications individual pathway pictures could be created pathway simulation to whom correspondence should be addressed and modeling applications could be executed graph operations on the pathways or stoichiometric analyses could be performed see e g chapter or the kegg_pathway could be used for gene_set enrichment_analyses for these purposes only a few converters are available keggconverter or kegg sbml offer command_line or web_based conversion of kgml files to sbml files kegggraph is able to convert kgml files to r based graph structures none of these tools has a graphical_user is capable to validate and autocomplete kegg reactions adds standard identifiers such as miriam urns to pathway elements or is able to write kgml files in multiple ouput formats along with this work the command_line toolbox subliminal n submitted for publication overcomes some of these limitations we here present keggtranslator which reads and completes the content of an xml file by retrieving online annotation of all genes and reactions using the kegg api kgml files can be converted to many output_formats minor deficiencies are corrected e g the name of a gene new information is added e g multiple miriam identifiers for each gene and reaction or sbo terms describing the function and some crucial deficiencies like missing reactants are addressed keggtranslator is a stand alone application with a graphical_user that runs on every operating system for which a java virtual_machine is available there are other tools for converting kgml to sbml and for converting kgml to graph structures in r but to our knowledge no other kegg converter is able to translate kgml formatted files to such a variety of output_formats with important functionalities like the autocompletion of reactions or the annotation of each element in the translated file using various identifiers furthermore keggtranslator is simple easy to use and comes with a powerful command_line and graphical_user the variety of output_formats combined with the translation options and comprehensive standard conform annotation of the pathway elements allow a quick and easy usage b the need for autocompleting reactions the upper half shows the kgmlfile with only one substrate and product on the lower half the complete reaction equation is shown as one can see one substrate and product is missing in the xml document of files from the kegg_pathway in a wide_range of other applications
