systems_biology identification of genetic network_dynamics with unate structure motivation modern experimental_techniques for time course measurement of gene_expression enable the identification of dynamical_models of genetic_regulatory in general identification involves fitting appropriate network_structures and parameters to the data for a given set of genes exploring all possible network_structures is clearly prohibitive modelling and identification methods for the a priori selection of network_structures compatible with biological_knowledge and experimental_data are necessary to make the identification problem tractable results we propose a differential_equation modelling framework where the regulatory_interactions among genes are expressed in terms of unate functions a class of gene activation rules commonly_encountered in boolean_network modelling we establish analytical properties of the models in the class and exploit them to devise a two step procedure for gene network_reconstruction from product concentration and synthesis rate time series the first step isolates a family of model structures compatible with the data from a set of most relevant biological_hypotheses the second step explores this family and returns a pool of best fitting models along with estimates of their parameters the method is tested on a simulated network and compared with state of the art network_inference on the benchmark synthetic network irma identification of genetic_regulatory aims at inferring the regulatory_mechanisms of gene_expression from experimental_data various modelling approaches have been employed with success for the reconstruction of the network of interactions among genes see e g for recent_reviews in particular boolean activation rules have been proposed as a natural framework for the description and reconstruction of gene activation rules whereas bayesian_networks have been utilized to capture statistical relationships in the expression of a network of genes to whom correspondence should be addressed the development of experimental_techniques for the quantitative monitoring of gene_expression over time is paving the way for the learning of gene_expression dynamics kinetic modelling where the interactions among genes are encoded into the structure of a set of gene_expression rates see de jong and references therein provides an accurate description of the time evolution of gene_expression unfortunately an overwhelming variety of gene activation functions must be explored in order to reconstruct the network_structure and dynamics from the data a way around this complexity is to quantify genetic_interactions by universal approximators in the activation level of each gene is quantified by a saturated linear combination of the concentrations of the network proteins this enables the reconstruction of direction and sign inhibition versus activation of the interactions among genes unlike in boolean_networks the interplay among controlling genes in the regulation of the controlled gene the logics of the network is not modelled explicitly similar insight into regulatory_interactions near equilibria is provided by the linearization methods glass andsuggested to model switch like regulatory_interactions by step functions this results into a very simple piecewise linear_model of gene_product concentration kinetics constant synthesis rate plus degradation that can be fitted to experimental_data quite efficiently for many activation functions however the approximation by step functions is rather coarse and may prevent the use of this framework for identification in this work we address the identification of kinetic_models of gene_regulatory from time course gene_expression data our primary interest is the reconstruction of the network of interactions and logics behind gene_expression control we propose a modelling framework where the synthesis rate_equations reflect the structure of a class of gene activation rules known as unate functions in the context of boolean modelling unate functions capture all interactions where each gene acts exclusively as an inducer or as an inhibitor for the expression of another gene based on biochemical analysis argue that unate functions provide a comprehensive modelling framework for genetic_regulatory unate functions include hierarchically or nested canalizing functions a class of boolean functions describing the majority of the known gene activation rules
