structural_bioinformatics dbsi server dna binding_site identifier proteinnucleic acid interactions are among the most important intermolecular_interactions in the regulation of cellular_events identifying residues involved in these interactions from protein_structure alone is an important challenge here we introduce the webserver interface to dna binding_site identifier dbsi a powerful structure based svm model for the prediction and visualization of dna_binding on protein_structures dbsi has been shown to be a top performing model to predict dna_binding on the surface of a protein or peptide and shows_promise in predicting rna binding_sites availability_and server is available at http dbsi mitchellproteinnucleic acid interactions are crucial to cellular_events in the regulation of transcription dna_replication and repair and rna_splicing and post_transcriptional identifying residues involved in nucleic_acid binding is crucial to understand function cocrystal structures are often unavailable and dna rna binding_sites may not be easily discernable from the protein_sequence or unbound structure here we present the web_interface to dbsi http dbsi mitchelllab org a machine_learning approach to classify surface_residues as binders or non binders of dna dbsi employs sequence and structure based features encompassing a range of physical chemical geometric and evolutionary properties of the protein surface dbsi also implements microenvironment features that allow for small_scale structural perturbation and the role of non local cooperative_effects the webserver greatly_simplifies the use of dbsi eliminating the need for downloading installing and configuring third_party software and requiring the upload of only one file the dbsi server facilitates online visualization of results and it ensures privacy of user jobs with the dbsi classification and score for each surface residue is provided as well sample pbeq archives and a user_manual with directions for generating the tgz files using the server and interpreting_results are provided on the dbsi server website the dbsi server typically takes around minutes for a residue sized protein and is faster on machines with a solid_state drive supplementary
