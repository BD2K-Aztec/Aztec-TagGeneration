databases_and geni db a database of global events for epidemic intelligence we present a novel public_health database geni db in which news events on the topic of over infectious_diseases and chemicals affecting human and animal_health are compiled from surveillance of the global online news_media in languages news event frequency data were gathered systematically through the biocaster public_health system from july to the present and is available to download by the research_community for purposes of analyzing trends in the global burden of infectious_diseases database_search can be conducted by year country disease and language systems which gather information about disease outbreak events from informal digital sources such as news_media are now seen as having high value to national and transnational public_health although agencies in wealthy countries have a sophisticated array of indicator sources such as over the counter sales or sentinel networks not all countries possess the resources to implement or maintain such systems with concerns about newly emerging_diseases such as a h n there has been increasing attention on epidemic intelligence ei systems that can complement indicator networks by detecting events on a global scale so that they can be acted on close to source while there are several surveillance_systems offering alerts and news browsing to the best of our knowledge there are only a few databases where researchers government health_officials physicians and public_health can look for historical event data which are updated in real_time promed a human network organized through the international_society for disease surveillance is an excellent source with its wide coverage open_access database of human disease reports from onwards reports are gathered manually and reviewed by experts in a staged process before being sent out via email and stored in an online database promed reports on both human and animal_health events although its coverage of animal_health is more limited in scope the world_health to whom correspondence should be addressed who offers a more specialized service through its weekly euroflu bulletins which are archived online as well as a news bulletin service through its global alert and response site additionally the world animal health_information database wahid provides access to reports of exceptional events submitted by member_states of the oie world organisation of animal_health geni db is a complementary service that provides additional support to those interested in understanding the context of ongoing disease_outbreaks as well as analyzing the global burden of infectious_diseases we developed the geni db database as a free structured and searchable source on news event statistics reported in the global media information gathering has been done fully automatically without human intervention by the biocaster ei system from thousands of sources in languages our experiments have shown that aggregated event counts from news can provide valuable early_warning alerts that in some cases are more timely than promed an additional advantage is that since biocaster is a single system with a common reporting standard this allows users to obtain comparative estimates of disease_outbreaks across disease conditions and geographic_areas geni db is a useful source for exploring media reporting patterns as well as following disease_outbreaks illustrates how aggregated multilingual reporting can be used to visualise media_coverage and timeliness in different languages for the porcine footand mouth epidemic in south_korea during ranking diseases by the number of reports and countries by the number of outbreak events detected per unit of population tables s and s in supplementary_material gives an indication of both the incidence of disease but also the characteristics of online media reports ranking countries according to the language of the report also yields some interesting trends in media focus supporting our view that multilingual reports are necessary to maximize sensitivity for example haiti features in the top three reported countries between july and july for most languages except for chinese where it appeared ranked at seven behind japan taiwan usa and france in french both angola and canada were more widely_reported than usa a recent quantitative study byprovides further insights into the volume geographic coverage timeliness and sources of biocasters information and a comparison against two other systems healthmap and epispider within the geni db database we have non zero event counts for states several states have unexpectedly_low counts either because there were very few open_source reports during the two year period e g for sub_saharan or central asia or because of technical_limitations in the system such as missing languages e g polish out of vocabulary names for provinces e g egypt failure to normalise diacritics to roman and non registration of small island states these issues are now being addressed by adding automated_detection for alternative arabic romanizations extending our place names ontology to include all world states and provinces as well as a greater number of minor cities populations under additionally we are constantly looking at how we can improve place name disambiguation from evidence in the text which is one of the greatest technological challenges we face several caveats need to be kept in mind when interpreting the data perhaps the most important is that the data have been sourced and
