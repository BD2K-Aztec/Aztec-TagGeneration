reveal visual eqtl analytics motivation the analysis of expression quantitative_trait eqtl data is a challenging scientific endeavor involving the processing of very large heterogeneous and complex data typical eqtl analyses involve three types of data sequence_based data reflecting the genotypic variations gene_expression data and meta data_describing the phenotype based on these certain genotypes can be connected with specific phenotypic outcomes to infer causal associations of genetic_variation expression and disease to this end statistical_methods are used to find significant associations between single_nucleotide snps or pairs of snps and gene_expression a major_challenge lies in summarizing the large amount of data as well as statistical results and to generate informative interactive_visualizations results we present reveal our visual_analytics approach to this challenge we introduce a graph_based visualization of associations between snps and gene_expression and a detailed genotype view relating summarized patient cohort genotypes with data from individual patients and statistical_analyses availability reveal is included in mayday our framework for visual_exploration and analysis it is available at http it inf uni tuebingen de software reveal the risk to come down with a complex disease such as cancer or diabetes can be influenced by genetic_variations genome_wide gwass help with the identification of such risk increasing local dna sequence_variants the ultimate_goal is to generate a complete view of the variability of a genome of individuals modern microarray and sequencing_technologies already allow for the compilation of hundreds of thousands of socalled single_nucleotide snps in typical gwas_studies linkage analyses are performed where each snp is tested for association with a specific phenotype of a disease thus one or more snp genotypes are sought whose frequency can be correlated with a disease however for many thus identified snps little is known about the molecular_mechanisms their phenotypic manifestation expression_quantitative eqtl studies go one step further involving three types of data sequence_based data reflecting the genotypic variations gene_expression data and meta data_describing the phenotype e g the severity of disease or speed of progression this analysis is therefore highly_challenging since it involves the scalable processing of very large heterogeneous and complex data for example the hapmap project to whom correspondence should be addressed has generated genotype data for million human snps such genotype data contain for each individual and each assessed snp a pair of nucleotides reflecting the two alleles maternal and paternal of the individual furthermore the expression values of tens_of of genes from thousands of individuals are gathered statistical_tests are used to compute for each pair of snp and transcript whether a significant association exists between the presence of polymorphisms and a difference in gene_expression these statistical_analyses often generate a large number of snps being either directly_or associated with the expression of specific genes the goal of eqtl data analysis is to generate a comprehensive picture that connects certain genotypes individual genetic_information with specific phenotypic outcomes based on this aggregated view of the data analysts e g biologists and bioinformaticians are enabled to infer causal associations of genetic_variation expression and disease i e to identify the genetic_basis for phenotypic variations more generally the ultimate_goal is to find a network of interacting genes whose expression changes are correlated with genetic_variation allowing for a prognosis of disease based on observed patient phenotypes a typical workflow for eqtl data analysis consists of applying either machine_learning or statistical_tests to extract significant associations the results however are often extremely difficult_to biologists or clinicians are mainly interested in the identification of correlated genes together with their associated snps and the phenotype connection visualizations in this field are highly_valuable and require views that can handle interaction filtering and zooming with these complex data the most important aspect of visual_analytics in this context lies in data aggregation filtering and the creation of meaningful summaries to allow researchers to extract the few important associations with clinical_significance from the enormous amount of input_data here we present reveal a visual_analytics approach to this challenge a proof_of implementation of reveal was submitted to the biovis contest part of the ieee visweek biovis symposium every year this newly inaugurated contest focuses on a specific biological application domain and solicits submissions combining data analysis and visualization last years domain was eqtl_analysis and reveal was chosen as the visualization experts favorite solution we have now significantly expanded our initial_implementation we included a new visualization to analyze distributions of genetic_variations in more detail furthermore we integrated reveal into our visual_analytics software mayday allowing for combined and highly interactive analyses of genotypic and expression data as well as meta_data e g disease phenotype we apply reveal to theour visual_analytics approach reveal introduces two different visualizations that allow biologists and bioinformaticians to visually analyze eqtl data the association graph visualizes significant associations between pairs of snps and gene_expression using the edge color to denote a snp_pairs target_gene has the benefit of allowing us to visualize trans effects i e snps associated with the expression of genes far away from their own genomic_locations at the same time cis effects are also easily visible as edges which are painted in the same color as one of their respective end nodes the example data we used here resulted in a relatively small association graph with nodes and a few dozen edges larger datasets will result in larger graphs our implementation can easily display larger numbers of nodes as well as larger numbers of significant snp pair associations however there is a limit to the complexity of a graph that can be meaningfully interpreted by a human user using the filtering based on edge_weights such overly complex graphs can be reduced to focus on the really important associations which are most promising as targets for further research although reveal can handle hundreds_or of nodes it becomes difficult to distinguish the different colors associated with each node since only about different colors are distinguishable when showing categorial data furthermore nodelink graphs quickly turn into hairballs for large_numbers of nodes therefore we introduce interactive highlighting of nodes and edges with identical color in order to maintain usability for large graphs in addition to the association_network we plan to add a matrixbased view which does not suffer from the drawbacks of node link visualizations in this context one can study for example the question whether the gene whose expression is significantly_changed by the respective snp is differentially_expressed between the different phenotypes to answer_this the user can select the respective node within the graph and a linked heatmap will show the expression of the gene the complementary graph of the association_network is a snp graph where snps are represented by nodes and an edge is drawn between any two snps if they form a significant snp pair we plan to combine these two graphs such that for example the user can select edges in the association_network and interactively construct a new complementary snp graph it would be interesting to study whether there are hubs or cliques in this complementary graph that could indicate whether a specific snp or snp pair is relevant for the phenotype the connection of the association graph with the genotype view enhances the analytical process since interesting edges can be selected in the association graph and a new genotype view can be generated visualizing the snps associated with these edges while the information on the cohort genotype distribution is useful for very detailed_analyses our simplified cohort genotype summary view allows for a quick overview of a large number of snps we present reveal an interactive visual tool for the analysis of eqtl data from gwass reveal allows for an efficient analysis of disease related polymorphisms through a series of different linked visualizations and enables one to study the influences of these polymorphisms on the genotypic as well as on the gene expression_level the two presented views build the basis of the analysis the association graph summarizes the given plink data by generating a network of associations that can be filtered interactively to concentrate on the most important aspects in the genotype view snps of interest can be visualized in more detail e g to evaluate data from a single patient in the context of the complete cohort of the samples being integrated into our visual_analytics software mayday reveal can be used for combined analyses of genotypic data expression data and additional meta_data e g disease phenotype this makes it a powerful visual analytical tool that combines visualization and interpretation of genome_wide association data with gene_expression analysis
