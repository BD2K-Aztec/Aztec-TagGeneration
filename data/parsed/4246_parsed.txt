data_and sima simultaneous multiple_alignment of lc_ms peak lists motivation alignment of multiple liquid_chromatography lc_ms experiments is a necessity today which arises from the need for biological and technical repeats due to limits in sampling_frequency and poor reproducibility of retention_times current lc systems suffer from missing observations and non linear distortions of the retention_times across runs existing_approaches for peak correspondence estimation focus almost exclusively on solving the pairwise_alignment problem yielding straightforward but suboptimal results for multiple_alignment problems results we propose sima a novel automated procedure for alignment of peak lists from multiple lc_ms sima combines hierarchical pairwise correspondence estimation with simultaneous alignment and global retention time correction it employs a tailored multidimensional kernel_function and a procedure based on maximum_likelihood to find the retention time distortion function that best fits the observed data sima does not require a dedicated reference spectrum is robust with regard to outliers needs only two intuitive parameters and naturally incorporates incomplete correspondence information in a comparison with seven alternative_methods on four different datasets we show that sima yields competitive and superior_performance on real_world data availability a c implementation of the sima algorithm is available fromrecent developments in liquid_chromatography lc_ms have afforded insight into the dynamics of biological_systems at unprecedented levels of detail high_resolution msbased protein identification and quantitative ms are now established methodologies in fields as diverse as proteomics glycomics lipidomics and metabolomics to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded as jointrobust alignment of lc_ms experiments current lc_ms experiments often investigate complex_biological over a set of different environmental_conditions and or time courses the associated data are routinely split into multiple fractions and acquired in technical and biological_replicates yielding tens to hundreds of lc_ms each of these runs delivers a snapshot of the system of interest and to enable their joint analysis the common components in different measurements need to be related to each other in practical lc_ms applications two major factors complicate the determination of component correspondences across multiple runs i the limited reproducibility attained on lc systems which gives rise to non linear distortions of the retention time domain and ii the limited sampling_frequency inherent to data_driven ms_ms acquisition as a notorious cause for missing observations to obtain quantitative estimates or to increase peptide_identification rates over a series of experiments lc_ms data analysis frameworks rely on accurate_mass and retention time alignment to propagate correspondence information between runs experiments and samples accounting for lc distortions is a necessary prerequisite for such cross experiment inference although numerous pairwise alignment_methods have been proposed the question of simultaneous alignment of multiple datasets is still a particularly challenging_task as the number of potential correspondences grows exponentially false initial multiple correspondence estimates are more likely and estimation procedures for the associated warping functions need to be robust to potential outliers even more in the light of practical_application multiple alignment_methods should naturally cope with incomplete correspondences where peaks are only observed in a subset of runs and no obvious missing_value strategy is available types of lc_ms alignment_algorithms published alignment_algorithms work on different representationseither peaks extracted from raw measurements or the raw measurements themselves this contribution focuses on the alignment of sparse sets of samples i e peaks which lie in a d feature_space ion mass to charge ratio ion elution time and ion charge as proposed in cox and mann existing_approaches can be divided_into three categories alignment based on a static reference where all observed measurements are aligned to a single reference peak list because these approaches single out one measured reference run they perform well if therepage we introduced sima a novel approach for the simultaneous alignment of multiple lc_ms peak lists sima is specifically tailored to the problems arising from large_scale experiments where
