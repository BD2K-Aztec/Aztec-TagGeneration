high_accuracy prediction of bacterial type_iii secreted effectors based on position specific amino_acid profiles motivation bacterial type_iii secreted t s effectors are delivered into host_cells specifically via type_iii secretion_systems t sss which play_important in the interaction between bacteria and their hosts previous computational_methods for t s protein prediction have only achieved limited accuracy and distinct_features for effective t s protein prediction remain to be identified results in this work a distinctive n_terminal position specific amino_acid aac feature was identified for t s proteins a large portion of t s proteins exhibit distinct position specific aac features that can tolerate position shift a classifier bpbaac was developed and trained using support_vector svm based on the aac feature extracted using a bi profile bayes model we demonstrated that the bpbaac model outperformed other implementations in classification of t s and non t s proteins giving an average sensitivity of and an average selectivity of in a fold_cross evaluation the model was also robust when a small_size training_dataset was used the fact that the position specific aac feature is commonly found in t s proteins across different bacterial_species gives this model wide_application to demonstrate the models application a genome_wide prediction of t s effector_proteins was performed for ralstonia_solanacearum an important plant pathogenic_bacterium and a number of putative candidates were identified using this model availability an r package of bpbaac tool is freely downloadable from http biocomputer bio cuhk edu hk softwares bpbaac six types of secretion_systems have been identified in gram_negative two of which type_i have been studied extensively the type_iii t ss has been widely_adopted by different bacteria such as animal pathogens salmonella shigella and vibrio plant_pathogens pseudomonas xanthomonas and ralstonia and some symbiotic bacteria such as rhizobia t sss play important to whom correspondence should be addressed roles in hostpathogen interactions that are often mediated by t s effectors specifically secreted into host_cells through the type_iii conduits previous_studies that the first amino_acid at the n_terminal region may contain the signal_peptides and chaperonebinding sequences needed to guide the secretion of t s proteins most known t s proteins have at least one chaperone which mediates its secretion through the extremely narrow t s conduit unlike most other signal_peptides t s signals are not cleaved after secretion due to low_sequence and lack of common features among different t s signal_sequences the established prediction_methods used for identifying signal_peptides do not apply to t s signals computational_prediction of t s protein has long been considered to be a particularly difficult challenge computational_approaches have been attempted to predict t s proteins based on sequence_similarity consensus patterns geneadjacent sequence_features etc different machine_learning e g naive_bayes nb artificial_neural ann and support_vector svm have also been adopted to identify the general signal_features some important features including g c content of the primary dna_sequence general enrichment and depletion of n_terminal amino_acid aac composition frequency of secondary_structure coil helices or strands and water accessibility states exposed or buried have been identified and used for in silico prediction effective t one of the earliest software developed for t s protein prediction explores possible sequence_based features exhaustively in effective t the aac and property preference within the signal region not position specific was represented in two reduced alphabets which may lead to loss of signal information buried in individual amino_acid in addition no positionspecific features were analyzed in effective t an ann model proposed byadopts a sliding_window technique with a window width of and an optimal model is obtained based on the signal_sequence located within the first amino_acids at the n_terminal end although this model achieved high_selectivity its sensitivity was rather low some drawbacks of the ann model shouldpage
