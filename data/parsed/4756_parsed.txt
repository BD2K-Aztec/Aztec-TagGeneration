turboknot rapid prediction of conserved rna_secondary including pseudoknots motivation many rna_molecules function without being translated into proteins and function depends on structure pseudoknots are motifs in rna_secondary that are difficult to predict but are also often functionally_important results turboknot is a new algorithm for predicting the secondary_structure including pseudoknotted pairs conserved across multiple_sequences turboknot finds of all known base_pairs in the systems tested and of predicted pairs were found in the known structures pseudoknots are found with half or better of the false_positive of previous methods availability the program is available for download under an open_source as part of the rnastructure package at in many cases rna functions in cells without being translated into proteins these non_coding ncrnas carry out a wide_range of functions including catalysis intracellular protein_trafficking immunity and gene_regulation the functions of these ncrnas depend on their structures rna_structure is hierarchical beginning with the sequence of nucleotides the primary structure then the set of all canonical i e gc au and gu base_pairs the secondary_structure and ultimately the full d positioning of all the atoms in the molecule the tertiary_structure the secondary_structure tends to form on a faster time scale and with stronger interactions than those interactions that fold the tertiary_structure so the secondary_structure can usually be predicted independently of knowing the overall tertiary_structure the most accurate method of secondary structure_determination is comparative_sequence it relies on the hypothesis that sequences that serve the same function share the same structure but comparative_sequence is impractical in many situations to whom correspondence should be addressed because it requires significant human insight and a large number of diverse sequences commonly the secondary_structure for a single_sequence is predicted using free_energy these methods use a set of thermodynamic_parameters that predict the folding_free change of a given structure and a dynamic_programming to find the structure with lowest free_energy change the thermodynamic_parameters can be used with a different type of dynamic_programming to predict a partition_function which can be used to predict the base_pairing probability for all possible canonical pairs base_pair probabilities can be used to assemble structures called maximum expected_accuracy mea structures briefly mea prediction seeks to maximize the sum of probabilities of each base_pair for all paired bases and the probabilities of being single_stranded for all unpaired bases empirically mea structure_prediction works because that base_pairs predicted to be the most probable are the most likely to be in the known structure although comparative_sequence is not yet automated a number of methods have been developed to improve structure_prediction by using the information available in homologous_sequences these methods use a supplied input sequence_alignment predict the structure for each sequence and then find the common structure or align and fold the sequences simultaneously these programs have been reviewed previously the recently_published turbofold algorithm is one such method that improves secondary_structure by predicting a conserved_structure using two or more homologous_sequences it refines base_pairing probabilities of an arbitrary number of sequences using their probabilistic alignments in an iterative manner structures are then assembled using a mea algorithm from the final_set of base_pairing probabilities because of computational_complexity most programs that predict secondary_structure do not predict pseudoknots formally a pseudoknot occurs if an rna has two base_pairs one between bases i and j and a second between i and j such that i i j j pseudoknots make up only a small fraction of base_pairs but they are often found in ncrnas predicting the minimum_free secondary_structure that includes pseudoknots of any topology has been proven to be np_hard in spite of this a number of single_sequence methods have been developed to these methods limit the set of possible pseudoknot topologies to accelerate the search a number of available methods has been previously reviewed recently a new algorithm was published probknot that uses a single_sequence partition_function to predict pairing probabilities and assigns base_pairs if the two bases are mutually maximally probable to pair with one another this algorithm can find pseudoknots of any topology while the partition_function does not include terms for pseudoknotted structures the probknot algorithm was able to find pseudoknotted base_pairs with reasonable accuracy compared with other methods and at minimal computational_cost the algorithm is o n in addition to the o n partition_function calculation approaches to the pseudoknot prediction_problem that employ information from sequence and structural_homology are few in number like single_sequence methods a monte_carlo alignment and folding method has also been published also analogous to single_sequence methods another approach identifies common pseudoknot free structures and then iteratively matches regions that can form pseudoknots a third approach computes a score matrix based on alignment and thermodynamic information and uses a maximum_weight matching mwm algorithm to assemble an optimal secondary_structure the latter two approaches are dependent on a high_quality sequence_alignment as input either one assembled manually or one computed from sequences with a large degree of sequence_identity or more such alignments are not always available particularly for newly_discovered classes of rnas this contribution reports a new algorithm turboknot for predicting rna_secondary conserved in multiple_sequences including pseudoknots turboknot assembles structures in the same way as probknot but with the pairing probabilities predicted by a turbofold calculation using multiple_sequences to inform the pairing probabilities the additional computational_cost compared with turbofold is small compared with the turbofold calculation itself just o mn where mis the number of sequences used and n is the length of the longest sequence it is benchmarked against two algorithms capable of predicting pseudoknots that also use multiple_sequences as input ilm and hxmatch it is also benchmarked against the single_sequence probknot algorithm finally two algorithms that cannot predict pseudoknots are included in the benchmark turbofold and mea maxexpect over the range of rna_families tested which have a variety of functions and structures turboknot averaged a sensitivity of and a ppv of for comparison turboknot was benchmarked against two other multisequence methods that can predict pseudoknots ilm version and hxmatch version each was run with default_parameters sequences were aligned for input into these algorithms using muscle version which performs well for rna sequence_alignment compared with other available tools in addition to these two methods benchmarks were run using probknot a single_sequence method that can predict pseudoknots turbofold the underlying multisequence method that cannot predict pseudoknots and maxexpect a single_sequence method that cannot predict pseudoknots other single_sequence methods capable of predicting pseudoknots were recently benchmarked and probknot compares_favorably against these it is used here as a representative of this class of algorithms one algorithm dotknot has been published more recently its performance on this test_set is included in supplementary tables s s for comparison similarly multisequence algorithms that cannot predict pseudoknots were recently benchmarked and turbofold compares favorable and is used as a representative of them here the average sensitivity and ppv of turboknot were better than any other method capable of predicting pseudoknots additionally turboknot had a higher sensitivity than turbofold albeit at a tradeoff in ppv since turboknot considers a larger structure space than turbofold it is natural to find more correct base_pairs with a cost to the ppv for pseudoknots in particular turboknot found correct pseudoknotted base_pairs out of a total of in the known structures and it made false_positive of pseudoknotted pairs this is more true_positives and fewer false_positives than any other tested method when consideringmaxexpectunderlined results represent the best performance out of all the algorithms that predict pseudoknots bold results represent absolute best performance a sequences were selected at random with replacement so some sequences were chosen more than once b pseudoknots were counted using the method ofstructures with pseudoknots rather than individual pairs turboknot found at least one true_positive pseudoknot in structures out of predictions and out of tested structures that contain at least one pseudoknot supplementary this is again more true_positives and fewer false_positives than any other tested method the use of an mwm algorithm to assemble structures given the turbofold pair probabilities was also considered as a control supplementary tables s and s this approach resulted in the identification of the exact same set of correct base_pairs as those based on mutual maximum probability pairs plus a small number of extra incorrect pairs the additional incorrect pairs were so few that they only affected the second decimal places of the ppv percentages the exception was the tmrna family in which a small number of additional correct base_pairs were identified the minor difference between these two approaches was due to how well the turbofold algorithm refines the pairing probabilities by excluding structures that are not conserved as another control an mwm algorithm was used to predict structures from pair probabilities calculated using a single_sequence partition_function this added a number of spurious base_pairs supplementary this emphasized the importance of the probknot approach when single sequences are used time benchmarks were performed on all tested algorithms groups of five random_sequences were used with average lengths varying from nt to nt the hxmatch algorithm performed the fastest turboknot was significantly_slower but it could still carry out the computations in a reasonable amount of time for a user with a typical desktop computer shows a sample structure_prediction for mycobacterium_tuberculosis rnase p using turboknot probknot or turbofold the turboknot and turbofold structures are similar but the turboknot algorithm is able to identify most of the pseudoknotted base_pairs probknot has a lower sensitivity and ppv overall for non pseudoknotted base_pairs in this structure it identifies the four correct pseudoknotted base_pairs that turboknot missed but it also finds eight pseudoknotted base_pairs that are not in the accepted structure turboknot overextends some helices as compared withturbofold when there are valid bases available to pair the accuracy of the extra base_pairs added when turboknot extends helicesin the same way as thein the process it predicted more than twice as many false_positive pairs as there were true pseudoknotted pairs in the accepted structures single_sequence methods with or without pseudoknot prediction capabilities were reported as having poor_performance on the prediction of tmrna structure the results with the sequences used here are consistent with that result turboknot and turbofold however show significant_improvement for this difficult class of rnas turboknot shows its best pseudoknot prediction capabilities on this class of rnas with of all predicted pseudoknotted base_pairs being true_positives in contrast group i introns show slightly worse sensitivity in turbofold and turboknot compared with maxexpect and probknot although they did still have higher ppvs this is likely because the long insertions present in some group i introns makes accurate sequence_alignment difficult indeed ilm and hxmatch which are dependent on a sequence_alignment algorithm for input did not perform well with randomly_chosen groups of sequences from this class of rnas these algorithms may have more success however when sequences with higher sequence_similarity are used or when using a manually_curated alignment which would allow for more accurate sequence_alignment such groups of sequences are not always available ilm was benchmarked in a previous study using just one sequence rather than an alignment and unexpectedly it appears less accurate when using multiple_sequences as input compared with previously_reported benchmarks this is likely because it was hindered by errors made by the sequence_alignment algorithm which aligns sequences but not secondary_structure it fared much better when given manually_curated alignments based on structural_homology because hxmatch which was given the same input sequence_alignments had similar results on similar classes of rnas it is likely tools that consider both secondary_structure and alignment at the same time are necessary to accurately align functionally_similar rnas which are not chosen to have a relatively high_sequence while turboknot has significantly_improved pseudoknot prediction_accuracy more work is needed to raise the accuracy to the current standard for non pseudoknotted base_pairs dirks and pierce report an algorithm that computes a partition_function that includes pseudoknots of some limited topologies in o n time this partition_function could be used by turbofold and turboknot to consider a larger structure space ideally increasing the probability of true pseudoknots at the expense of false ones that are predicted currently at an acceptable increase in computational expense
