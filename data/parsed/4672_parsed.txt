timma r an r package for predicting synergistic multi targeted drug_combinations in cancer_cell or patient derived samples network pharmacology based prediction of multi targeted drug_combinations is becoming a promising_strategy anticancer_efficacy and safety we developed a logic_based network algorithm called target inhibition interaction using maximization and minimization averaging timma which predicts the effects of drug_combinations based on their binary drug_target and single drug sensitivity_profiles in a given cancer sample here we report the r implementation of the algorithm timma r which is much faster than the original matlab_code the major extensions include modeling of multiclass drug_target profiles and network visual ization we also show that the timma r predictions are robust to the intrinsic noise in the experimental_data thus making it a promising high_throughput tool to prioritize drug_combinations in various cancer_types for follow_up experimentation or clinical_applications availability_and timma r source_code is freely_available cran r project org_web timma recently a network pharmacology paradigm for anticancer_drug has been proposed with an aim of developing multi targeted drug_combinations that consist of distinct chemical_agents as a promising_strategy treatment efficacy and safety most mathematical_models for predicting the effects of drug_combinations relies on empirical cellular dynamic_models such as those based on signaling_pathways or metabolic_networks these types of methods are hardly applicable for predicting cancer selective drug_combinations due to lack of accurate kinetic_parameters for each cancer type other methods use the transcriptional_responses of drugs i e gene_expression before and after drug_treatments to predict drug_combinations however such drug_induced transcriptional phenotypes are not routinely profiled in a typical high_throughput drug_screen and thus provide limited translation potential in the clinical_settings we have developed a logic_based network pharmacology approach target inhibition interaction using maximization and minimization averaging timma for predicting the effects of drug_combinations in a given cancer cell sample timma combines drug_target interaction networks with singledrug sensitivity_profiles derived either from individual cell_line models or from patient derived cell samples the network algorithm starts by searching a set of combinatorial targets that are most predictive of the singledrug sensitivities a drug_combination is then treated as a combination of target inhibitions the effect of which can be estimated based on the set relationships with the target profiles of the drugs the outcome of the timma model provides a list of predictedthe timma r package will facilitate effective integration of drug_target and drug sensitivity_profiles which are becoming increasingly available for the anticancer research the package does not only offer an efficient prioritization tool for selecting the most promising drug_combinations for further experimental_testing but also produces data_driven hypotheses for their target interactions such networkcentric investigation of the underlying_mechanisms of action in the given cellular_context will greatly improve our knowledge about the functional cross_talks between parallel cancer signaling_pathways to be utilized in anticancer treatment applications
