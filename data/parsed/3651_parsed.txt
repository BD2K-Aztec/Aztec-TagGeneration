structural_bioinformatics predicting protein residue residue_contacts using deep networks and boosting motivation protein residueresidue contacts continue to play a larger and larger role in protein tertiary_structure modeling and evaluation yet while the importance of contact_information increases the performance of sequence_based contact predictors has improved slowly new approaches and methods are needed to spur further development and progress in the field results here we present dncon a new sequence_based residue residue contact predictor using deep networks and boosting techniques making use of graphical processing units and cuda parallel_computing technology we are able to train large boosted ensembles of residueresidue_contact predictors achieving state of the art performance availability the web_server of the prediction method dncon isthe prediction of protein residueresidue contacts is seen by many as an important intermediate step for gaining traction on the challenging_task of tertiary_structure this idea has been spurred further recently by encouraging_results that demonstrate that predicted contact_information can indeed be used to improve tertiary_structure and effectively transform some unfolded structures into their folded counterpart the addition of a contact guided structure modeling category in the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp on a rolling basis has also aided in sparking interesting in residueresidue contact_prediction beyond the scope of tertiary_structure protein residueresidue contacts have been used in drug_design model evaluation and model ranking and selection existing_methods for residueresidue contact_prediction can be broadly categorized as sequence_based or template structure based sequence_based attempt to predict contacts from the primary sequence or information that can be derived directly from the sequence a number of these sequence_based use various machine_learning such as support_vector neural_networks hidden_markov markov logic networks random_forests and deep architectures to make residueresidue_contact predictions other sequence based_approaches have used evolutionary_information contained in multiple_sequence msas to identify possible contacts methods using msas were among the first sequence based_approaches tried but suffered from low accuracies caused by indirect or transitive correlations more recent_developments byusing large msas and sparse covariance_matrices have been better able to identify contacting residues from the alignments and resulted in significant improvements in accuracy template structurebased methods operate by extracting contact_information from structural data for template based_methods this structural data comes in the form of templates i e homologous_proteins with known structure once templates have been found and aligned residueresidue contacts are predicted using the contacts found in the structures given the relatively high_quality of the tertiary_structure models generated by template based techniques residueresidue_contact data is most useful when dealing with hard targets i e those for which a structural template does not exists or hard to identify by sequence alone for hard targets the conformational search is much larger and overall model quality is usually much lower thus there is great interest in high_quality sequence_based residueresidue_contact predictors that do not rely on template data such contact predictors would be able to provide_additional when generating models for hard targets unfortunately recent assessments of state_ofthe sequence_based contact predictors routinely report average accuracies in the range indicating a need for further development and new methods and ideas here we present a new sequence_based residueresidue_contact predictor using deep networks dns and boosting our method differs from other implementations of deep architectures owing to its boosted nature overall network architecture and training_procedure more specifically for training we initially use an unsupervised_approach to learn patterns in the data and initialize to whom correspondence should be addressed parameters and then fine_tune them with back propagation furthermore by using the computational power of graphical processing units gpus and cuda we were able to train large boosted ensembles of dn classifiers achieving state_ofthe performance in this work we have presented dncon a new method for protein residueresidue prediction the approach is based on two concepts boosted ensembles and dns which are novel in accuracy of the top l and l long_range contact predictions for a boosted ensemble win the graph plots accuracy as a function of the number of rounds of boostingshort medium medium long long the context of residueresidue contact_prediction when compared with the current state of the art dncon performs favorably achieving state of the art performance in the critical area of accuracy on top medium and long_range contact predictions when allowing for less than residue_level precision the performance of dncon is even more impressive given the strong contact signal present for short and medium range contacts and the fast flexible architecture of dns in the future we plan on modifying the dns such that they can incorporate and propagate predicted short to medium range contacts when making longer range predictions we also plan on refining the parameters and network architecture used to increase performance the method is available as a web_service at http iris rnet missouri edu dncon
