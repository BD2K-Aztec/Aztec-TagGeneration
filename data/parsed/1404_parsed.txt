discovering graphical granger_causality using the truncating lasso penalty motivation components of biological systems_interact with each other in order to carry out vital cell functions such information can be used to improve estimation and inference and to obtain better insights into the underlying cellular_mechanisms discovering regulatory_interactions among genes is therefore an important problem in systems_biology whole_genome expression data over time provides an opportunity to determine how the expression levels of genes are affected by changes in transcription_levels of other genes and can therefore be used to discover regulatory_interactions among genes results in this article we propose a novel penalization method called truncating lasso for estimation of causal_relationships from time course gene_expression data the proposed penalty can correctly determine the order of the underlying time series and improves the performance of the lasso type estimators moreover the resulting estimate provides information on the time lag between activation of transcription_factors and their effects on regulated_genes we provide an efficient algorithm for estimation of model_parameters and show that the proposed method can consistently discover causal_relationships in the large p small n setting the performance of the proposed model is evaluated favorably in simulated as well as real data examples availability the proposed truncating lasso method is implemented in the r package grangertlasso and is freely_available ata critical problem in systems_biology is to discover causal_relationships among components of biological_systems gene_regulatory metabolic_networks and cell signalling_networks capture causal_relationships in cells discovery of causal_relationships may be only possible through carefully_designed experiments which can be challenging however gene_regulation is carried_out by binding of protein products of transcription_factors to cis_regulatory of genes such regulatory_mechanisms are evident if the expression levels of gene x is affected by changes in expression levels of gene y therefore time course gene_expression data can be used to discover causal_relationships among genes and construct the gene_regulatory different methods have been developed to infer causal_relationships from time series data including dynamic_bayesian and granger_causality in dbns the state_space of bayesian_networks is expanded by replicating the set of variables in the network by the number to whom correspondence should be addressed of time points cyclic networks are then transformed to directed_acyclic dags by breaking down cycles into interactions between variables at two different time points among others have applied dbns to infer causal_relationships among components of biological_systems on the other hand the concept of granger_causality states that gene x is granger causal for gene y if the autoregressive model of y based on past values of both genes is significantly more accurate than the model based on y alone this implies that changes in expression levels of genes could be explained by expression levels of their transcription_factors therefore statistical_methods can be applied to time course gene_expression observations to estimate granger_causality among genes exploring granger_causality is closely_related to analysis of vector autoregressive var models which are widely used in econometrics and opgen rhein and strimmer employed var models to learn gene_regulatory whileproposed a sparse var model for better performance in cases when the number of genes p is large compared to the sample_size n similar sparse models have also been considered by mukhopadhyay and chatterjee zou andcompared the performance of dbns and granger_causality methods for estimation of causal_relationships and concluded that the performance of the two approaches depend on the length of the time series as well as the sample_size the findings ofemphasizes the need for sparse models in cases where the sample_size is small in particular when p n penalized methods often provide better prediction_accuracy applied the lasso or penalty to discover the structure of graphical_models based on the concept of granger_causality and studied the relationship between different key_performance in analysis of stock prices asymptotic and empirical performances of the lasso penalty for discovery of graphical_models have been studied by many researchers and a number of extensions of the original penalty have been proposed we refer to these variants of the lasso penalty as lasso type penalties in particular to reduce the bias in the lasso estimates proposed the adaptive lasso penalty and showed that for fixed p if appropriate weights are used the adaptive lasso penalty can achieve variable_selection consistency even if the so_called irrepresentability assumption is violated in fact it can also be shown that if initial weights are derived from regular lasso estimates the adaptive lasso penalty is also consistent for variable_selection in high_dimensional sparse settings the lasso estimate of the graphical granger model may result in a model in which x is considered to influence y in a number of different time lags such a model is hard to interpret and inclusion of additional covariates in the model may result in poor model_selection
