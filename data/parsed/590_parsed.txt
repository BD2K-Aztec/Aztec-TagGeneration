automated analysis of information_processing kinetic independence and modular_architecture in biochemical_networks using midia motivation understanding the encoding and propagation of information by biochemical_reaction and the relationship of such information_processing properties to modular network_structure is of fundamental_importance in the study of cell_signalling and regulation however a rigorous automated approach for general biochemical_networks has not been available and high_throughput analysis has therefore been out of reach results modularization identification by dynamic independence algorithms midia is a user_friendly extensible r package that performs automated analysis of how information is processed by biochemical_networks an important component is the algorithms ability to identify exact network decompositions based on both the mass action kinetics and informational properties of the network these modularizations are visualized using a tree_structure from which important dynamic conditional_independence properties can be directly read only partial stoichiometric information needs to be used as input to midia and neither simulations nor knowledge of rate parameters are required when applied to a signalling network for example the method identifies the routes and species involved in the sequential propagation of information between its multiple inputs and outputs these routes correspond to the relevant paths in the tree_structure and may be further visualized using the inputoutput path matrix tool midia remains computationally_feasible for the largest network reconstructions currently available and is straightforward to use with models written in systems_biology sbml understanding how information is encoded and transferred by biochemical_networks is of central importance in cellular and systems_biology we recently_introduced a rigorous new approach grounded in biochemical mass action kinetics and based on dynamic conditional independences between species trajectories a species trajectory is the time course of the number of molecules of a particular type of biomolecule by deriving dynamic conditional independences we are able to identify the species trajectories that fully encode the relevant_information and thus to trace the sequential_process of information_transfer through the network section in supplementary_material importantly the approach is applicable to a wide class of stochastic dynamics a suitable foundation has thus been laid for automated and potentially high_throughput computational_analysis of information_processing kinetic independence and modular_architecture for a wide class of biochemical_networks here the necessary algorithms and software for such analyses are made available to the community in a user_friendly extensible package called midia modularization identification by dynamic independence algorithms the package is written in the freely_available r language and is therefore applicable to the majority of operating_systems including windows mac and linux midia is straightforward to use with models of intracellular dynamics written in systems_biology or sbml and hence also with public_repositories of systems_biology models such as the biomodels_database an important component of midia is the ability to compute exact network decompositions based on dynamic independence properties of the modules section in supplementary_material midia identifies the species resulting in the overlap of modules and thus the important intermediaries in the network of all those species present in other modules only those in a given modules overlap region or intersection are relevant for the instantaneous kinetics of its other species and if stipulated for the trajectory of the module noteworthy departures from previous_approaches to module identification are that the decompositions are explicitly based on dynamic informational properties and that these decompositions are not partitions graphical community detectionbased methods were extended byto kinetic but solely deterministic models of signalling_networks by partitioning the species between modules so as to minimize inter modular retroactivity constraint based module detection methods such as correlated reaction sets or assume steady_state dynamics in which concentrations are constant over time we believe that this limits the scope of their applicability
