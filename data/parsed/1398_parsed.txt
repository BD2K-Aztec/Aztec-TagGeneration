discovering and visualizing indirect associations between biomedical concepts motivation discovering useful associations between biomedical concepts has been one of the main goals in biomedical_text and understanding their biomedical contexts is crucial in the discovery process hence we need a text_mining system that helps users explore various types of possibly hidden associations in an easy and comprehensible manner results this article_describes facta a real_time text_mining system for finding and visualizing indirect associations between biomedical concepts from medline_abstracts the system can be used as a text search_engine like pubmed with additional features to help users discover and visualize indirect associations between important biomedical concepts such as genes diseases and chemical_compounds facta inherits all functionality from its predecessor facta and extends it by incorporating three new features i detecting biomolecular events in text using a machine_learning model ii discovering hidden associations using co occurrence statistics between concepts and iii visualizing associations to improve the interpretability of the output to the best of our knowledge facta is the first real_time web_application that offers the functionality of finding concepts involving biomolecular events and visualizing indirect associations of concepts with both their categories and importance availability facta is available as a web_application at http refine nactem mc man ac uk facta and its visualizer is available at http refine nactem mc man ac uk facta visualizer text search_engines such as pubmed are crucial in everyday research_activities in biomedical_sciences as a significant fraction of biomedical knowledge is still accessible only in textual form we have previously_developed facta a text_mining system designed to help researchers find direct_associations between biomedical concepts in an interactive fashion it is capable of producing ranked lists of important biomedical concepts e g genes diseases and chemical_compounds which are considered relevant to the query according to their co occurrence statistics the system has also been used as a search_engine to link biomolecular pathways to textual evidence to whom correspondence should be addressed this article_describes three new classes of functionality that are introduced to extend and improve facta the first extension is the use of biomolecular events as semantic metadata used for search semantic metadata derived from text to index digital documents for retrieval purposes have been used in systems like suiseki ihop chilibot goweb hanalyzer semantic medline medie ebimed and kleio automatic extraction of events has a broad range of applications in biology ranging from support for the creation and annotation of pathways to automatic population or enrichment of databases this novel event extension allows users to specify a concept which involves a biomolecular event the second extension is to help users discover indirectly associated concepts discovering hidden previously_unknown and potentially useful associations between biomedical concepts such as diseases and chemical_compounds from the literature is a longstanding goal in biomedical_text the pioneering work ofhypothesized the role of fish_oil in clinical treatment of raynauds disease combining different pieces of information from the literature and the hypothesis was later confirmed with experimental_evidence among various approaches to the automatic generation of such hypotheses we adopt a simple approach using two step associations more specifically we attempt to discover indirect associations by combining two known associations which are obtained from direct co occurrence statistics in this work we give a probabilistic interpretation to the strengths of the discovered indirect associations which allows the system to rank them in the order of their expected amount of information the third extension is visualization the output format of facta was a tabular formatthe associated concepts found by the system are categorized ranked and presented in multiple columns although the tabular format may be useful enough in most cases visualizing the output can help the user grasp the results more intuitively the visualization component we have introduced in facta uses a technique called treemapping which enables the user to easily understand the relative importance of many different concepts this article is organized as follows section_describes our machine_learning approach to detecting biomolecular events in text section_presents our algorithm for discovering indirectpage i i i we have presented three extensions which have recently been introduced in facta a text search_engine for medline first we have proposed a joint learning approach to detecting biomolecular events described in text the performance of detecting trigger words has been significantly_improved by performing the task jointly with protein name recognition second we have presented a method for detecting indirect associations the associations are ranked by the level of novelty and reliability which are estimated by combining the strengths of multiple known associations that are directly observable from co occurrence statistics in the literature third we have implemented a novel visualization component which provides an intuitive overview of the discovered concepts and their associations each concept is represented with a coloured rectangle the colour shows the category and the area indicates the importance each association is displayed with a link whose width indicates the importance the three classes of functionality described in this article are implemented in facta the system accepts concept identifiers arbitrary keywords and their boolean combinations as a query and immediately produces a ranked_list or its visualization of concepts that are indirectly associated with the query facta is implemented in c and currently running on a single linux server with gb of memory the service is available at http refine nactem mc man ac uk facta and the visualization i system is available at http refine nactem mc man ac uk factavisualizer
