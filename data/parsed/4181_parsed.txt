semantic integration of physiology phenotypes with an application to the cellular_phenotype ontology motivation the systematic observation of phenotypes has become a crucial tool of functional_genomics and several large international projects are currently underway to identify and characterize the phenotypes that are associated with genotypes in several species to integrate phenotype descriptions within and across species phenotype ontologies have been developed applying ontologies to unify phenotype descriptions in the domain of physiology has been a particular challenge due to the high_complexity of the underlying domain results in this study we present the outline of a theory and its implementation for an ontology of physiology related_phenotypes we provide a formal description of process attributes and relate them to the attributes of their temporal parts and participants we apply our theory to create the cellular_phenotype ontology cpo the cpo is an ontology of morphological and physiological phenotypic_characteristics of cells cell components and cellular_processes its prime application is to provide terms and uniform definition patterns for the annotation of cellular_phenotypes the cpo can be used for the annotation of observed abnormalities in domains such as systems microscopy in which cellular_abnormalities are observed and for which no phenotype ontology has been created availability_and the cpo and the source_code we generated to create the cpo are freely_available onphenotype studies on all scales and levels of granularity are now an invaluable tool for functional_genomics research phenotypes of targeted mutations in animal_models are now systematically recorded to reveal the role of individual genes within a biological system these phenotype studies now play_a in translational to whom correspondence should be addressed research and are being used to reveal candidate_genes for orphan diseases and to identify chemicals that may have effects on these diseases the large_volume and diversity of phenotypes within different species and across multiple_scales and levels of granularity necessitates the application of flexible strategies for managing and integrating data so that it becomes amenable to automated comparative_analyses to integrate biomedical data across heterogeneous information systems biomedical_ontologies are being developed an ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization of a domain and can be used to make the meaning of terms in a vocabulary explicit they play_a in the annotation of biomedical data and the integration of model_organism databases ontologies increasingly rely on the use of semantic_web technologies the semantic_web provides a stack of protocols and languages to include explicit semantics in websites in particular the web_ontology owl has been designed to express and share ontologies within the semantic_web owl is a language based on description logics a group of formal languages based on first order predicate logic automated reasoners have been developed within the semantic_web to perform complex operations on ontologies formulated in owl in particular automated reasoners can verify an ontologys consistency and use deductive inference to perform powerful queries over ontologies to benefit from automated reasoning and the rapidly increasing number of software_tools that are being developed within the semantic_web most biomedical_ontologies are now available in owl or can be converted into an owl based representation in the domain of phenotypes multiple ontologies have been developed in particular ontologies to characterize mammalian human yeast and worm phenotypes are now available while several more phenotype ontologies are under development to benefit from automated reasoning integrate phenotypes across species and reuse the content of anatomy and process ontologies we have defined process classes using the framework of the phenotypic attribute and trait ontology pato
