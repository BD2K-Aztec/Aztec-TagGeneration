ball snpgp from genetic_variants toward computational diagnostics in medical_research it is crucial to understand the functional consequences of genetic_alterations for example non_synonymous variants nssnvs nssnvs are known to be causative for several human_diseases however the genetic_basis of complex_disorders such as diabetes or cancer comprises multiple factors methods to analyze putative synergetic effects of multiple such factors however are limited here we concentrate on nssnvs and present ball snpgp a tool for structural and functional characterization of nssnvs which is aimed to improve pathogenicity assessment in computational diagnostics based on annotated snv data ball snpgp creates a three_dimensional visualization of the encoded_protein collects available information from different resources concerning disease relevance and other functional_annotations performs cluster_analysis predicts putative binding_pockets and provides data on known interaction sites availability_and ball snpgp is based on the comprehensive c framework biochemical algorithms library ball and its visualization front end ballview our tool is available at www ccb uni saarland de ball snpgp non_synonymous variants nssnvs play_a for understanding the genetic_basis of many diseases including diabetes and cancer over of known nssnvs are currently associated with a specific disease while the advent of nextgeneration_sequencing ngs increases the amount of identified nssnvs the experimental analysis of their pathogenic influence is laborious and time consuming consequently several approaches to predict the functional impact of nssnvs in silico have been developed in a previous study we evaluated the prediction concordance and congruency of stateof the art pathogenicity prediction_tools to this end we were able to address fundamental problems of current methods centering at the one snv one phenotype paradigm a human individual inherits several nssnvs simultaneously these nssnv sets may exhibit synergistic_effects and thus contribute to pathogenic phenotypes besides browser_based tools such as mupit interactive providing three_dimensional d visualizations computational_methods to assess the impact of nssnv sets on a protein are missing in the first approach to analyze nssnv sets we developed the proof_of tool ball snp that visualizes mutated residues within d protein_structures and provides available database annotations on clinical_significance and disease association for them here we present ball snpgp which expands our previous tool to improve the assessment of pathogenic relevance in clinical_diagnostics especially when no d structural_information is available based on ngs output that relies on the variant_call and includes gene based annotation ball snpgp searches for a d structure or a homologous d model and pathogenicity information in available databases predicts pathogenicity protein_stability changes and active_sites performs cluster_analyses on mutated residues and assigns protein interaction sites as annotated in pisite on the residue_level in this work we present ball snpgp a software_tool to analyze and identify nssnv candidates for computational diagnostics it is based on a standard molecular_modeling framework allows the use of standard ngs output embeds fundamental nssnv information and performs various analyses of the d structure of the mutated protein to gain insights into putative cumulative_effects of nssnvs the well defined user_interface and the clear presentation of the generated information are appealing to non expert users as well as bioinformatics professionals in the future ball snpgp will be extended to include the possibility to analyze binding of the affected protein to its interaction_partners and small_molecules to facilitate drug_design studies
