genome_analysis genplay a multipurpose genome_analyzer and browser motivation rapidly decreasing sequencing cost due to the emergence and improvement of massively_parallel has resulted in a dramatic_increase in the quantity of data that needs to be analyzed therefore software_tools to process visualize analyze and integrate data produced on multiple_platforms and using multiple methods are needed results genplay is a fast easy to use and stable tool for rapid analysis and data_processing it is written in java and runs on all major operating_systems genplay recognizes a wide_variety of common genomic data_formats from microarray or sequencing based platforms and offers a library of operations normalization binning smoothing to process raw_data into visualizable tracks genplay displays tracks adapted to summarize gene structure gene_expression repeat families cpg islands etc as well as custom tracks to show the results of rna_seq chip_seq timex seq and single_nucleotide snp analysis genplay can generate statistics minimum maximum sd correlation etc the tools provided include gaussian filter peak_finders signal saturation island finders the software also offers graphical features such as scatter plots and bar charts to depict signal repartition the library of operations is continuously growing based on the emerging needs availability genplay is an open_source project available fromwith the advent_of sequencing_technologies bioinformatics_analysis has become a bottleneck despite the creation of biocomputational units at major research_centers many useful tools are available to analyze and visualize genomic and epigenomic data but most are geared toward informaticians and can be difficult to use for biologists the problem is not that most applications are run through a command_line since commands flags and parameters can rapidly be learned rather the main bottleneck is the absence of tools that biologists can use to analyze and evaluate their data by the usual trial and error process that is so important to gain a real understanding of any phenomenon biologists need tools that allow them to scrutinize genomic and epigenomic data as easily as to whom correspondence should be addressed they can scrutinize a microscope slide by moving the stage varying the light etc to focus on interesting details with most existing_tools this is not possible because data analysis involves many hours of computing time and many decision points without any visual_feedback before the data are sufficiently processed to be loaded in a genome_browser in practice most bioinformatics analyses are performed by informaticians that understand the tools but not necessarily the experiments rather than by the biologists who designed the experiments genplay was developed with the aim of producing a graphically oriented user_friendly multipurpose tool that would help biologists visualize analyze and transform their raw_data into biologically_relevant tracks it was also developed to facilitate comparison of datasets generated on multiple_platforms among the currently available genome_browsers we can distinguish two categories the first category is web_based client server application such as the ucsc or ensembl fernandez genome_browsers they include rich databases and users do not need to have the data on their personal computer these browsers are mostly used for data visualization and they generally do not offer tools to process data the second category of browsers are desktop oriented and rely on local databases and can be graphically much faster this category is particularly adapted to processing as well as visualizing user generated data examples of desktop oriented browsers include the software apollo artemis bamview gambit viewer http code google com p gambit viewer gbrowse igv igb lookseq magic viewer mochiview savant tablet genplay is a desktop genome_analyzer and visualizer that was written in java because of the cross_platform capability of this language and the ease of development features from the jdk java development toolkit one of the challenges we faced during development was to obtain fast performance on common desktop computers the challenge was met by extensive use of multithreading by paying close attention to data_structures and by preloading data to be visualized in the computers main_memory one effective solution for some data types was to divide the genome into bins of fixed size one of genplay advantages over most of the other browsers is that it places emphasis on letting biologists take control of their own data by providing constant visual_feedback combined with extremely rapid browsing at every decision point during an analysis the speed of the analyses performed in genplay is critical to let users experiment
