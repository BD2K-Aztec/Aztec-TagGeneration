unicon d de_novo using united residue conformational search via stepwise probabilistic sampling motivation recent experimental_studies have suggested that proteins fold via stepwise assembly of structural_units named foldons through the process of sequential stabilization alongside latest_developments on computational side based on probabilistic modeling have shown promising direction to perform de_novo protein conformational_sampling from continuous space however existing computational_approaches for de_novo often randomly sample protein conformational_space as opposed to experimentally suggested stepwise sampling results here we develop a novel generative probabilistic_model that simultaneously captures local structural preferences of backbone and side chain conformational_space of polypeptide_chains in a united residue representation and performs experimentally motivated conditional con formational sampling via stepwise synthesis and assembly of foldon units that minimizes a composite physics and knowledge based energy function for de_novo the proposed method unicon d has been found to i sample lower_energy conformations with higher accuracy than traditional random_sampling in a small benchmark of proteins ii perform comparably with the top five automated methods on difficult target domains from the th critical assessment of protein_structure casp experiment and on difficult target domains from the th casp experiment and iii outperform two state of the art approaches and a baseline counterpart of unicon d that performs traditional random_sampling for protein modeling aided by predicted residue residue_contacts on targets from the th edition of casp availability_and source_code executable versions manuals and example data of unicon d for linux and osx are freely_available to non commercial users at http sysbio rnet mis souri edu unicon d computationally predicting protein_structure from its amino_acid the so_called de_novo structure prediction_problem remains to be largely unsolved owing to the challenges associated with efficiently navigating huge conformational_space accessible to proteins as well as due to the difficulties in accurately capturing physical_forces behind protein_folding in silico recent experimental_studies based on equilibrium and kinetic hydrogen exchange have theorized that protein_folding proceeds by stepwise assembly of protein structural_units known as foldons previously formed foldon units cooperate to sequentially stabilize subsequent foldons to gradually build the native_structure in a process known as sequential stabilization alongside encouraging process has been made on computational side with development of probabilistic_graphical to perform conformational search from a continuous space that is free from discretized database driven search_strategies as employed in fragment assembly based structure_prediction these methods adopt different representations to parameterize protein conformational_space and employ a diverse set of machine_learning to model it for instance fb hmm adopts a coarse_grained ca only representation and trains a generative hidden_markov hmm to capture local structural preferences a discriminative learning method crfsampler on the other hand trains a conditional_random crf by utilizing ca only representation torusdbn and cs torus uses dynamic_bayesian dbn to capture structural bias of proteins backbone whereas fusion relies on input_output hidden_markov iohmm for modeling local preferences of backbone conformational_space furthermore methods relying on markov_random mrf have been proposed to generate protein side chain rotamer library v dihedral_angles conditioned on backbone_conformation dbn based models such as basilisk also exist to capture backbone dependent and backbone independent structural preferences of side chain v angles despite showing promising direction these approaches follow several conventions that can be circumvented first starting from an extended polypeptide conformation of the whole protein these approaches attempt to predict the folded structure by replacing random stretches of the chain using probabilistic sampling and optimizing a potential_energy these probabilistic_graphical methods like current fragment assembly based_methods therefore do not apply experimentally suggested stepwise protein_folding paradigm during structure_prediction second these methods do not consider the influence of side_chains during structure modeling and typically add side chain conformation conditioned on backbone after the backbone geometry is predicted motivated by experimental hypothesis we develop unicon d a de_novo method that performs stepwise synthesis and assembly of foldon units via conditional sampling from a novel united residue probabilistic_model which captures local conformational bias of backbone and side chain simultaneously in a united residue representation the rationale for choosing united residue representation is to integrate both backbone and side chain during structure modeling it is found that i stepwise sampling produces lower_energy conformations with higher accuracy than random_sampling when everything else remains the same ii unicon d attains comparable_performance with top five automated methods of casp and casp in a dataset of and difficult target domains respectively and iii unicon d outperforms a baseline counterpart of unicon d that performs traditional random_sampling as well as gdfuzz d and ft comar two stateof the art approaches for de_novo aided by residue residue_contacts in a dataset containing casp_targets here we show that experimentally motivated stepwise probabilistic sampling can lead to improvements during de_novo conformational_sampling of united residue polypeptide_chains by generating lower_energy conformation with higher accuracy than traditional random_sampling approaches moreover stepwise sampling strategy naturally avoids domain splitting and reassembly during multi domain protein modeling and can be directly applied to predict structures of relatively larger proteins combined with a basic implementation of united residue physics based force_field aided by predicted residue residue_contacts the method attains accuracy comparable with the top automated approaches worldwide in a dataset of difficult protein targets furthermore with sufficiently accurate predicted contacts the method can consistently predict correct overall folds of proteins with higher average_accuracy than two state of the art approaches our results obtained purely based on coarse_grained sampling and scoring could be further enhanced by focusing future work on all atom refinement and improved scoring_function
