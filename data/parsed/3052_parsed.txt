gene_expression modeling tissue contamination to improve molecular_identification of the primary_tumor of metastases motivation contamination of a cancer tissue by the surrounding benign non cancerous_tissue is a concern for molecular cancer diag nostics this is because an observed molecular_signature will be distorted by the surrounding benign_tissue possibly leading to an incorrect diagnosis one example is molecular_identification of the primary_tumor of metastases because biopsies of metastases typically contain a significant amount of benign_tissue results a model of tissue contamination is presented this contamination model works independently of the training of a molecular pre dictor and it can be combined with any predictor model the usability of the model is illustrated on primary_tumor identification of liver_biopsies specifically on a human dataset consisting of microrna expression measurements of primary tumor_samples benign liver_samples and liver_metastases for a predictor trained on primary_tumor and benign liver_samples the contamination model decreased the test error on biopsies from liver_metastases from to a further reduction to was obtained by including biopsies in the training data several studies have considered molecular predictors for primary_tumor identification see all these studies report misclassification percentages of in predicting the primary_tumor from primary tumor_samples which is consistent with our findings see section however the performance of molecular predictors on metastatic samples is less clear most studies assess the performance of their predictor using a combination of primary_tumor and metastatic samples with an unbalanced metastatic sample set metastases are often more difficult to classify by conventional diagnostics compared with primary_tumors yet samples of metastatic cancers are generally underrepresented in the validation to correctly validate the performance of a predictor the validation_samples must be representative of the samples that the predictor is intended to be used on for the majority of patients with metastatic_cancer identification of the primary_tumor relies on small formalin_fixed paraffinembedded ffpe needle_biopsies core_biopsies from metastatic_lesions hence we argue that a molecular predictor designed to assist in the diagnostic_work of patients with metastatic_cancer must be compatible with and validated on ffpe core_biopsies from metastatic_lesions to develop such a predictor for primary_tumor identification of metastases it would seem preferable to train it exclusively on core_biopsies constituting metastatic tissue however it may be difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of metastatic biopsies of known primary tumor_origin furthermore a larger technical variation because of the smaller amount of processed material and the varying tumor content make it difficult to rely on core_biopsies only therefore previous_studies as well as ours have relied on primary tumor_samples as a predominant part of the training_set these considerations lead to the central problem that we address in this article when core biopsy_samples are scarce or completely_absent how can we best adapt primary tumor_samples to build a molecular predictor able to identify the primary_tumor of metastatic tumor_samples such an adaptation is generally referred to as a domain adaptation the problem being that the distribution of the cases to be predicted the target_domain differs from the distribution of the cases used for training the source domain see e g to overcome this problem we explicitly_model how the target_domain is related to the source domain and use this model to train a predictor a central difference between the source and target domains in our setting is caused by the fact that a core_biopsy is often contaminated by tissue_surrounding the tumor_cells that is benign_tissue from the biopsy_site unrelated to the tumor see another difference can arise if the molecular_signature of the metastatic_tumor deviates from the signature of the primary_tumor see e g orfor a discussion of the biology of metastases recent_findings bysuggest that tissue contamination may result in a decline of performance for molecular predictors the results presented in the present article to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as demonstrate that tissue contamination hampers primary_tumor identification of non microdissected metastatic liver_core we developed our contamination model to correct this however our suggested methodology is not specific to primary_tumor identification the biomarkers usedin our case microrna mirna expressionor the technological platform it is a general computational_model which is broadly_applicable whenever sample contamination constitutes a problem we found that a non adapted primary_tumor predictor trained solely on mirna_expression measurements from primary_tumors and benign liver_samples misclassified of the liver_core in our sample set notably the performance of the predictor was even worse for the subset of liver_core constituting metastases by applying our contamination model and suggested domain adaptation procedure this performance was improved for a predictor based on mirnas the contamination model decreased the misclassification percentage for metastatic liver_core from to a further improvement was obtained by combining the contamination model with a few biological metastatic liver_core this combined approach reduced the misclassification percentage for metastatic liver_core down to in this section we present results obtained by testing the suggested domain adaptation method on the mirna_expression dataset described in section the domain adaptation method was used with a linear and a log scale contamination model as described in section predictors were constructed using multinomial group_lasso outlined in section and by using the anova pam method fromresults obtained with and without using the domain adaptation method were compared to assess the generalization ability of the predictor method a multinomial group_lasso predictor was trained and crossvalidated solely on the resections this predictor achieved an overall fold_cross error of on the resected primary_tumors normal liver and cirrhotic liver_samples however on liver core biopsiesour target domainthis predictor had an overall test error of note that results are reported in terms of misclassification percentages of the predictors which we also refer to as the errors of the predictors the errors are either estimated on test data by cross_validation or by subsampling as described in detail in the following sections furthermore all errors reported henceforthexcept section originate from validation on our target_domain i e samples from one of the following categories liver_core of metastatic_tumors liver_core of primary_liver and core_biopsies of normal and cirrhotic_liver contamination of samples can affect the performance of molecular predictors this has been reported in other studies e g in the present article we have seen that normal liver contamination hampers primary_tumor identification of liver_biopsies this was seen regardless whether multinomial group_lasso or anova pam was used several molecular predictors for identification of the primary_tumor have been published which include ferracin et_al in the present article we show how an anova pam predictor exclusively trained on primary_tumor normal and cirrhotic liver_samples results in a misclassification percentage of when validated on the metastatic liver_core hence the anova pam predictor is like the multinomial group_lasso predictor not able to generalize well from the primary tumor_samples to non microdissected metastatic liver_core with a heterogenous tumor content distribution we did not find that any of the previous_studies systematically addressed the problem of identifying primary_tumor of non microdissected core_biopsies addressing this problem we found that novel methodology was needed to explicitly incorporate tissue contamination we have developed a computational_approach that deals with tissue contamination from surrounding_tissue and we have shown that the method improves the performance of the molecular predictor notably training of such predictors does not require metastatic samples from the specific biopsy_site e g liver comparable improvements could be obtained by including liver_core in the training data for each of the nonliver related classes moreover including liver_core in combination with the contamination model was shown to reduce the error even further with a sufficiently_large number of metastatic liver_core the improvement because of the contamination model is likely to be small however an advantage of the contamination model is that it reduces the number of metastatic samples from the specific biopsy_site needed for training combining the contamination model with core_biopsies the misclassification percentage of the non microdissected metastatic liver_core was reduced to although we only considered liver_core in the present article it is natural to assume that our contamination model will work for other biopsy sites as well with a limited number of benign_tissue resections representing the biopsy_site of interest our contamination model could easily be used to develop a predictor adapted to core_biopsies of other metastatic_sites in addition even though we only address tissue contamination our contamination model has the potential to be used to model background contamination in other types of samples
