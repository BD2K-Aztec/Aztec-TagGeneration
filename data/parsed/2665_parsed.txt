data_and large_scale benchmark of endeavour using metacore maps endeavour is a tool that detects the most promising genes within large lists of candidates with respect to a biological_process of interest and by combining several genomic data_sources we have benchmarked endeavour using pathway maps and disease marker sets from metacore tm of genego inc containing a total of and genes respectively we obtained an area under_the of for pathway and of for disease gene_sets these results indicate that endeavour can be used to efficiently prioritize_candidate for pathways and diseases identifying disease_causing is a key challenge in human_genetics in the process of identifying such disease genes researchers are often confronted with large lists of candidate_genes among which only one or a few are actually causal the validation of each candidate is often too costly_and so that only a few candidates are further experimentally_validated a related problem arises when trying to identify new members of a biological_pathway the selection of a small subset of optimal candidates for validation is called gene_prioritization since going manually through all possible sources of information is a slow and tedious process several bioinformatics_methods have been developed to tackle this problem we previously_developed endeavour whose key feature is that it uses multiple genomic data_sources e g sequence expression literature and annotation to estimate how promising a candidate_gene is by measuring its similarity with a set of training genes the training genes are genes which are already known to play a role in the biological_process under study the underlying assumption is that the most promising candidate_genes are the ones that exhibit many similarities with the training genes a schematic view of the algorithm is shown in originally endeavour was benchmarked by leave_one cross_validations on gene_sets corresponding to to whom correspondence should be addressed the inputs are on the one hand the training genes on top in red known to be involved in the process of interest and on the other hand the candidate_genes to prioritize at the bottom in grey and orange b data are collected for these genes e g expression_profiles functional_annotations and proteinprotein_interactions c candidate_genes are prioritized i e ranked according to their similarities to the training genes for example the gene in orange is the most promising_candidate i e it ranks in first position because i its expression_profile is similar to the red ones ii it also shares several functional_annotations and iii it is interacting with several training proteins the cross_validation procedure measures the ability of the program to capture the information of the known genes and to correctly use this information to prioritize the left out gene to assess the abilityof endeavour to capture the information of known pathway and disease related gene_sets we used the pathways maps and disease marker sets of metacore tm from genego inc since the gene_sets in metacore are manually_curated we consider them as a reliable representation of the current knowledge of the functional contexts in which the genes are active we have benchmarked endeavour using pathway maps and disease marker sets containing a total of pathway members and disease genes respectively in addition we have also benchmarked omim diseases and gene_ontology pathways that contain and genes respectively for each prioritization run the position of the left out gene among randomly_chosen candidates is recorded see also supplementary_material we use the area_under roc_curves auc as a measure of the performance we obtained an auc of for the metacore pathways moreover of the prioritizations have the left out gene being ranked in the first position the auc value obtained for the metacore disease marker sets is and of the prioritizations have the left out gene being ranked in the first position the auc values obtained for the gene_ontology pathways and omim diseases are and respectively altogether the results indicate that endeavour efficiently prioritizes candidate_genes for both pathways and diseases as observed and discussed in our previous work the performance of gene_prioritization is higher for pathways than for disease marker sets because data_sources such as gene_ontology contain pathway specific information and because diseases often implicate a complex set of cascades making their profiling more challenging furthermore the performance is higher for omim diseases than for metacore diseases because the metacore sets include markers derived from gene_expression studies whereas the omim sets only rely on known causative_genes such markers are indirectly associated to the disease and it is therefore harder to prioritize them assessing the performance of a novel type of bioinformatics tool such as gene_prioritization methods is of crucial importance our large_scale benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of endeavour it should be noted that the evaluation was carried_out at novartis by s schuierer and u dengler independently of the core endeavour team in particular the endeavour platform was used as is and no parameter fine_tuning was performed i e all available data_sources were used see also supplementary_material we are aware of the many pitfalls of benchmarking gene_prioritization and function prediction_methods so that the performance observed in cross validation_studies is likely to be higher than that observed in prospective_studies we have recently conducted such a prospective validation in drosophila which also confirmed further the effectiveness of our strategy
