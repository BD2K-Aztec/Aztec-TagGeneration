quantifying the white_blood transcriptome as an accessible window to the multiorgan transcriptome motivation we investigate and quantify the generalizability of the white_blood wbc transcriptome to the general multiorgan transcriptome we use data from the ncbis gene_expression geo public repository to define two datasets for comparison wbc and oo other organ sets results comprehensive pair_wise correlation and expression_level profiles are calculated for both datasets with sizes of and respectively we have used mapping and ranking across the gene_ontology go categories to quantify similarity between the two sets go mappings of the most correlated and highly_expressed from the two datasets tightly match with the notable exceptions of components of the ribosome cell_adhesion and immune_response that is or of all measured genes do not change of rank range between wbc and oo only change rank two trans tissue gene_lists are defined the most changing and the least changing genes in expression rank we also provide a general quantitative measure of the probability of expression rank and correlation profile in the oo system given the expression rank and correlation profile in the wbc dataset one of the reasons that the classification of malignancy was one of the earliest human applications of microarray transcriptional_profiling was that the tissue to be characterized the tumor was extracted as a matter of a routine surgical oncological care other clinical domains have lagged because the tissue involved in a pathophysiology may not be reasonably obtained from a living individual e g in behavioral or psychiatric_disorders or the organ specificity of a disease is unclear e g type_ii or hypertension increasingly investigators have explored the possibility of classifying prognosticating and characterizing the mechanism of diseases using the gene_expression measured in white_blood wbcs for those studies seeking to find the mechanisms genes dysregulated in the tissue of interest the large majority have been structured very similarly a direct comparison is made between expression_profiling of peripheral_blood and the specific tissue where the disease is known to develop an alternative method is to establish the degree of isomorphism between the peripheral_blood transcriptome and the overlap in expression_profiles from a fixed number of representative human tissues e g brain colon heart kidney etc altogether nine tissue_types to the surprise of many these investigations have proven to show considerable shared transcriptome across these tissues we adopt here a systematic_survey approach using the ever growing mountain of public microarray_expression of both wbc and dozens of other tissues under a variety of conditions and pathophysiological states our goal is to provide a quantitative estimate of the generalizability of gene_expression findings in wbc to those in other tissues we seek to identify the most robust similarities and corresponding differences in a genome_wide expression_profiles and to quantify them appropriately we hypothesize there will be robust correlations that survive the well known variability of the multiply sourced gene_expression database such as the gene_expression geo that allow large fractions of the peripheral_blood transcriptome to be reflected in other organs and tissues this hypothesis heretofore referred to as the wbc relevance hypothesis entails the following three questions i to what extent do those genes with the highest levels of expression in the wbc transcriptome also have high levels of expression in other organ_systems specifically can we quantify how the rank of the gene in wbc informs us of the rank in non wbc tissues ii how do correlations between pairs of genes in wbc inform us of their correlation in non wbc tissues iii how does the overall correlation_structure e g relevance network of wbc compare to those of other tissues to the extent that the wbc relevance hypothesis is supported we explore whether the informativeness of wbc gene_expression is broad or varies by specific functional_categories we look at both the broad categories of gene_annotation such as apoptosis as well as examining individual genes we used the ncbis geo to find experiments measuring wbc expression and a large number of experiments on non wbc tissues that we lump into the other organ oo category to minimize the noise from inter platform comparisons we used only those data obtained on the geos gpl platform for both the wbc and oo categories this resulted in a total of a diagram representing the workflow of the analysis i data_sets definition includes bulk download of the geo archive files for the gpl platform parsing out all gsm sample files with similar probeset averaged expression matrix detecting and removing outlier genes and constructing two sets for comparison wbc and oo sets ii quantify similarity between sets include use go mapping of the most correlated highly_expressed as defined by their fdr q value thresholds to quantify change across sets the null_hypothesis h is overlap between corresponding sets from wbc and oo by chance use a linear_model and general least_squares and pca to quantify relationships between oo and wbc across expression and correlation profiles respectively define two list of most changing and least changing from wbc to oo genes across expression_profiles iii in ad_hoc analyses we first construct the relnets of the most correlated wbc genes and their corresponding oo pairs ranks changes we next looked at the tfs human homologs from the mahoney atlas as expressed in wbc another step is looking at how the most changing and least changing genes from step ii are represented in the list of human housekeeping_genes finally we run go enrichment_analysis of the least changing genes with respect to tissue of expression in david for the oo and samples for the wbc set the oo set consists of about solid tissue_samples and about are cancer related tissues see section if the tools of functional_genomics can be applied to peripheral_blood cell samples to develop biomarkers for other organs two questions are apparent to what extent does expression in wbcs reflect expression in other organ_systems why should wbcs reflect expression in other organ_systems this investigation focuses on the first question and we review some possibilities with regard to the second at the end of this discussion before a further discussion of our findings here we comment on the general validity of our approach two sets were defined and compared the wbc and oo the oo set is composed of a large number of different solid tissues of all samples come from such tissue see also there was no discrimination between diseased or normal samples in oo or the wbc sets i e of the samples in oo are from malignant_tissues in a sense we compare wbc expression to expression of an averaged or generalized human tissue a question might arise about the general validity of such a procedure to address it we have redone the bulk of our analyses for the case of an oo set defined as a superposition of five samples taken at random from the solid tissue_distribution in the specific differences seen do not affect the quantitative conclusions reported below results not shown page we study the similarity between the wbc and oo transcriptomes using public repository expression data geo the oo sets has a wide representation of solid tissues and normal tissue_samples page
