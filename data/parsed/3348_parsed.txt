data_and ontology and graph_based similarity assessment in biological_networks a standard systems based_approach to biomarker and drug_target consists of placing putative biomarkers in the context of a network of biological_interactions followed by different guilt by association_analyses the latter is typically done based on network structural_features here an alternative analysis approach in which the networks are analyzed on a semantic_similarity space is reported such information is extracted from ontology_based functional_annotations we present simtrek a cytoscape_plugin for ontology_based similarity assessment in biological_networks a standard systems based_approach to biomarker and drug_target consists of placing putative or known biomarkers in the context of a network of biological_interactions followed by different guilt by association_analyses putative biomarkers may be derived for example from standard differential_expression including those from large_scale gene_expression and proteomics experiments networks may encode genegene geneprotein or proteinprotein_interactions they are typically inferred from published interactions or from computational prediction_models guilt by association approaches include graph_theoretic techniques such as network clustering_algorithms thus standard network driven approaches tend to be based on the analysis of biological network_structures here we report an alternative analysis approach in which the user_defined networks are mapped onto a semantic_similarity space in such a space between protein relationships are represented by estimates of ontology_based functional_similarity semantic_similarity is computed by using statistical information_encoded in functional databases annotated to the gene_ontology go we and others have previously investigated semantic_similarity assessment in the context of functional_genomics and network based biology to whom correspondence should be addressed page
