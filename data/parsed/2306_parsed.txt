identification of structural_features in chemicals associated with cancer drug response a systematic data_driven analysis motivation analysis of relationships of drug structure to biological response is key to understanding off target and unexpected drug effects and for developing hypotheses on how to tailor drug_therapies new methods are required for integrated analyses of a large number of chemical_features of drugs against the corresponding genome_wide responses of multiple cell models results in this article we present the first comprehensive multi set analysis on how the chemical_structure of drugs impacts on genome_wide gene_expression across several cancer_cell connectivity_map cmap database the task is formulated as searching for drug response components across multiple_cancers to reveal shared effects of drugs and the chemical_features that may be responsible the components can be computed with an extension of a recent approach_called group factor_analysis we identify components that link the structural_descriptors of drugs with specific gene_expression responses observed in the three cell_lines and identify structural groups that may be responsible for the responses our method quantitatively outperforms the limited earlier methods on cmap and identifies both the previously_reported associations and several interesting novel findings by taking_into multiple cell_lines and advanced d structural_descriptors the novel observations include previously_unknown similarities in the effects induced by delta prostaglandin j and hsp inhibitors which are linked to the d descriptors of the drugs and the induction by simvastatin of leukemia specific response resembling the effects of corticosteroids availability_and source_code implementing the method is available at modeling and understanding the diverse spectrum of cellular_responses to drugs is one of the biggest challenges in chemical systems_biology some of the responses can be predicted for targeted_drugs which have been designed to bind to a specific protein that triggers the biological response the binding of a drug to a target largely depends on the structural correspondence of the drug_molecule and the binding_cavity of the target_molecule which can be modeled in principle given ample computational_resources off target effects are harder to predict they are dependent on the cell_types individual genetic_characteristics and cellular_states making the spectrum of responses overwhelmingly diverse the less well known the drugs mechanism of action and the characteristics of the disease the harder the prediction from first principles becomes the most feasible way to approach this challenge in an unbiased way which does not require prior_knowledge of all on and off target interactions of drugs is to collect systematic measurements across different drugs cell_types and diseases and search for response patterns correlating with the characteristics of the drugs the patterns found can be used as evidence for hypotheses on underlying action mechanisms or directly in predicting the responses the connectivity_map cmap described the basis for a data_driven study of drugeffect relationships at a genome_wide level cmap hosts the largest collection of highdimensional gene_expression derived from treatment of three different human_cancer with over one thousand drugs the cmap data have been used in a multitude of studies revealing new biological links between drugs and between drugs and diseases genome_wide gene_expression responses from the cmap have been used to discover clusters of drugs having similar mechanisms of action resulting in novel findings such as effects of heat_shock hsp inhibitors and identification of modulators of autophagy the cmap data have also been successfully used in large_scale integrative studies including the analysis of regulation of drug_targets herg annotations to predict novel inhibitors and drugs interactions with protein networks quantitative structureactivity relationship analysis qsar is a widely_adopted approach to studying drug_responses traditionally univariate biological_activities are predicted using a range of methods including classical regression support_vector and random_forests the key challenge when moving from traditional qsar to system wide analysis of chemical effects is how to relate structural_features to genome_wide cellular_responses integration of chemical_structures with genome_wide responses has become a major research direction in chemical systems_biology which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com other datasets atias and sharan modeled linkage between structural_descriptors of drugs and their side_effects using canonical_correlation cca structures have also been used with genomic_datasets to predict toxicity and complex adverse_drug combined structures of drugs and mutation information of cell_lines to predict drug cytotoxicity in a series of cell_lines relationships between structural_descriptors of drugs and their gene_expression have also been studied examined similarities between chemical_structures and molecular_targets of drugs that were clustered based on their bioactivity profiles classified rat liver_samples to toxic versus non toxic responses based on combined drug_induced expression_profiles and chemical descriptors and identified chemical substructures and genes that were responsible for liver_toxicity in a broader setting when the goal is to find dependencies between two data_sources chemical_structures and genomic responses correlation type approaches match the goal directly and have the additional advantage that a predefined classification is not required generalized structure response analysis to multivariate correlations with cca on the cmap because of the limitations of classical cca their study was restricted to a limited set of descriptors and genomic summaries genesets and did not attempt to take into account the data from the three separate cell_lines in this article we present the first probabilistic_approach to the problem of integrated analysis of effects of chemical_structures across genome_wide responses in multiple model systems we extend the earlier work in three major ways i instead of using only two data_sources as in classical cca we used the recent bayesian group factor_analysis gfa method that generalizes the analysis to multiple sources here three cell_lines and two sets of chemical descriptors ii our bayesian treatment with feature level priors enabled us to cope better with the uncertainties in the high_dimensional iii we included a more informative set of d chemical descriptors to complement the widely used d fingerprints which are recognized to only explain limited aspects of drugs schneider our goal was to uncover the big picture of relationships between chemical_structure parameters and genome_wide responses in a data_driven fashion the data came from cmap gene_expression responses in three cell_lines hl blood cancer leukemia mcf breast_cancer and pc prostate_cancer and from two sets of chemical descriptors d pentacle descriptors of drugs and functionally_relevant structural_fragments fcfp as d fingerprints of the drugs these five datasets consist of samples from the drug_treatments coupled by the detailed drug identity we analyzed the statistical relationships between the datasets by decomposing them into a set of interpretable components our method quantitatively outperformed previous_studies thereby validating the approach we rediscovered findings reported_earlier as well as identified novel drug associations and detailed_structure response relationships
