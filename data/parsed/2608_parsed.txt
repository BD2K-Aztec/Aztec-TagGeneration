systems_biology jmassbalance mass balanced randomization and analysis of metabolic_networks analysis of biological_networks requires assessing_the of network based_predictions by using a realistic null_model however the existing network null_model switch randomization is unsuitable for metabolic_networks as it does not include physical constraints and generates unrealistic reactions we present jmassbalance a tool for mass balanced randomization and analysis of metabolic_networks the tool allows efficient generation of large sets of randomized networks under the physical constraint of mass_balance in addition various structural_properties of the original and randomized networks can be calculated facilitating the identification of the salient properties of metabolic_networks with a biologically_meaningful null_model availability_and jmassbalance is implemented_in and freely_available on the web atnetwork based studies of biological_systems attempt to relate topological_properties to biological_function the first step in drawing this connection involves determining the network_properties which do not arise by chance to this end a network null_model can be used to assess_the of network_properties the common approach for determining the statistical_significance of a given property is to determine a p value based on the following procedure i determine the chosen property from an investigated biological_network ii sample a large number of random networks under biologically_meaningful constraints and iii estimate the mean and variance of the property from the simulated networks to calculate a z_score with the corresponding p value under the assumption of normal distribution clearly the significance of a network property strongly depends on the null_model the commonly used method switch randomization does not account for physical constraints and thus generates unrealistic biochemical_reactions see for an example thus it is questionable whether the significance determined by this generic randomization scheme helps to elucidate the relation between network_properties and biological_functions the randomization procedure consists of a pre calculation step which classifies the compounds from the network according to their chemical sum formula see followed by the actual randomization the pre calculation is executed only once for all subsequent randomizations of the same network and renders the method applicable to large_networks a network is randomized by replacing the substrates and products of randomly_chosen reactions by compounds from within the same network and choosing their stoichiometric coefficients such that equation is satisfied the polynomial time algorithm generates randomized networks uniformly at random and clearly outperforms switch randomization see jmassbalance is written in java and comes with all required libraries hence an installation is not required and it can be used on any operating system with installed java http www oracle com the randomization procedure accepts network files in biocyc sbml or a customizable text format additional optional parameters allow specifying whether unbalanced reactions in the original network should be fixed whether compartments should be considered the randomization depth and probability and the number of randomized networks to generate all calculations can easily be parallelized by executing the program multiple times with different network indices see online reference manual switch randomization is also implemented and can be applied to compare the results of the two null_models in addition to randomization the following structural_properties can be calculated for the original and randomized networks respectively which allows to determine their statistical_significance in a biologically_meaningful context bullet local essentiality the ratio of successor reactions affected by the knockout of a reaction bullet reaction centrality the ratio of reactions globally affected by the knockout of a reaction bullet knockout set the set of reactions globally affected by the knockout of a given reaction bullet degree_distribution the compound degree_distribution bullet weight distribution the distribution of edge_weights bullet scope size_distribution the distribution of the number of compounds producible from a random set of seed compounds of the given size bullet distribution of r g the distribution of the standard gibbs_free of reactions the randomized networks may be printed as stoichiometric matrices or as text_files thus enabling subsequent investigations such as constraint based analysis jmassbalance is a flexible and efficient tool for assessing the significance of metabolic network_properties through a biologically_meaningful null_model it can be used to determine the salient structural_properties of metabolic_networks and to identify new properties which are statistically_significant and independent of basic physical constraints thus we believe the tool is useful for the initial analysis of reconstructed metabolic_networks as well as subsequent network based research
