chimira analysis of small_rna sequencing_data and microrna modifications chimira is a web_based system for microrna mirna analysis from small rna_seq sequences are automatically cleaned trimmed size selected and mapped directly to mirna hairpin sequences this generates count_based mirna_expression data for subsequent statistical_analysis moreover it is capable of identifying epi transcriptomic modifications in the input_sequences supported modification types include multiple types of modifications e g uridylation adenylation modifications and also internal modifications or variation adar editing or single_nucleotide besides cleaning and mapping of input_sequences to mirnas chimira provides a simple and intuitive set of tools for the analysis and interpretation of the results see also supplementary_material these allow the visual study of the differential_expression between two specific samples or sets of samples the identification of the most highly_expressed mirnas within sample_pairs or sets of samples and also the projection of the modification profile for specific_mirnas across all samples other tools have already been published in the past for various types of small rna_seq analysis such as uea workbench seqbuster magi oasis and cap mirseq cpss for modifications identification a comprehensive comparison of chimira with each of these tools is provided in the supplementary_material chimira outperforms all of these tools in total execution speed and aims to facilitate simple fast and reliable analysis of small rna_seq allowing also for the first time identification of global microrna modification profiles in a simple intuitive_interface availability_and chimira has been developed as a web_application and it is accessible here http www ebi ac uk research enright software chimira small_rna sequencing_data are among the most straightforward types of ngs_data to analyse however many laboratories that generate such data still struggle to develop or adapt computational_pipelines for the analysis and interpretation of these data additionally in recent_years it has been reported that many mirnas go through post_transcriptional alterations that modify their end mainly via mono poly uridylation or polyadenylation such modifications are believed to impart significant functional changes to the mirna indeed other modifications and or editing have also been observed to occur in several other instances hence it is imperative to explore the full profile of all modifications and or edits that can be identified in small rna_seq the functional_roles of small_rnas in different conditions may be greatly influenced by such modifications this can be accomplished by aligning small rna_sequences against their hairpin precursors the alignment region spanning each v c the author published_by chimira has been specifically developed for fast analysis of simple small_rna datasets with a user_friendly interface it complements our previous pipeline sequenceimp which was designed for command_line level analysis of larger scale experiments with complex designs chimira is a fast and robust system for the cleaning filtering qc and mapping of small rna_seq aiming to simplify the process of small_rna ngs_analysis to a straightforward online workflow additionally it allows the extraction of global modification profiles across and within each of the input samples thus allowing the inference of correlations between certain modification patterns and any conditions indicated by the input samples we hope the system will prove useful to the small_rna community conflict of interest none declared
