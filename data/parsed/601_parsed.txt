genetics_and automated construction and testing of multi_locus gene gene_associations it has been argued that the missing_heritability in common diseases may be in part due to rare_variants and genegene effects haplotype analyses provide more power for rare_variants and joint analyses across genes can address multi gene effects currently methods are lacking to perform joint multi_locus association_analyses across more than one gene region here we present a haplotype mining genegene analysis method which considers multi_locus data for two genes regions simultaneously this approach extends our single region haplotype mining algorithm hapconstructor to two genes regions it allows construction of multi_locus snp sets at both genes and tests joint genegene effects and interactions between single variants or haplotype combinations a monte_carlo framework is used to provide statistical_significance assessment of the joint and interaction statistics thus the method can also be used with related individuals this tool provides a flexible data_mining approach to identifying genegene effects that otherwise is currently unavailable haplotype and genegene analyses have been suggested as strategies to identify disease_loci that single_nucleotide snp approaches may have missed haplotypes have the potential for improved characterization of variation across the locus set yet it is usually unclear which haplotypes to test and how to model them numerous methods consider all haplotypes spanning the entire locus set with attempts to reduce the degrees_of that this approach otherwise confers other techniques have been designed to analyze contiguous and non contiguous locus subsets it has been hypothesized and in some cases shown that genetic_factors at one gene can modify the effects of another gene on disease_susceptibility if such biological interaction exists the association may only be evident by considering both genes simultaneously genegene studies are complicated by issues_surrounding what constitutes a genegene to whom correspondence should be addressed interaction for example some approaches for testing interactions focus on association between two unlinked loci which do not provide any measure of departure from additivity as a statistical interaction is classically defined most often haplotype analyses are performed for a single region and genegene studies concentrate on single snps in each region methods that consider multi_locus data at more than one gene would be desirable to maximize the ability to detect association evidence one such method exists to test specific haplotype interactions at unlinked regions however both haplotype and genegene analyses can result in high_dimensionality and how to combine them is therefore a challenging_problem to address these challenges we have extended our single region haplotype mining approach to consider multilocus data at two genes and test for association and interaction we concentrate on a broad set of tests that considers both joint effects and interaction effects in our genegene mining process data considered at each gene can be single or multi_locus we anticipate that this genegene mining approach will be most useful for hypothesis_generation however if required haplotype testing can also be performed using an empirical correction_for casecontrol and case only designs are available in addition to statistics to test joint and interaction effects the method is implemented in a monte_carlo mc testing framework and empirical construction wide significance assessment is available for hypothesis_testing
