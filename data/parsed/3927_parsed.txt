recognition of beta structural_motifs using hidden_markov trained with simulated evolution motivation one of the most successful methods to date for recognizing protein_sequences that are evolutionarily_related has been profile_hidden however these models do not capture pairwise statistical preferences of residues that are hydrogen_bonded in sheets we thus explore methods for incorporating pairwise dependencies into these models results we consider the remote_homology problem for structural_motifs in particular we ask if a statistical_model trained on members of only one family in a scop structural superfamily can recognize members of other families in that superfamily we show that hmms trained with our pairwise model of simulated evolution achieve nearly a median improvement in auc for structural_motif recognition as compared to ordinary hmms profile_hidden hmms have been one of the most successful methods to date for recognizing both close and distant homologs of given protein_sequences popular hmm methods such as hmmer and sam have been behind the design of databases such as pfam prosite and superfamiily however a limitation of these hmms is since there is only finite_state information about the sequence that can be held in any particular position hmms cannot capture dependencies that are far and variable distance apart in sequence on the other hand in structural_motifs as was noticed by lifson sander and others amino_acid that are hydrogen_bonded in sheets exhibit strong pairwise statistical_dependencies these residues however can be far away and a variable distance apart in sequence making them impossible to capture in an hmm early work ofshow that these pairwise_correlations help to recognize protein_sequences that fold into the right_handed parallel helix fold more recent work has used a conditional_random or markov_random framework both of which generalize hmms beyond linear dependencies to identify the right_handed parallel helix fold the leucine_rich fold and the propeller folds to whom correspondence should be addressed while these conditional_random and markov_random models are extremely powerful in theory in practice substantial computational barriers remain for template construction training and computing the minimum energy threading of an unknown sequence onto a template thus a general structure software_tool designed for structural folds in the same manner as hmmer and sam packages recognize all protein structural folds remains a challenging unsolved_problem in this article we find an unusual and different way to incorporate pairwise dependencies into profile hmm in particular we generalize our recent work on augmenting hmm training data to include these very pairwise dependencies as a part of a larger training_set see below while this method of incorporating pairwise dependencies is undoubtedly less powerful than mrf methods it has the advantage of being simple to implement computationally fast and allows the modular application of existing hmm software_packages we show that our augmented hmms perform better than ordinary hmms on the task of recognizing structural scop protein superfamilies in particular we consider the problem of how well an hmm trained on only one family structural scop superfamily can learn to recognize members of other scop families in that scop superfamily as compared to decoys we show a median auc improvement of nearly for our approach compared to ordinary hmms on this task we have shown how pairwise dependencies in sheets can be incorporated into an augmented hmm training_set using simulated evolution resulting in improved recognition of structural_motifs our datasets augmented training_sets and our hmms are all available online at http bcb cs tufts edu pairwise in the present work it was assumed that the structural_information was available for sequences in the training_set thus structural_information was used to construct the multiple_sequence to locate strands and to determine how the strands were hydrogen_bonded into sheets however ordinary hmms and our earlier simpler point_mutation model of simulated evolution require only sequence_information not structure extending our work to the case where no solved protein strcuture is known is an interesting open question secondary_structure programs could be used to find strands but determining how they are paired and hydrogen_bonded is a much more difficult issue computationally predicting how strands are paired in the absence of structural_information is a well studied problem since recent work that has tried to computationally model transmembrane barels and amyloids without a structural template may also be relevant
