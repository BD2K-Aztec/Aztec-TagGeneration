structural_bioinformatics megadock an ultra high performance protein protein_docking software for heterogeneous supercomputers the application of proteinprotein_docking in large_scale interactome analysis is a major_challenge in structural_bioinformatics and requires huge computing_resources in this work we present megadock an fft based docking software that makes extensive use of recent heterogeneous supercomputers and shows powerful scalable performance of strong scaling availability_and megadock is written in c with openmpi and nvidia cuda or later and is freely_available to all academic and non profit users at proteinprotein_interactions can provide valuable insights for understanding the principles of biological_systems and for elucidating causes of incurable diseases although many structures of interacting_proteins have been determined by x_ray and nuclear_magnetic the structures of many protein_complexes have still not been determined_experimentally because of cost and technical_limitations proteinprotein_docking a computational_method for predicting the structure of a protein complex from known component structures is a powerful approach that facilitates the discovery of otherwise unattainable protein complex structures a number of fast_fourier fft based rigid_body initial proteinprotein_docking tools have been developed for predicting protein complex structures however faster docking tools are still required to perform large_scale interactome predictions some applications also require a huge number of dockings such as ensemble docking techniques using multiple_conformations for flexible docking gr unberg et_al kr ol et_al cross docking for identification of protein interaction_partners and multiple docking to achieve these large_scale analyses use of the supercomputing environment has become absolutely necessary on the other hand of computing performance of supercomputers ranked in top org is currently achieved by hardware accelerators such as graphics_processing gpus and this percentage is increasing therefore tools that can be used with such heterogeneous supercomputers are necessary while some docking tools are accelerated by gpus on a node heterogeneous supercomputers which have massive numbers of nodes including multiple cpu cores and gpu cards have not yet been used for acceleration of docking tool performance here we present ultrahigh performance docking software megadock which makes extensive use of supercomputers equipped with gpus
