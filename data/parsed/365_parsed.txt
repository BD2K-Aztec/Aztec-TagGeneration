annocript a flexible pipeline for the annotation of transcriptomes able to identify putative long_noncoding the eukaryotic transcriptome is composed of thousands of coding and long_non lncrnas however we lack a software platform to identify both rna classes in a given tran scriptome here we introduce annocript a pipeline that combines the annotation of protein_coding transcripts with the prediction of putative lncrnas in whole transcriptomes it downloads and indexes the needed databases runs the analysis and produces human_readable and standard outputs together with summary_statistics of the whole analysis rna_seq has effectively portrayed the transcriptional complexity in eukaryotes demonstrating the widespread transcription of lncrnas in a diverse group of organisms however annotation of de_novo generated transcriptomes remains a complex task requiring efficient management of large_datasets current_tools for annotation identify coding_sequences by similarity_searches while lncrnas are typically predicted relying on sequence_composition lack of conservation and lack of orfs to fulfill the need of a single_platform we developed annocript a pipeline linking together these processes it uses multiple programs to annotate sequences based on similarity and composition it is capable of assigning protein_names domains metabolic_pathways enzyme classes go terms and other annotations further it can identify putative lncrnas based upon lack of any protein domain similarity lack of long orfs and high non coding potential by default a transcript is classified as lncrna if it satisfies all the following conditions i length nucleotides ii lack of similarity with any protein domain and other short ncrna from rfam and rrnas iii longest open_reading orf amino_acids and iv non coding potential score annocript is a pipeline for the annotation of transcriptomes the pipeline is optimized to run quickly without bargaining on accuracy it is the first platform with the ability to annotate coding_genes along with the prediction of putative lncrnas without the need for a reference_genome or comparative supporting data
