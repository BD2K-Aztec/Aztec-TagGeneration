genetics_and sampletrees and rsampletrees sampling gene genealogies conditional on snp_genotype the program sampletrees is a markov_chain sampler of gene genealogies conditional on either phased or unphased snp_genotype the companion program rsampletrees is for pre_and processing of sampletrees files including setting up the files for sampletrees and storing and plotting the output of a sampletrees run availability_and sampletrees is implemented in c the source_code documentation and test files are available at http stat sfu ca statgen research sampletrees html the r package rsampletrees is available on cran http cran r project org_web rsampletrees index html the gene genealogy is a tree that describes the ancestral relationships among chromosomal segments sampled from individuals in a population knowledge of this ancestral tree has application in population_genetic inference and for gene_mapping as the true tree cannot be known the uncertainty can be handled with markov_chain mcmc by sampling trees that are consistent with the observed data the c program sampletrees is used to sample gene genealogies conditional on genetic data observed at present the algorithm is based on the approach outlined in z llner and letting s represent the genealogical tree including branch times at a genomic location called the focal_point and g represent the snp data we wish to sample from the posterior_distribution pr sjg this is achieved using an mcmc approach where we sample from a distribution proportional to pr g s this joint_distribution is modelled by including additional latent_variables representing the haplotype sequences of internal nodes of the tree and the rates of mutation and recombination on the branches of the tree to sample trees from the posterior_distribution at a step of the sampler a proposal distribution that updates some components of the latent data i e the mutation_rate recombination_rate internal node sequences tree_topology or tip haplotypes is selected and an update to the latent data is proposed this update is either accepted or rejected according to the metropolis hastings ratio for further statistical details on the algorithm please see burkett et_al b and references therein in addition to the c program the r package rsampletrees is available to assist users with creating the input_files needed by sampletrees and manipulate and display the results after sampletrees has been run we expect the two programs to be used as follows with rsampletrees generate the necessary input_files for sampletrees run the sampletrees executable at the command_line passing the name of the settings file generated in step to the program read in and summarize the results of step in r using
