decoyfinder an easy to use python gui application for building target specific decoy_sets decoys are molecules that are presumed to be inactive against a target i e will not likely bind to the target and are used to validate the performance of molecular_docking or a virtual_screening workflow the directory of useful decoys database http dud docking org provides a free directory of decoys for use in virtual_screening though it only contains a limited set of decoys for targets to overcome_this we have developed an application called decoyfinder that selects for a given collection of active ligands of a target a set of decoys from a database of compounds decoys are selected if they are similar to active ligands according to five physical descriptors molecular_weight number of rotational bonds total hydrogen_bond donors total hydrogen_bond acceptors and the octanolwater partition_coefficient without being chemically_similar to any of the active ligands used as an input according to the tanimoto coefficient between maccs fingerprints to the best of our knowledge decoyfinder is the first application designed to build target specific decoy_sets ligand enrichment is a key metric for assessing the performance of molecular_docking or virtual_screening workflows it involves measuring the ability of a method or procedure to discriminate between active and inactive compounds however sufficient amounts of inactive compounds are generally not available for such testing thus decoys i e molecules that are presumed to be inactive against the examined target are commonly used for this purpose to avoid bias and to ensure that the enrichment is not simply due to physical differences between active
