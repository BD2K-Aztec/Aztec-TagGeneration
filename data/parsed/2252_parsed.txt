hycud a computational_tool for prediction of effective rotational correlation time in flexible proteins motivation a large fraction of eukaryotic_proteins contain unstructured tails or linkers the presence of flexible regions allows these systems to experience a high_level of mobility facilitating their biological_function the complex nature of protein rotation in such flexible modular systems precludes a straightforward application of hydrodynamic methods to calculate their rotational mo tional properties we describe the workflow of hydrodynamic coupling of domains hycud a program for prediction of effective rotational_correlation in multidomain_proteins the usage of hycud is demonstrated by its application to the ribosomal_protein l l rotational_correlation predicted by hycud might be used to detect molecular_switch events mediated by disorder order transitions in interdomain linkers availability_and the source_code are available at www mpibpc mpg de software the function of biological_macromolecules depends on their internal mobility supported by the presence of intrinsically_disordered reorientational motion of biomolecules can be followed through a variety of experimental_techniques however for slowly tumbling systems the use of these experimental_techniques is limited on the other hand theoretical prediction of rotational motional behavior through standard hydrodynamic methods is complicated in these systems by the presence of several potentially coupled motions to overcome these problems modification of rigid_body hydrodynamics as well as brownian_dynamics of coarse_grained models with the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions have been employed here we describe the workflow of a recently_developed alternative approach_called hydrodynamic coupling of domains hycud to predict the rotational correlation time s c of protein_domains within flexible modular systems the details of the hycud method together with its application to the flexible two domain ribosomal_protein l l and protein x of sendai_virus are reported the residue l l ribosomal_protein contains two globular_domains an n_terminal domain ntd responsible for protein dimerization and a c terminal domain ctd the ntd and ctd are connected via a long flexible_linker here we first generated an ensemble of random structures for the dimeric l l protein using the eom program supplementary subsequently hycud calculations were performed to predict the effective s c of the dimerized ntd and each ctd within the full_length protein dimers supplementaryshows that the hycud prediction for both ntd and ctd converged within an ensemble size of the s c distribution within the ensemble of dimeric l l is shown in s b supplementarypresents the results of hycud calculations close agreement with the experimental_results was obtained considering the uncertainty range of experimental_data and inaccuracy in hydrodynamic calculations further support for the validity of hycud is provided by the excellent_agreement between predicted and experimental s c of the residue domain of protein x from sendai_virus supplementaryand supplementary as well as several other examples reported in rezaei supplementary in conclusion we described a computational_tool to predict the effective rotational correlation time of domains in flexible multidomain_proteins the presented tool is easy to use and provides users insight into the rotational_motion of protein modules within dynamic modular biomolecules
