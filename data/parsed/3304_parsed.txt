genome_analysis nucler a package for non parametric nucleosome_positioning nucler is an r bioconductor_package for a flexible and fast recognition of nucleosome_positioning from next_generation and tiling arrays experiments the software is integrated with standard high_throughput genomics r packages and allows for in situ visualization as well as to export results to common genome_browser formats availability additional information and methodological details can be found ateukaryotic chromatin is organized in nucleosomes a structure with approximately basepairs bp of dna wrapped around an octamer of histones nucleosomes affect the packaging and accessibility of dna thus playing a crucial_role in defining its functionality the development of high_throughput techniques such as tiling arrays ta and next_generation ngs coupled to micrococal nuclease mnase digestions has enabled the study of nucleosome_positioning at the entire_genome level for several organisms including humans some clear features emerged from these studies such as the presence of wellpositioned nucleosomes and their depletion in regions_surrounding transcription_start tss however well positioned phased across different cells nucleosomes coexist with fuzzy not phased ones outside the tss this variability makes nucleosome_positioning complex requiring therefore the development of algorithms to find the most probable nucleosomal configuration these approaches include among others hidden_markov hmm higher_order bayesian_networks or mixed methods these methods are very powerful but the intrinsic assumptions and the level of expertise of the modeler can significantly affect the results here we present a new tool nucler integrated in the open_source multiplatform r bioconductor framework the approach is based on a fast nonparametric detection of all nucleosome dyads and scoring of the calls a good performance is achieved by filtering the noise using fast_fourier fft the user has full freedom tofrom nislows group and an ngs experiment performed in our group a comparative_analysis has been performed using hmm results provided byand the package chipseqr available from r bioconductor repository we selected the first method as it is widely used in the literature and the second one for being the only package that enables a nucleosome_positioning analysis in r bioconductor the main difference between lees hmm and our approach is that the method presented here is able to detect multiple shifted nucleosomes in a given single position and not just providing the most probable state for each position this has a large impact on the final map where we are able to identify a richer landscape of nucleosome calls in ta experiments additionally the hmmbased approach is difficult to apply to bp resolution experiments such as nsg due to the large amount of memory required for backtracking apart from this scalability problem the modeling of background transition_probabilities a key element in hmm requires a very fine and subjective tuning this can overconstrain the results forcing for example preferred length linker dna strict periodic positioning or inability to detect coverage peaks due to strange chromatin structures like centromers or tetrasomes in the previous work of nucleosomes well positioned and fuzzy were detected nucler applied to the same dataset is able to detect a total of individual scored nucleosome calls furthermore our method displayed a larger ability to detect nucleosome_positions in synthetic data hits for nucler versus for hmm and also a higher correlation when rebuilding the original read maps_obtained from the ta experiment p for nucler versus p for hmm see_supplementary chipseqr www bioconductor org provides a similar approach as the one presented here but lacks support for ta data and a method for noise removal this generates problems in peak_detection since only global maxima above a settled threshold are detected efficiently missing many relevant sub peaks local maximums and leading to an underestimation of nucleosome density in our ngs_data nucler detects nucleosome calls repeated genomic_regions were not considered for this analysis comprising all of the local maximums above the default threshold on the smoothed signal with the same detection threshold chipseqr detects by default nucleosome binding_sites and if asking for sub peak_detection very far from the expected magnitude of calls according to yeast genome_size and putative nucleosome length a visual comparison of the mentioned methods is available as supplementary_material see supplementary again a benchmark analysis showed that nucler was able to recover more nucleosome_positions in synthetic data for nucler versus for chipseqr and to reproduce with higher definition the experimental coverage map p for nucler versus p for chipseqr see_supplementary for details nucler has a computational_complexity between o n and o n log n the package is accessible free of cost under lgpl_license scheme from our website_http mmb pcb ub es nucler and the instituto nacional de bioinformtica site http www inab org it should also be available on
