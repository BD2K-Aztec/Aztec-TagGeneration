genome_analysis false_positive peaks in chip_seq and other sequencing based functional_assays caused by unannotated high_copy regions motivation sequencing based assays such as chip_seq dnase_seq and mnase seq have become important tools for genome_annotation in these assays short_sequence enriched for loci of interest are mapped to a reference_genome to determine their origin here we consider whether false_positive peak calls can be caused by particular type of error in the reference_genome multicopy sequences which have been incorrectly assembled and collapsed into a single_copy results using sequencing_data from the genomes_project we systematically scanned the human_genome for regions of high sequencing_depth these regions are highly_enriched for erroneously inferred transcription_factor positions of nucleosomes and regions of open chromatin we suggest a simple masking procedure to remove these regions and reduce false_positive calls availability files for masking out these regions are available at
