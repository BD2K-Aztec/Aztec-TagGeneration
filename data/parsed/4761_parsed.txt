genome_analysis twist dna computing base_pair and bubble opening probabilities in genomic superhelical dna local opening of the dna_double is required in many fundamental biological_processes and is in part controlled by the degree of superhelicity imposed in vivo by the protein machinery in particular positions of superhelically destabilized regions correlate with regulatory_sites along the genome based on a self consistent linearization of a thermodynamic_model of superhelical dna introduced by benham we have developed a program that predicts the locations of these regions by efficiently computing base_pair and bubble opening probabilities in genomic_dna the program allows visualization of results in standard genome_browsers to compare dna opening properties with other available datasets availability_and source codes freely_available for download at http www cbp ens lyon fr doku php iddeveloppe ment productions logiciels twistdna implemented in fortran and supported on any unix based operating system linux mac os x many key_biological like transcription or replication require the local opening of double_helical dna under physiological_conditions most base_pairs are double_stranded but transient melting or unwinding of bubbles can occur spontaneously at specific locations along the genome in vivo the double_helix of dna is mechanically constrained by protein machineries imposing generally a negative superhelical stress to dna with a typical superhelical density of about in bacteria this tendency to underwind dna globally destabilizes the double_helix which might result in changes in the local physicochemical dna features like for example the binding_constants of transcription enzymatic complexes it is therefore believed that highly destabilized regions in the sequence might be related to regulatory_sites over the past_years based on a thermodynamic_model of superhelical dna introduced by craig benham it has been shown that these strongly stressinduced duplex destabilized regions significantly correlate with yeast origin of replications or promoter_regions in bacteria such observed correlations suggest that information on the local opening properties of dna could drive the identifications and annotations of putative regulatory_regions in genomes nine years_ago bi and benham developed the web_server websidd that predicts the destabilization properties of genomic_dna in response to superhelical stress however the systematic use of this tool to genome_wide analysis of dna local melting is highly limited by important computation times that restrict the use of the server to sequences bp recently we have developed a computationally_efficient self consistent linearization of the benham model that allows the prediction of position dependent opening properties of entire genomes within minutes on a personal computer here we describe twist dna a novel freely_available open_source program that computes local base_pair and bubble opening probabilities of superhelical dna under any given temperature ionic condition or superhelical stress density in particular it reads generic sequence files in fasta_format and provides output_files in bed format that can be loaded into genome_browsers to compare destabilization properties of genomic_dna with existing annotations or available datasets
