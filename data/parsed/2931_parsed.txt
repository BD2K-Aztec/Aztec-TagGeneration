genetics_and methylaid visual and interactive quality_control of large illumina k datasets the illumina k array is a frequently used platform for large_scale genome_wide studies i e epigenome_wide currently quality_control of k data can be performed with illuminas genomestudio and is part of a limited number k analysis_pipelines however genomestudio cannot handle large_scale studies and existing pipelines provide limited options for quality_control and neither support interactive_exploration by the user to aid the detection of bad quality samples in large_scale genome_wide studies as flexible and transparent as possible we have developed methylaid a visual and interactive web_application using rstudios shiny package bad quality samples are detected using sample dependent and sample independent quality_control probes present on the array and user adjustable thresholds in depth exploration of bad quality samples can be performed using several interactive diagnostic plots furthermore plots can be annotated with user provided metadata for example to identify outlying batches our new tool makes quality_assessment of k array data interactive flexible and efficient and is therefore expected to be useful for both data analysts and core facilities availability_and methylaid is implemented as an r bioconductor_package www bioconductor org_packages bioc html methylaid html a demo application is available from shiny bioexp nl methylaid contact m van iterson lumc nlbecause the introduction of the illumina k human methylation beadchip it has become the standard for large_scale genome_wide studies i e epigenome_wide ewas the array measures cpg_dinucleotides covering of genes refseq and a broad range of genomic_annotations the principle of the array is that the methylation_level of individual cpg_dinucleotides is inferred using quantitative genotyping of bisulfite converted genomic_dna a chemical_reaction that converts unmethylated cs into ts whereas methylated cs are protected to monitor the quality of illumina k data the array contains different types of quality_control probes to evaluate the performance of both samples and specific steps in the process the most frequently used type of quality_control probe is the negative control that represents the background signal level these are used to determine_whether a signal significantly exceeds the background signal represented as a so_called detection p or however current_tools do not allow researchers to use the valuable information provided by the other control probes the illumina software genomestudio visualizes all quality_control probes but is limited to small studies typically while tools developed to handle large studies primarily focus on data_processing and analysis and mostly limited their use of the control probe information to the calculation of the detection p values moreover neither have the possibility for interactive_exploration by the user methylaid was developed to address these limitations methylaid provides complete insight in the quality of each sample in a large_scale ewas and gives the user full control on the selection of bad quality samples that should be excluded from downstream_analyses quality_assessment of k array data is made interactive flexible and efficient therefore methylaid is expected to be useful for both data analysts and core facilities
