genetics_and a fast and powerful tree based association test for detecting complex joint effects in case_control motivation multivariate tests derived from the logistic regression_model are widely used to assess the joint_effect of multiple predictors on a disease outcome in casecontrol_studies these tests become less optimal if the joint_effect cannot be approximated adequately by the additive_model the tree_structure model is an attractive alternative as it is more apt to capture non additive_effects however the tree model is used most commonly for prediction and seldom for hypothesis_testing mainly because of the computational_burden associated with the resam pling based procedure required for estimating the significance_level results we designed a fast algorithm for building the tree_structure model and proposed a robust tree based association test treat that incorporates an adaptive model_selection procedure to identify the optimal tree model representing the joint_effect we applied treat as a multilocus association test on genes regions in a study of esophageal_squamous escc and detected a highly_significant novel association between the gene cdkn b and escc p we also demonstrated through simulation_studies the power advantage of treat over other commonly used tests the logistic regression_model is the most widely used approach for studying the relationship between a binary outcome and a set of explanatory_variables under the logistic regression_model the cumulative_effect of all the considered explanatory_variables is assumed to be additive on the logit scale in situations where the summation of the main effects from all considered variables is not adequate the addition of interaction_terms each of which is a product of two chosen main effects can be considered the logistic regression_model is a convenient tool for studying the joint_effect of multiple risk_factors if their effects are nearly additive but it can be less efficient if the joint_effect is more complicated and cannot be approximated adequately by the additive_model even with the inclusion of interaction_terms the tree_structure model which hierarchically partitions the data into multiple exclusive subsets and models each subset individually can be an attractive alternative to the linear_model approach especially in the situation where the joint_effect of multiple risk_factors predictors is non additive tree_structure models are used most often for outcome_prediction but seldom for hypothesis_testing when building a tree model a predictor is chosen to split each subset a node of a tree according to certain criteria also the tree_size is decided through a model_selection procedure such as cross_validation thus there are extensive model and variable selections in the tree model_building process as a result it is hard to obtain the asymptotic distribution for the test_statistic derived from the final tree model instead we have to resort to a computationally_intensive resampling based procedure to evaluate the statistical_significance this greatly limits the application of the tree_structure model in the setting of hypothesis_testing our goal is to develop a robust hypothesis_testing procedure based on the tree_structure model that is computationally_efficient even with the resampling based procedure the procedure is for testing_the that none of the considered risk_factors is associated with the outcome one motivated application is to conduct a gene level association test on a genome_wide association gwa study gwa studies typically measure genotypes on million single_nucleotide snps on a group of cases and controls one way to identify loci that are associated with the disease condition is to perform an association test on each snp separately another strategy is to conduct a gene level analysis by treating each chromosomal_region as a testing unit and testing whether all snps in the considered region are associated with the disease condition a considered region can contain a few to a few hundred snps measured by a commercial genotype array when conducting an agnostic screen over the genome we usually need to test genes or annotated regions when the bonferroni_correction for multiple_comparisons is used the p value threshold for declaring the global genome_wide significance at the familywise type_i of is about this creates a huge computational_burden on existing gene based to whom correspondence should be addressed tests that rely on a resampling based procedure to estimate their significance_levels for example it requires about iterations for a resampling based procedure to achieve a reliable estimate for a p value at the level of which would normally occur when tests are performed our proposed method is a general testing procedure that can be used as a multivariate test for the association between a set of predictors and a binary outcome the test_statistic is derived from a tree_structure model that approximates the joint_effect of a set of predictors on the disease risk and relies on a permutation procedure to evaluate its significance_level we reduce the computational_burden considerably by developing memory and cpu efficient algorithms for evaluating splitting rules in the treebuilding process we further speed up the testing procedure by deriving closed form score test_statistics for assessing the joint_effect summarized by the tree_structure model we use this new procedure to perform a genome_wide gene based analysis on genes regions in a gwa study of esophageal_squamous escc based on about cases and controls we also demonstrate the advantage of the proposed procedure over existing ones through extensive_simulation the linear_regression such as the logistic regression_model has been the dominant tool for assessing the joint_effect of multiple predictors the following three factors contribute to its popularity first the linear_regression is convenient to use as the asymptotic distributions have been established for derived test_statistics second it is generally_accepted that the linear_model is usually adequate for depicting the joint_effect third there are not many alternative options available there is clearly a demand for more robust testing procedures especially in situations when the cumulative_effect from multiple predictors is non additive here we have proposed a general testing procedure based on the tree_structure model leveraging a computationally_efficient tree building algorithm the procedure has limited requirements for cpu time and memory for a gene with snps in a study of cases and controls it takes s to run the procedure with permutation steps on a linux machine with a ghz xeon cpu we have demonstrated the power advantage for the proposed procedure in the setting of gene based association analysis through real_and the proposed testing procedure is general and can be used for testing the association between a set of risk_factors and a binary outcome it can adjust the covariates effects by treating them as a categorical variable with multiple levels it has two major tuning parameters that have to be set by the user the maximum tree sizes k the number of leaf nodes and the minimum sample_size n required for each leaf node to be split in practice the maximum tree_size depends on the sample_size of the study the number of risk_factors and the prior_knowledge on the complexity of the underlying risk model for the purpose of hypothesis_testing we favor a relatively small tree_size as we want to limit the number of considered candidate risk models which are subtrees of the full tree with the maximum number of leaf nodes to control multiple comparison effects on the other hand the maximum tree_size has to be large enough to allow the searching space to be sufficiently broad to cover a model that adequately approximates the true risk model in the setting of gene based analysis we recommend choosing k in the range of to under the assumption that the number of true disease associated loci within a gene tends to be relatively small the choice of the minimum sample_size n required in each leaf node is driven mainly by the total_sample because each leaf node represents a candidate risk group we suggest n for robust testing results the computational_burden associated with the tree_structure model is one major barrier to its use for hypothesis_testing we overcame this obstacle by combining several strategies to speed up the proposed procedure including the derivation of closedform formulas for evaluating splitting rules and score test_statistics for assessing the joint_effect summarized by the tree_structure model the use of ges one layer permutation algorithm for the evaluation of the p value and the adaptation of the boo method for swift scanning over candidate splitting rules we demonstrated that it is feasible to apply the proposed procedure as a multilocus association test in large_scale gene based association studies with candidate_genes or annotated regions the tree building algorithm can be accelerated further by noticing that the evaluation of splitting rules at each given tree node is parallelizable we are currently working on a gpu graphic processing unit implementation to take advantage of the parallelizability we developed a general testing procedure based on the treestructure model and presented a fast algorithm for building the tree_structure model by adopting the computationally_efficient boolean operator for swift evaluation of the splitting rule this procedure has broad applications and it is a valuable_tool that can be run routinely in conjunction with other tests that target an additive joint_effect we have created an r package implementing the procedure http www hanzhang name softwares treat
