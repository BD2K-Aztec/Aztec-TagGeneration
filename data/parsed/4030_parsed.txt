rnaifold t constraint programming design of thermo ires switches motivation rna thermometers rnats are cis_regulatory that change secondary_structure upon temperature_shift often involved in the regulation of heat_shock cold_shock and virulence_genes rnats constitute an interesting potential resource in synthetic_biology where engineered rnats could prove to be useful tools in biosensors and conditional gene_regulation results solving the temperature inverse folding problem is critical for rnat engineering here we introduce rnaifold t the first constraint programming cp and large neighborhood search lns algorithms to solve this problem benchmarking tests of rnaifold t against existent programs adaptive walk and genetic_algorithm inverse folding show that our software generates two orders_of more solutions thus allowing ample exploration of the space of solutions subsequently solutions can be prioritized by computing various measures including probability of target structure in the ensemble melting_temperature etc using this strategy we rationally_designed two thermosensor internal_ribosome thermo ires elements whose normalized cap independent translation efficiency is approximately greater at c than c when tested in reticulocyte lysates translation efficiency is lower than that of the wild_type ires element which on the other hand is fully resistant to temperature_shift up this appears to be the first purely computational_design of functional rna thermoswitches and certainly the first purely computational_design of functional thermo ires elements availability rnaifold t is publicly_available as part of the new release rnaifold at https github com clotelab rnaifold and http bioinformatics bc edu clotelab rnaifold which latter has a web_server as well the software is written in c and uses or tools cp search_engine
