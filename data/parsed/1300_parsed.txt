deepmesh deep semantic representation for improving large_scale mesh indexing motivation medical_subject mesh indexing which is to assign a set of mesh main headings to citations is crucial for many important tasks in biomedical_text and information_retrieval large_scale mesh indexing has two challenging aspects the citation side and mesh side for the citation side all existing_methods including medical text indexer mti by national_library and the state of the art method meshlabeler deal with text by bag of words which cannot capture semantic and context dependent information well methods we propose deepmesh that incorporates deep semantic_information for large_scale mesh indexing it addresses the two challenges in both citation and mesh sides the citation side challenge is solved by a new deep semantic representation d v tfidf which concatenates both sparse and dense semantic representations the mesh side challenge is solved by using the learn ing to rank framework of meshlabeler which integrates various types of evidence generated from the new semantic representation results deepmesh achieved a micro f measure of higher than of meshlabeler and higher than of mti for bioasq challenge data with citations medical_subject mesh is a comprehensive controlled_vocabulary which has been developed and maintained by national_library nlm resulting in already mesh main headings mhs http www nlm nih gov pubs factsheets mesh html by one important usage of mesh is to index citations in medline ncbi resource to catalog documents books as well as audiovisuals recorded in nlm currently one citation in medline is indexed by approximately mhs on average mesh has also been used in many other applications in biomedical_text and information_retrieval such as query expansion document clustering and document searching thus accurate mesh indexing of biomedical documents is crucial for the biomedical_researchers in formulating novel scientific hypothesis and discovering new knowledge currently human curators in nlm assign most relevant mesh headings to documents resulting in that medline citations were indexed in http www nlm nih gov bsd bsd key html this work is very precious but clearly laborious since to index an article curators need to review the full text of the corresponding medline article which is time consuming and prohibitively_expensive for example the average cost of annotating one medline article is estimated to be around meaning a huge total_cost for indexing around one million v c the author published_by
