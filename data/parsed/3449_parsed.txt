data_and pathview an r bioconductor_package for pathway based data_integration and visualization the pathway based_approach has been widely used in highthroughput data analysis emmert it has been successfully and routinely applied to gene_expression both microarray_and genetic and gwas proteomic and metabolomics_data compared with the individual gene molecule based_approach pathway analysis is more sensitive consistent and informative r bioconductor has become a primary software environment for high_throughput data analysis and visualization numerous pathway analysis methods and data types are implemented in r bioconductor yet there has not been a dedicated and established tool for pathway based data_integration and visualization in this article we introduce a novel package called pathview we did a detailed comparison between pathview and existing pathway tools in r bioconductor and other languages in supplementary table s pathview provides three features that are rarely implemented well in other tools i fully accessible and functional pathway visualization it adheres to human_readable pathway definitions and layouts like kegg no previous kegg base tools provide full graphics including node edge attribute modifications node edge labels legends and color keys ii strong data_integration capacity it integrates and works with data of different types different omic levels literature and so forth ids formats attributes species and so forth as far as we know no other tool provides such extensive data mapping and integration support iii easy to automate and integrate with pathway analysis tools only a few tools can be directly automated and fully integrated into pathway analysis_pipelines supplementary automated analysis column none of these features are brand new but surprisingly few of the existing_tools provide_satisfactory functionality in these aspects
