data_and hexpochem a systems_biology resource to explore human exposure to chemicals humans are exposed to diverse hazardous chemicals daily although an exposure to these chemicals is suspected to have adverse_effects on human_health mechanistic_insights into how they interact with the human_body are still limited therefore acquisition of curated_data and development of computational_biology approaches are needed to assess the health_risks of chemical_exposure here we present hexpochem a tool based on environmental_chemicals and their bioactivities on human proteins with the objective of aiding the qualitative exploration of human exposure to chemicals the chemicalprotein interactions have been enriched with a quality scored human proteinprotein_interaction a proteinprotein association_network and a chemicalchemical interaction_network thus allowing the study of environmental_chemicals through formation of protein_complexes and phenotypic outcomes enrichment availability hexpochem is available at http www cbs dtu dk services hexpochem humans in their daily lives are exposed to diverse hazardous chemicals through their environment and it has been recognized as an important component in the interplay between genes lifestyle diet natural environmental_exposure and disease_etiology hazardous chemicals are present in everything from food to consumer_products to industrial_effluents however knowledge about their mechanisms of action within the human_body is still limited as large_scale databases on chemical_toxicity i e actor and the comparative_toxicogenomics ctd are being assembled investigation of the relationship between environmental_chemicals and human_diseases can be investigated much more systematically not solely at the molecular level but also at the cellular and systems level for example integration of chemical toxicology within systems_biology using proteinprotein_interaction ppi and proteinprotein association_network ppan has been suggested to allow previously_uncharacterized connections between chemical_compounds and diseases to be revealed here we present hexpochem a server with the aim to explore chemicals exposure and their impact on human_health hexpochem is distinct from other tools as i it provides information about the source of the chemical_exposure ii it identifies proteins interacting with a chemical and consequently suggests chemicalchemical interactions and qualitative cumulative_risk of chemical mixtures and iii it integrates ppi and ppan data into biological outcomes and environmental diseases using computational_biology approaches
