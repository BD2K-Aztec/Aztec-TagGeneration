systems_biology pathway_commons at virtual cell use of pathway data for mathematical_modeling pathway_commons is a resource permitting simultaneous queries of multiple pathway_databases however there is no standard mechanism for using these data stored in biopax format to annotate and build quantitative mathematical_models therefore we developed a new module within the virtual cell modeling and simulation software it provides pathway data_retrieval and visualization and enables automatic creation of executable network models directly from qualitative connections between pathway nodes availability_and available at virtual cell http vcell org application runs on all major platforms and does not require registration for use on the users computer tutorials and video are available at user guide page the pathway_commons collection of databases provides access to interactions among physical entities the data are retrieved in the form of biological_pathway exchange biopax that can be converted to the systems_biology sbml the gold_standard for exchanging mathematical_models and the native standard for the biomodels model database however while converting to sbml the wealth of information in annotations is often lost because the semantics of general biological_knowledge differs from that of mathematical_models here we describe a tool that allows users to access the rich trove of pathway data available through pathway_commons and use it to build well annotated mathematical_models it was implemented in the virtual cell vcell modeling and simulation framework a platform designed for building and simulating compartmental and spatial models and analysis of simulation_results the vcell database contains user models of which are public however most of these models were created ad_hoc using multiple iterations in doing so users rarely used detailed names to identify variables and functions in the mathematical_model but most often used simplified abbreviations like r atp or even arbitrary symbols such as s p and so forth as a result in the absence of extensive accompanying documentation a model is often difficult or even impossible to understand by anyone except for the model author s as models increase in complexity sharing and reusing models and components become a necessity and creating a well annotated model is essential for this purpose minimal information required in the annotation of models miriam community standard was developed lenov re et_al our software facilitates this by linking every model element to extensive documentation coming from pathway_databases helping researchers to produce models that are easier to understand and shared with the community the tool stores connectivity_information derived from pathway interactions and can convert it into a reaction_network in vcell which can then be populated with rate_constants and initial_concentrations to generate kinetic simulations which is a useful feature for researchers learning how to model online tutorials describe simple ways to create a simulation ready qualitative model of a complete pathway we also expect the tool to be appealing to bioinformaticians as a browser and editor for data in pathway_commons we hope that the ease of creating computational_models to use pathway data can bring together researchers doing mathematical_modeling biologists working with pathway data and bioinformaticians querying and visualizing it
