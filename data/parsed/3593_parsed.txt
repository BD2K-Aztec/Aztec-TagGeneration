gene_expression plrs a flexible tool for the joint analysis of dna_copy and mrna_expression data dna_copy and mrna_expression are commonly used data types in cancer studies available software for integrative_analysis arbitrarily fixes the parametric form of the association between the two molecular levels and hence offers no opportunities for modelling it we present a new tool for flexible modelling of this association plrs uses a wide class of interpretable models including popular ones and incorporates prior_biological it is capable to identify the gene specific type of relationship between gene_copy and mrna_expression moreover it tests the strength of the association and provides confidence_intervals we illustrate plrs using glioblastoma data from the cancer_genome availability_and plrs is implemented as an r package and available from bioconductor as of version http bioconductor org additional code for parallel computations is available as supplementary_material dna_copy are characteristics of the cancer cell these aberrations are gains_and of chromosomal_dna which may alter expression levels of mrna_transcripts the identification of genes for which an abnormal copy_number affects gene_expression is important in cancer studies as these genes are likely to be relevant for tumourigenesis here we present a new tool for exploratory and confirmatory analysis of such effects for a given gene copy_number and mrna_expression are generally believed to be concordant the exact form of the association is usually not established in fact the shape is likely to differ between genes because of the presence of different post_transcriptional regulatory_mechanisms tools that investigate the interaction between the two molecular levels assist in better understanding of regulatory_mechanisms numerous software_packages have been proposed for joint analysis of copy_number and gene_expression data however most of these fix the association between dna and rna a priori typically a linear or piecewise_constant line hence these approaches do not permit investigation or identification of the shape of the association recently the need for more subtle models has been highlighted to reflect the biological_mechanisms between the two molecular levels here we describe the r package plrs that implements the framework recently_proposed by leday et_al plrs uses piecewise linear_regression splines which allow multiple linear lines and are a wide class of interpretable models including the linear and piecewise_constant ones it enforces concordance by restricting relevant model_parameters in addition plrs tests the strength of the overall association identifies its functional shape and provides confidence_intervals for the estimated curve we illustrate plrs using a dataset from glioblastoma samples obtained from the cancer_genome tcga we applied plrs to a dataset of glioblastoma tumour_samples obtained from tcga http cancergenome nih gov for which copy_number agilent cgh microarray a and mrna_expression agilent k platform were available we found that for many known cancer_genes the expression_level is strongly associated with dna aberrations cf supplementary_material depicts the dnamrna association for four genes including known cancer_genes met ercc and agap clearly relationships are different and demonstrate that the flexibility of the plrs model allows new insights in the association for gene met we observe that the effect of amplifications extends that of gains more than proportionally for ercc the expression_level of samples with loss and normal copy_number differs in average and expression increases linearly with dosage amplifications of gene agap have a strong effect on mrna_expression whereas gains have none the effect as defined by plrs is broad and expressed by both an intercept and a slope for each copy_number aberration state the variety of models resulting from plrs contrasts with most other methods which impose a unique parametric form to all genes our method lets the data decide what is most appropriate as a consequence plrs has more power than other standard methods for detecting relatively large effects occurring in small subgroups of samples note that other non linear techniques e g based on mutual_information can be competitive but less interpretable plrs is a tool for flexible modelling of the association between dna_copy and mrna_expression we demonstrated its potential to reveal interesting relationships it is particularly useful for i a detailed understanding of the relationship between dna_copy and mrna_expression and ii powerful detection of copy_number induced sample subgroup specific effects thereby acknowledging heterogeneity of many cancers the software can also be used for studying the effect of dna_copy on microrna expression
