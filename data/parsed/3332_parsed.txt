databases_and oncomirdb a database for the experimentally_verified oncogenic and tumor_suppressive micrornas micrornas mirnas a class of small_regulatory play_important in cancer_initiation progression and therapy mirnas are found to regulate diverse cancer related processes by targeting a large set of oncogenic and tumor_suppressive genes to establish a high_confidence reference resource for studying the mirna regulated target_genes and cellular_processes in cancer we manually_curated entries of cancer related mirna regulations with direct experimental_evidence from abstracts covering more than mirnas and target_genes across cancer tissues a web_based portal named oncomirdb which provides both graphical and text_based interfaces was developed for easily browsing and searching all the annotations it should be a useful resource for both the computational_analysis and experimental study on mirna_regulatory and functions in cancer micrornas mirnas are a class of nt endogenous small_regulatory which can repress the expressions and or translations of hundreds of target_genes by binding to the utrs of target_gene mrna_transcripts till now there are more than human mirnas collected in the latest mirbase database release more than half of the protein_coding are potentially regulated by one or multiple_mirnas according to the genome_wide computational predictions and high_throughput experimental screens extensive evidence shows that mirnas play_important in nearly all essential_cellular such as cell_proliferation migration differentiation apoptosis and senescence cancer which is one of the leading causes of death worldwide involves significant changes of chromatin structures and molecular regulatory_networks as their impacts on mrna_stability and translation efficiency are extensive mirnas are found to regulate different hallmarks of cancer by targeting a large set of oncogenic and tumor_suppressive genes these mirnas are usually called onco mirnas oncomirs esquela kerscher and slack to facilitate the study on mirna functions and regulatory_networks in cancer there is a great need to establish a reference_database for annotating the oncomirs regulating different cellular_processes and target_genes in different types of cancers there are a few existing databases aiming at annotating the cancerrelated mirnas such as mircancer phenomir mir disease hmdd and somamir but they mainly collect the differentially_expressed or the mirna associated genetic_mutations in cancer without direct functional evidence mir disease and hmdd include some experimentally_verified entries but the number of entries is relatively small according to the pubmed records as of march there are publications studying the cancer related_mirnas this literature provides extensive information for the oncomir functions and target_genes we manually reviewed the abstracts and curated entries of experimentally_verified oncomirs which either regulate one or more cancer related cellular_processes or directly target at least one gene in cancer related processes the mirna expression_patterns their upstream_regulators and the corresponding experimental_conditions are also collected from the abstracts then we developed a web_based portal oncomirdb for storing and displaying all the curated_data entries with the graphical and text_based interfaces users can easily browse and search all the entries for the oncomirs related to different cancer_types different regulated cellular_processes or different target_genes oncomirdb should be a valuable resource for both the computational_analysis and the experimental study of mirna functions and regulatory_networks in cancer
