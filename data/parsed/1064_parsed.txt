genome_analysis comparative_studies of de_novo tools for next_generation motivation several new de_novo tools have been developed recently to assemble short_sequencing generated by next_generation however the performance of these tools under various conditions has not been fully_investigated and sufficient information is not currently available for informed decisions to be made regarding the tool that would be most likely to produce the best performance under a specific set of conditions results we studied and compared the performance of commonly used de_novo tools specifically_designed for next_generation data including ssake vcake euler sr edena velvet abyss and soapdenovo tools were compared using several performance_criteria including n length sequence_coverage and assembly accuracy various properties of read data including single_end paired_end sequence gc_content depth of coverage and base_calling error_rates were investigated for their effects on the performance of different assembly tools we also compared the computation time and memory_usage of these seven tools based on the results of our comparison the relative performance of individual tools are summarized and tentative guidelines for optimal selection of different assembly tools under different conditions are provided recently_developed next_generation such as the roche gs flx system illumina_genome and hiseq system and abi solid system have revolutionized the field of biology and medical_research compared to traditional_sanger technology these new sequencing_platforms generate data much faster and produce much higher sequencing output while decreasing costs by more than a thousand fold shendure to whom correspondence should be addressed and the ability to rapidly generate enormous numbers of sequence_reads at markedly_reduced prices has greatly extended the scope of economically_feasible sequencing_projects the prospect of sequencing the entire_human for a large number of samples has become a reality these new sequencing_technologies also pose tremendous challenges to traditional de_novo tools designed for sanger_sequencing as they are incapable of handling the millions to billions of short_reads bp each generated by next_generation therefore several novel de_novo tools have been developed such as ssake vcake sharcgs euler sr edena velvet celera wgaassembler abyss and soapdenovo with the recent introduction of multiple de_novo tools it has become necessary to systematically analyze their relative performance under various conditions so that researchers can select a tool that would produce optimal results according to the read properties and their specific requirements recently compared the performance of several of these tools for assembling sequences of different species although they evaluated multiple_criteria such as runtime ram usage n and assembly accuracy their results were based on simulation reads using only a single depth of coverage and a single base call error_rate further investigation is necessary to determine_whether and how these assembly tools are differentially affected by varying depths of coverage sequencing_errors read_lengths and extent of gc_content of the sequence_reads furthermore the assembly performance of soapdenovo v has dramatically improved for long_read assembly consequently sufficient information is not currently available for informed decisions to be made regarding the tool that would be most likely to produce the best results based on variations in the practical conditions identified above accordingly in this study we systematically studied and compared the performance of seven commonly used de_novo tools for next_generation using a number of metrics including n length a standard measure of assembly connectivity to be more specifically defined later sequence_coverage assembly accuracy computation time and computer memory requirement and usage to imitate different
