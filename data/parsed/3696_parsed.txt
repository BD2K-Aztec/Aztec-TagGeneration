sequence_analysis primerprospector de_novo design and taxonomic_analysis of barcoded polymerase_chain primers motivation pcr_amplification of dna is a key preliminary step in many applications of high_throughput yet design of novel barcoded primers and taxonomic_analysis of novel or existing primers remains_a results primerprospector is an open_source software_package that allows researchers to develop new primers from collections of sequences and to evaluate existing primers in the context of taxonomic data availability primerprospector is open_source available atusing next_generation methods to characterize hundreds of samples simultaneously in a single sequencing run has revolutionized microbial_ecology however primer_design for such studies remains_challenging the primers must amplify an appropriate region of dna that is the right length for sequencing and also taxonomically informative a linker that is not complementary to the target in any one of many diverse_species must be inserted before the barcode to avoid differential amplification and the set of barcodes must be checked to avoid formation of secondary_structure within or between primers i e primerdimers or between the barcodes and the primers additionally the techniques need to be generic rather than tied to one taxonomic outline or database so that many different target_genes can be studied here we present primerprospector an open_source software_package for primer_design and analysis built using the pycogent toolkit that resolves these issues we recently to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as applied primerprospector to identify the s rrna f r primer_pair as nearly universal to archaea and bacteria and to optimize this primer_pair for increased sensitivity across these domains this optimized primer_pair applied successfully in several recent_studies manuscript in preparation has provided novel insight into archaeal and bacterial_community membership in soils by allowing for more accurate determination of the abundances of taxa missed by many commonly used canonical primer_pairs e g the verrucomicrobia no existing_tools specifically address the issues associated with designing barcoded polymerase_chain pcr_primers for community analysis primer_design is a large field and we cannot survey it comprehensively in this article but among a selection of related tools primer validator http bioinfo unice fr allows taxonomic assessment but does not generate de_novo primers or allow a customizable weighted scoring system to predict successful amplification of tested primers barcrawl allows design of barcodes for specified pcr_primers but not design of the primers themselves so is a useful complement to primerprospector rdps probe match will report sequences matching a probe as does greengenes probe function but these tools are tied to the respective s rrna databases and do not have support for barcodes primrose and oligocheck are useful for small numbers of target_sequences but do not scale well to thousands or tens_of of sequences as is necessary when designing universal or near universal_primers and do not incorporate differential weighting of and bases in primer scoring primer blast uses primer software to build primers of a specified length against one target_sequence and then blasts the results against other databases to ensure that putative primers do not target blast hits this functionality is also a useful complement to that provided in primerprospector while applications of primerprospector to date have focused on ssu_rrna primer_design primerprospector can be used for any nucleic_acid and allows users to design de_novo primers based upon arbitrary multiple_sequence user specifiable design_parameters include primer length degeneracy and targeted_regions for generation of primers existing or de_novo primers can be analyzed for predicted taxonomic coverage as shown in finally common pitfalls in primer_design can be identified such as likely barcode primer secondary_structure regions susceptible tocoverage summary of the f r s ssu_rrna primer_pair at the phylum level for a archaea b eukarya and c bacteria the y axes represent percent coverage and the value on top of each bar is the total number of reference_sequences in each taxon in this analysis the reference_sequences were derived from the silva database and filtered at sequence_identity with uclust archaeal and bacterial sequences shorter than bases and eukaryotic sequences less that bases were excluded from the reference_set as illustrated this primer_pair is nearly universal for archaeal and bacterial s but is generally poor for eukaryotic notably metazoan s sequences this plot and additional primerprospector analyses informed the decision to use this primer_pair inand g comparisons with the unoptimized primer_pair and with an alternative popular pair f r are shown as supplementary figures s and s respectively primer dimerization and disparate gc_content between primer_pairs convenient reports show amplicons or simulated reads that cover regions of sequences that are not phylogenetically informative or are of unsuitable lengths for sequencing
