genome_analysis vega variational segmentation for copy_number detection motivation genomic copy_number cn information is useful to study genetic_traits of many diseases using array_comparative acgh researchers are able to measure the copy_number of thousands of dna_loci at the same time therefore a current challenge in bioinformatics is the development of efficient algorithms to detect the map of aberrant chromosomal_regions methods we describe an approach for the segmentation of copy_number acgh data variational estimator for genomic_aberrations vega adopt a variational model used in image_segmentation the optimal segmentation is modeled as the minimum of an energy functional encompassing both the quality of interpolation of the data and the complexity of the solution measured by the length of the boundaries between segmented regions this solution is obtained by a region_growing process where the stop condition is completely data_driven results vega is compared with three algorithms that represent the state of the art in cn segmentation performance assessment is made both on synthetic and real_data synthetic data simulate different noise_conditions results on these data show the robustness with respect to noise of variational models and the accuracy of vega in terms of recall and precision eight mantle_cell cell_lines and two samples of glioblastoma_multiforme are used to evaluate the behavior of vega on real_biological comparison between results and current biological_knowledge shows the ability of the proposed method in detecting known chromosomal_aberrations recent biological studies show the close relationship between chromosomal_regions aberrant in copy_number cn and diseases like tumor and mental_retardation high_resolution cn estimation makes use of comparative_genomic arrays dna from a test sample and normal reference_sample are labeled differentially using different fluorophores and hybridized to several thousand probes the ratio of the fluorescence_intensity of the test to that of the reference dna is then calculated to measure the cn changes for a particular location in the genome in particular the logr ratio llr gives an indirect measure of cn of each probe by plotting the ratio of observed to expected hybridization intensity after a microarray has been constructed and hybridized the corresponding image can be acquired and additional analysis steps can be used both to reduce noise and to increase the statistical confidence of the observations generally each probe is spotted in several copies the output of this process is a list of lrr values with the respective genomic positions the so_called segmentation_algorithms use this list of measurements to compute the features breakpoint positions and kind of mutation of the aberrant regions along the genome the availability of efficient segmentation_algorithms plays an important role in the mapping of aberrant chromosomal_regions accurate aberration mapping can be used to extract new insight on the mechanisms leading to genetic_diseases for this reason in literature several segmentation approaches have been proposed in likelihood_function based_approaches breakpoint positions are estimated by using a maximum_likelihood criterion in which penalty terms are used to limit the complexity of the solution often penalty terms are controlled by weights which can be chosen adaptively to the data an interesting likelihood_function based_approach is dnacopy which is based on a modification of the original binary segmentation proposed by dnacopy segments the chromosome into contiguous regions of equal cn using a non parametric permutation reference distribution which takes in account the effect of noise in particular the authors model cn data as a sequence of random_variables and the maximum_likelihood is used recursively to look for change_points where adjacent random_variables have a different distribution function in addition dnacopy uses a pruning algorithm to control the number of regions willenbrock and fridlyand andshowed that dnacopy algorithm performs well in terms of sensitivity and false_discovery both on synthetic and real_data other statistical_models frequently used for cn segmentation are bayesian approaches and hidden_markov in the bayesian_framework the prior distributions are combined with some posterior_distribution functions to construct the most plausible hypothesis concerning the data segmentation in hidden_markov based_approaches hidden_states represent the underlying cn of probes in fridlyand et_al page in order to evaluate the performance of our approach we use both synthetic and real_data we compare our results with the ones obtained by dnacopy ultrasome and smap
