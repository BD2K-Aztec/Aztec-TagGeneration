gene_expression epigenetic priors for identifying active transcription_factor motivation accurate_knowledge of the genome_wide binding of transcription_factors in a particular cell_type or under a particular condition is necessary for understanding transcriptional_regulation using epigenetic data such as histone_modification and dnase_i accessibility data has been shown to improve motif based in silico methods for predicting such binding but this approach has not yet been fully explored results we describe a probabilistic_method for combining one or more tracks of epigenetic data with a standard dna sequence_motif model to improve our ability to identify active transcription_factor tfbss we convert each data type into a position specific probabilistic prior and combine these priors with a traditional probabilistic motif model to compute a log posterior odds score our experiments using histone_modifications h_k h_k h k ac and h k ac as well as dnase_i sensitivity show conclusively that the log posterior odds score consistently outperforms a simple binary filter_based on the same data we also show that our approach performs competitively with a more complex method centipede and suggest that the relative simplicity of the log posterior odds scoring_method makes it an appealing and very general method for identifying_functional tfbss on the basis of dna and epigenetic evidence availability_and fimo part of the meme suite software toolkit now supports log posterior odds scoring using position specific priors for motif search a web_server and source_code are available at http meme nbcr net utilities for creating priors are at http research binding of transcription_factors tfs to dna is a key_step in the regulation of gene_expression strongly influencing the activation or repression of genes however accurately locating transcription_factor tfbss in eukaryotic_genomes containing to whom correspondence should be addressed gigabases of dna is challenging because a typical tf binds to relatively short bp dna_sequences that occur at many places throughout the genome only a small portion of which are actively involved in gene_regulation in any particular cell_type in vivo several molecular_mechanisms limit the binding of tfs to a small fraction of the potential sites perhaps most significantly local chromatin_structure arising from the packaging of dna histones and other proteins occludes access of the tf to many genomic_loci some aspects of this structure notably numerous types of post_translational covalent_modifications such as acetylation methylation phosphorylation ubiquitination ribosylation glycosylation and sumoylationaffect tf_binding in a complex fashion that is not yet completely_understood empirically however numerous studies have shown that tf_binding is associated with several types of histone_marks e g mono and tri methylation of histone h lysine and with hypersensitivity to cleavage by dnase_i in light of these observations a variety of computational_methods have been proposed that aim to improve our ability to identify active tfbss on the basis of the dna_sequence plus one or more epigenetic experimental assays perhaps the simplest such approach scans for occurrences of a specified dna_motif but deterministically filters out some positions on the basis of the raw signal from a histone_modification chip_seq assay this type of filter greatly_improves the accuracy of tfbs_prediction several other integrative methods have been proposed for combining dna motifs with chromatin data among these methods the one most directly comparable to the one proposed here is centipede which employs a hierarchical bayesian mixture_model that incorporates information about the dna_sequence evolutionary_conservation distance to the transcription_start dnase_i accessibility and activating and repressing histone_marks in this work we propose a probabilistic_method for combining one more more tracks of epigenetic data with a standard dna sequence_motif model to improve our ability to identify active tfbss our work thus makes two primary methodological contributions first we describe a heuristic procedure for converting each data type into a probabilistic prior the approach itself is novel though it is motivated by similar methods introduced in the context ofpage
