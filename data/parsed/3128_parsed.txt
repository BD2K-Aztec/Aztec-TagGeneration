systems_biology msstats an r package for statistical_analysis of quantitative mass_spectrometry based proteomic experiments msstats is an r package for statistical relative quantification of proteins and peptides in mass_spectrometry version of msstats supports label_free and label based experimental workflows and data dependent targeted and data independent spectral acquisition it takes as input identified and quantified spectral peaks and outputs a list of differentially_abundant peptides or proteins or summaries of peptide or protein relative_abundance msstats relies on a flexible family of linear_mixed availability_and the code the documentation and example datasets are available open_source at www msstats org under the artistic license the package can be downloaded from www msstats org or from bioconductor www bioconductor org and used in an r command_line workflow the package can also be accessed as an external tool in skyline broudy et_al and used via graphical_user quantitative mass_spectrometry is a technology of growing importance in biological and clinical research modern proteomic workflows are complex and diverse and a statistical_approach is required to reduce bias and inefficiencies distinguish the systematic_variation from random artifacts and maximize the reproducibility of the results k all and vitek although some of these goals can be achieved with standard statistical_methods or with methods developed for other technologies such as gene_expression this is typically insufficient specialized methods and software are needed to characterize the stochastic properties of the data in a way that reflects the details of sample_preparation and spectral acquisition and to implement the statistical_analysis workflows in a way that is useful for both experimentalists and statisticians msstats is an open_source r based package that provides such statistical functionalities for relative quantification of proteins and peptides using a flexible family of linear_mixed for some special cases the methods and the implementation were previously described here we present msstats a package that integrates the methodology across several mass_spectrometric workflows and data_acquisition strategies contains new functionalities for model based analyses provides example datasets enables interoperability with the existing popular computational_tools and facilitates their use by both statistical and proteomic communities
