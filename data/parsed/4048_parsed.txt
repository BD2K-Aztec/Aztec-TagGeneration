rnasurface fast and accurate detection of locally optimal potentially structured rna_segments motivation during the past_decade new classes of non_coding ncrnas and their unexpected functions were discovered stable secondary_structure is the key feature of many non_coding taking_into huge_amounts of genomic_data development of computational_methods to survey genomes for structured rnas remains an actual problem especially when homologous_sequences are not available for comparative_analysis existing programs scan gen omes with a fixed window by efficiently constructing a matrix of rna minimum free_energies a wide_range of lengths of structured rnas necessitates the use of many different window lengths that substantially increases the output size and computational efforts results in this article we present an algorithm rnasurface to efficiently scan genomes by constructing a matrix of significance of rna_secondary and to identify all locally optimal structured rna_segments up to a predefined size rnasurface significantly_improves precision of identification of known ncrna in bacillus_subtilis availability_and rnasurface c source_code is available fromrnas perform diverse enzymatic regulatory and structural functions in living_cells and are involved in nearly all housekeeping cellular_processes numerous new classes of non coding and regulatory_rnas were discovered during past_decades for example micrornas regulate_gene through post transcriptional_repression of messenger_rna other prominent examples_include the rna role in translation messenger_rna localization alternative_splicing epigenetic states virus_replication and so forth moreover according to recent_studies of the human_genome up to of the genome may be transcribed and a substantial fraction of transcripts may represent functional non_coding biological_function of the majority of functional rnas crucially depends on its tertiary_structure rna_molecules fold hierarchically and sequentially therefore the tertiary_structure is largely determined by the secondary_structure scaffold for example riboswitches regulate_gene by switching between two specific secondary_structures there exist numerous methods to predict secondary_structure computationally for a review see among which free_energy based on nearest_neighbor thermodynamic_parameters is the most prevalent approach generally rna_sequences have numerous suboptimal structures which have energies close to the optimal one in addition to this inaccuracies of the energy parameters base modifications and dependence on cell conditions yield a moderate_quality of the structure_prediction by energy_minimization with the average sensitivity of and selectivity of however the optimal energy could be a good measure to define propensity of a sequence to fold in a stable structure the minimum_free mfe of functional rnas can be distinguished from that of random_sequences on the other hand there exist rna regions actively bound by protein factors relatively low mfe due to selection against formation of stable secondary_structure may represent a signal of an accessible site structural potential of an rna_sequence reflects significance of its secondary_structure mfe next_generation produce vast_amounts of genomic_data hence identification in genomes of segments with unusual structural potential is of special interest this problem has two sides to efficiently scan genomes and to assess significance of output hits there are several programs that efficiently scan genomes rnall and rnaslider use a window based_approach to calculate the mfe and structure of each local sequence of a predefined size rnalfold slightly diminishes the output size by considering only structures with paired first and last nucleotides so_called closed structures these programs focus on efficient computing and ignore significance of output hits the only discriminator in these programs is mfe however mfe strongly depends on the length and dinucleotide composition of a sequence comprehensive comparison of rna_structure scores shows that to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com z_score can be used as a suitable measure of the structural potential the z_score of a sequence is calculated aswhere e is the mfe of a biological sequence and are the average and standard_deviation of the energy_distribution of shuffled sequences with preserved length and average dinucleotide composition there also exists a less common approach which uses uniqueness of secondary_structure instead of thermodynamic_stability to assess its significance an early attempt to detect significant structures was based on a monte_carlo this approach becomes impractical for sequences of moderate several thousand of nucleotides size further studies introduced look up tables to eliminate bias of nucleotide_composition combined with regression on sequence_length or the notion of asymptotic z_score the current stateof the art program rnalfoldz extends rnalfold by calculating z_score using svr to our knowledge the implementation of rnalfoldz is now embedded in rnalfold approaches that analyze rna_segments of a fixed size suffer from an inability to detect structured elements of varying sizes whereas functional rnas fall into a wide_range of sizes here we circumvent this limitation to that end we define the surface of the structural potential as the surface of z scores for all genome subsequences shorter than a predefined size visualizes this concept the line at the bottom represents a segment of the genome each point on the heatmap represents a subsequence and color represents structural potential of this subsequence from highly_structured dark blue to highly nonstructured dark red we introduce the program rnasurface that efficiently reconstructs the surface of structural potential using a new fast algorithm for z_score evaluation this approach introduces an intuitively clear definition of locally optimal segments as peaks in the surface of structural potential besides identification of structured regions the surface usage allows one to identify structured domains comprising the region we apply our method to the genome of bacillus_subtilis and identify genome_regions with high structural potential a highly_accurate determination of structured intervals or regions of accessibility is useful for several purposes preprocessing during de_novo search for regulatory and noncoding_rnas accurate definition of ncrna boundaries and correlation of genome_scale structural potential with other genomic_features gene boundaries ribosome_profiling transcriptome_data binding_sites of protein factors etc we analyzed the genome of b subtilis to benchmark the programs and to study regions of structure accumulation this gram_positive has numerous cis_acting regulatory_rnas and small_rnas in addition widespread rho independent transcription_termination and non random prevalence of stem loops structures make b subtilis an object of specific research interest
