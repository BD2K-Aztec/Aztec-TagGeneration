systems_biology carpools an r package for exploratory_data and documentation of pooled crispr_cas screens motivation genetic_screens by crispr_cas mediated genome_engineering have become a powerful_tool for functional_genomics however there is currently a lack of end_to software pipelines to analyze crispr_cas screens based on next_generation results the crispr analyzer for pooled screens carpools is an r package for exploratory_data that provides a complete workflow to analyze crispr_cas screens to further support the analysis of large_scale screens carpools integrates screening documentation and generation of standardized analysis reports availability_and carpools manuals and an open virtual appliance are available atcrispr cas mediated genome_engineering can be leveraged for high_throughput functional genomic screens in vertebrate cells for such screens cas expressing_cells are infected with lentiviral short guide sg rna libraries after phenotypic selection sgrna sequences serve as barcodes to identify enriched or depleted mutant clones by next_generation ngs inter experimental variations in sequencing quality and depth variable sgrna coverage per gene on target efficiency and off target effects represent challenges for analysis and hit identification the software_package crispr analyzer for pooled screens carpools performs exploratory_data of crispr_cas screens combined with detailed screening documentation to enable reproducibility of analyses workflows
