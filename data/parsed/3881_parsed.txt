rapid similarity_search of proteins using alignments of domain arrangements motivation homology search_methods are dominated by the central paradigm that sequence_similarity is a proxy for common_ancestry and by extension functional_similarity for determining sequence_similarity in proteins most widely used methods use models of sequence_evolution and compare amino_acid strings in search for conserved linear stretches probabilistic_models or sequence_profiles capture the position specific variation in an alignment of homologous_sequences and can identify conserved_motifs or domains while profile_based search_methods are generally more accurate than simple sequence comparison methods they tend to be computationally more demanding in recent_years several methods have emerged that perform protein similarity_searches based on domain_composition however few methods have considered the linear arrangements of domains when conducting similarity_searches despite strong evidence that domain order can harbour considerable functional and evolutionary signal results here we introduce an alignment scheme that uses a classical dynamic_programming to the global_alignment of domains we illustrate that representing proteins as strings of domains domain arrangements and comparing these strings globally allows for a both fast and sensitive homology_search further we demonstrate that the presented methods complement existing_methods by finding similar proteins missed by popular amino acidbased comparison methods availability an implementation of the presented algorithms a web_based interface as well as a command_line program for batch searching against the uniprot database can be found at http rads uni muenster de furthermore we provide a java api for program matic access to domain stringbased search_methods accurate identification of sequence_similarity is a crucial and integral part of modern biological analysis sequence_similarity is often used to infer functional_similarity when comparing an unknown protein_sequence to a set of well described sequences and can be the result of conservation or convergent_evolution homologous_sequences are often identified by comparing a query_sequence with a large collection of sequences subjects in public_databases in such comparisons a pairwise_alignment attempts to match the homologous characters nucleotides or amino_acid of query and subject sequences according to an evolutionary model pairwise_alignments can be evaluated in terms of similarity or distance scores furthermore the probability to obtain an identical or better score by chance alone is computed and a threshold is chosen to accept or reject potential homology given an underlying evolutionary model calculating the optimal pairwise_alignment is possible but computationally_demanding therefore many similarity_searches use heuristic approaches shows an overview of the main methods used for sequence homology_search local alignment_algorithms such as blast focus on conserved_regions only and hence do not enforce an alignment of entire sequences this approach has advantages in finding homology first homologous_proteins can have regions that are not similar for example if these regions have not been under selectional constraints or are fast evolving second proteins often have regions of local_similarity which correspond to protein_domains finally heuristics are much faster because only stretches of local similarities are considered however using local_alignments also bears drawbacks the most obvious drawback is that multi_domain that share one domain may exhibit a high degree of local_similarity which can mask an overall low degree of global similarity ergo applying a local_alignment approach for finding functional homologs may be misleading in contrast global similarity suffers the opposite extreme remote_homologs of a query can be missed owing to the low amount of global sequence_similarity to address these problems the proteins domain_composition or domain arrangement i e the n to c terminal order of domains can be taken into account protein_domains are the units of protein_structure function and evolution to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as zpresent address architecture et

grosshaderner str planegg martinsried germany for a review tools that consider domains to find functionally_similar or even homologous proteins do exist for example cdart measures similarity by considering the number of domains shared between two proteins cdart does not consider the order of domains the number of repeats or the non shared domains when determining similar proteins in essence cdart treats proteins as a bag of domains several approaches have been developed that attempt to circumvent the problems with local_similarity which modern search and alignment_algorithms face defined local sequence similarity_scores with the analysis of a local neighbour similarity network into a neighbourhood correlation score thus extending the local similarity_score to include a global perspective defined a similarity measure between proteins as the weighted_average of three similarity_scores which consider the number of shared domains and the number of domains that are specific for one protein domain duplications and the local order of domains incidence of ordered domain pairs a similar approach is used by dahunter and wdac which also incorporates domain versatility and domain frequency into the search for similar domain arrangements bjorklunddefined the domain distance a protein distance measure based on the number of domains that are not matched between two proteins in essence the domain distance is an edit_distance as it measures the number of edit operations domain additions or deletions needed to move from one arrangement to another in addition to similarity_search domain based_approaches have been also used for protein clustering e g the domainteams tool for example analyses domainwise local similarities microsyntenies on bacterial chromosomes irrespective of gene boundaries by using microsyntenies domainteams is able to detect clusters of orthologous_genes even if domain arrangements are variable several approaches demonstrated that domain content can be used to reconstruct phylogenies furthermore beyond domain content the order of domains in a protein can help elucidate functional and structural constraints while aforementioned domain based_algorithms are promising to date none takes_advantage of such a context based analysis i e the knowledge that the linear_combinations of domains bear a strong phylogenetic and functional signal here we present two algorithms for finding homologous_proteins that exploit this signal of conserved domain arrangements the first algorithm rads rapid alignment of domain strings represents proteins as domain arrangements and does not require any sequence_information the similarity between two proteins is determined by aligning the proteins domain arrangements to each other using a dynamic_programming a key_advantage to this approach is the reduction in time complexitywhile proteins in uniprot contain on average amino_acids they harbour an average of only domains for multi domain arrangements making the number of required comparisons considerably smaller further by only considering proteins that share at least one common domain the search_space can be drastically_reduced while abandoning the information contained within the sequences does come at the cost of sensitivity it is well established that domains are the units of protein evolution and are a good proxy for sequence_similarity the need for increased sensitivity rampage creates global alignments of amino_acid using the domainwise alignments provided by rads as guideline similar to previously described approaches such as the segment based_approach applied in dialign t we demonstrate that methods searching for domain arrangements yield biologically_meaningful which are often complementary to sequence_based and at the same time work at a speed that is significantly_faster than local_alignment tools it has been shown that proteins with identical multi domain arrangements have similar function in of all cases whereas of multi_domain sharing only one domain are functional homologs we therefore consider the rads approach to identify all identical arrangements to a given query as a fast and valuable step in determining protein similarity across large_datasets for single_domain and proteins that lack domain annotation however sequence based_algorithms provide more relevant results as they are able to identify local similarities which are crucial in distinguishing close homologs rampage alleviates this problem and perform with similar sensitivity but significantly_faster than blast supplementary_material s we propose that rads is complementary to sequence_similarity based_approaches and that exploiting domain arrangements for similarity_search is in particular for multi_domain an important means for identifying_functional homologs although rads explicitly disregards sequence_information at the alignment stage the comparison of domains is nonetheless driven by sequence_information as multiple_sequence are used to construct the profile indeed such sequence_profiles are sensitive as they in essence describe the variation at the sequence level of a large set of related proteins this is particularly valuable when dealing with the increasing amount of available sequence_data as the ability to use the strong discrimination power of hidden_markov hmms or other profilebased methods can be used to initially reduce search_space the sensitivity of rads rampage is theoretically comparable with profile_based searches such as psi_blast yet a sensitive similarity_search can be achieved without compromising the actual search time because the computationally heavy stage is shifted to protein annotation however recent advancements in the hmmer package have made on the fly annotation of protein_domains feasible such that a rads search is swift even for raw sequence queries several published approaches use domain_composition or arrangements for homology detection nonetheless rads rampage will be a valuable resource for the communityfor several reasons first cdart does not rank results based on domain arrangement similarity rather it provides the user with the number of shared domains without taking any additional domain or sequence_information into account moreover because cdart uses custom defined domain definitions results are difficult to compare with more widespread domain definitions such as pfam second the domain distance introduced by bjorklundprovides a simple but efficient metric for describing the dissimilarity of domain arrangements which is defined as the number of domains that remain unaligned in a global_alignment of domain arrangements recently_published an analogous approach where domain arrangement similarity is expressed as the number of aligned domains to the best of our knowledge neither of these metrics has been implemented in a publicly_available resource third in the most recently described method which includes a web_interface the authors proposed a complex measure based on information_theory that combines the domain_composition similarity with ordered pairs and domain duplications however the method is kingdom dependent eukaryota bacteria archea limiting the possibility of large_scale cross kingdom comparisons furthermore the scoring system as implemented has not been tested on large_datasets and we were unable to reproduce the results provided by the web_interface which only reports the most similar arrangements and seems to be outdated fourth we find that rads rampage perform significantly_faster than all other methods tested in this study supplementary_material s finally we provide a set of implementations to meet the needs of various groups we provide a fast c based command_line application for running custom domain string comparisons a web_interface for querying uniprot with pfam and a command_line java_application for querying the web_interface in batch mode which can also be used example results of a combined rads blast_search in enzyme_family of phosphomannomutases illustrating the differences between the two algorithms left comparison between the original query a vp myctu and a protein with the same domain arrangement c txy schja a putative phosphoglucomutase and high rads score that is not detected by blast at an e value of right comparison with a significant e value blast hit c z c strsw with little agreement with the query in domain arrangement as a java_library for programmatic_access furthermore we have integrated the rads rampage search into a guibased tool termed domosaics which is available for download from http domosaics uni muenster de in summary the complementary approaches rads and rampage and their implementations allow for fast similarity_searches using domain arrangement comparisons the web_service provides a fine_grained arrangement scoring with useradjustable parameters and comparison with blast results can be ordered filtered by scores and or reduced to non redundant arrangements searches can be saved and downloaded and we are currently developing new filters to allow for taxon and species specific searches to ensure that the sequence database of the web_service remains current we are using pfamseq annotations and have developed routines to ensure that this resource is updated with each new pfam release given the large amount of sequence_data that has so much become an integral part of modern biological analysis and the increasing speed of profilebased annotation methods we believe that both rads and rampage will prove useful in identifying homology of interest and that it can help to put the available data to work in pursuing interesting and relevant questions in molecular_biology and evolution
