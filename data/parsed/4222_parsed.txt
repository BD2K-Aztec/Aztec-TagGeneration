sharpvisu integrated analysis and segmentation of super_resolution data we introduce sharpvisu an interactive open_source with a graphical_user which allows performing processing_steps for localization data in an integrated manner this includes common features and new tools such as correction of chromatic aberrations drift correction based on iterative cross_correlation calculations selection of localization events reconstruction of d and d datasets in different representations estimation of resolution by fourier ring correlation clustering analysis based on voronoi diagrams and ripleys functions sharpvisu is optimized to work with eventlist tables exported from most popular localization software we show applications of these on single and double labelled super_resolution data the first step in processing of stochastic super_resolution data the single_molecule localization recently became a routine operation and is often implemented by the manufacturer with the software operating the microscope however the further processing workflow of single molecule_localization smlm data is much less standardized coordinates of individual_molecules in space and time with their localization precisions are contained in a table of events obtained after fitting the gaussian like spots in the first step of the processing most available software for processing of single_molecule data such as rapidstorm quickpalm the localization microscopy plugin for mmanager rainstorm and are dedicated to fitting of camera images while few software such as palmsiever and visp el are designed for processing of localization tables the best way to analyze stochastic microscopy data is to work directly with eventlists for which the development of new specialized and integrated tools is required
