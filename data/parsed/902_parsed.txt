structural_bioinformatics cell dock high performance protein protein_docking the application of docking to large_scale experiments or the explicit treatment of protein_flexibility are part of the new challenges in structural_bioinformatics that will require large computer resources and more efficient algorithms highly optimized fast_fourier fft approaches are broadly used in docking programs but their optimal code implementation leaves hardware acceleration as the only option to significantly reduce the computational_cost of these tools in this work we present cell dock an fft based docking algorithm adapted to the cell be processor we show that cell dock runs faster than ftdock with maximum speedups of above while achieving results of similar quality availability_and the source_code is released under gnu_general version and can be downloaded fromcell functions rely on intricate networks of proteinprotein_interactions which need to be understood at structural and functional level given the magnitude of the human interactome experimental efforts will have to be complemented by computational_approaches such as proteinprotein_docking which aims to predict the structure of complexes from the free unbound subunits fast_fourier fft based docking approaches revolutionized the field but faster computer solutions are required in order to face some of the current docking challenges some of which have arisen from the recent critical assessment of prediction of interactions capri experiments such as protein_flexibility large_scale experiments or multi protein_docking given that fft implementations are highly optimized it is not likely to speed up this type of calculations by using only algorithm optimization techniques leaving hardware acceleration as the most feasible option to significantly reduce the computational_cost of these tools in this work we present cell dock to our knowledge the first protein_docking algorithm implemented on the cell be processor cell dock is a new fft based docking implementation for the cell be architecture showing similar prediction rates to ftdock with much more efficient performance this implementation can efficiently run on the widely accessible playstation opening the door to large_scale experiments that may benefit
