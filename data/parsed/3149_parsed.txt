gene_expression multilevel support_vector analysis to identify condition specific regulatory_networks motivation the identification of gene regulatory_modules is an important yet challenging_problem in computational_biology while many computational_methods have been proposed to identify regulatory_modules their initial success is largely compromised by a high rate of false_positives especially when applied to human cancer studies new strategies are needed for reliable regulatory module identification results we present a new approach namely multilevel support_vector ml svr to systematically identify condition specific regulatory_modules the approach is built upon a multilevel_analysis strategy designed for suppressing false_positive with this strategy a regulatory module becomes ever more significant as more relevant gene_sets are formed at finer levels at each level a two stage support_vector svr method is utilized to help reduce false_positive by integrating binding_motif information and gene_expression data a significant analysis procedure is followed to assess the significance of each regulatory module to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed_strategy we first compared the ml svr approach with other existing_methods on simulation_data and yeast_cell data the resulting performance shows that the ml svr approach outperforms other methods in the identification of both regulators and their target_genes we then applied our method to breast_cancer cell_line data to identify condition specific regulatory_modules associated with estrogen_treatment experimental_results show that our method can identify biologically_meaningful regulatory_modules related to estrogen_signaling and action in breast_cancer availability_and the ml svr matlab_package can be downloaded atidentifying regulatory_modules is one of the key_steps to understanding_the of biological_processes to whom correspondence should be addressed especially important for defining the deregulated pathways in cancer at the transcriptional level a regulatory module is defined as a set of genes controlled by one or several transcription_factors tfs in a condition specific_manner tfs can either activate or inhibit gene_expression usually by binding to short highly_conserved dna_sequences in the promoter or upstream region i e transcription_factor tfbs or binding_motif in higher_eukaryotes tfbss are often organized in clusters called cis_regulatory crms many computational_methods have been developed to facilitate the identification of crms from either gene_expression data or dna sequence_data expression based_methods take advantage of gene_expression data but lack of sequence binding constraints sequence_based module discovery algorithms such as cismodule creme and modulesearch analyze the promoter_regions of a set of coregulated genes to identify overrepresented motif combinations a major_limitation of sequence_based is that they do not consider the condition specific nature of regulatory_modules i e they ignore the relationship between binding_affinities and gene_expression levels a living_cell is a dynamic system in which gene activities and interactions exhibit temporal_patterns and spatial compartmentalization recently several studies have shown that binding of tfs not only depends on their affinity for the binding_sites but binding also occurs in a conditionspecific manner in response to various environmental changes thus a tf may play different regulatory_roles to its downstream_target or may even have different downstream_targets under different conditions motivated by this understanding many computational algorithms were proposed to discover condition specific regulatory_modules by integrating condition specific gene_expression and motif information regression_models are widely used to combine these two types of information for example a least square regression ls regression_method described by identifies significant regulators by combining mrna expression_level and chip on chip binding data to minimize a fitting error gram is another regression_method based on an iterative search to identify significant regulators andpage identification of transcription regulatory_modules has become increasingly important to understand_the associated with cancer previous methods focused on how to model the relationship of tf_binding and gene_expression levels assuming either active tfs or target_genes are known however it is a challenging_problem in many cancer studies due to significant noise in data_sources inaccurate motif binding information noisy gene_expression data and incomplete knowledge of the biological problem under study the ml svr method is intended to address these problems and simultaneously identify significant tfs and their target_genes through a multilevel strategy svr is utilized because its performance for combining binding_motif information and gene_expression data is robust in the presence of noise note that it can also be extended to model the non linear relationship between binding information and expression data through kernel functions clustering is used to group genes in multiple levels in a coarse tofine way to avoid hard split of the genes which may be undesirable considering the noises there are several issues for further investigation the method described here assumes that coexpressed genes should be coregulated to some degree hence genes are clustered based on their expression_profiles alone recently proposed to cluster genes based on their gene_expression data and binding_motif information together which may provide more accurate gene_clusters for analysis another important issue that needs to be addressed is how to determine an appropriate motif set for svr fitting in our experiment we only focused on each individual tf and their modules however finding the cooperative tfs is also important for many biological studies due to the large number of motifs under study typically in a range of to it is not feasible to consider all possible motif combinations when the order of the motif set increases in our recent work we developed a stepwise forward greedy search_strategy using a modified loss function to find the cooperative motifs in a given gene_set finally the parameters in the algorithm need to be further optimized in the future work we have proposed a multilevel two step svr method to identify significant condition specific regulatory_networks binding_motif information and gene_expression data are integrated by svr followed by significance analysis to find the active motif sets
