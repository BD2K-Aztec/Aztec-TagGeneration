molecular principles of human virus protein_protein motivation viruses from the human proteinprotein_interaction perspective target hubs bottlenecks and interconnected nodes enriched in certain biological_pathways however not much is known about the general characteristic_features of the human proteins interacting with viral_proteins referred to as hvips as well as the motifs and domains utilized by human virus protein_protein referred to as hu vir ppis results our study has revealed that hvips are mostly disordered proteins whereas viral_proteins are mostly ordered proteins protein disorder in viral_proteins and hvips varies from one subcellular_location to another in any given viral human ppi pair at least one of the two proteins is structurally disordered suggesting that disorder associated conformational_flexibility as one of the characteristic_features of virushost interaction further analyses reveal that hvips are i slowly evolving proteins ii associated with high centrality scores in human ppi_network iii involved in multiple pathways iv enriched in eukaryotic linear motifs elms associated with protein_modification degradation and regulatory_processes v associated with high number of splice_variants and vi expressed_abundantly across multiple tissues these aforementioned findings_suggest that conformational_flexibility spatial diversity abundance and slow evolution are the characteristic_features of the human proteins targeted by viral_proteins hu vir ppis are mostly mediated via domainmotif interactions dmis where viral_proteins employ motifs that mimic host elms to bind to domains in human proteins dmis are shared among viruses belonging to different families indicating a possible convergent_evolution of these motifs to help viruses to adopt common strategies to subvert host cellular_pathways availability_and hu vir ppi data ddi and dmi data for humanvirus ppi can be downloaded fromviruses are the obligate_intracellular and hence need host cellular_machinery for their genome_replication and propagation enabled by interactions between viral and several host_proteins during various stages of viral_infection hence viral host proteinprotein_interactions have been keenly studied by employing both computational and experimental human proteinprotein_interaction hu ppi_network is robust to random attacks owing to its scale_free nature however the network breaks down due to targeted attacks studies have shown that viral_proteins interact with hubs bottlenecks and rich clubs in hu ppi_network and they also interact with the human proteins involved in signalling cell_cycle cell trafficking transcription and translation the fact that viral_proteins although very a few in number target hubs bottlenecks and rich clubs indicates that viral subversion of human cellular_processes is achieved by targeted attacks our recent study has revealed yet another interesting facet of viral_proteins that some of them act as articulation points in the human viral bridged ppi_network by bridging unconnected components of hu ppi_network thereby mediating certain novel interactions to tune host machinery for their propagation in literature one can find studies_reporting properties of host_proteins targeted by viral_proteins for example it has been reported that the human proteins targeted by viruses are associated with diabetes and auto immune_diseases viral immune modulators have been shown to target_proteins involved in signalling_pathways and cellular_processes it has been found that the targets of hiv are highly_conserved across primates structural interaction_network studies comprising about viral hu ppis have revealed that the endogenous interfaces hu ppi evolve at slower rates compared with rest of the surface whereas the exogenous interfaces viral targets evolve at faster_rates later studies based on another dataset comprising interactions reported results contradicted these results among proteins some are referred to as intrinsically_disordered idps as these proteins are enriched with disordered_regions lacking stable three_dimensional structures idps are known to perform many biological_functions such as signalling regulatory_processes dna_binding and transcription idps usually interact with large number of proteins and hence occupy topologically important positions in proteinprotein_interaction they are tightly_regulated in the cell and found to harbour short_linear slims eukaryotic linear motifs elms in their disordered_regions that are recognized by modular protein_domains such as sh pdz and sh many genomes from prokaryotes to eukaryotes harbour several genes that code for idps about in archaea in bacteria and in eukaryotes viral_genomes too code for idps and the proportion of amino_acids in the disordered_regions of these genomes vary from to depending on their hosts or genome types furthermore some of the viruses harbour sequences that mimic elms in the disordered_regions some of the idps are associated with certain human genetic_disorders cancers neurodegenerative and autoimmune_diseases however role of idps in infectious_diseases in particular those caused by viral_infections has not been well studied in this study we report a systematic analysis of characteristic_features of human proteins interacting with viral_proteins hvips as well as on general_features of human virus hu vir ppi we find that significant number of hvips can be classified as idps furthermore hvips occupy central positions in ppi_network evolve at relatively slower rates involve in multiple pathways harbour a number of potential binding interfaces and linear motifs in their disordered_regions we also find that virus hu ppis are mediated by a common set of domainmotif interactions dmis viral_replication inside host is marked by various stages of life_cycle during various stages of viral_life viral_proteins interact with human proteins localized to distinct_cellular locations and distinct functions extra_cellular space or plasma_membrane for virus_entry and egress cytoplasm during unpackaging or virion assembly endoplasmic_reticulum for protein_synthesis and nucleus for viral_transcription replication mrna_processing our study has revealed that hu vir interactions mainly involve disordered proteins huelm in human protein elm in viral protein domain in hvip and domain in viral protein domain profile was obtained using interproscan elm profile for protein obtained using anchor atwenty have experimental_evidences detailed list in supplementary vir ppi and b which provide inherent conformational_flexibility to interacting_partners perhaps as a means to compensate structural_variations caused by mutations that frequently happen in viral_proteins protein structural_disorder in hvips and viral_proteins shows subcellular_location specific variation h and supplementary fig s a and b in most of the hu vir ppis human and viral_proteins complement each other in terms of their structural disorderwhen one is disordered the other is usually ordered disorder associated conformational_flexibility thus seems to be the common_feature of hu vi ppis viruses target human proteins that occupy central positions and hence make targeted attacks on hu ppi by which they gain_control over information_flow in hu ppi_network hvips are expressed across multiple tissues suggesting that they are housekeeping_genes which are required for cellular_processes hvips are associated with splice variation involved in multiple pathways and localized to multiple subcellular_locations thus presenting diversity and variation to interacting viral_proteins viruses are known to jump across species to cause diseases as a consequence of their co evolution with host_proteins immune system proteins evolve at higher rates when compared with non immune proteins our study also has revealed that immune hvips evolve at faster rate whereas non immune hvips show slowest evolutionary_rate these observations suggest two facets of viral_infections i evolutionary arms_race between viral and antiviral proteins consistent with and ii viruses capability to infect different hosts viral pathogen of one host_species cause a severe pathological symptoms in an another closely_related host_species for example hiv and hiv are thought to have jumped from chimpanzee and sooty mangabey respectively influenza h n causative of swine_flu has jumped from pigs to humans and kfdv kyasanoor forest disease virus that causes the disease in human has jumped from monkey hvips show higher number of interfaces in disordered_regions compared with non hvips and they can form multi interface hubs large number of interfaces in a protein enables it to interact with multiple proteins hvips are also enriched with elms which function in regulation of activities of proteins in cellular_processes such as endocytosis signalling transcription cell_cycle and protein degradation_pathways when we resolved hu vir ppi using known dmi and ddi information we found that viruses mainly utilize elms with hvips in a recent study reported that interspecies ppis between human and viral_proteins are mostly characterized by dmis compared with intraspecies interactions they also reported that hu vir ppis can be resolved using ddi and dmis in our study with high coverage of almost all known hu vir ppis and higher number of ddis and dmis than previously_reported in literature we found only of the interactions utilize either ddi or dmi elms in viral_proteins mimic host motifs mimicking slims is evolutionarily favourable for viruses as they undergo mutations rapidly driving convergent_evolution mimicked elms in viral_proteins mostly target kinase functions cell_cycle protein_degradation and cleavage pathways in bipartite ddi and dmi network we found that ddis are widespread and viral domains are involved in multiple interactions with different domains whereas motifs are involved in single interaction with corresponding lmbd and are utilized by multiple hu vir ppis it was also found that ddis are mostly virus specific whereas dmis are used by multiple viruses kegg_pathways enriched in hvips involved in dmi with viral_proteins of different viral families indicate that they are common among families and those of ddis are more specific to families of viruses this further confirms convergent_evolution of linear motifs in viruses belonging to different families as a strategy to target common pathways kegg_pathways uniquely enriched in ddi and dmi are distinct in ddi they are related to immune_recognition of viruses whereas in dmi they are related to metabolism cell_cycle and immune signalling it is well established that certain viral_proteins modulate pattern_recognition prr signalling_pathways and our results show downstream_signalling proteins of prr pathways form dmi with viral_proteins indicating viruses use linear motifs for manipulating these pathways proteins containing ww domain which have role in cell_cycle are targeted by viruses by mimicking ww domain binding_motifs consistent_with non_homologous pathway is enriched in hvips involved in dmis of retroviridae and herpesviridae whose activation is required for retroviruses and inhibition during lytic_cycle of herpes_viruses interestingly we found a few pathways involved in regulation of metabolism such as carbohydrate absorption insulin_signalling adipocytokine signalling mtor signalling and inositol_phosphate metabolism which are also enriched in hvips targeted via elms in viral_proteins viral modulation of metabolic_pathways is being studied in recent_years mtor signalling_pathway is known to be manipulated by pathogens our study revealed that akt gsk and pik k are targeted by many viruses by mimicking pkinase domain binding_motifs and supplementary hcv has been shown to stimulate phosphoinositol phosphate production via activation ofmolecular principles of human virus proteinprotein interactionspi k kinase activation consistent with our finding inositol_phosphate metabolism being targeted by means of dmis our previous study on hu vir bridged networks has revealed certain viral_proteins acting as articulation points and as a consequence bridge metabolic_pathways to the signalling_pathways aforementioned observations and examples in a nutshell support that host like linear motifs in viral protein_sequences are used for modulation of host functions by viruses although the known protein disorder in the viral_genomes vary broadly in the range from to majority of them are in the range of our study has also shown that majority of viral_proteins are odps and mdps structured of disordered residues disordered viral_proteins show high degree centrality though viral disordered proteins are less in number we see that they interact with higher number of hvips owing to their disorder and higher number of elms some viral_proteins have shown to contain higher_density of elms few studies focusing presence of elms in disordered proteins of hcv and across viral_genomes have been reported there are large_numbers of uncharacterized elms in disordered_regions of viral_proteins which may have functional_implications in our study we see viruses utilizing elms as a common strategy to manipulate certain pathways presence of large_numbers of putative elms indicate that viruses may use molecular_mimicry of elms as a strategy to rewire hosts regulatory and signalling_pathways current approaches based on limited structural data are inadequate to uncover all the elms involved in hu vir ppis our study has shed light on general molecular_characteristics of targeted viral attack on host_cells viruses have evolved in such a way that they employ targeted attack strategy by interacting with important proteins of hu ppi_network which are mostly idps in most of the cases hu vir ppis commonly involve at least one idp providing conformational_flexibility to the protein interaction viruses were found to utilize intrinsic_disorder in human proteins and of viral_proteins differentially in different subcellular_locations interactions with central proteins enable viruses to take control of host network and redirect it towards synthesis of viral_genome and proteins hvips were found to be enriched with binding interfaces in disordered region and slims elms in them viruses mimic host motifs and utilize them for targeted attack on certain host cellular_pathways presence of motifs which act as molecular_switches in regulation of multiple pathways high connectivity and global expression involvement in multiple pathways slow evolutionary_rate protein_abundance and high le in human proteins makes them achilles heel for targeted attack by viral_proteins viruses irrespective of their families mimic linear motifs in their protein_sequences as a common strategy to subvert specified functions undergoing convergent_evolution information control functional_diversity protein_abundance evolutionary plasticity of viruses to mimic host elms and conformational_flexibility are the governing principles of hu vir ppis this knowledge can be further exploited for screening and developing broad_spectrum of antiviral therapies
