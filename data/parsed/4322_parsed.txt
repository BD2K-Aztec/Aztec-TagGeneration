genome_analysis socrates identification of genomic_rearrangements in tumour genomes by re aligning soft clipped reads motivation methods for detecting somatic genome_rearrangements in tumours using next_generation are vital in cancer gen omics available algorithms use one or more sources of evidence such as read_depth paired_end or split_reads to predict structural_variants however the problem remains_challenging due to the significant computational_burden and high false_positive or false_negative results in this article we present socrates soft clip realignment to identify structural_variants a highly_efficient and effective method for detecting genomic_rearrangements in tumours that uses only split_read data socrates has single_nucleotide identifies micro homologies and untemplated sequence at break_points has high_sensitivity and high_specificity and takes_advantage of parallelism for efficient use of resources we demonstrate using simulated_and that socrates performs well compared with a number of existing structural variant detection_tools availability_and socrates is released as open_source and available from http bioinf the identification of somatic rearrangements in tumour genomes using next_generation ngs_data is an important step in characterizing cancers including identifying genomic_instability understanding tumour evolution and identifying potential fusion_genes however prediction of genomic_rearrangements remains a challenging bioinformatics problem existing_methods suffer from a variety of issues including high false_positive see for further discussion or false_negative depending on the methods data and nature of the genomic_rearrangements to identify genomic_rearrangements or structural_variants svs dna from samples is extracted fragmented size selected and typically paired_end pe sequenced there are four distinct approaches to identifying genomic_rearrangements using these data read_depth paired_end split_reads and de_novo methods read_depth methods rd identify one class of structural variationcopy number variants they provide only indirect_evidence for break_points and no information about genomic_organization rd methods involve counting reads in windows and segmenting the counts see e g they may use single_end se or paired_end their resolution and accuracy is dependent on the depth of coverage and the window_size but is typically of the order of kilobases examples of rd methods include readdepth and cnvnator anomalous pairedend alignment_methods pe use reads that contain a break_point in the unsequenced region between the paired_reads these reads map anomalously or discordantly to the reference genomefurther apart or closer together than expected based on the selected fragment_size to different chromosomes or with inverted orientation see e g the signal of a rearrangement is a cluster of anomalous reads the resolution of pe methods is related to the fragment_size and coverage in general single_nucleotide is not possible with pe methods breakdancer is an example of a pe method split_read methods sr rely on reads that span the break_point split_reads may be identified from singleend or paired_end although using paired_end data has the advantage of higher quality alignment most ngs to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their

will map the unsplit read while local aligners may also map part of the split_read with paired_end local ngs aligners are often greedy to align_reads concordantly thus the aligned part of a split_read may be quite short e g nucleotides nt a straightforward approach to identifying a split_read using an ngs aligner is via soft_clipping a soft clip is a special mismatch state in the alignment that is restricted to contiguous segments of the read at the or end sequencing_errors chimeric reads errors in the reference_genome or genomic rearrangement may cause soft clips sr methods are capable of single_nucleotide although micro homologies at fusion sites mean the break_point may only be known to nt accuracy and large imperfect homologies at the break_point may cause lower accuracy again examples of sr methods include splitread until recently most methods used just one of these types of evidence however several methods have now appeared that make use of more of the available evidence to predict an sv for example delly and prism use pe evidence and incorporate sr evidence through a targeted smithwaterman alignment cnver uses pe and rd signals to identify potential copy_number changes de_novo methods dn typically perform targeted sequence_assembly following other evidence to locate the locus and reads for assembly for example crest uses sr then dn however unbiased assembly of the whole_genome data is also possible making better use of the available evidence to predict break_points is obviously desirable but how this is undertaken is critical to find somatic rearrangements evidence from a tumour and a matched normal is used typically svs are called in both samples variants that occur in the both genomes are most likely polymorphisms or artefacts somatic rearrangements are obtained by subtracting predicted normal svs from the predicted tumour svs most methods are not specifically_designed for tumour genomes and some methods that are designed for germline dna neglect certain classes of rearrangement which are unlikely to be present as polymorphisms e g making them inappropriate for use in tumours the reads produced by ngs_platforms are increasing dramatically in length as a result the capacity to create dna libraries with fragments large enough to retain an unsequenced insert is decreasing and with it the utility of pe information increased length also means read mappability and the utility of sr methods is improved here we describe a new method for identifying somatic rearrangements socrates soft clip re alignment to identify structural_variants which currently relies only on sr evidence socrates works by efficiently identifying clusters of soft clipped alignments in the reference_genome as candidate break_points the soft clipped sequences are then extracted and realigned to the reference_genome a genomic rearrangement is predicted and break_points are identified with single nucleotide precision when soft clipped sequences from one cluster map to another with high stringency and there is reciprocal support we have developed socrates with bowtie and bwa in mind but it should work with any ngs aligner that supports or soft_clipping soft clips that are too short to align are also counted but are handled by direct search of the cluster pair the idea of re aligning soft clips has previously been used in clipcrop but clipcrops design is inappropriate for identifying genomic_rearrangements in tumours and our approach incorporates several novel features socrates is designed to be fast and memory_efficient it has single_nucleotide and is designed to be highly_sensitive it also has high_specificity on simulated_data it identifies micro homologies and untemplated sequence at break_points and deals with promiscuous or re used break_points our method was originally motivated by work on the emyc transgenic_mouse tumour genome and the failure of existing_methods to detect known fusions using pe reads from short dna_fragments but we have tested it extensively on simulated_data and human_tumours despite its design for somatic tissue analysis socrates can also be used to analyze svs in germline dna we compare the algorithms capabilities with other established break_point detection_tools using simulated_and
