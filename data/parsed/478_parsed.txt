genetics_and a robust ammi_model for the analysis of genotype by environment data motivation one of the most widely used models to analyse genotype by environment data is the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction ammi_model genotype by environment data resulting from multi location trials are usually organized in two way tables with genotypes in the rows and environments location year combinations in the columns the ammi_model applies singular_value svd to the residuals of a specific linear_model to decompose the genotype by environment interaction gei into a sum of multiplicative terms however svd being a least_squares method is highly_sensitive to contamination and the presence of even a single outlier if extreme may draw the leading principal component towards itself resulting in possible misinterpretations and in turn lead to bad practical decisions since as in many other real_life studies the distribution of these data is usually not normal due to the presence of outlying observations either resulting from measurement errors or sometimes from individual intrinsic characteristics robust svd methods have been suggested to help overcome this handicap results we propose a robust generalization of the ammi_model the r ammi_model that overcomes the fragility of its classical version when the data are contaminated here robust statistical_methods replace the classic ones to model structure and analyse gei the performance of the robust extensions of the ammi_model is assessed through a monte_carlo simulation_study where several contamination schemes are considered applications to two real plant datasets are also presented to illustrate the benefits of the proposed methodology which can be broadened to both animal and human_genetics studies availability_and source_code implemented in r is available in the supplementary_material under the function r ammi contact multi environment trials met which comprise experiments across multiple_locations are important tools for testing both broad and narrow genotype adaptation here when two different genotypes show a differential_response to a prototypic trait e g yield across environments it is said that genotype by environment interaction gei is present data from met are often summarized in two way tables of means with genotypes in the rows columns and environments location year combinations in the columns rows the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction ammi_model is one of the most widely used tools to analyse and structure gei this model works under a fixed model framework and is fit in two stages first the main effects of the model are estimated using the additive two way analysis_of anova by least_squares then the singular_value svd is applied to the residuals from the anova i e to the interaction to obtain the estimates for the multiplicative terms of the ammi_model the ammi_model in its standard form implicitly assumes equal weights for all entries of the two way dataset and that no outliers leverage points are present in the data proposed a weighted ammi algorithm where different weights to columns and or rows and or particular cells of the twoway data table are given and used this generalization to study gei and quantitative_trait qtl by environment interactions however their approach does not fully solve the problem that arises from contaminated dataa problem that is common in field data such as data resulting from metbecause of the difficulty in defining the weights associated with possible outlying observations as a consequence the results from the analysis using standard methods may be biased leading to possible misinterpretations which in turn may result in bad practical decisions since the reason behind these biases lies on the fact that i leastsquares regression anova method does not perform well in the presence of outlying observations which often tend to pull the regression_line towards them and consequently compromise inference results ii svd is a technique essentially based on the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the sample covariance correlation_matrix and is thus highly_sensitive to the presence of atypical observations it seems natural that an upgrade of this method may be achieved by improving the performance of the intermediate anova and svd steps robust statistical_methods are designed to overcome the handicaps of traditional_methods that are felt when one or more assumptions of the model of analysis are not fulfilled these violations often translate in biased parameter_estimation underpowered association tests unreliable confidence_intervals and so forth therefore and since data contamination is more a rule than an exception when real_life data are considered there has been growing interest in the use of these statistical methodologies which allow for valid results even if model_assumptions are violated interest that is also explained by the fact that throughout the years the associated computational_burden has been substantially_reduced to overcome the problem of analysing two way contaminated data and to better understand gei we introduce in this study a robust ammi_model where the linear fit underlying the anova method is replaced by a robust fit m regression and the use of the standard svd by a robust svd approach see a review in we underline that in the ammi_model the main effects are considered to be fixed and the errors normally distributed although other extensions have already been proposed in the literature hadi also proposed an alternative procedure of handling outliers in two way tables by using robust alternating regression based on factor_analytic anova models and robust projection pursuit principal_component to robustify the ammi_model however instead of dealing with a two stage model first fitting the additive part of the ammi_model and then the multiplicative estimates the additive and multiplicative terms simultaneously the performance of the proposed robust extensions of the ammi_model is assessed through monte_carlo where several contamination schemes are considered the methods are also compared with the results obtained via the classical ammi_model according to several criteria here the good features of the r ammi_model are displayed an application of the methodology to two real_datasets is also presented to illustrate the benefits of this approach we highlight that the range of possible applications of a robust ammi_model is wide spanning from plant genetics such as qtl detection and qtl by environment interaction studies to microarray_experiments ribosomal_dna studies plant and microbial_populations growth across several environmental_conditions animal sciences and human_genetics this study outlines the fragility of the classical ammi_model when the two way data table is contaminated which often is the case inexample of the usefulness of the preliminary descriptive_analysis one can think of the case where a regional trial has both irrigated and no irrigated plots which can result in wide yield differences within an environment in this case it might be more appropriate to analyse such a yield trial as two separate subsets instead of combining all data in one single analysis the proposed robust r ammi_model may also be useful in other studies where data contamination is inevitable e g in qtl detection and qtl by environment interaction studies in that case the robust ammi_model may be used instead of its classical counterpart to calculate more accurate predicted values when fitting the model which can then be subject to a qtl_analysis in a two stage procedure similar to the ones described in gauch et_al and rodrigues et_al further comparisons in terms of qtl detection and qtl by environment interaction between standard weighted and robust ammi models should be done in future work to reinforce the usefulness of the robust ammi_model also the ideas behind this robust approach may also be incorporated in the genotype main effects and genotype by environment interaction effects gge model which as the ammi_model is also very popular in met studies the main difference between the two is that in the gge model svd is performed on the matrix of residuals from a one way anova with fixed_effects for environments only instead of a two way anova with fixed_effects of genotypes and environments further extensions and applications of the proposed methodology can be done not only for animal and human_genetics applications but also in other fields as the ammi_model is also known in the literature as double centered principal_component the use of this robust version of the ammi_model and others that have shown preliminary good performances or that may subsequently follow e g based on the methods of jung and will allow practitioners to make better strategic decisions therefore this discussion is another step_forward in the direction of the development and use of more robust and thus more accurate methods not only in this field of application but in all others where data fail to comply with classical model_assumptions
