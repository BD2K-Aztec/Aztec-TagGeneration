genome_analysis mrhmms multivariate_regression hidden_markov and the variants hidden_markov hmms are flexible and widely used in scientific_studies particularly in genomics and genetics there are multiple distinct regimes in the genome within each of which the relationships among multivariate features are distinct examples_include differential gene_regulation depending on gene_functions and experimental_conditions and varying combinatorial patterns of multiple transcription_factors we developed a software_package called mrhmms multivariate_regression hidden_markov and the variants that accommodates a variety of hmms that can be flexibly applied to many biological studies and beyond mrhmms supplements existing hmm software_packages in two aspects first mrhmms provides a diverse set of emission probability structures including mixture of multivariate normal_distributions and logistic regression_models second mrhmms is computationally_efficient for analyzing_large data_sets generated in current genome_wide studies especially the software is written in c for the speed advantage and further amenable to implement alternative_models to meet users own purposes availability_and http sourceforge net_projects mrhmms multivariate features are abundant in genomic and genetic_studies a central theme is to understand the differential relationships among features and their contribution to gene_functions and phenotypes for example the gene_expression variation can be predicted using distinct sets of histone_modification levels in gene function groups the joint occupancy of multiple transcription_factors may change depending on the genome context such that differential regulatory_modules are observed and linked to distinct regulation mechanisms mrhmms multivariate_regression hidden_markov and the variants is based on the premise that biological_factors do not interact with each other in a uniform manner across the genome a regression hidden_markov rhmm for example can be used to segment the genome or genes into groups in each of which there is a unique relationship among biological_factors in addition to rhmm mrhmms includes five other hidden_markov hmm variant structures that can be alternatively applied to suit specific studies and data characteristics
