protein secondary_structure appears to be robust under in silico evolution while protein disorder appears not to be motivation the mutation of amino_acids often impacts protein_function and structure mutations without negative effect sustain evolutionary_pressure we study a particular aspect of structural robustness with respect to mutations regular protein secondary_structure and natively unstructured intrinsically_disordered is the formation of regular secondary_structure an intrinsic feature of amino_acid or is it a feature that is lost upon mutation and is maintained by evolution against the odds similarly is disorder an intrinsic sequence feature or is it difficult to maintain to tackle these questions we in silico mutated native protein_sequences into random_sequence like ensembles and monitored the change in predicted_secondary and disorder results we established that by our coarse_grained measures for change predictions and observations were similar suggesting that our results were not biased by prediction mistakes changes in secondary_structure and disorder predictions were linearly_proportional to the change in sequence surprisingly neither the content nor the length_distribution for the predicted_secondary changed substantially regions with long disorder behaved_differently in that significantly_fewer such regions were predicted after a few mutation steps our findings_suggest that the formation of regular secondary_structure is an intrinsic feature of random amino_acid while the formation of long disordered_regions is not an intrinsic feature of proteins with disordered_regions put differently helices and strands appear to be maintained easily by evolution whereas maintaining disordered_regions appears difficult neutral mutations with respect to disorder are therefore very unlikely random undirected mutation is a major driving_force for change in nature in the protein universe selection is realized through function mutations leading to loss of function are rarely observed as protein_structure determines protein_function it is also subjected to evolutionary selection most problematic single_nucleotide snp that alter the amino_acid nonsynonymous snps appear to impact the stability of protein_structure helices and strands constitute the major macromolecular building_blocks of all well ordered proteins the particular d structure of a protein is assumed to correspond to the global minimum_free and hence defines the unique fold of an amino_acid polymer another essential_feature of protein_structure is the unique interplay between well ordered and flexible regions one particular aspect of this interplay is that between what we may loosely refer to as order and disorder many proteins have regions that remain unstructured unless bound to a substrate they do not adopt a unique stable conformation in isolation such regions are also referred to as intrinsically_disordered or simply as disordered our operational definition for this vague term is we consider as disorder whatever is predicted as such proteins with long disorder regions have unique biophysical traits that enable the binding to different substrates often at different cellular conditions very long regions without regular secondary_structure loosely referred to as loops may resemble disorder nevertheless we can clearly distinguish between disorder like and well structured loops disorder is an important building_block for the increase in complexity in the evolution from unicellular prokaryotes to multi_cellular eukaryotes page
