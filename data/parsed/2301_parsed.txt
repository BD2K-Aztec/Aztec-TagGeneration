sequence_analysis identification of prokaryotic small proteins using a comparative_genomic approach_motivation accurate prediction of genes_encoding small proteins on the order of amino_acids or less remains an elusive open_problem in bioinformatics some of the best methods for gene prediction use either sequence_composition analysis or sequence_similarity to a known protein coding_sequence these methods often fail for small proteins however either due to a lack of experimentally_verified small protein_coding or due to the limited statistical_significance of statistics on small sequences our approach is based upon the hypothesis that true small proteins will be under selective_pressure for encoding the particular amino_acid for ease of translation by the ribosome and for structural_stability this stability can be achieved either independently or as part of a larger protein complex given this assumption it follows that small proteins should display conserved local protein_structure properties much like larger proteins our method incorporates neural net predictions for three local structure alphabets within a comparative_genomic approach using a genomic alignment of closely_related bacteria genomes to generate predictions for whether or not a given open_reading orf encodes for a small protein results we have applied this method to the complete genome for escherichia_coli strain k and looked at how well our method performed on a set of experimentally_verified small proteins from this organism out of a total of possible orfs we found that of the top and of the top predictions belonged to the set of experimentally_verified small proteins we found of all the true small proteins within the top predictions we compared our method to glimmer using a default glimmer protocol and a modified small orf glimmer protocol with a lower minimum_size cutoff the default glimmer protocol identified of the true small proteins all in the top predictions but failed to predict on due to size cutoffs the small orf glimmer protocol made predictions for all the experimentally_verified small proteins but only contained of the true small proteins within the top predictions increasingly small proteins have been found to be important functional_elements in cellular_biology members of this class of molecules have been associated with a diverse set of functions including the regulation of amino_acid iron_homeostasis spore development and antimicrobial_activity despite the recent_discoveries of functionally_relevant small proteins there is still relatively little known about how widespread and critical small proteins are furthermore the advent_of technologies has enabled transcriptional_profiling of complete_genome in the yeast_genome these efforts have led to the expansion of the transcriptome the problem of discriminating small protein encoding_sequences from other small_rnas will only increase as transcriptional_profiling efforts expand due to the lack of introns and alternative_splicing mechanisms prokaryotic organisms represent a unique setting for the elucidation of novel small proteins within this context any open_reading orf is potentially a protein encoding_gene for prokaryotic_genomes the most accurate way to predict a gene is via similarity to a protein in another genome this technique is problematic however due to limited_numbers of experimentally_verified small proteins in sequence_databases further complicating the problem is a contamination of sequence_databases caused by the propagation of dubious orf predictions via homology_based annotation efforts in situations where there is no matching protein sequence_composition based_methods are traditionally used there are several automated gene_finders that fall into this category such as glimmer orpheus genemark and easygene glimmer uses interpolated markov_models to distinguish coding from non coding_dna the program combines first through eighth order markov_models and weights them by their predictive_power orpheus begins by a database similarity_search the genes with matches in the database are then used to create a statistical profile of protein_coding and ribosome binding_sites this profile is then used to make genome_wide predictions for protein_coding the original genemark program usedwe have developed a method that uses traditional_measures protein conservation and codon_bias as well as local protein_structure properties to generate predictions that a small orf encodes for a protein the framework for all our calculations is comparative_genomics using whole_genome alignments between closely_related we have shown that within this context multiple_alignment information can be very valuable as we expected sequence_composition and protein like conservation alone do not perform as well as our combined approach specifically we were unable to identify any of the validated small proteins within the top predictions when we used a single_genome codon_bias metric as our lone data source this is especially interesting because this approach is one of the standard off_the tools used to distinguish protein_coding while this approach may work for longer_sequences our results show that small proteins will be missed by such efforts for our analysis of the e coli k genome we intentionally omitted all ribosome_binding data as a possible scoring feature this was done for two reasons in several bacterial_genomes there are a large number of leaderless protein genes so we created a method that did not rely on strong ribosome binding_sites furthermore a majority of the experimentally_validated small proteins in this genome were identified in large part due to a strong ribosome binding_site near the orf start site therefore
