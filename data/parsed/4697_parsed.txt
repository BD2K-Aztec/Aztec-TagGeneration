topology function conservation in protein_protein motivation proteins underlay the functioning of a cell and the wiring of proteins in proteinprotein_interaction pin relates to their biological_functions proteins with similar wiring in the pin topology around them have been shown to have similar functions this property has been successfully exploited for predicting protein functions topological_similarity is also used to guide network_alignment that find similarly wired proteins between pins of different species these similarities are used to transfer annotation across pins e g from model_organisms to human to refine these functional_predictions and annotation transfers we need to gain insight into the variability of the topology_function for example a function may be significantly associated with specific topologies while another function may be weakly associated with several different topologies also the topology_function may differ between different species results to improve our understanding of topology_function and of their conservation among species we develop a statistical_framework that is built upon canonical_correlation using the graphlet degrees to represent the wiring around proteins in pins and gene_ontology go annotations to describe their functions our framework i characterizes statistically_significant topology_function in a given species and ii uncovers the functions that have conserved topology in pins of different species which we term topologically orthologous functions we apply our framework to pins of yeast and human identifying seven biological_process and two cellular_component go terms to be topologically orthologous for the two organisms proteins carry out specific tasks in a cell by binding to each other new proteins are getting identified due to recent_advances in genome sequencing_technologies and annotating their biological_functions is receiving increasing interest similarly wired proteins in the proteinprotein_interaction pins are shown to carry out similar functions and that fact has been exploited for transferring functional_annotations between proteins a proteins function can be described at different levels of detail from its molecular_functions to the phenotypes that it affects identifying a unified descriptor for protein_function is a challenging_task due to the inter dependencies and unclear separation between these levels gene_ontology go is a well established way of handling these issues a go term represents either a biological_process bp a molecular_function or a cellular_component cc phenomenon and the ontology containing these terms describe their dependencies a protein can be associated with multiple go terms each representing a different functional characteristic of the protein one of the important properties of a network is density density is the proportion of the node pairs in a network that are connected with edges and it measures how tightly the network is wired apart from density many different standard network_properties such as degree_distribution clustering_coefficient betweenness_centrality and closeness centrality can be used for trying to understand the information contained in the wiring of a protein in the pin graphlets have been shown to be particularly useful in capturing different aspects of the wiring around a node graphlets are small connected non isomorphic induced subnetworks of a large network nodes within each graphlet are said to belong same automorphism orbit if they can be mapped to each other by an automorphism the thirty to node graphlets and their automorphism orbits are illustrated in the wiring around a node can be described by generalizing the notion of node degree to graphlet_degree milenkovicndmilenkovicnd the graphlet_degree vector of node n denoted by gdv n is a dimensional vector where its ith coordinate gdv n is the number of graphlets that node n touches at orbit i the gdv captures the wiring patterns around a node for all possible subnetworks with up to five nodes because proteins almost never perform their function alone but interact with each other to carry out their function analysing their interaction_patterns can give valuable insights into their function inside a cell it has been shown that proteins with similar functions and cellular locations tend to cluster together in the pin of yeast and of interacting_protein share at least one function several graph_theoretic approaches were proposed to predict the functions of proteins based on their shared neighbourhoods or on their closeness in the pins however it was shown that the functional_similarities between proteins do not necessarily depend on them being in the same local neighbourhoods but on the similarities of their interaction_patterns independent of the network location milenkovicndmilenkovicnd prulj another group of methods aligns pins of two or more species to identify the evolutionary_conserved parts of the pins and use the resulting node to node mappings to transfer the functional_annotations of proteins across species these graph_theoretic approaches show that the topological characteristics of proteins complement their sequence and structural_characteristics and enable transfer of their functional_annotation although the link between topology and function has been widely_studied all of these studies assume that for each function the wiring patterns of the annotated proteins are similar however evolution might have varying effects on different parts of the pins for this reason while some essential functions might carry the topological_similarity constraint other functions that are linked with more species specific processes may not have such topological_similarity constraints and therefore their topological characteristics can vary unlike the previous_studies that aim to predict the functions of proteins from their wiring patterns in pins we aim to identify the most prominent wiring patterns of biological_functions and to characterize their conservation across species our new method_utilizes the canonical_correlation cca method to identify significant topology_function with the topology being represented by the graphlet degrees of proteins and their functions by go annotations to identify the evolutionarily_conserved topology_function we separately apply our cca based_methodology on different species and integrate the obtained results we illustrate our method on yeast and human pins as they are the most complete to date and we uncover consistent topology_function for seven bp and two cc terms these functions reveal the regions of the pins that are evolutionarily the most conserved which we term topologically orthologous furthermore we perform three case studies on the identified patterns of dna dependent transcription_initiation cellular_localization and proteasome complex go annotations and show that our results are coherent with the underlying topology we propose a three step method that is able to find topology_function that persist across the pins of different species topology function conservation in ppi networkseven if these topological patterns are not formed by the same sets of proteins with our method we identify that seven bp and two cc go terms have non redundant topology_function for yeast and human our case studies on the patterns of dnadependent transcription_initiation cellular_localization and proteasome complex validate that our results are in agreement with the underlying_biological our analysis uncovers conserved topology_function on a relatively small number of high_level go terms this is due to the fact that go terms that are annotated with small sets of proteins are less likely to appear as significant furthermore while we mainly focus on conserved topology_function our method also uncovers many species specific ones for example a highly_specific go term maturation of ssu_rrna is linked with the orbits of dense graphlets i e orbits in yeast while the same patterns are not observed in human analysis of such species specific topology_function can shed light on the wiring patterns of a wider_range of functions and raise interesting questions about the underlying reasons for different wiring patterns of proteins annotated with the same go terms in different species this could further improve our understanding of the evolution of those functions although the association matrix can be used for predicting the go term annotations of the proteins from their wiring patterns in pins our results show that not all topology_function are conserved across species which is likely to negatively impact the quality of predictions however if prediction is the objective graphlet_degree statistics can be further supported with other types of features e g protein_sequence or structure our methodology can easily accommodate such additional features to derive more accurate linear transformations for predicting biological_function our method is applicable to any number of species although the incompleteness of the pins limits it to yeast and human for the time being when more complete proteinprotein_interaction datasets become available we will be able to apply our method without modification by replacing the functional_annotations with other biological_information about proteins our method would further uncover conserved wiring patterns in different phenomena including those in disease or kegg_pathway annotations of proteins topology function conservation in ppi_networks
