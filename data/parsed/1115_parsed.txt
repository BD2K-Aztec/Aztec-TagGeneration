gene_expression computational network_analysis of the anatomical and genetic organizations in the mouse_brain motivation the mammalian central_nervous cns generates high_level behavior and cognitive_functions elucidating the anatomical and genetic organizations in the cns is a key_step toward understanding the functional brain circuitry the cns contains an enormous_number of cell_types each with unique gene_expression therefore it is of central importance to capture the spatial expression_patterns in the brain currently genome_wide atlas of spatial expression_patterns in the mouse_brain has been made available and the data are in the form of aligned d data arrays the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose_significant for efficient computational_analysis results we employ data reduction and network modeling techniques to explore the anatomical and genetic organizations in the mouse_brain first to reduce the volume of data we propose to apply tensor factorization techniques to reduce the data_volumes this tensor formulation treats the stack of d volumes as a d data array thereby preserving the mouse_brain geometry we then model the anatomical and genetic organizations as graphical_models to improve the robustness and efficiency of network modeling we employ stable model_selection and efficient sparsity regularized formulation results on network modeling show that our efforts recover known interactions and predicts novel putative correlations availability the complete results are available at the project websitethe mammalian central_nervous cns generates high_level control functions and knowledge on the anatomical and genetic organizations in this system can elucidate the functional brain circuitry the enormous complexity of this system is reflected in the large number of cell_types each with unique gene_expression therefore it is of central importance to capture the anatomical localization of gene_expressions in the brain recent_advances in bioimaging technologies such as the high_throughput in situ_hybridization ish technique have made it possible to capture the spatial expression_patterns in the adult_mouse consequently genomic_scale expression atlases in the form of digital_images have been produced at increasing speed and resolution the marriage of image processing_tools and advanced computational_methods opens_the for unraveling the functional brain circuitry and the generation of high_level cognitive_functions on top of it the allen brain atlas aba contains d atlas of gene_expression in the adult_mouse and is one of the most comprehensive datasets for spatial expression_patterns in the mammalian cns it provides cellular resolution d expression_patterns in the male day old c bl mouse_brain in this atlas genome_wide coverage is available in sagitally oriented sections in addition coronal_sections at a more refined scale are available for a set of about genes showing restricted expression_patterns the image data are generated by in situ_hybridization using genespecific probes followed by slide scanning d image_registration to the allen reference atlas ara and expression segmentation this results in a set of spatially aligned d volumes of size one for each gene that document the spatial expression_patterns of genes in the mouse_brain efficient and effective analysis of these highthroughput data can shed light on the global function of mammalian cns on the other hand the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose_significant for efficient computational_analysis hence computational understanding of these data is limited to unsupervised techniques which cluster the brain_regions into co expressed groups in this article we employ advanced computational_techniques to model the anatomical and genetic organizations in the mouse_brain as networks first to reduce the size of data and accelerate efficient analysis and storage we propose to apply tensor factorization techniques to reduce the data_volumes this tensor formulation treats the stack of d volumes as a d data array thereby preserving the mouse_brain geometry based on the reduced data we model the anatomical and genetic organizations as graphical_models in which each vertex represents a spatial_location or a gene and the edges between vertices encode the correlations between locations and genes to improve the efficiency of network modeling we employ an approximate formulation for gaussian graphical modeling which involves a series of sparsity regularized_regression problems the efficiency of this approximate formulation enables us to employ a robust estimation technique known as stability_selection which estimate and combine multiple models based on resampling we apply the data reduction and network modeling techniques to learn the anatomical and genetic_networks underlying the mouse
