quantitative frame analysis and the annotation of gc_rich and other prokaryotic_genomes an application to anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans motivation graphical_representations of contrasts in gc usage among codon frame positions frame analysis provide evidence of genes missing from the annotations of prokaryotic_genomes of high_gc but the qualitative_approach of visual frame analysis prevents its applicability on a genomic_scale results we developed two quantitative methods for the identification and statistical characterization in sequence_regions of three base periodicity hits associated with open_reading structures the methods were implemented in the n profile analysis computational_tool npact which highlights in graphical_representations inconsistencies between newly_identified orfs and pre_existing annotations of coding_regions we applied the npact procedures to two recently annotated strains of the deltaproteobacterium anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans identifying in both genomes numerous conserved orfs not included in the published annotation of coding_regions availability_and npact is available as a web_based service and for download ataccurate genome_annotations are fundamental to a great variety of sequence analyses annotations of prokaryotic_genomes are based on computational gene prediction_methods that using information from sequence_composition and from sequence signals e g ribosome_binding have achieved remarkable levels of sensitivity the availability of large_databases of gene sequences also facilitates identification of coding_regions using information from sequence_similarity nevertheless a multitude of orfs conserved across distantly_related genomes and not reported in published genome_annotations have been recently identified despite the high_sensitivity of gene prediction_methods certain genes may still be difficult to predict for example genes of very short_length or genes_encoded by heterologous dna true genes may also be excluded from the annotation by over conservative criteria of robustness of prediction across methods or of evolutionary_conservation for example although glimmer is often considered to have lower specificity than other predictors e g genemark hmm or prodigal many genes predicted by glimmer and not included in genome_annotations have been confirmed in a recent analysis based on evolutionary_conservation and functional characterization bioinformatics_tools and procedural standards have been developed to facilitate and v c the author published_by
