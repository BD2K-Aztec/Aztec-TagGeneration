genetics_and hiv therapy simulator a graphical_user for comparing the effectiveness of novel therapy regimens computer simulation_models can be useful in exploring the efficacy of hiv therapy regimens in preventing the evolution of drug_resistant viruses current modeling programs however were designed by researchers with expertise in computational_biology limiting their accessibility to those who might lack such a background we have developed a user_friendly graphical program hiv therapy simulator hivsim that is accessible to non technical users the program allows clinicians and researchers to explore the effectiveness of various therapeutic_strategies such as structured treatment interruptions booster therapies and induction maintenance therapies we anticipate that hivsim will be useful for evaluating novel drug based treatment concepts in clinical research and as an educational tool availability hiv therapy simulator is freely_available for mac os and windows atthe current standard for the management of uncomplicated hiv_infection is triple drug_therapy for patients whose therapeutic_options have become limited due to the development of drug_resistance more complex regimens consisting of four to six drugs have been attempted unfortunately efforts to improve suppressive efficacy can also increase the likelihood of adverse_drug and reduce patient adherence because newly arising resistance mutations may be incorporated into the latently_infected cd t cell reservoir improperly designed primary or salvage regimens may perpetuate a downward spiral of progressively more limited and poorly_tolerated therapeutic_options it is therefore critical to select antiviral regimens that are well_tolerated and optimally tuned to achieve viral_suppression and limit resistance mathematical_models that simulate the dynamics of viral_infection are powerful_tools for exploring the effects of therapy regimens on virus current modeling programs however were designed for theoretical research use limiting their accessibility to clinical_researchers and others to whom correspondence should be addressed who might lack a computational background to bridge this gap we have developed hiv therapy simulator hivsim a graphical program that enables users to easily explore_potential outcomes under different therapy strategies mathematical_models can be used to examine the impact of antiretroviral therapies on hiv_infection we have developed an intuitive graphical program hiv therapy simulator which allows users without a technical background to compare the efficacy of standard and novel hiv therapy regimens in suppressing viral_replication and the emergence_of strains hivsim may be useful as an educational tool for illustrating the strengths_and of various hiv therapy strategies as well as teaching evolutionary concepts such genetic_drift and epistasis hivsim may also enable clinical_researchers to evaluate the logic of novel treatment_strategies such as cycling or recycling pharmacologic_agents and structured treatment interruptions of various lengths and frequencies this approach may be particularly helpful in planning for and evaluating clinical_trials in which it is not possible for ethical reasons to have a true placebo arm however we caution against using hivsim to inform individual treatment_decisions as simulation_models are necessarily simplified and cannot substitute for the judgment of a trained clinician potential_future for hivsim include porting to additional platforms adding additional biological_features and extending the program to other infections such as hepatitis c
