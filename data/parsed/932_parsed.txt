systems_biology characterization of p mapk isoforms for drug_resistance study using systems_biology approach_motivation p mitogen_activated activation plays an important role in resistance to chemotherapeutic cytotoxic_drugs in treating multiple_myeloma mm however how the p mitogen_activated signaling_pathway is involved in drug_resistance in particular the roles that the various p isoforms play remains_largely method to explore_the we developed a novel systems_biology approach by integrating liquid chromatog raphymass spectrometry and reverse_phase data from human mm cell_lines with computational pathway_models in which the unknown_parameters were inferred using a proposed novel algorithm called modularized factor graph results new mechanisms predicted by our models suggest that combined activation of various p isoforms may result in drug_resistance in mm via regulating the related pathways including extracellular_signal erk_pathway and nfib pathway erk_pathway regulating cell_growth is synergistically regulated by p isoform whereas nuclear_factor nfib pathway regulating cell apop tosis is synergistically regulated by p isoform this finding that p isoform promotes the phosphorylation of erk in mm cells treated with bortezomib was validated by western_blotting based on the predicted mechanisms we further screened drug_combinations in silico and found that a promising drug_combination targeting erk and nfb might reduce the effects of drug_resistance in mm cells this study provides a framework of a systems_biology approach to studying drug_resistance and drug_combination selection availability_and rppa experimental_data and matlab source codes of modularized factor graph for parameter_estimation are freely_available online atmultiple myeloma mm as the second most common hematologic_malignancy with new cases per year in the usa remains incurable with a median_survival of years the relapse of this disease and resistance to treatment cannot be avoided while recent_advances in novel therapeutics keep producing promising clinical responses the p mitogen_activated p mapk_signaling is known to play_a in many cellular_responses including apoptosis cell_cycle induction of expression of cytokine_genes and cellular_differentiation more recently p mapk has been shown to have a central role in resistance to chemotherapeutic_agents to date four isoforms of the p mapk family have been identified p p p and p activation of various p isoforms may determine cell_fate after drug treatment previous_research has shown that the activation of particular p isoforms can be specifically controlled through different upstream_regulators and co activated by various combinations of such regulators enhanced cell_death resulting from p mapk inhibition when cells are treated with arsenic_trioxide ato and or bortezomib bzm is thought to be due to the suppression of c_jun jnk_activation by p mapk in mm cells increased killing by dexamethasone and bzm as a result of p mapk inhibition was associated with reduced phosphorylation and activation of the antiapoptotic protein heat_shock in addition the p mapk inhibitor sb has been shown to suppress the function of p glycoprotein in drug_resistant cell_lines leading to the increased efficacy of cytotoxic_drugs together these studies suggest that p mapk activation may mediate drug_resistance via multiple mechanisms however how the p mapk_signaling to whom correspondence should be addressed
