systems_biology lpnet a linear_programming approach to reconstruct signal_transduction networks with the widespread availability of high_throughput experimental_technologies it has become possible to study hundreds to thousands of cellular_factors simultaneously such as coding or non coding mrna or protein concentrations still extracting information about the underlying regulatory or signaling interactions from these data remains a difficult challenge we present a flexible_approach towards network_inference based on linear_programming our method reconstructs the interactions of factors from a combination of perturbation non perturbation and steady_state time series data we show both on simulated_and that our methods are able to reconstruct the underlying networks fast and efficiently thus shedding new light on biological_processes and in particular into diseases mechanisms of action we have implemented the approach as an r package available through bioconductor using network_inference approaches it is possible to understand how different cellular_components e g genes proteins metabolites interact with each other several methods for network_inference exist such as boolean_networks dynamic_bayesian bn and methods based on differential_equations boolean_networks scale up well for larger_networks and are easy to interpret yet the biological signal is binarized which leads to a substantial_loss of information bn and differential_equations allow for a more detailed modeling of the underlying_processes but they are often applicable only to small_scale problems as they usually scale up poorly one of the major recent_approaches to model signaling_networks based on perturbation data are the nested effects models nems which have been widely_applied and extended in different ways this approach assumes a small number of candidate pathway genes which are silenced s genes and the effects of this silencing are measured on a large set of effects genes e genes thus using indirect observations of effects for network_inference approaches that use direct observations from perturbed networks obtained either at a single or several time points include however many of the published network_inference approaches are computationally_expensive and thus not suitable for large_networks also although many methods are publicly_available a substantial fraction of them are dependent on rd party proprietary software e g matlab and are not properly documented thus making them very hard to use here we present a flexible_approach implemented as a bioconductor_package lpnet freely_available for any of the major operating_systems the method implemented in lpnet extends a previously_developed in by adding support for time series data as a result the method is now suited for any combination of perturbation non perturbation and steady_state time series data and not only for perturbation steady_state data as in the previous version of furthermore the calculation of a nodes activity which directly influences the resulting network was improved leading to more accurate results finally since the method is formulated as a linear_programming approach inferring networks becomes fast and efficient even for large_scale problems the performance of the first version of lpnet suitable only for perturbation steady_state data has been assessed as for the latest_version with support for a combination of perturbation non perturbation and steady_state time series data it has been used in the dream competition in the hpn dream breast_cancer network_inference challenge where it scored third for the in silico challenge auroc and th for the experimental challenge auroc without using prior information among more than competing groups in the in silico challenge the goal was to infer the causal edges in a node network given a dataset containing the nodes observations across time points and perturbation experiments one of these being the control in the experimental challenge the goal was to infer causal networks one for each combination of cell_line stimulusthere were cell_lines and different stimuli each of the datasets contained nodes observations across time points and inhibition experiments one of these being the control in the supplementary_information section we briefly compare lpnet with ddepn a method also implemented as a well documented r package and suitable for the same type of data two conclusions from this comparison are worth emphasizing i lpnet is very robust against noise ii on the same platform lpnet takes on average min to infer a network with nodes time points and perturbations while ddepn takes on average min computations done on an intel_xeon x ghz mb l cache gb ram bit linux os more detailed results are presented in the supplementary_materials and in
