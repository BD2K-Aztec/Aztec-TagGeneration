systems_biology opm an r package for analysing omnilog phenotype microarray_data opm is an r package designed to analyse multidimensional omnilog phenotype microarray pm data opm provides management visualization and statistical_analysis of pm data including curve parameter_estimation and discretization dedicated and customizable plots metadata management automated generation of textual and tabular reports mapping of substrates to databases batch conversion of files and export to phylogenetic software in the yaml markup_language availability opm is distributed under the gpl through the comprehensive_r http cran r project org pack ageopm along with a comprehensive manual and a user_friendly tutorial further information may be found at http www dsmz de re search microorganisms projects high_throughput phenotypic testing is increasingly important for exploring the biology of bacteria fungi yeasts and animal cell_lines e g human cancer_cells and offers a great_potential for testing gene function and improving genome_annotation the omnilog pm system monitors simultaneously on a longitudinal time scale the phenotypic reaction to up to environmental_challenges spotted on sets of well microtiter_plates as respiration kinetics with an often sigmoidal shape as we discussed previously by using a combination of existing r packages ad_hoc code and even manual manipulations there is an increasing demand to explore omnilog pm data not only qualitatively but also quantitatively taking_into associated metadata on the organisms and experimental_settings as a result we present here the broad and flexible design of the r r development core package opm which allows users to analyse omnilog pm data within a wide frame of research tasks such as omics approaches systems_biology ecology and taxonomy the unique strength of opm is the qualitative_and analysis of raw kinetic omnilog pm data via direct visualization and the robust estimation of curve parameters and their confidence_intervals thereby the user retains full control on the directions of data analyses according to his research_interests flexible ways to add and query metainformation enable the user to efficiently explore these data statistically also across multiple groups export to matrices and data frames allows for the exploitation of all functionality available in the r environment whereas standardized and easily readable output_formats ease the interaction with external software general workflow of opm and its interplay with r and third_party software
