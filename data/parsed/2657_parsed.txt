genome_analysis kvsnp accurately predicting the effect of genetic_variants in voltage_gated motivation non_synonymous nssnps in voltage_gated kv_channels cause diseases with potentially_fatal consequences in seemingly healthy_individuals identifying disease_causing genetic_variation will aid presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment of such disorders nssnp effect predictors are hypothesized to perform best when developed for specific gene_families we thus created kvsnp a method that assigns a disease_causing probability to kv_channel nssnps results kvsnp outperforms popular non gene_family specific methods snps go sift and polyphen in predicting the disease potential of kv_channel variants according to all tested metrics accuracy matthews correlation_coefficient and area under receiver_operator most significantly it increases the separation of the median predicted disease probabilities between benign and disease_causing snps by on the next best competitor kvsnp has ranked uncharacterized kv_channel nssnps by disease_causing probability one in every bases of human dna shows variation between individuals these sites are called single_nucleotide snps distinguishing benign snps bsnps from those that cause disease dcsnps is a key premise for personalized_medicine but with a total of million polymorphic_loci within the genome it is no trivial feat efforts are often focused on identifying snps responsible for specific diseases or all dcsnps within certain genomic_regions or genes for example identifying dcsnps within the voltage_gated kv_channel genes where genetic_variation has been shown to cause or be associated with cardiac arrhythmogenesis for which the first presenting_symptom can be sudden_cardiac genetic_screening of a long_qt lqts cohort of patients revealed that had at least minor_allele in a kv_channel gene an additional concern with arrhythmogenesis is that individuals with certain genetic_backgrounds including kv_channel genotypes can acquire it when administered with certain drugs furthermore snps in kv_channel genes also cause or predispose individuals to various neurological_disorders including epilepsy neuromyotonia and episodic ataxia as well as other diseases such as deafness while not directly fatal these disorders would still benefit from pre symptomatic diagnosis and treatment association studies have previously been used to identify kvchannel dcsnps but there is concern that some variants may be incorrectly assigned because study cohorts were not large enough to infer statistical_significance results are also confounded by multiple testing errors and the fact that compound snps are likely to cause or contribute to disease variable phenotype penetrance and severity is observed in arrhythmia patients harboring the same kv_channel snp suggesting that phenotypic modifier genes and or variants exist ranking snps by disease_causing probability would i prioritize variants for further examination and ii aid identification of phenotype modifying variants this is made even more relevant by the current sequencing revolution where advances in high_throughput technology have facilitated genotyping to an unprecedented depth at affordable costs resulting in a plethora of data that some are finding hard to analyse fast enough computational_methods to predict whether nssnps will cause disease were originally based on empirical rules but now tend to use machine_learning variants of known consequence are used to train the machine_learning predictor which finds patterns within the annotated nssnp attributes that best classify the data into in their constituent groups dcsnps and bsnps once trained the predictor can be applied to uncharacterized variants emitting the likelihood that they are disease_causing this approach has resulted in prediction_accuracies of up to but there is some evidence that performance can be improved if the machine_learning model is built for a specific gene
