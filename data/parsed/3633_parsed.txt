genome_analysis precise inference of copy_number in tumor_samples from snp_arrays motivation the accurate detection of copy_number cnas in human_genomes is important for understanding susceptibility to cancer and mechanisms of tumor_progression cna detection in tumors from single_nucleotide snp_genotyping is a challenging_problem due to phenomena such as aneuploidy stromal contamination genomic waves and intra_tumor issues that leading methods do not optimally address results here we introduce methods and software penncnv tumor for fast and accurate cna detection using signal_intensity data from snp_genotyping we estimate stromal contamination by applying a maximum_likelihood approach over multiple discrete gen_omic intervals by conditioning on signal_intensity across the genome our method accounts for both aneuploidy and genomic waves finally our method uses a hidden_markov to integrate_multiple sources of information including total and allele specific signal_intensity at each snp as well as physical_maps to make posterior inferences of cnas using real_data from cancer_cell and patient tumors we demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and computational_efficiency compared with existing_methods availability source_code documentation and example datasets are freely_available sourceforge net_projects penncnv copy_number cnas refer to the copy_number change of a chromosomal segment that is of somatic origin often observed in tumor_tissues in contrast to inherited copy_number cnvs present in the germline cnas tend to be longer and occupy a significantly_larger proportion of the genome the recent application of single_nucleotide snp_genotyping has led to the characterization of genomic_aberrations associated with cancer development and prognosis and some studies have investigated cnas in cancer_cell and tumor_subtypes the comprehensive characterization of cnas in cancer_genomes is critical for understanding disease_etiology and for advancing the development of targeted_therapies for individual cancer patients a number of methods have been proposed to detect both cnvs and cnas using snp_genotyping array based_technologies such as those from affymetrix or illumina compared with array_comparative cgh platforms which measure only the total intensity at each marker snp_arrays report both the overall intensities of the probe hybridization reaction for each snp as well as the ratio of the intensities between the two alleles recent versions of high_density snp_arrays have incorporated non polymorphic_markers to better interrogate genomic_regions for which snp information is not adequate or not available by leveraging signal_intensity data from snp_arrays statistical_methods can measure both total copy_number and allelic states with high_resolution due to the high_density of snps featured on these microarrays typically ranging from to million markers across the genome dozens of computational algorithms have been developed for cnv_detection on snp_arrays and these methods have already been widely used in human_genetics research however the problem of cna detection is considerably more difficult than cnv_detection for several reasons first whereas germline cnvs can be inferred based on the assumption of a baseline copy_number of two calibration of the baseline in tumors is not obvious as tumor_cells may be aneuploid i e have an abnormal number of chromosomes a second complication known as stromal contamination arises from the fact that samples derived from malignant_tissue are often contaminated with adjacent_normal simply modeling the copy_number state of the tumors may lead to inaccurate estimates as the true copy_number state is distributed as a mixture of normal and one or more tumor_cells populations third intra_tumor is now appreciated as a common_feature of cancer_genomes and subpopulations of cancer_cells may harbor distinct copy_number changes fourth although cnas and cnvs can both be recurrent_events cna boundaries may be more variable in a region across samples so sensitivity may be an issue for cna methods continuous time hidden_markov hmms are traditionally favored for modeling the underlying state_space i e copy_number and allelic state for cnv cna to whom correspondence should be addressed inference as they integrate over all parameters in the model including the spatial_relationship between snps along the genome allowing one to obtain both point_estimates and their confidence_intervals for the parameters of interest in the current study we present an hmm_based solution to cna detection that addresses each of the issues specific to tumor_genomes because several previously_published have also considered some of these complications we compare these with our approach and highlight its advantages in this section we report comparisons between penncnv tumor and existing software for calling cnas namely ascat van gap genocn oncosnp and gphmm over software_tools have now been published for identifying cnas from snp_arrays most are based on hmms but several use segmentation_algorithms our proposed algorithm uses snp_genotyping to identify cnas and estimate their magnitude in tumor_samples while accounting for intratumor_heterogeneity stromal contamination and aneuploidy when compared against other popular_methods our approach performs comparably in terms of the detection and estimation of cnas but shows marked improvements in the estimation of stromal contamination and runtime efficiency later in the text we discuss the
