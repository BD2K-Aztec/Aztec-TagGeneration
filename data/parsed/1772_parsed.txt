fast integration based prediction bands for ordinary_differential models_motivation to gain_a of biological_processes and their relevance in disease mathematical_models are built upon experimental_data uncertainty in the data leads to uncertainties of the models parameters and in turn to uncertainties of predictions mechanistic dynamic_models of biochemical_networks are frequently based on nonlinear differential_equation systems and feature a large number of parameters sparse observations of the model components and lack of information in the available data due to the curse of dimensionality classical and sampling approaches propagating parameter uncertainties to predictions are hardly feasible and insufficient however for experimental_design and to discriminate between competing_models prediction and confidence bands are essential to circumvent the hurdles of the former methods an approach to calculate a profile likelihood on arbitrary observations for a specific time point has been introduced which provides accurate confidence and prediction intervals for nonlinear models and is computationally_feasible for high_dimensional models results in this article reliable and smooth point wise prediction and confidence bands to assess the models uncertainty on the whole time course are achieved via explicit integration with elaborate correction mechanisms the corresponding system of ordinary_differential is derived and tested on three established models for cellular signalling an efficiency analysis is performed to illustrate the computational benefit compared with repeated profile likelihood calculations at multiple time points availability_and the integration framework and the examples used in this article are provided with the software_package data dynamics which is based on matlab and freely_available www data dynamics org one major task in systems_biology is to infer knowledge about biological_processes via mathematical representations of the underlying biochemical_reactions at the beginning information given in experimental_data is exploited to build a suitable model either biologydriven or by reverse_engineering algorithms an important step of this process is the model_selection for this purpose reliable confidence_intervals on the models of choice are crucial subsequently predictions about the models unobserved components or extrapolation to different experimental_conditions are desired in systems_biology mechanistic_models based_on odes i e where each model component has a biological_process as counterpart are frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological_interactions thus calculation of confidence_intervals typically has to deal with nonlinear stiff ode systems with a large number of parameters and v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com sparse observations of the model components in the case of linear_models propagation of uncertainties is well studied yet in odes parameter transformations to link the model responses linearly to its parameters are in general not achievable as a consequence the classical_approach based on fisher information is insufficient alternatively sampling approaches like markov_chain can be applied to infer knowledge about the model behaviour through dense sampling of the parameter subspace which is in agreement with the measured data nevertheless a dense sampling is not feasible for high_dimensional spaces known as curse of dimensionality in addition prior information which is essential for some sampling methods is normally not given in the context of biochemical_models which often results in a weakly confined parameter_space from which samples have to be taken to remedy these deficiencies the validation and prediction profile likelihood for arbitrary model observables have been introduced in based on theoretical_foundations made in hinkley and bjornstad while the prediction profile likelihood determines confidence_intervals on the model response the validation profile likelihood includes the noise of a potential validation measurement both are generated without sampling of a high dimensional_space instead the one dimensional model_prediction space is evaluated and parameters are computed via penalized maximum_likelihood thereby an efficient and reliable propagation of uncertainties from the experimental_data to the model response is accomplished and predictions as well as confidence_intervals are attained in this study we exploit that prediction intervals pis for different time points are connected through an implicit function this enables us to calculate a fast approximation of point wise prediction bands pbs for a certain confidence_level the term point wise will be omitted from here on to obtain pbs a system of odes for the time propagation of a specified point on the validation profile will be derived and a dedicated explicit integration scheme is applied together with elaborate correction mechanisms in contrast to pbs which includes the uncertainty of an additional measurement point wise confidence bands cbs represent the uncertainty of the current model only to deduce the latter pbs can be calculated for the limit case of a decreasing uncertainty of the additional measurement r the presented method is tested and verified on three established models for cellular signalling published inand bachmann et_al one of the main purposes of mathematical_modelling is to acquire knowledge about the outcome of perturbed experimental_conditions or not yet measured model components which includes arbitrary functions like the integral of time courses total concentrations or the recurrence time after stimulation this constitutes a challenging_task for large non linear_models with sparse observations as they typically arise in biological_applications sampling approaches like mcmc have serious drawbacks in this setup due to the curse of dimensionality they are feasible within low parameter dimensions or if appropriate prior_knowledge is present in contrast models in systems_biology often possess non identifiable parameters where the search_space is weakly confined the nonlinearity also hampers translation of one dimensional parameter profiles into pbs thereby the trajectories associated to the optimized parameter_sets for each point on the parameter profiles see equation are utilized subsequently the envelopes of these trajectories constitute an approximation of the pbs yet the uncertainty is in general underestimated because comprehensive sampling of the model_prediction space is not guaranteed by evaluation along onedimensional parameter manifolds see section to resolve the mentioned impediments a new approach based on re optimization of the likelihood with a varying constraint or an auxiliary data point was introduced in therein the one dimensional prediction space is evaluated to directly infer the prediction and confidence_intervals from the measured data apart from a constraint on the model response the confidence_interval can be obtained through decreasing the standard_deviation of the auxiliary data point too as a result pbs can be obtained by interpolation between pis for multiple time points in this article a fast integration method based on the validation profile likelihood approach is developed in order to attain accurate pbs the integration starts from an arbitrary point in time on the corresponding pi e g the thresholds for t leading to the pbs for the observable of interest in the context of statistical_testing the pbs enclosing the confidence region control the probability of errors of type hence they specify the probability that a single validation measurement at a specific time point is within the interval if pbs with high_precision are desired the integration procedure can be performed coupled with a correction at every step thereby robust and precise pbs still faster than distinct validation profile likelihood computations are achieved the superiority originates from the relationship between two adjacent time points expressed in equation and because only the auxiliary data point on the specified confidence_level a is required in contrast the validation profile likelihood approach provides a number of possible validation measurements with their corresponding v value which can be used to compute pis to arbitrary confidence_levels a the efficiency advantage compared with distinct validation profiles is eliminated when only a rough estimate of the pbs is desired or when the linear taylor approximation of the required sensitivities breaks down or requires a very small step_size in addition the methods mentioned above can be faster and still reliable if the model is in the so_called asymptotic setting and behaves approximately_linear an explicit integration scheme was chosen for the integration of pbs since the computation of second derivatives arising within the jacobian matrix of the right hand side of equation b is not efficient to circumvent the latter automatic differentiation was carried_out for comparison yet it was significantly_slower compared with the implemented explicit integration followed by elaborate correction mechanisms the scope of pis is to provide a powerful_tool for experimental_design and model_selection as well as to determine observability of different model components through integration pbs are available for the whole time span of an observable the latter comprises experimentally_measured conditions as well as extrapolation to new experimental_conditions and new arbitrary functions of both e g ratios or sums in addition availability of smooth pbs provides new possibilities for those functions like the duration for the recurrence to the initial steady_state concentration or the area under the curve the information provided by pbs can also be included in reverse_engineering algorithms for the inference of ode systems e g for the description of gene_regulatory via genetic_programming for this purpose the observability and width of pbs for specified model components can be included in the applied fitness functions for the special_case of fixed model_parameters the width of the pbs will be exclusively determined by the uncertainty r of the auxiliary data point i e the penalty term in equation therefore r provides a lower_bound to the width of pbs for a for experimental_design and the improvement of model observability regions with pi r indicate that the current model exhibits vast uncertainty there in such a case a measurement would provide_additional for reducing parameter and prediction uncertainties on the contrary a pi approaching its minimum characterizes an informative observable to discriminate the current from alternative model structures precise integration labels an integration with initiated correction at every step the respective models are published inthe propagation of parameter uncertainties to model_predictions is non trivial for large non linear_models yet besides systems_biology various areas in science apply computer_aided simulations based on large non linear differential_equations to study a systems behaviour all attempts to attain model_prediction uncertainties are hampered by the curse of dimensionality and a weakly confined parameter_space also the non linear dependence of parameters results in an arbitrarily complex shape of confidence regions for parameter_estimates which cannot be translated into pis through error propagation to elude sampling of a high_dimensional parameter_space the validation profile likelihood approach was introduced in kreutz et_al to compute data based pis thereby statistically accurate pis are obtained by continuous variation of an auxiliary data point whereby parameters are re optimized in this article reliable and smooth pbs over time are achieved via integration techniques with elaborate correction mechanisms which detect non observabilities of the model during the integration the idea is related to the validation profile likelihood and takes the auxiliary data point at the threshold of a specified confidence_level a as starting_point by decreasing the error of the data point the integrated pbs converge into cbs the efficiency and applicability of the integration method was successfully demonstrated on three established ode_models for cellular signalling the results of the validation profile likelihood approach for distinct time points were reproduced and an accurate integration could be executed roughly five times_faster the introduced approach_helps to resolve a main impediment in current applications of system biology namely an accurate and efficient computation of pbs and cbs which help to perform experimental_design model_selection and network_inference through e g reverse_engineering the presented framework and the examples used in this article are available within the software_package data dynamics which is matlab based open_source and freely_available www data dynamics org further instructions to execute
