data_and large_scale extraction of gene interactions from full text literature using deepdive motivation a complete repository of genegene_interactions is key for understanding cellular_processes human disease and drug response these genegene_interactions include both protein_protein and transcription_factor interactions the majority of known interactions are found in the biomedical_literature interaction_databases such as biogrid and chea annotate these genegene_interactions however curation becomes difficult as the literature grows exponentially deepdive is a trained system for extracting information from a variety of sources including text in this work we used deepdive to extract both proteinprotein and transcription_factor interactions from over full text plos articles methods we built an extractor for genegene_interactions that identified candidate genegene relations within an input sentence for each candidate relation deepdive computed a probability that the relation was a correct interaction we evaluated this system against the database of interacting_proteins and against randomly curated extractions results our system achieved precision and recall in extracting direct and indirect interactions involving gene symbols co occurring in a sentence for randomly curated extractions the system achieved between and precision based on direct_or interactions as well as sentence level and document level precision overall our system extracted unique gene_pairs using features from over full_text a complete repository of the genegene_interactions is a key for understanding cellular_processes human disease and drug response furthermore these interactions inform gene network_analyses that typically rely on curated interaction_databases two types of interactions are critical for understanding how a protein or gene affects biological or disease processes physical protein_protein ppis and transcription_factor interactions tfis ppis include interactions where two proteins physically bind to one another to form a complex or otherwise modify the function of one or both proteins alternatively tfis involve transcription_factors directly binding upstream of a gene to control transcription of that gene modifications to ppis and or tfis can have a detrimental_effect on their associated cellular_processes an improved understanding of both of these interactions henceforth called genegene_interactions for simplicity may help uncover the v c the author published_by after the tuning process we evaluated the extracted genegene_interactions against the dip database and against curation of random extractions in this work we developed a genegene relation extractor for the system deepdive and applied it to the entirety of three plos journals our system performance is on par if not better than current systems that have been applied only to abstracts we extracted direct_physical ppis indirect interactions and tfis to create a complete view of known protein and gene interactions by extracting both ppis and tfis our work enables not only the construction of protein_interaction but also how these networks impact or are impacted by gene_regulation while different groups have focused on extracting physical ppis other types of genegene relationships including transcription_factors are key for understanding biological_processes disease_etiology and drug response to build a complete knowledgebase of gene and protein relationships we extracted both physical ppis as well as transcription_factors with their respective target_genes apart from the impact these different types of interactions have on one another oftentimes a single isolated sentence will be too vague to deduce the type of interaction for example the verb associate can be used for both ppis and tfis and does not provide enough information to specify the interaction type evaluating a combined interaction system presents a challenge because there is no combined test_set for both types of genegene_interactions to properly evaluate we checked extractions in dip curated documents for missed transcription_factor relationships and counted them as true_positives additionally we performed a random curation to assess performance for both types of interactions by using the entirety of plos biology plos genetics and plos one we showed how scientific_knowledge about a proteins interactions change over the course of a decade as the plos family of journals is just over a decade old the majority of documents containing interactions occurred after with a larger corpus across older journals we will be able to show how genes grow or wane in popularity due to recent research in the future general relation extraction on full text journals spanning a decade or more will allow for more nuanced analyses about how our understanding on these relations changes over time we constructed individual binary features from sentences encountered in the training data that matched high_level feature patterns as this strategy created millions of individual_features we were concerned with overfitting the feature weights to the training data however the tuning process highlighted sources of overfitting that were subsequently removed from the system on the next iteration these sources of overfitting included highly frequent training examples that were removed from the training data after tuning of the features had a weight less than out of and did not impact the final probability of a given candidate relation the remaining features were not only learning patterns in a noisy training_set but were also learning patterns for gene co occurrence due to shared biological_processes that are not strictly interactions deepdive allows users to automatically annotate candidate entities or relations with distantly supervised labels to learn underlying patterns among the input_features by distantly supervising the training labels we do not curate each sentence to confirm that the two genes are interacting based on the sentence rather we label over candidate genegene relations as training examples even though most will be co occurrence using these uncertain training examples we were able to detect true interaction_patterns at the sentence level instead of providing a binary output or label for each candidate deepdive provides a probability that the candidate entity or relation has some attribute e g is correct thus we can select a probability cut_off to call a given output a specific label additionally deepdive is specifically calibrated to have accuracy correlated with probability the system calculates accuracy using the distant supervision training labels and thus this calibration represents deepdives performance based on the provided labels during tuning the user may discover that the distant supervision labels are missing an entire class of relations and thus incorrectly labeling candidates for example if one only uses random english word_pairs as a false relation then the system may incorrectly say all co occurringdeepdivegenes are true relations due to random genegene pairs existing with an easily_recognizable genetic context that differs from random english_words deepdive requires several iterations of tuning to remove noisy distant supervision gene_pairs and add or remove feature patterns at the end of each iteration of deepdive we conducted an error analysis to identify sources of error in the system we completed in depth error analyses before freezing the system for evaluation the false_positives from these error analyses were caused by unbalanced feature weights and training examples lack of training examples for a given feature low weighted feature and missing features important to note we did not aim to fix specific candidate relations but rather to identify either missing or incorrectly weighted feature patterns deepdives internal calibration and the user calibration are two distinct calibration steps with respect to machine_learning for the system calibration learning features to predict labels deepdive holds out a test_set from the training labels to evaluate deepdives predictions based on the input_data on the other hand user calibration refers to the process of adding and or refining features or training labels manually deepdives internal calibration plots are shown in supplementary plot a shows accuracy for the heldout test_set at different probability cut_offs this calibration depicts deepdives performance solely based on the provided training labels on the basis of prior work with constructing features we only required complete iterations of user calibration calculating an estimate of precision and recall on sample sentences before we froze the system to decide when to stop this user calibration we decided on an estimated precision and or recall of for a given iteration because our system ultimately extracts interactions from an input corpus we cannot directly compare on previously constructed interaction data_sets for text_mining this comparison would require new input documents which may alter results we evaluated our system against the dip interaction_database however this evaluation has its limitations one limitation is that the documents were solely from plos biology but the system was largely trained on plos one documents additionally the dip set contained ppis curated from documents with experimental_evidence that may not be well represented in our overall plos corpus there have been multiple papers and reviews focusing on protein interaction method comparison however we chose not to directly compare to other methods for multiple reasons first many of these methods were designed for abstracts only and may not perform as well on full_text due to different levels of detail in the full text compared with the abstract second these methods were tested on many different corpora and small_scale gold_standard data_sets in one comparison performed by performance_metrics vary depending on the gold_standard used in addition some methods such as pie aim to prioritize protein interaction abstracts or articles our system has multiple components including text preprocessing gene extraction feature construction and distant supervision a false positive_or can arise from any of these components however we were interested in the number_of from the text preprocessing and gene extraction stages an error in either of these two categories represents an impossible interaction in our system one or both gene symbols actually being an acronym for a non gene entity ng or two genes not occurring in the same sentence np as we wanted the highest recall for gene symbols and as these symbols are largely known and stored in databases such as ncbi gene database and uniprot we decided to find initial genes with a dictionary based_approach and have the system learn that a non gene entity cannot be in a gene interaction however we discovered numerous cases where authors only referred to genes by their full names or only used non human and non standard gene names to address these errors we could combine a dictionary based_approach along with a named_entity tool such as banner or gennorm or even deepdive to catch these non standard gene name variants sentence parsing errors occurred when two or more sentences were concatenated together with two genes extracted as a single candidate relation even if the genes were present in separate sentences these errors were introduced at the text preprocessing stage one potential solution would be to train the stanford parser on biomedical_text to learn the different forms of sentences tokens and parts of speech when complex gene names symbols acronyms and unknown words are frequently used alternatively we can apply the genia tagger to tokenize and label words with parts of speech however this would not address incorrect sentence splitting to investigate errors occurring at the extractor stage we can disregard these ng errors and improve precision roughly five points for curation positive stringent and curation positive all to and respectively disregarding the np errors precision for curation positive stringent and curation positive all increased two points to and respectively removing both the ng and np errors and focusing only on extractor errors the system achieved and precision for curation positive stringent and curation positive all respectively text_mining and applications require access to either abstracts or full_text for data_extraction while researchers have access to the majority of biomedical abstracts through ncbis pubmed_database access to full_text remains_limited as of july there are over million articles from nearly journals in pubmed central pmc but only available through pmcs open_access subset this set includes many journals that are not relevant for mining genegene_interactions but may still mention co occurring genes to reduce noise from journal selection we focused on relevant journals from a single publisher it is important to note that these three journals comprise almost of pmcs open_access journal_articles future system tuning on additional open_access journals will provide more interactions for use in the research_community deepdive contains internal parallelization and optimization to efficiently handle large document corpora we set deepdives parallelization parameter to run processes with a maximum of gb of memory not including document parsing with stanford corenlp runtime was less than h to load documents into the database construct candidate mentions with features and run the inference engine in this work we show the utility of deepdive and distant supervision for extracting genegene_interactions from a large corpus of documents while we tuned the system for three plos journals with over full text documents adding additional documents or abstracts would require several rounds of system tuning our work is the first application of deepdive to the biomedical_domain specifically we extracted genegene relations linked to sentences from over full text documents from three plos journals these relations are available in supplementary data this work enables an improved and more precise understanding of gene and protein interactions within the cell to further both experimental and computational research
