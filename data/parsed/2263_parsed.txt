gene_expression ibmq a r bioconductor_package for integrated bayesian modeling of eqtl data motivation recently mapping studies of expression quantitative loci eqtl where gene_expression levels are viewed as quantitative_traits have provided insight into the biology of gene_regulation bayesian_methods provide natural modeling frameworks for analyzing eqtl studies where information shared across markers and or genes can increase the power to detect eqtls bayesian approaches tend to be computationally_demanding and require specialized software as a result most eqtl studies use univariate methods treating each gene independently leading to suboptimal results results we present a powerful computationally optimized and free open_source r package ibmq our package implements a joint hierarchical_bayesian where all genes and snps are modeled concurrently model_parameters are estimated using a markov_chain algorithm the free and widely used openmp parallel library speeds up computation using a mouse cardiac dataset we show that ibmq improves the detection of large trans eqtl hotspots compared with other state of the art packages for eqtl_analysis availability the r package ibmq is available from the bioconductor web_site at http bioconductor org and runs on linux windows and mac os x it is distributed under the artistic licence terms recently eqtl_mapping studies where gene_expression levels are viewed as quantitative_traits have provided insight into the biology of gene_regulation among eqtls it is customary to distinguish cis eqtls from trans eqtls the former share the same locus as the expressed gene whereas the latter are located on loci different from the expressed gene many eqtls particularly trans eqtls form trans eqtl hotspots where one single_nucleotide snp is linked to the expression of several genes across the genome despite this observation most available eqtl_analysis tools treat genes as independent and as such these methods are underpowered to detect trans eqtl hotspots likewise some available packages such as ggtools allow for data analysis and visualization of results but are currently limited to univariate_analyses we present an integrated hierarchical_bayesian that jointly models all genes and snps to detect eqtls the ibmq r bioconductor_package incorporates genotypic and gene_expression data into a single model while i coping with the high_dimensionality of eqtl data large_number ii borrowing strength from all gene_expression data for the mapping procedures and iii controlling the number_of to a desirable level we applied ibmq to data generated by scott boyer and available at genenetwork accession_number gn the data comprise genes and markers in cardiac_tissue from axb bxa recombinant inbred_strain mice as measured using illumina microarrays we used million iterations with burn in iterations as suggested in previous_studies scott which took h using an intel_xeon e core processor using a false_discovery threshold of ibmq detected significant eqtls of which were cis eqtls where gene start is mb from eqtl peak and were trans eqtls the cis eqtls align along a diagonal in among trans eqtls ibmq detected three clusters of genes forming trans eqtl hotspots represented by vertically_aligned dots to verify whether the hotspots detected by ibmq showed biological_relevance and coherence we tested whether corresponding groups of trans eqtls showed enrichment in genes from gene_ontology go term categories using the david bioinformatics resources in each case i there was significant_enrichment for particular go terms and ii ibmq detected more trans eqtl genes than the univariate r qtl method for the three trans eqtls hotspots both methods detected significant_enrichment for the following go terms go cellular_component go enzyme linked receptor_protein signaling_pathway and go immune_response according to the method used these go terms ranked as either the top or the second most enriched category consequently the significance of go term enrichment was higher for trans eqtl hotspots detected by ibmq than for the corresponding hotspots detected by r qtl ibmq appears to show greater sensitivity to detect trans eqtl hotspots containing large_number note in the first column a position identified as refers to a snp at position mb on chromosome columns list the go term id and for each method the number of trans eqtl genes belonging to the go term category the total number of genes in the hotspot and the enrichment p value see_supplementary for details
