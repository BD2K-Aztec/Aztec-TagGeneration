gene_expression joint network and node selection for pathway based genomic_data analysis motivation by capturing various biochemical_interactions biological_pathways provide insight into underlying biological_processes given high_dimensional microarray or rna sequencing_data a critical challenge is how to integrate them with rich_information from pathway_databases to jointly select relevant pathways and genes for phenotype prediction or disease_prognosis addressing this challenge can help us deepen biological understanding of phenotypes and diseases from a systems perspective results in this article we propose a novel sparse bayesian_model for joint network and node selection this model integrates_information from networks e g pathways and nodes e g genes by a hybrid of conditional and generative components for the conditional component we propose a sparse prior based on graph laplacian matrices each of which encodes detailed correlation structures between network nodes for the generative component we use a spike and slab prior over network nodes the integration of these two components coupled with efficient variational inference enables the selection of networks as well as correlated network nodes in the selected networks simulation_results demonstrate improved predictive_performance and selection accuracy of our method over alternative_methods based on three expression datasets for cancer study and the kegg_pathway we selected relevant_genes and pathways many of which are supported by biological_literature in addition to pathway analysis our method is expected to have a wide_range in selecting relevant groups of correlated high_dimensional biomarkers with the popularity of high_throughput such as microarray and rna sequencing_data many variable_selection methodssuch as lasso and elastic_net have been proposed and applied to select relevant_genes for disease diagnosis or prognosis nevertheless these approaches ignore invaluable biological pathway_information accumulated over decades of research hence their selection results can be difficult_to biologically and their predictive_performance can be limited by a small_sample of expression_profiles to overcome_these a promising direction is to integrate expression_profiles with rich biological_knowledge in pathway_databases because pathways organize genes into biologically functional_groups and model their interactions that capture correlation between genes this information integration can improve not only the predictive_performance but also interpretability of the selection results thus a critical need is to integrate pathway_information with expression_profiles for joint selection of pathways and genes associated with a phenotype or disease despite their success in many applications previous sparse learning methods are limited by several factors for the integration of pathway_information with expression_profiles for example group_lasso can be used to utilize memberships of genes in pathways via a l norm to select groups of genes but they ignore pathway structural_information an excellent work byovercomes this limitation by incorporating pathway structures in a laplacian matrix of a global graph to guide the selection of relevant_genes in addition to graph laplacians binary markov_random priors can be used to represent pathway_information to influence gene_selection these network regularized approaches do not explicitly select pathways however not all pathways are relevant and pathway selection can yield insight into underlying biological_processes a pioneering approach to joint pathway and gene_selection byuses binary markov_random priors and couples gene and pathway selection by hard constraintsfor example if a gene is selected all the pathways it belongs to will be selected however this consistency constraint might be too rigid from a biological_perspective an active gene for cancer_progression does not necessarily imply that all the pathways it belongs to are active given the markov_random priors and the nonlinear constraints posterior distributions are inferred by a markov_chain mcmc method but the convergence of mcmc for high_dimensional problems is known to take a long time this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use

information of each network e g a pathway and incorporate it into a sparse prior_distribution to select individual networks for the generative component we use a spike and slab prior_distribution to choose relevant nodes e g genes in selected networks for this hybrid model we do not impose the hard consistency constraints used by furthermore the prior_distribution of our model does not contain intractable partition functions this enables us to give a full bayesian treatment over model_parameters and develop an efficient variational inference algorithm to obtain approximate posterior distributions for bayesian_estimation as described in section our inference algorithm is designed to handle both continuous and discrete outcomes simulation_results in section demonstrate superior_performance of our method over alternative_methods for predicting continuous or binary responses as well as comparable or improved_performance for selecting relevant_genes and pathways furthermore on real expression data for diffuse_large dlbcl pancreatic_ductal pdac and colorectal_cancer crc our results yield meaningful biological interpretations supported by biological_literature as shown in the previous section the new bayesian_approach nanos outperformed the alternative sparse learning methods on both simulation and real_data by a large margin now we discuss three factors that may contribute to the improved_performance of nanos first the spike and slab prior and its generalization in nanos separate weight regularization from the selection of variables pathways or genes both the generalized spike and slab prior and elastic_net can be viewed as mixture_models in which one component encourages the selection of variables and the other helps remove irrelevant ones however unlike the elastic_net where the weights over l and l penalty functions are fixed the spike and slab prior has the selection indicators over these two components estimated from data when a variable is the predictive_performance of nanos when the pathway structures are inaccurate when more edges are randomly_selected and removed from each pathway the performance of nanos degrades smoothly but still better than the competing_methods
