sequence_analysis bellerophontes an rna_seq framework for chimeric_transcripts discovery based on accurate fusion model motivation next_generation allows the detection of genomic structural_variations novel genes and transcript_isoforms from the analysis of high_throughput data in this work we propose a new framework for the detection of fusion_transcripts through short paired_end which integrates splicing driven alignment and abundance estimation analysis producing a more accurate set of reads supporting the junction discovery and taking_into also not annotated transcripts bellerophontes performs a selection of putative junctions on the basis of a match to an accurate gene_fusion model results we report the fusion_genes discovered by the proposed_framework on experimentally_validated biological_samples of chronic_myelogenous cml and on public ncbi datasets for which bellerophontes is able to detect the exact junction sequence with respect to state of art approaches bellerophontes detects the same experimentally_validated fusions however it is more selective on the total number of detected fusions and provides a more accurate set of spanning reads supporting the junctions we finally report the fusions involving non annotated transcripts found in cml samples the analysis of rna_seq revealed to be particularly effective for the detection of fused genes which have been shown to be involved in several diseases by applying rna_seq short_reads novel fusion_genes and in particular the vapb ikzf chimera have been found to play_a in the survival in breast cancer_cells in the analysis of single long_reads has been performed to reveal novel fusion junctions however the application of short paired_end has been recently demonstrated to provide higher dynamic range and sensitivity in supporting fusion_transcripts in paired_end to whom correspondence should be addressed reads both the forward and reverse template strands of each dna_fragment are sequenced the two sequenced ends also known as the two mate reads are spaced by a gap of unknown nucleotides whose size is approximately known the nature of the paired_end and the way they map on a gene_fusion boundary offer the opportunity to detect possible chimeric candidates shows a schematic representation of how the paired_end map on two fused genes according to the reads arrangement over the fusion junction two scenarios might occur as follows i each mate of the read encompasses the junction and maps on a different gene of the fused gene couple the read is considered as a read encompassing the fusion boundary ii alternatively a single mate of the read overlaps the fusion junction while the corresponding paired_end mate matches one of the two genes involved in the fusion in this case the read is considered as spanning the fusion junction encompassing reads can be used to find a first list of gene_fusion candidates while spanning reads are used to detect the exact boundary sequence since in the case of spanning reads the mate overlapping the junction breakpoint is discarded by conventional short_reads aligners these reads must be searched on the set of initially unmapped mates these reads are then mapped on an artificially constructed putative fusion junction from candidate gene_pairs previously detected through encompassing reads analysis in this work we propose a new framework for the detection of fusion_transcripts through short paired_end with respect to currently available solutions bellerophontes provides the following contributions bullet to improve the quality and selectivity of fusion discovery bellerophontes selects those fusions matching an accurate aimed at overcoming rna_seq challenges concerning multiple read_alignment novel transcript discovery and accounting for alternative_splicing in addition it exploits recent researches about the pattern of reads mapping across fusion breakpoints enabling a more accurate model of the fusion junction on this concern bellerophontes presents distinguishing_features with respect to fusion detection_tools proposed in the last year http tophat fusion sourceforge net in that it integrates these new instruments in a fusion_detection software framework in this article we report the fusion_genes discovered by the proposed_framework on experimentally_validated biological_samples of chronic_myelogenous cml and on public ncbi datasets of validated fusions we also performed a comparative_analysis with an alternative stateof art approach on the same datasets the results highlight that bellerophontes while recognizing the validated fusions reduced the final_set of predictions and includes fusions involving non annotated_genes in this section we report details about the effects of filters and the results about a comparative_analysis with another recently_published which has been used to discover gene_fusions in tumour_samples the proposed_framework implements a new analysis_pipeline that exploits effective alignment and annotation algorithms as well as a filtering stage based on an accurate modeling of the junction rnaseq_data analysis presents major challenges concerning ambiguous assignments of reads to isoforms that can impact fusion_detection indeed fusion candidates are discovered by means of encompassing reads as such the accuracy in detection of discordant mates is a key feature of a fusion_detection pipeline bellerophontes introduces a new approach where reads are mapped on experimental determined transcripts rather than using a reference_genome thus reducing the probability of multiple matches that may affect state of art fusion detection_tools based on basic alignment_algorithms
