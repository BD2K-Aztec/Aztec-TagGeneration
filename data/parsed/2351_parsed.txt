imat an integrative metabolic analysis tool imat is an integrative metabolic analysis tool enabling the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic_data with genome_scale models to predict enzymes metabolic_flux based on the method previously described by shlomi et_al the prediction of metabolic_fluxes based on high_throughput molecular data_sources could help to advance_our of cellular_metabolism since current experimental_approaches are limited to measuring fluxes through merely a few dozen enzymes modern genomic sequencing_technologies have enabled the rapid reconstruction of metabolic_networks giving rise to more than highly curated metabolic reconstructions published to date spanning all three domains of life including eukaryota bacteria and archaea additional computational_methods to automatically reconstruct metabolic_network models have recently resulted in draft network reconstructions for microbial_species such reconstructed metabolic_network models have been commonly used for metabolic_phenotype prediction metabolic_engineering studies of network evolution and biomedical_applications these studies employ various constraint_based cbm methods to analyze the network function by solely relying on simple physical_chemical constraints utilizing gene_and to predict metabolic_flux is a challenging_task due to the complex mapping between the two previous_studies have found a strong qualitative correspondence between gene_expression and measured as well as predicted metabolic_fluxes in microbes however the correlation between expression and metabolic_flux is generally moderate and in some cases significant transcriptional changes do not reflect changes in flux and vice_versa to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded_as significant changes in measured flux may not reflect transcriptional changes these discrepancies may result from post_transcriptional regulatory_processes that effect the actual levels of enzymes translated and from metabolic_regulation representing the effect of metabolite_concentrations on the actual enzyme_activity through allosteric and mass action effects several cbm methods for analyzing and predicting metabolic flux_distributions based on gene_expression data have been suggested previously the methods ofand becker and palsson use gene_expression data to identify genes that are absent or likely to be absent in certain contexts and search for metabolic_states that prevent or minimize the flux through the associated metabolic_reactions consider data on both lowly and highly_expressed in a given context as cues for the likelihood that their associated reactions carry metabolic_flux and employ constraint_based cbm to accumulate these cues into a global consistent prediction of the metabolic_state the latter method was shown to accurately_predict human tissue metabolism based on tissue_specific gene_and data its application has demonstrated that in many cases the activity of genes responsible for metabolic_diseases is not directly manifested in enzyme expression data though can still be correctly_predicted by expression integration with the metabolic_network the implementation of the method based oninvolves solving multiple complex mixed_integer milp optimization_problems requiring extensive parallel computing_resources and hence has not been readily_accessible for the research_community since its publication here we present an integrative metabolic analysis tool imat that is a web_based implementation based on the method ofthe new tool will serve the community by enabling the prediction of the metabolic_state of an organism in a specific condition given pertaining gene_and data we provide below a high_level description of the imat server with an illustrative example of applying it to a toy model
