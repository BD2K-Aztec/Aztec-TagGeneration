deep profiling of multitube flow_cytometry data motivation deep profiling the phenotypic landscape of tissues using high_throughput flow cytom etry fcm can provide important new insights into the interplay of cells in both healthy and diseased_tissue but often especially in clinical_settings the cytometer cannot measure all the desired markers in a single aliquot in these cases tissue is separated into independently analysed samples leaving a need to electronically recombine these to increase dimensionality nearest_neighbour nn based imputation fulfils this need but can produce artificial subpopulations clustering based nns can reduce these but requires prior domain_knowledge to be able to parameterize the clustering so is unsuited to discovery settings results we present flowbin a parameterization free method for combining multitube fcm data into a higher dimensional form suitable for deep profiling and discovery flowbin allocates cells to bins defined by the common markers across tubes in a multitube experiment then computes aggregate expression for each bin within each tube to create a matrix of expression of all markers assayed in each tube we show using simulated multitube data that flowtype analysis of flowbin output reproduces the results of that same analysis on the original data for cell_types of abundance we used flowbin in conjunction with classifiers to distinguish normal from cancerous_cells we used flowbin together with flowtype and rchyoptimyx to profile the immunophenotypic landscape of npm mutated acute_myeloid and present a series of novel cell_types associated with that mutation flow_cytometry fcm immunophenotyping is a powerful and highthroughput analytical_technique allowing the rapid quantification of proteins on cells in suspension on a per cell basis today it is a critical step in both research and clinical_decision for leukemias human_immunodeficiency hiv and a host of other diseases however a major_limitation is that data are typically analysed manually although the combinatorial space in fcm data are often vast investigators rely primarily on intuition to guide their analysis which may be errorprone and difficult to reproduce in answer the bioinformatics community has developed tools for computational deep profiling of high_dimensional fcm data one example is flowtype which exhaustively stratifies all combinations of markers and its sister package rchyoptimyx which finds those cell_types most important to external outcomes such as disease_state or patient_survival and distills these to their simplest possible form another example is spanning tree progression analysis of density normalized events spade which clusters cells multidimensionally then maps those clusters into a d representation using a minimum_spanning algorithm these and other approaches have recently been compared and found to be extremely_effective as part of a classification pipeline predicting acute_myeloid aml from healthy patients based on fcm data however in many cases the number of proteins needing to be assayed exceeds the number that the cytometer available can measure in a single run furthermore it is often essential especially in clinical testing to use negative controls either unstained or isotype to counteract technical variation across samples as a solution to this problem standard practice is to aliquot a sample into multiple tubes each of which is run to assay overlapping subsets of the total set of desired of proteins this process is common for modern clinical diagnostic fcm data especially when immunophenotyping leukemias where the standard method is to include the pan leukocyte marker cd in each tube and use this in combination with right angle scattered_light side scattered_light ssc to identify leukemic blasts in each tube separately for example the current standard for leukemia diagnosis established by the euroflow consortium recommends an colour multitube panel of overlapping reagents van without some means of combining tubes together existing techniques for deep profiling can only be applied serially to each tube in a multitube fcm assay which results in a substantial_loss in depth this can be illustrated with an example consider an assay with six tubes containing six markers each with two of those markers overlapping being present in every tube the complete number of distinct markers will be when examining a binary division of each marker into positive_and expression the total number of possible cell_types present is however working one tube at a time only cell_types can be elucidated in each tube for a total of for this example serial analysis can only explore approximately one hundred millionth of the complexity of the phenotype space per cell nearest_neighbour nn merging of tubes attempts to address this this method is founded on making the assumption that a cell in one tube is identical to its nn in another tube in terms of the common population markers the expression_vectors of all the nns across tubes are merged creating a single high colour matrix of cellular expression across all tubes nn merging has proven_effective as part of classification pipelines da however as others have shown and we show later in this article populations defined in terms of population markers are frequently made up of a mixture of cell_types and nn consequently tends to produce spurious combinations of markers this makes the merged output from nn poorly suited for applying the deep profiling techniques such as flowtype and spade as it tends to skew the counts of cell_types one proposed solution to this is to constrain the nns mapping with clustering incorporating domain_knowledge however this latter method requires that all cell_types expected to be present be prespecified in order to parameterize the clustering step so although well suited to diagnostic pipelines where the goal is to quantify known cell_types it is poorly suited for discovery of new cell_types there remains a need for a multitube combination method for fcm data that produces conservative non imputed data suitable for deep profiling in this article we describe flowbin an r bioconductor_package that we developed to fulfil this need flowbin is a complete pipeline for combining multitube fcm data via markers shared across tubes quantile normalization of those markers to reduce technical variation is included of the two forms of binning included flowfp is most suitable for later flowtype analysis while k means fits the contours of the data better compared with nns merging of tubes flowbin produces cleaner data with far fewer false double_positive marker combinations flowbin with flowtype can reproduce true data for more abundant cell_types and this data are suitable for statistical_testing albeit with lowered statistical_power increased type_ii error also importantly this is only true for cell_types of abundance suggesting that flowbin and potentially recombining of multitube fcm in general is not suitable for analyses_involving rarer cell_types we have found a series of cell_types associated with npm mutation in aml although many of these cell_types fit with previously_reported trends most represent new previously_unreported cell_types associated with npm mutation importantly we have also demonstrated that flowbin output can be used for downstream discovery analysis using tools such as flowtype and rchyoptimyx deep profiling of multitube flow_cytometry data
