gene_expression samexplorer exploring reproducibility and robustness of rna_seq results based on sam_files motivation data from rna_seq experiments provide us with many new possibilities to gain insights into biological and disease mechanisms of cellular functioning however the reproducibility and robustness of rna_seq results is often unclear this is in part attributed to the two counter acting goals of i a cost efficient and ii an optimal_experimental leading to a compromise e g in the sequencing_depth of experiments results we introduce an r package called samexplorer that allows the subsampling m out of n bootstraping of short_reads based on sam_files facilitating the investigation of sequencing_depth related_questions for the experimental_design overall this provides a systematic way for exploring the reproducibility and robustness of general rna_seq studies we exemplify the usage of samexplorer by studying the influence of the sequencing_depth and the annotation on the identification_of availability_and samexplorer is available as an r package from bioconductor rna_seq generated with nextgeneration_sequencing ngs_platforms are offering many new and exciting_opportunities from basic biology to translational clinical research however one important problem that have these diverse applications in common is the question regarding the reproducibility and the robustness of obtained results due to the novelty of rna_seq there are so_far only a few studies_investigating either the optimal sequencing_depth in general v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com or for context specific problems e g for identifying differentially_expressed de genes in this paper we introduce an r package called samexplorer that allows the convenient exploration of reproducibility and robustness of rna_seq results we demonstrate the utility of samexplorer by a case study for identifying de genes to demonstrate the applicability of samexplorer for studying reproducibility and robustness we use an rna_seq dataset from mus_musculus mouse this dataset consists of two groups with three samples in each aligning was performed with bowtie allowing mismatch for our analysis we consider three different annotations for obtaining_information about the robustness and reproducibility of this dataset w r t different metrics we draw m out of n bootstrap short_reads from the original sam_files whereas f m n corresponds to the fraction of subsampled reads i e f fraction of subsampled reads subsampled reads total reads the parameter f has the interpretation of a simulated sequencing_depth of a virtual sequencing_experiment furthermore for every value of f we generate r replicates see loop in each of these datasets is then analyzed with deseq to obtain a list of de genes in a we show the number of de genes y axis as a function of the simulated sequencing_depth f x axis for three annotations the three included p values_correspond to results from a friedman_test for dependent groups comparing the results from r user specified values of f horizontal slices see arrows for a fixed annotation testing_the of equal means ideally a nonsignificant friedman_test corresponds to statistically_robust results because a further increase of the real sequencing_depth is unlikely to change the results practically the friedman_test may give significant results indicating an imperfection in the robustness of the results w r t variations of the parameter f as is the case for the examples in a next we study the reproducibility of different annotations for fixed f values vertical slices see arrows as one can see from a the results for different annotations are diverging for increasing values of f making the results less reproducible w r t different genome_annotations the choice of f values is explored in the suppl file in order to emphasize that robustness as well as reproducibility are always defined w r t to a specific metric we repeat the above analysis for the common number of de genes between two annotations results shown in b further questions that could be studied with samexplorer in a similar way would be the reproducibility of results of rna_seq from different wet labs sequencing_platforms gene summarizations including introns tissue_preparations ffpe versus ff samples or statistical_analysis methods also the robustness of the summarization parameter for multiple gene hits or the number of mismatches for the alignments could be explored a cornerstone of any scientific study is the question regarding the reproducibility and robustness of obtained results unfortunately for high_throughput data from rna_seq experiments such questionsare highly non trivial to answer which may be an explanation for the severe underrepresentation of this topic in the literature samexplorer provides a flexible exploratory tool for investigating general rna_seq w r t user_defined metrics
