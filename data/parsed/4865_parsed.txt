genome_analysis vista region viewer rviewer a computational system for prioritizing genomic_intervals for biomedical_studies current genome_browsers are designed for linear browsing of individual genomic_regions but the high_throughput nature of experiments aiming to elucidate the genetic_component of human disease makes it very important to develop user_friendly tools for comparing several genomic_regions in parallel and prioritizing them based on their functional content we introduce vista region viewer rviewer an interactive online tool that allows for efficient screening and prioritization of regions of the human_genome for follow_up studies the tool takes as input genetic_variation data from different biomedical_studies determines a number of various functional parameters for both coding and non coding_sequences in each region and allows for sorting and searching the results of the analysis in multiple_ways availability_and the tool is implemented as a web_application and is freely_accessible on the web atthe recent_technological have allowed researchers to discover a wide_range of variations on the scale of a complete human_genome the role of single_nucleotide snps and genomic copy_number cnvs in human disease is becoming increasingly evident but it is often difficult to move from associations to the identification of causative variations the number of genes in cnvs may be large and non coding_regions may also contribute to the phenotype on the other hand the identification of functional snps requires predicting what impact a certain polymorphism might have on gene function this is relatively straightforward with sequence_variants leading to amino_acid changes in protein_coding since these are more likely to disrupt gene function however a clear result of genome_wide gwass is that functional snps with association to disease are as likely to be found in the non coding to whom correspondence should be addressed portion of the genome thus data obtained by several types of studies require an informatics approach to organize biological_knowledge and prioritize genomic_intervals for further analysis the current widely used genome_browsers such as ucsc browser ensembl and gbrowse use individual intervals on a reference_genome to display the tracks of functional_elements such as genes or rna investigating genomic_intervals obtained through cnv or other experiments requires looking at each interval individually while comparison of functional features in multiple intervals can bring new insights into genome studies we describe an interactive online genome_analysis tool vista rviewer a new addition to the vista suite of tools for comparative_genomics rviewer is designed to accept datasets produced by clinical geneticists either cnvs identified in copy_number array_comparative acgh studies or genomic neighborhoods of snps of interest from it calculates a set of important parameters for both coding_and and provides investigators with capabilities to compare the intervals and identify those that are likely to be significant in a particular study this tool also links to mouse phenotype and gene_expression data thus allowing for comparisons and prioritization of significant genes and non coding_regions across a region rviewer presents several functionalities not found in currently available tools first multiple genomic_intervals are displayed simultaneously allowing for quicker visual_inspection second direct links to gene_ontology pathway and mouse phenotype data allow for more rapid prioritization of genes and regions of likely biological_significance and third the annotation of highly_conserved non coding intervals brings an important component into the analysis and is likely to be useful for whole_genome studies to our knowledge software providing such functions is not currently available
