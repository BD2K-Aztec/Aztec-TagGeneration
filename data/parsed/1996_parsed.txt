data_and genetukit a software for document level gene normalization motivation linking gene mentions in an article to entries of biological_databases can facilitate indexing and querying biological_literature greatly due to the high ambiguity of gene names this task is particularly challenging manual_annotation for this task is cost expensive time consuming and labor_intensive therefore providing assistive tools to facilitate the task is of high value results we developed genetukit a document level gene normalization software for full_text this software employs both local_context surrounding gene mentions and global context from the whole full text document it can normalize genes of different species simultaneously when participating in biocreative iii the system obtained good results among runs the system was ranked first fourth and seventh in terms of tap tap and tap respectively on the full text test articles availability_and the software is available atgene normalization is one of the most challenging tasks in bio literature mining due to the high ambiguity of gene names as they may refer to orthologous or entirely different genes may be named after phenotypes and other biomedical terms or may resemble common names with non gene entities it is time consuming and labor_intensive to annotate full_text manually therefore a good assistive tool for this task may facilitate the process greatly there has been a large body of work addressing the problem of gene mention normalization prominer a strict dictionary based_approach relies on the quality of its gene dictionaries heavily proposed a method using gene profiles generated from pubmed_abstracts for gene disambiguation gnat is a rule_based and machine_learning ml based gene normalization system which used extensive background_knowledge built from open_source libraries and publicly_available resources geno employed a carefully crafted suite of symbolic and statistical_methods moara is a java_library for extracting and normalizing gene and protein mentions and currently designed for four model_organisms our software departs from previous systems in two aspects first it combines local and global contexts to normalize genes at to whom correspondence should be addressed document level the goal of this software is not to normalize every mention correctly but to suggest a list of normalized genes given a target document to assist human annotators most previous systems are normalizing genes at mention level and only local_context surrounding a mention e g the sentence where the mention was recognized were employed however due to the high ambiguity of gene names it may be insufficient to use only local_context intersentential or document level context can be helpful in this task second the software is designed for simultaneously normalizing genes of many different species for full_text it is not limited to any specific organism but rather deals with all species present in a gene database entrez_gene in this article genetukit is a software_designed for document level gene normalization which employs features from the local_context and the global context within the whole full text article it can normalize genes of many different species given a target article the software outputs a list of normalized genes and each predicted gene is associated with a confidence_score
