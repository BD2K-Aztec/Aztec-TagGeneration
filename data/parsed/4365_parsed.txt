sphinx an algorithm for taxonomic_binning of metagenomic_sequences motivation compared with composition based binning algorithms the binning accuracy and specificity of alignment based binning algorithms is significantly_higher however being alignment based the latter class of algorithms require enormous amount of time and computing_resources for binning huge metagenomic_datasets the motivation was to develop a binning approach that can analyze metagenomic_datasets as rapidly as composition based_approaches but nevertheless has the accuracy and specificity of alignment based_algorithms this article_describes a hybrid binning approach sphinx that achieves high binning efficiency by utilizing the principles of both composition and alignment based binning algorithms results validation results with simulated sequence_datasets indicate that sphinx is able to analyze metagenomic_sequences as rapidly as composition based_algorithms furthermore the binning efficiency in terms of accuracy and specificity of assignments of sphinx is observed to be comparable with results obtained using alignment based_algorithms availability a web_server for the sphinx algorithm is available atthe enormous microbial_diversity prevalent in natural_ecosystems represents a rich resource for discovery of hitherto_unknown microbes and the novel genes proteins they encompass estimates reveal that of these microbes cannot be easily cultured in the laboratory the rapidly_growing field of metagenomics directly investigates this microbial_diversity by obtaining and sequencing the entire genomic content present in any given environmental sample since majority of these organisms in environmental_samples belong to hitherto_unknown taxonomic_groups one of the biggest challenges for computational_biologists is not only just to catalog the known organisms but also to identify to whom correspondence should be addressed and characterize new organisms belonging to known or unknown taxonomic_groups these organisms could belong to an entirely new species or genus or family or order or class or even a new phylum researchers typically catalog taxonomic diversity a process referred to as binning by using computational_methods that identify the taxonomic affiliation of all the sequences obtained from a given environmental sample sequences sharing the same taxonomic label are subsequently grouped binned together accurate binning of metagenomic_sequences is a crucial step in any metagenomics project since wrongly binned sequences will affect hinder in the downstream_analysis of many subsequent steps such as sequence_assembly gene prediction and functional_annotation etc existing binning algorithms assign a sequence to a particular taxon clade if features of the sequence are similar to sequence s belonging to that taxon clade the extent to which these features are similar determines not only the accuracy but also the specificity of assignment the taxonomic_level at which the sequence is assigned besides binning methods are challenged by sequences generated by current_sequencing such as and illumina the short lengths of sequences bp produced using these sequencing_technologies make it difficult to identify features which are similar between sequences from closely_related organisms and are distinct from those from distant organisms one class of features used by binning algorithms is based on the similarity of the compositional characteristics of the query and the target_sequences a few examples of compositionbased binning algorithms published in recent_years include phylopythia tacoa and phymmbl phylopythia utilizes support_vector and uses oligonucleotide frequencies as training features to initially build organism clade specific classifiers these classifiers are subsequently used for assigning a query_sequence to an organism clade whose genome s is are most similar to the query with respect to oligonucleotide usage however svm based_classifiers used by phylopythia are not robust enough to predict the taxonomic labels of short query_sequences having lengths bp as a result in addition to most of the short_sequences remaining unclassified this method has a high misclassification rate another composition based binning algorithm namely tacoa also uses oligonucleotide frequencies as features for building organism specific models based on the gc_content of a genome tacoa builds a genome model represented in the form of a vector the elements of these vectors contain the ratiothe summarized binning results obtained with sphinx sortitems megan and tacoa for all four validation datasets are given in supplementary table a graphical_representation of these results is illustrated in as mentioned previously these results were generated using the ffn database in clustered sphinx and unclustered formats sort items megan and tacoa the results of sphinx sort items and megan obtained with ffn database are referred to as results with sphinx ffn sort items ffn and megan ffn respectively results of sphinx obtained using a reference_database containing both coding_and are referred to as results with sphinx fna current alignment based binning methods depend on exhaustive database_searches performing such exhaustive database_searches for millions of sequences present in typical metagenomic_samples would take enormous amounts of time this hinders research groups having modest computational_resources from using similarity based binning methods the hybrid approachsphinx presented in this article addresses this issue by adopting a reduced search_space approach using this approach sphinx achieves a to fold reduction in the time taken for binning compared with other binning approaches which depend on exhaustive database_searches on a single desktop with modest specifications intel_xeon quad core gb ram sphinx fna takes just about h for binning million sequences of the mouse gut metagenome binning the same set of sequences using sphinx ffn would have further reduced the time to an estimated h without significant loss in accuracy and specificity in contrast exhaustive_search approaches against the same database would require an estimated weeks for completing the same task furthermore validation results of sphinx obtained with simulated_datasets indicate that the binning efficiency of sphinx matches those obtained with alignment based binning algorithms which depend on the output of exhaustive database_searches e g sort items an examination of the results obtained for the same set of sequences with different variants of databases indicate highest binning efficiency in terms of accuracy and specificity with the sphinx fna database variant since it contains fragments originating from both coding_and including fragments spanning both these regions of completely_sequenced however results of sphinx obtained with a databasevariant devoid of fragments spanning coding_and referred to as sphinx c nc in supplementary indicate that using such a database variant results in an increase in taxonomic_assignments at non specific levels as well as an increase in the percentage of wrong assignments as compared with the sphinxfna variant these results show that the most optimal results are obtained using the sphinx fna database variant since our observations with clustered and non clustered variants of the ffn database indicate no significant loss in binning efficiency using a reduced search_space strategy it will be beneficial to adopt the latter strategy even for the nr database which is more comprehensive in terms of having sequences even from partially_characterized genomes in addition to sequences from completely_sequenced this will help in significantly_reducing the overall time taken by alignment based binning approaches the quality of reference_database clusters is an important factor that determines the binning specificity and accuracy of the sphinx algorithm though this study adopted the k_means approach in principle any other clustering method that can efficiently segregate dna_sequences of varying oligonucleotide composition in feature_vector space can be applied to the current workflow of sphinx the k_means approach_adopted in the present study takes only about h on a simple desktop to cluster approximately million vectors corresponding to coding_sequences of prokaryotic_genomes this includes the time taken for generating all the vectors as well as for obtaining the vectors corresponding to the cluster centroids the quality of the clustered reference_database is also dependent on the kmer size a typical metagenomic_sequence obtained using existing sequencing_technologies has a length_bp for such short_sequences the taxonomic discrimination capability achieved using lower kmer sizes is expected to be poor on the other hand the frequencies of various oligonucleotides obtained using large kmer sizes will be extremely_low and statistically_insignificant a kmer size of was used in the current study since an earlier study had demonstrated that tetra nucleotide frequencies carry an inherent taxonomic signal however using kmer size of limits the applicability of the current method for obtaining reliable taxonomic_assignments for very short_sequences especially those obtained from sequencing_technologies such as solexa and illumina the binning efficiency of sphinx also depends on the taxonomic coverage of the clustered reference_database the clustered database used in the current study contained sequences originating from completely_sequenced prokaryotic_genomes as more and more genomes are being sequenced updating the clustered database with sequences from these genomes will help in improving the quality of taxonomic_assignments updating the clustered reference_database with sequences from these new genomes takes only a few minutes since the process only involves mapping the new sequences to existing cluster centroids and subsequently recomputing the cluster centroids the clustered reference_database used in the current study contained sequences originating from prokaryotic_genomes in principle this database can be constructed using sequences from other taxonomic domains such as viruses or eukaryotes however given that the information content in sequences originating from non coding_regions which form major portions of eukaryotic_genomes does not conform to known patterns of taxonomic hierarchy extending the sphinx approach to such sequences will be a challenging_task it is also difficult to bin sequencesalignment based binning algorithms are observed to have greater binning accuracy and specificity as compared with existing composition based_methods in this article we demonstrate that adopting a reduced search_space strategy enables one to drastically reduce the overall time taken for alignment based binning approaches with no significant loss of binning efficiency this indicates the immense applicability of the proposed algorithm in rapidly mapping the taxonomic diversity of large metagenomic_samples with high_accuracy and specificity
