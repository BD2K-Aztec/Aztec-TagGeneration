novel domain combinations in proteins encoded by chimeric_transcripts motivation chimeric rna_transcripts are generated by different mechanisms including pre_mrna trans_splicing chromosomal_translocations and or gene_fusions it was shown recently that at least some of chimeric_transcripts can be translated into functional chimeric_proteins results to gain a better understanding of the design principles underlying chimeric_proteins we have analyzed chimeric rnas from humans we focused on the specific domains present in these proteins comparing their permutations with those of known human proteins our method uses genomic alignments of the chimeras identification of the genegene junction sites and prediction of the protein_domains we found that chimeras contain complete protein_domains significantly more often than in random data_sets specifically we show that eight different types of domains are over represented among all chimeras as well as in those chimeras confirmed by rna_seq experiments moreover we discovered that some chimeras potentially encode_proteins with novel and unique domain combinations given the observed prevalence of entire protein_domains in chimeras we predict that certain putative chimeras that lack activation domains may actively compete with their parental proteins thereby exerting dominant_negative effects more generally the production of chimeric_transcripts enables a combinatorial increase in the number of protein products available which may disturb the function of parental genes and influence their proteinprotein_interaction the splicing of mrnas is an essential aspect of eukaryotic gene_expression this process can occur in cis within a single premrna or in trans between two different pre mrnas in the latter case chimeric_transcripts are generated chimeric_transcripts can also be produced by other mechanisms including gene_fusion recombination and other mechanisms the defining property of a chimeric rna_transcript is a fusion of transcripts from at least two discrete genes the pioneering observations evidencing the joining of sequences from separate genes were made in trypanosomes though similar events have been shown to occur to whom correspondence should be addressed in nematodes and higher_eukaryotes more recently chimeric_transcripts were demonstrated also in flies in the case of the fly mod gene mdg the independently transcribed pre mrnas are formed a chimeric transcript with exons from the sense and antisense strands of the mod genomic_region other genes in fruit_fly incorporate both sense and antisense exons such as lola genes in the mosquito chimeric_transcripts were found to involve internal exons from genes at different chromosomal_loci in mammals chimeric_transcripts are frequently associated with cancer indeed abnormal myc mrna_transcripts a ubiquitous feature of tumor_cells typically involve one or more exons from another gene spliced to exon of myc additionally fusion_genes that arise from chromosomal_rearrangements have been found in an expressed_sequence est library and in a more recent study chimeric_proteins were identified in different human cell_lines the interesting empirical_evidence of human chimeras made up of two genes was supported in a subsequent study of the human cholesterol_acyltransferase acat hybrid mrna in which mapped the untranslated_region utr of this gene was mapped to chromosome and the remaining sequence to chromosome paired_end rna_sequencing of human_cancer led to the discovery of tissue_specific converging diverging and overlapping mrna chimeras finally high_throughput of fruit_fly mrnas identified chimeric_transcripts with complex genomic architecture although a large variety of chimeras have been described at the rna level there are still only a few examples in humans where it has been shown empirically by mass_spectrometry experiments that the chimeric rnas produce corresponding chimeric_proteins some examples of chimeric_proteins found in tumors are those that result from recurrent chromosomal_translocations which can be found in different patients with the same tumor_type although several studies have addressed the potential influence of local sequence_features on such recurrence the design principles of chimeric_proteins still remain_unclear for examples the preferential incorporation of a full protein domain from the parental protein to better understand the design principles underlying chimeric_proteins here we present an analysis of a data_set of human chimeric_transcripts recently the expression of chimeras in this data_set was confirmed by high_throughput we focused on protein_domains present in the chimeric_transcripts and compared their permutations to those contained in protein_coding transcripts generally found in humans we found that chimeras contain complete protein_domains significantly more often than would be expected if gene or exon splicing were assumed to be a random_process specifically we show that at hook gtp eftu mhc sh sh tyrkc ef h domains and wd repeats are over represented among chimeras moreover we discovered that some chimeras potentially encode_proteins with novel and unique combinations of domains given the observed prevalence of entire protein_domains in chimeras we predict that certain putative chimeras with missing activation domains may actively compete with their parental proteins thereby exerting dominant_negative effects interestingly fusion_proteins produced by chromosomal_translocations in cancers also incorporate the tyrosine_kinase tyrkc runt at hook dna_binding nup repeats nuclear signals and coiled_coil domains therefore we propose that production of chimeric_transcripts may produce active competition with original proteins and produce dominant_negative phenotypes in cancer finally it must be noted that chimeras can drive diversification of a given transcriptome offering the opportunity to acquire novel functional proteins we surveyed all the functional_domains in proteins encoded by chimeric_transcripts translated and we found that of chimeras tend to contain complete functional_domains of their proteins significantly_higher than in the corresponding random data_set of chimeras wilcoxon_test p e we noted that chimeras contain various well characterized complete protein_domains supplementary_material representing most protein_domains of those present in the genecode c human database remarkably we found that the chimeras in our data_set were significantly_enriched in at hook gtp eftu mhc sh sh tyrkc ef h domains and wd see results section below these findings complement our earlier discovery of enrichment in transmembrane_domains among chimeras moreover we found that that of chimeras confirmed by rna_seq in the study of encode complete protein_domains most of the chimeras are weakly expressed transcripts and they are very tissue_specific given the prevalence of entire protein_domains in chimeras we suggest that certain chimeras may actively compete with the wild_type parental proteins especially transcription_factors b all ests and mrnas from the chimerdb collection transcripts of human data_set c all chimeric_transcripts confirmed by rna_seq from all three aforementioned data_sets submitted for publication d the additional transmembrane_domains and signal_peptides were identified for the same data_set of all chimeras for all chimeras confirmed by rna_seq the additional overrepresented domains are actin here we show that chimeras are particularly enriched in eight types of protein_domains in conjunction with our earlier study our data raise the possibility that chimeras result not only in altered_cellular localizations due to a sizable enrichment in transmembrane_domains frenkel morgenstern et_al submitted for publication but also in the acquisition of a number of other new functions using the elm resource the position and length of each domain within a given protein was assigned and annotated thus the domain_composition and domain order relative to the protein_sequence was readily available for each protein allowing us to identify unique and novel domain combinations in chimeras of note as many chimeras have been evidenced by multiple ests and supplementary_material we propose that some chimeras may be produced by regulated trans_splicing and have functional advantages elucidating the possible trans_splicing mechanisms in humans remains as a promising field of research in this study we focused on chimeras in frame and chimeras confirmed by rna sequencing_experiments for all chimeras confirmed by rna_seq and in frame we predicted the protein_domains they contained and compared the permutations of domain pairs to those found in all proteins or in random data_sets using this approach we identified novel domain pairs that are unique to chimeras which incorporate transcription_factors as parental genes given the fact that even low expression of mutated transcription_factors can interfere with the function of the wild_type transcription_factor we propose that many chimeras exert dominant_negative phenotypes taking_into the protein_domains identified in the fusion_proteins we propose that dominant_negative effects of fusion_proteins may be frequent in cancer moreover chimeras may influence the proteinprotein_interactions of parental genes in the protein_interaction thus chimeras with domains from the highly_connected proteins will produce more consequences than chimeras from less connected proteins taking in consideration the recent_findings on the highly_expressed incorporated in the human chimeras and the fact that highly_expressed tend to have more proteinprotein interaction_partners we propose that chimeras can influence the proteinprotein_interaction of the parental genes having validated the existence of chimeric_proteins in eukaryotes we stress the need to take chimeric_proteins into consideration when carrying out experimental_studies of protein cellular_localization moreover the potential dominant_negative effect of chimeras should be taken into account when proteinprotein_interactions are studied finally we suggest that future_studies investigate if chimeric rnas represent useful biomarkers for the early_diagnosis of different different cancers
