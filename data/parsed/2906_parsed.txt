structural_bioinformatics metalionrna computational predictor of metal_binding in rna_structures motivation metal_ions are essential for the folding of rna_molecules into stable tertiary_structures and are often involved in the catalytic_activity of ribozymes however the positions of metal_ions in rna d structures are difficult to determine experimentally this motivated us to develop a computational predictor of metal_ion sites for rna_structures results we developed a statistical potential for predicting positions of metal_ions magnesium sodium and potassium based on the analysis of binding_sites in experimentally solved rna_structures the metalionrna program is available as a web_server that predicts metal_ions for rna_structures submitted by the user availability the metalionrna web_server is accessible atrna plays_a in many biological_processes it takes part in almost every aspect of processing genetic_information including decoding codon triplets alternative_splicing peptide_bond and the regulation of these mechanisms the function of many rna_molecules is dependent on their d structure the rna backbone is negatively_charged the neutralization of the electrostatic repulsion by the binding of cations is essential for the formation of compact tertiary_structures it has been shown in folding studies that trna stability increases remarkably in the presence of monovalent especially na and k and divalent mg cations however divalent mg cations are more effective in stabilizing the native_structure of rna the higher the charge_density of the rna the higher the concentration of cations near the surface and the greater the entropic advantage in using divalent ones because fewer cations are confined near to whom correspondence should be addressed the rna thus a small number of strong mg binding_sites maybe responsible for the effective stabilization of rna tertiary_structure reviewed by metal_ions also serve as essential cofactors in many reactions catalyzed by ribozymes the hammerhead_ribozyme group_i introns as well as ribonuclease p rnasep ribozymes are examples of catalytic rna that need divalent_cations to perform their functions reviewed by for example the cleavage of a phosphodiester_bond by the hammerhead_ribozyme depends on the presence of metal_ions that are required for both folding and activity the formation of rnametal ion complexes occurs in an aqueous environment the energy of electrostatic_interactions of a cation with water_molecules depends on its charge and radius mg has a small radius and can tightly organize six water_molecules in an octahedral arrangement followed by organization of further layers of water theoretical_calculations combined with experimental analyses suggest a total hydration free_energy for mg of kcal_mol k is larger radius has a smaller charge and it organizes eight or nine water_molecules in a less ordered manner with the hydration energy of kcal_mol three different binding_modes of magnesium_ions can be distinguished first partially dehydrated cations can interact with rna directly chelated by electronegative atoms such as phosphate oxygens creating very strong interactions second fully solvated cations can be stably bound to rna via one or two layers of water_molecules third cations may contribute to rna_stability without occupying discrete sites in a diffuse manner where they interact with the rna only by electrostatic_interactions without making direct contacts or perturbing their hydration layers despite the growing number of experimentally solved rna_structures the positions of cations in these structures still cannot be easily determined mg na and h o have electrons each and can be distinguished only in high_resolution hence many bound cations can be easily mistaken for water_molecules or may be missing from crystal_structures the positions of metal_ions are also difficult to determine by nuclear_magnetic nmr this situation motivated us to develop a computational predictor which only uses information about the rna_structure to identify the most likely metal_ion binding_sites in this structure we developed metalionrna a computational_method for the prediction of metal_ion binding_sites in rna d structures using a statistical potential and a grid based calculation approach the potential is based on the analysis of known metal_ion binding_sites present in rna_structures as an input metalionrna takes an rna d structure in the pdb format and returns pdb files with the calculated rna potential surface and the coordinates of cations predicted for the target rnastructure metalionrna is a novel tool for predicting metal_ion binding_sites in rna_structures it uses an anisotropic statistical potential trained on a database of known structures the current_implementation is capable of making predictions for mg na and k cations and further ions will be added as the database of rna_structures is expected to grow the fold_cross test proved that ion positions are predicted by metalionrna with useful accuracy as the method successfully reproduces the crystallographically determined positions of mg na and k cations in dozens of different rna_molecules a similar accuracy was achieved by the prediction of mg in dna structures which were not used for training revealing that the general mechanism of ion binding by both types of the nucleic_acids is sufficiently_similar to be captured by a coarse_grained method such as ours comparison with another fully_automated method feature demonstrated that metalionrna can identify true mg sites in rna_structure with a relatively low rate of false_positives suggesting that it may be a practically useful tool there are alternative_approaches for predicting metal_ion binding_sites in rna_structures with high_accuracy hermann and westhof applied brownian_dynamics bd simulations of cations diffusing under the influence of random brownian_motion within the electrostatic field to predict metal_ion binding_sites misra andpresented an analytical model based on the non linear poissonboltzmann pb equation that describes the energetic and stoichiometric linkage between the mg binding and rna_folding developed a statistical_mechanical model based on the pb theory which considers and ensemble of discrete ion distributions it models electrostatics and steric interactions for tightly_bound ions and uses the mean field fluid model to describe the diffuse ions the advantage of these methods is that they model the physicochemistry of the system and therefore can be used to infer dynamic and thermodynamic_parameters of the systems under study and its individual_elements an important feature of these and similar methods is the examination of the system under physical_conditions defined by the user such as temperature concentration of different ions possible presence of other molecules etc these methods are however computationally very costly and require specialized expertise to set up and run the simulations and to interpret their results the simulation_methods are not available as black_box packages that can take an rna_structure as an input and generate defined positions of ions as an output for these reasons they cannot be used to make predictions for a large series of test structures they serve different purpose than the automated predictive methods such as feature or metalionrna and these two types of tools cannot be directly compared the advantage of metalionrna is that it is relatively fast can be accessed by a_user and does not require special skills to interpret the results ion sites predicted by metalionrna are ranked according to their score which can be used to infer the relative order and strength of binding consecutive metal_ions by the given rna_molecule e g with increasing ion concentration metalionrna requires the d structure of a nucleic_acid as an input however predictions of ion binding_sites in nucleic_acid may be validated experimentally with methods that do not require the experimental determination of nucleic_acid in particular fenton chemistry makes use of the ability of fe to replace mg and to generate highly_reactive hydroxyl_radicals that can cleave nucleic_acid backbones in spatial_proximity of the ion binding_site the sites of cleavage can be then mapped with standard biochemical_methods this and other methods of experimental determination of ion binding_sites can be used in conjunction with metalionrna to model rna_structures in the more physically and biologically_realistic ion bound_state the next steps in the development of metalionrna will be to assess its ability to predict ion binding_sites in low accuracy structures and to explore the possibilities of integrating the modeling of metal_ions with software for automated rna d structure modeling by comparative or de_novo approaches we also intend to explore the possibility to include the ion concentration as a parameter of the prediction and to enable predictions for mixed solutions with different cations present simultaneously and potentially competing for similar binding_sites
