bioimage_informatics thunderstorm a comprehensive imagej plug in for palm and storm data analysis and super_resolution imaging thunderstorm is an open_source interactive and modular plug in for imagej designed for automated processing analysis and visualization of data acquired by single_molecule localization mi croscopy methods such as photo activated localization microscopy and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy thunderstorm offers an extensive collection of processing and post_processing methods so that users can easily adapt the process of analysis to their data thunderstorm also offers a set of tools for creation of simulated_data and quantitative performance evaluation of localization algorithms using monte_carlo availability_and thunderstorm and the online documentation are both freely_accessible at https code google comsingle molecule_localization smlm methods such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy storm and photo activated localization microscopy palm have recently_emerged to overcome the diffraction barrier offering times_higher lateral resolution and the possibility of d imaging by various approaches in smlm a super_resolution image is reconstructed from a sequence of diffraction limited images of sparsely distributed single photoswitchable molecules as the sequence is usually long thousands of images and the positions of the molecules have to be estimated systematically with sub diffraction precision it is crucial to use specialized software for processing the data we present thunderstorm an open_source interactive modular and platform independent software which provides a complete set of tools for automated processing analysis and visualization of data acquired by smlm methods our philosophy in developing thunderstorm has been to offer an extensive collection of processing and post_processing methods which were developed based on extensive testing with both real and simulated_data we also provide a detailed_description of the implemented methods and algorithms supplementary note as well as a users guide
