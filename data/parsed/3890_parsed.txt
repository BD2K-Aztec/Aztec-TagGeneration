phylogenetics raxml light a tool for computing terabyte phylogenies motivation due to advances in molecular sequencing and the increasingly rapid collection of molecular data the field of phyloinformatics is transforming into a computational science therefore new tools are required that can be deployed in supercomputing environments and that scale to hundreds_or of cores results we describe raxml light a tool for large_scale phylogenetic_inference on supercomputers under maximum_likelihood it implements a lightweight checkpointing mechanism deploys bit sse and bit avx vector intrinsics offers two orthogonal memory saving techniques and provides a fine grain production level message_passing parallelization of the likelihood_function to demonstrate scalability and robustness of the code we inferred a phylogeny on a simulated dna alignment taxa bp using cores this dataset requires one terabyte of ram to compute the likelihood_score on a single tree code availability https github com stamatak raxml light data availability http www exelixisphyloinformatics is facing a paradigm_shift toward becoming a real computational science molecular sequencing_technologies are developing at a rapid pace generating enormous amounts of new data due to the necessity to process and store huge_amounts of data we expect the field to undergo an analogous transition that physics or computational_fluid underwent years_ago projects such as the insect transcriptome_sequencing project www kite org already face these challenges such evolutionary_studies require software that scales beyond a single_node that can be checkpointed and restarted and that can accommodate the memory_requirements of whole_genome datasets under likelihood_based models raxml light is a production level tool for phylogenetic_inference on supercomputers that implements new approaches for handling load imbalance checkpointing and reducing the ram to whom correspondence should be addressed requirements of likelihood computations implementation details are discussed in the online supplement
