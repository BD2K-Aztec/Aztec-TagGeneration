pypdb a python api for the protein_data we have created a python programming interface for the rcsb protein_data pdb that allows search and data_retrieval for a wide_range of result types including blast and sequence_motif queries the api relies on the existing xml_based api and operates by creating custom xml requests from native python types allowing extensibility and straightforward modification the package has the ability to perform many types of advanced search of the pdb that are otherwise only available through the pdb website availability_and pypdb is implemented exclusively in python using standard libraries for maximal compatibility the most up to date version including ipython notebooks containing usage tutorials is available free of charge under an open_source mit_license via github at https github com williamgilpin pypdb and the full api reference is atthe rcsb protein_data pdb represents one of the most comprehensive structural_biology information databases openly available to genomics and proteomics researchers it provides an online interface for browsing amino_acid and genetic_sequences as well as crystallographic structures aggregated from a large number of sources it also provides sophisticated tools for visualizing protein_structure and sequence lineages aligning sequences and searching for homologies and it provides links to relevant entries in related databases such as genbank and uniprot the python scripting language has demonstrated its usefulness to the bioinformatics community as a means of unifying different data_sources and analysis tools allowing diverse data streams to be retrieved analyzed and summarized from within the same workflow this function has been complemented by new interface tools such as the ipython notebook as well as general_purpose analysis toolkits like biopython and biskit in this article we describe an api for the pdb that allows advanced querying of information on pdb entries similar utilities exist for programmatic querying of other large bioinformatics databases including ensembl pubchem and uniprot but to our knowledge no such tool currently exists for the pdb our tool facilitates integration of automatic pdb searches within existing python bioinformatics workflows and it simplifies the process of performing multiple searches based on the results of existing searches the library described here provides direct querying of the pdb using the python programming_language this api complements the existing pdb gui and xml api by introducing the ability to directly retrieve information from the pdb from within existing python bioinformatics workflows the use of native python datatypes to represent queries simplifies conducting multiple searches with similar queries and it allows the individual pdb ids returned in search results to be examined from within the same programming workflow as the original search the latest stable release of pypdb is available on pypi and can be installed with the command pip install pypdb the source_code of all versions of pypdb is available at https github com williamgil pin pypdb and full documentation is available at http williamgil pin github io pypdb docs html ipython notebooks containing usage examples are also available on the github website note additional functions provided in the documentation
