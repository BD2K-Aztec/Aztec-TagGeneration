data_and seth detects and normalizes genetic_variants in text descriptions of genetic_variations and their effect are widely spread across the biomed ical literature however finding all mentions of a specific variation or all mentions of variations in a specific gene is difficult to achieve due to the many ways such variations are described here we describe seth a tool for the recognition of variations from text and their subsequent normalization to dbsnp or uniprot seth achieves high_precision and recall on several evaluation corpora of pubmed_abstracts it is freely_available and encompasses stand alone scripts for isolated application and evaluation as well as a thorough documentation for integration into other applications availability_and seth is released under the apache license and can be down loaded from http rockt github io seth over the last decades a wealth of information about genetic_variations and their effect on phenotypes has been published in the scientific_literature however finding such variations the genes they affect and the associated effects on phenotypes is cumbersome due to the many ways in which variations can be described despite efforts towards defining nomenclature guidelines for genetic_variants den authors often use descriptive natural_language instead of following a suggested formalism which incurs ambiguity and uncertainty in which variation actually is described this severely hinders the usage of published variation data for subsequent analyses such as biological and clinical interpretation several tools have been developed to facilitate the identification of genetic_variants in text for a recent evaluation we refer to jimeno yepes and verspoor b but none of them is freely_available recognizes and normalizes mentions to an acknowledged nomenclature links variations to structured databases e g dbsnp or uniprot and covers a large range of mutation types seth is an open_source tool unifying all these features furthermore seth achieves consistent high_precision and recall on several publicly_available gold_standard corpora we introduced seth an open_source tool for recognizing and normalizing mentions of variations in natural_language text by rewritingvariants using the hgvs nomenclature and normalization to dbsnp seth facilitates indexing and information_retrieval of heterogeneous occurrences of the same biological variant across the literature seth achieves state of the art performance and is the only freely_available tool performing physical validation not only for protein_sequence mutations but also for dna variations variation mentions recognized by seth in pubmed and pubmed central can be browsed in geneview at http bc informatik hu berlin de
