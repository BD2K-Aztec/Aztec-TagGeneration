genome_analysis modeling nucleosome position distributions from experimental nucleosome_positioning maps motivation recent experimental advancements allow determining positions of nucleosomes for complete_genomes however the resulting nucleosome_occupancy maps are averages of heterogeneous_cell accordingly they represent a snapshot of a dynamic ensemble at a single time point with an overlay of many configurations from different cells to study the organization of nucleosomes along the genome and to understand the mechanisms of nucleosome trans location it is necessary to retrieve features of specific conformations from the population average results here we present a method for identifying non overlapping nucleosome configurations that combines binary variable analysis and a monte_carlo approach with a simulated_annealing scheme in this manner we obtain specific nucleosome configurations and optimized solutions for the complex positioning patterns from experimental_data we apply the method to compare nucleosome_positioning at transcription_factor in different mouse cell_types our method can model nucleosome translocations at regulatory genomic_elements and generate configurations for simulations of the spatial folding of the nucleosome chain availability source_code precompiled binaries test data and a web_based test installation are freely_available bioinformatics fh stralsund de nucpos the dna of eukaryotic_organisms is wrapped around a histone_octamer forming nucleosomes the basic dna packing unit of chromatin nucleosomes can impede the binding of transcription_factors to dna therefore the positions of nucleosomes control local dna accessibility and can directly affect the readout of dna sequence_information at regulatory genomic_elements thus regulating gene_expression the genome_wide study of nucleosome_positions has been made possible by high_throughput dna sequencing_techniques that identify the nucleosomal_dna isolated after digestion of the linker dna between nucleosomes with micrococcal_nuclease mnase seq however obtaining nucleosome_positions based on these mnase seq data is fraught with difficulties nucleosome_positions have an intrinsic biological_variability some nucleosomes such as the nucleosome at the transcription_start are known to be positioned with high_precision in yeast but the positions of other nucleosomes can vary substantially in addition the results reflect the experimental methodology used first although mnase preferentially digests the linker dna between the nucleosomes the nucleosomal dna_fragments obtained in this manner display some length_variation from the precise boundaries of the nucleosome second the proportion of the nucleosomal dna_fragments that can be identified is affected by mnase concentration and incubation time third the experiments probe a population of typically to cells each cell contributes its individual nucleosome configuration to this average which is potentially incompatible with other configurations accordingly experimental nucleosome_occupancy maps contain overlapping and ambiguous nucleosome_positions at many locations several approaches and tools have been proposed to extract nucleosome_positions from mnase seq data such as the following peak_calling on smoothed coverage data hidden_markov template filtering mixture_models and sliding_window statistics many of these approaches need an elaborate parameterization or cannot extract non overlapping nucleosome configurations and decide between overlapping peaks the sole identification of local occupancy maxima determines the average nucleosome_positions of a cell ensemble but does not cope with the sterical incompatibilities arising from averaging many usually unsynchronized cells if different configurations lead to overlapping occupancy peaks it is impossible to represent the data with a single configuration of non overlapping nucleosomes here we address_these with two approaches going beyond peak_calling we apply a binary variable approach that generates an ensemble of nucleosome configurations that when combined with each other reproduce the input_data with to whom correspondence should be addressed minimal error ambiguous peak data can be dissected into source components including non overlapping nucleosome configurations this allows quantification of the dynamics of nucleosome_positioning and of the relative occlusion of dna by nucleosomes for some applications like d modeling of the nucleosome chain or combinatorial transcription_factor binding a single optimal configuration of non overlapping nucleosomes is desirable even though the data are ambiguous we address this by applying a metropolis monte_carlo mmc algorithm that generates a dynamic population of non overlapping nucleosomes our simulation algorithm yields an ensemble of nucleosome configurations that reproduces the distribution of the input_data to find an optimized placement of nucleosomes we combine monte_carlo with a simulated_annealing protocol our approach compares_favorably to existing peak_calling methods and it was applied to the analysis of promoter and enhancer regions in mouse_embryonic escs and neural_progenitor npcs as well as embryonic_fibroblasts mefs derived from these the three cell_types have identical genomes but differ in their differentiation state comparing them by using our method allowed quantification of differences in nucleosome patterns and dynamics at binding_sites that have important roles in cell_differentiation furthermore we analyzed the nucleosome density at the samd locus for the three cell_types as an example of a gene that shows changes in gene_expression during differentiation we analyzed experimental nucleosome maps in mouse_escs as well as npcs derived from these and mefs for the same mouse_strain in a first step we identified non overlapping nucleosome configurations from the experimental_data as described in section we weighted the contribution of each nucleosome configuration using a least_squares method based on the weighted configurations we determined the relative occlusion of dna with nucleosomes and characterized the dynamics of nucleosome_positioning at particular genomic_features
