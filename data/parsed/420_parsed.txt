gene_expression a personalized committee classification approach to improving prediction of breast_cancer motivation metastasis prediction is a well known problem in breast_cancer research as breast_cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease with many molecular_subtypes predictive_models trained for one cohort often perform poorly on other cohorts and a combined model may be suboptimal for individual patients furthermore attempting to develop subtype specific models is hindered by the ambiguity and stereotypical definitions of subtypes results here we propose a personalized approach by relaxing the definition of breast_cancer we assume that each patient belongs to a distinct subtype defined implicitly by a set of patients with similar molecular_characteristics and construct a different predictive_model for each patient using as training data only the patients defining the subtype to increase robustness we also develop a committee based prediction method by pooling together multiple personalized models using both intra_and dataset validations we show that our approach can significantly improve_the of breast_cancer compared with several popular approaches especially on those hard to learn cases furthermore we find that breast_cancer patients belonging to different canonical subtypes tend to have different predictive_models and gene_signatures suggesting that metastasis in different canonical subtypes are likely governed by different molecular_mechanisms availability_and source_code implemented in matlab and java available atrecently large_scale profiling techniques such as microarray and next_generation have enabled systematic_screening of genomic epigenomic and transcriptomic changes associated with cancer these data have been used for disease_prognosis and outcome_prediction with an accuracy comparable or superior to conventional histological_grading based_methods however it is well known that cancer is a heterogeneity disease and that cancers occurring at the same tissue or organ can have multiple subtypes with distinct molecular_signatures and likely have different prognosis and treatment responses therefore the overall performance of such prognostic_models is still poor an intuitive solution to address the aforementioned problem is to design prognostic_models separately for each cancer subtype this simple solution poses two problems firstly the number of available training samples becomes smaller especially for relatively rare subtypes which unavoidably reduces the reliability and stability of the classification_models secondly and more importantly this solution depends on well establishment of predefined cancer_subtypes and unambiguous assignment of each patient to some subtype however the definition of subtypes may be ambiguous and evolve with time for example in a series of studies perou and colleagues analyzed gene_expression of primary breast_tumors and defined the subtypes of breast_cancer termed luminal a luminal b normal breast like basal erbb and more recently claudia low which have different survival_rates and responses to hormone_treatment studies on other datasets have confirmed some of the subtypes such as the basal like and erbb but the definitions of the other subtypes are not always consistent and are sensitive to the set of genes used and the set of samples analyzed it was suggested that the molecular_subtypes of cancer may be a continuum hence attempting to identify distinct subtypes may not be always appropriate in this article we propose a generalization of the subtypebased classification idea instead of relying on explicit definition of subtypes we simply treat each patient as if he she belongs to a different subtype and then construct multiple personalized predictive_models for each patient these models are evaluated for their performance in predicting the outcomes of the specific patient and only the good models are retained when a new patient comes a set of patients of similar molecular_characteristics are chosen so are their predictive_models the final decision is made by considering the predictions from all the selected models applying our method to three publicly_available microarray_datasets of breast_cancer for prediction of metastasis we found that our proposed personalized classification_method has much better prediction_accuracy than standard methods that either do to whom correspondence should be addressed not use cancer subtype information or use only the predefined cancer_subtypes importantly we found that our proposed method significantly_improves cross dataset prediction_accuracy which is critical in clinical practice to predict disease outcomes furthermore our results show that different breast_cancer require different metastatic classification_models suggesting that the metastasis process in these different subtypes are governed by different molecular_mechanisms in this article we proposed a personalized committee classification approach for disease outcome_prediction that was based onbasal lumb erbb and luma lumb represent the models displayed in cluster and respectively in
