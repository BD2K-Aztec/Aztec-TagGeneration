a simple yet accurate correction for winner's curse can predict signals discovered in much larger genome_scans downloaded from motivation for genetic_studies statistically_significant variants explain far less trait variance than sub threshold association_signals to dimension follow_up studies researchers need to accurately estimate true effect_sizes at each snp e g the true mean of odds_ratios ors regression_coefficients rrs or z_score noncentralities navenave estimates of effect_sizes incur winners curse biases which are reduced only by laborious winners curse adjustments wcas given that z scores estimates can be theoretically translated on other scales we propose a simple method to compute wca for z scores i e their true means noncentralities results wca of z scores shrinks these towards zero while on p value scale multiple testing adjustment mta shrinks p values toward one which corresponds to the zero z_score value thus wca on z scores scale is a proxy for mta on p value

conclusions fiqt is a simple yet accurate wca method for z scores and ors rrs via simple transformations genome_wide gwas represent a powerful and widely used tool for detecting associations between genetic_variants and complex_traits in such studies researchers directly assay and statistically impute genotypes for one to several million single_nucleotide snps respectively the gwas paradigm has been very successful in identifying genetic_variants associated with a range of phenotypes however as seen in gwas of psychiatric_disorders a considerable portion of the predicted genetic_contribution is contributed by numerous moderate signals which are not deemed significant at accepted genome_wide levels i e suggestive signals with the advent of large_scale wholeexome and genome_sequencing studies the field will likely see an exponential_increase in the number of such suggestive signal to successfully dimension future_studies e g for detecting as significant a certain number of signals which are only suggestive in current cohorts there is a need for statistical_methods that accurately estimate unbiased effect_sizes for suggestive signal snps and even all variants from genome_scans henceforth denoting not only extant gwas and whole_exome but emergent wholegenome sequencing studies as well given that effect_size estimates such as z scores ors and rrs can be theoretically translated from one scale to another in this paper we concentrate on estimating the true means noncentrality of z scores at each snp when estimating the true effect_sizes it is well established that the largest signals are generally the most affected by the bias known as winners curse i e their apparent effect_size is sometimes much larger than their true_values this is due to statistics with the largest magnitude having an extreme value distribution as opposed to the gaussian_distribution we commonly assume for a random snp z_score by incorrectly assuming a gaussian_distribution navenave estimators of extreme statistics have a tendency to overestimate the magnitude of these statistics in statistical genetics researchers proposed a multitude of methods to perform winners curse adjustment wca for studies with one stage discovery and twostage discovery and replication studies for z scores these wca estimates i e their noncentralities or true means are obtained by shrinking the z scores towards their null value of zero however a majority of these methods are only designed to handle mostly significant signals recently two new tools for estimating the mean noncentrality of all statistics in genome_scans were proposed the first the empirical_bayes eb method based on tweedies formula was adapted from a general_purpose statistical_method because it employs empirical estimates of the density histogram bins by default of scan statistics it is well suited for the large number of statistics from a genome_scan albeit less suited to instances in which the number of statistics is much smaller in the context of genome_scans this method was used by who found that the empirical histogram is less precise in the extreme tails off the distribution where tail adjustment ta methods provide better accuracy based on these observations the authors proposed an interesting adaptive combination of eb and ta which at the cost of increased computational_burden combines the best attributes of both methods the second of these new tools is a computationally_efficient soft threshold method which adjusts statistics such that their sum of squares do not overestimate the true mean because this method does not use empirical density estimation it is applicable even to a small number of statistics similar to wca navenave use of snp p values as a measure of association for snps will overestimate their statistical_significance this is due to the fact that due to the large number of tests many snps will attain very low p values even under the null_hypothesis of no association between trait and genotypes thus to be used in assessing genome_wide significance of snps individual p values need to be first adjusted for multiple testing after multiple testing adjustment mta the adjusted p values are much larger than the original ones i e they are shrunken towards the null value of one given that wca shrinks z scores towards zero and mta shrinks the p values towards one which corresponds to a value of zero on the z_score scale we argue that wca for effect_sizes is very similar in spirit with if not downright the homologue of mta for p values thus mta can be considered if not identical to a very good proxy for the wca for p values to accurately estimate the wca of z scores from a genome_scan i e their true means noncentralities we propose a novel twostep method which is inspired by the strong similarity between mta and wca first we perform a mta for p values e g by using a false_discovery fdr approach second we estimate the noncentrality of z scores by back transforming the adjusted p value on the z_score scale using an inverse gaussian cumulative_distribution cdf when compared to competing_methods we show that the proposed procedure has very good performance in terms of i squared error loss ii fraction of the variability in true means of univariate statistics explained and iii computational_efficiency a practical_application of this approach shows that due to their good performance the proposed estimators can be used to predict with reasonable accuracy the number and location of subtreshold signals that are likely to become significant in much larger cohorts among eb n methods we tested eb eb eb and eb eb and eb have intermediate performance between eb and eb with eb closer to eb and eb closer to eb data not shown consequently we present only the results for eb and eb measures of prediction_accuracy for all of the above methods are assessed based on the simulated and estimated noncentralities for all snps in genome_scans under h i e the surrogate for underpowered studies fiqt has the best mean square error mse performance everywhere except for the very small region of extremely_low p values where eb slightly outperforms it among the remaining methods eb performs best over the entire parameter_space and as expected mle has the largest mse we note that in marked contrast to the alternative hypothesis results that follow eb thoroughly outperforms eb under the alternative h a fiqt has better mse performance for settings with moderate to large number of signals and larger_sample its performance improvement over competitors is sometimes substantial e g for large_sample and medium number of signals eb does not outperform fiqt under any h a scenarios eb only nominally outperforms fiqt at smaller_sample surprisingly even though it was designed only as a tail bias adjustment ta performs reasonably well under certain scenarios e g large_sample it outperforms ebs for statistics with nominally significant p values and even slightly outperforms fiqt for a very narrow range of moderately small p values the better performance of fiqt is mostly due to the lower variance of this estimator in supplementary_material sm because when compared with eb and especially ta methods the bias is often somewhat larger however fiqt conservativeness at low p values negative_bias in s opens the possibility of future improvement which take into account the local ld of statistics as alternative hypothesis mse of z scores noncentrality estimates seefor background notation c s relative to mhh sample_size c c number of causal signals relative to the significant mhh signals alluded in discussion when measuring accuracy by r i e the explained variability of the z_score noncentralities fiqt practically outperforms all other methods albeit eb only nominally so due to its very simple computation fiqt has much faster running_times than competitors when compared to the next most accurate method eb the proposed method is faster by more than four orders_of in supplementary_material sm fiqt is also faster than the less accurate eb by almost two orders_of data not shown practical_application given that discovery phase of pgc scz has around four times the sample_size of its pgc scz homolog then the z_score noncentrality in pgc scz are expected to be twice as large as the pgc scz fiqt estimates seefor relationships between these estimators and pgc scz statistics by computing under a gaussian_distribution assumption the p values associated with estimated pcc scz noncentralities we predict regions supplementary to attain significance in pgcscz as opposed to only present in pgc scz the regions were obtained by clustering together predicted significant signals within kb of these significant regions a very high number overlap the independent chromosomal_regions reported by pgc scz a total of predicted pgc scz regions overlap the extended mhc region mb on chromosome p from the actual pgc scz findings as opposed to only reported by pgc scz of the overall of overlapping regions are in loci outside mhc regions as opposed to just reported by pgcscz
