genome_analysis completemotifs dna motif_discovery platform for transcription_factor binding_experiments completemotifs cmotifs is an integrated web_tool developed to facilitate systematic discovery of overrepresented transcription_factor from high_throughput chromatin_immunoprecipitation experiments comprehensive annotations and boolean logic operations on multiple peak locations enable users to focus on genomic_regions of interest for de_novo motif_discovery using tools such as meme weeder and chipmunk the pipeline incorporates a scanning tool for known motifs from transfac and jaspar databases and performs an enrichment test using local or precalculated background models that significantly improve the motif scanning result furthermore using the cmotifs pipeline we demonstrated that multiple transcription_factors could cooperatively bind to the upstream of important stem_cell regulators availability gene_expression is a complex process that is coordinately_regulated by interactions of multiple transcription_factors tfs and other proteins that form promoter and enhancer complexes the recent development of next_generation has made it possible to determine in vivo and in vitro bindings of diverse tfs on a genomic_scale i e chip_seq one immediate question is whether the peak regions are functionally associated with the transcriptional_regulation of target_genes an indication of such functional_associations is the presence of loci occupied by multiple_tfs or highly conserved_sequences across species hence an important step towards understanding functional binding_events is to study the presence of dna_sequence in the context of nearby tfs genomic_features and epigenetic_modifications to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as there are several challenges in finding motifs in peak regions identified from tf binding_experiments in the case where only a subset of chip_seq has common motifs de_novo discovery tools might not be optimal scanning for known motifs is faster and capable of detecting motifs that appear less frequently however the relatively short bp nature of protein binding_motifs can produce non significant results many tools such as gimmemotifs van tmod and moan have been deployed to identify sequence_motifs while rsat and galaxy provide more comprehensive means to analyse regulatory_sequences in general each method has its own strength in identifying potential transcription_factor tfbs however it is crucial to combine results from complementary tools and provide an intuitive_interface that streamlines peak annotation filtering motif_discovery and summary completemotifs cmotifs was developed to provide biologists an easy to use yet comprehensive web_tool for chip_seq analysis first peak regions are annotated with comprehensive genomic_information such as known genes conservation scores and repeating sequence_elements second boolean logic operations such as intersection and union can combine multiple datasets from different tf bindings or histone_modification states using the annotation and boolean operations users can filter and combine peak lists from one or multiple experiments facilitating the study of cooperative tf binding_events third combining the top_ranked motifs from three de_novo methods and known motif scanning using background models helps to identify novel or known tfbs of interest as well as possible co factor binding_sites
