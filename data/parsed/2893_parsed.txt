metabolome scale prediction of intermediate compounds in multistep metabolic_pathways with a recursive supervised approach_motivation metabolic_pathway is crucial not only in metabolic_engineering but also in rational_drug however the bio synthetic biodegradation pathways are known only for a small portion of metabolites and a vast amount of pathways remain uncharacter ized therefore an important challenge in metabolomics is the de_novo reconstruction of potential reaction_networks on a metabo lome scale results in this article we develop a novel method to predict the multistep reaction sequences for de_novo reconstruction of metabolic_pathways in the reaction filling framework we propose a supervised approach to learn what we refer to as multistep reaction sequence likeness i e whether a compoundcompound pair is possibly converted to each other by a sequence of enzymatic_reactions in the algorithm we propose a recursive procedure of using step specific classifiers to predict the intermediate compounds in the multistep reaction sequences based on chemical substructure fingerprints descriptors of compounds we further demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method on the prediction of enzymatic reaction_networks from a metabolome scale compound set and discuss characteristic_features of the extracted chemical substructure transformation patterns in multistep reaction sequences our comprehensively predicted reaction_networks help to fill the metabolic gap and to infer new reaction sequences in metabolic_pathways metabolic_pathway is crucial not only in systematic metabolic_engineering but also in rational drug_discovery for example of cancer drugs are either natural_products or their direct derivatives and many pharmaceutically useful compounds are produced by microbes fungi and plants it is estimated that plants produce at least metabolites and the total number of natural_products is undoubtedly much larger if microbes and fungi are also considered however the biosynthetic biodegradation pathways are known only for a small portion of metabolites and a vast amount of pathways remain uncharacterized even in human for example international_union of biochemistry and molecular_biology recognizes only enzymatic_reactions therefore in silico prediction of unknown pathways is expected to support the experimental_characterization leading to benefit not only drug_discovery and health_care but also agricultural and environmental issues there have been many successful studies on computational reconstruction of metabolic_pathways in organisms or in specific conditions of cellular_processes the most traditional approach is reference based framework where enzyme genes are mapped to appropriate positions in the predefined reference pathways using orthologous and other information across different organisms or conditions this framework is dependent on the predefined reference pathways i e the collection of characterized substrateproduct relationships that have been described in the literature or experimentally_validated thus this is not applicable to predicting unknown substrateproduct relationships or completely new metabolic_pathways in contrast a variety of computational_methods have been developed for de_novo reconstruction of new metabolic_pathways based on chemical_structure data of metabolites the goal is to elucidate novel reactions absent from the reference pathway maps in the reference based framework based on our current knowledge about known reactions and chemical_transformations to be used as training data the previous methods are mainly classified into compound filling framework and reaction filling framework the compound filling framework generates the chemical_structures of the intermediates even if they are not present in databases the users input the start source compound and or the goal target_compound and the methods predict intermediates and reactions between the two compounds to whom correspondence should be addressed this study provided a general method to predict the number of reactions to connect two metabolites the more the number of known reactions increases the better the predictive_performance would become however the recursive strategy chooses the smallest_number of steps with the fewest numbers of intermediates for given startgoal compounds there are some known cases where different organisms synthesize the same compounds using different pathways with different number of steps the further extension will be needed to obtain possible longer pathways with keeping the computation efficiency this study used a predefined set of chemical substructures kcf s however it is known that some metabolic_pathways use their characteristic chemical substructures this may imply that when the users want to predict pathways for a specific group of metabolites using the common substructures in multiple metabolites would detect the metabolite groupspecific substructures leading to the improvement of the specific pathways the preparation of positive_and examples is crucial in this study in the study of enzymatic_reaction likeness step likeness distinction of positive negative is relatively clear positive if a compound pair corresponds to a known substrate product pair and negative otherwise in the study of multiple reaction sequence likeness reversibility of reaction may affect the distinction of positive negative enzymatic_reactions are generally reversible in vitro but they are sometimes irreversible in vivo depending on the physiological condition these reversibilities are merely described in databases making_it to distinguish positive negative multistep reaction sequences recent metabolomics_studies enable metabolite driven approaches for understanding previously_unknown biosynthetic mechanisms at the gene level for genome sequenced plants we believe that this study will contribute to the understanding and the identification of metabolites and genes in the biosynthetic machinery
