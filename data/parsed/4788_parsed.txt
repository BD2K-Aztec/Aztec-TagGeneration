unified representation of genetic_variants a genetic_variant can be represented in the variant_call vcf in multiple different ways inconsistent representation of variants between variant callers and analyses will magnify discrepancies between them and complicate variant filtering and duplicate removal we present a software_tool vt normalize that normalizes representation of genetic_variants in the vcf we formally define variant normalization as the consistent representation of genetic_variants in an unambiguous and concise way and derive a simple general algorithm to enforce it we demonstrate the inconsistent representation of variants across existing sequence_analysis and show that our tool facilitates integration of diverse variant types and call sets availability_and the source_code is available for download atmethods for calling genetic_variants from sequence_data are rapidly_evolving beyond single_nucleotide snps to more complex variants such as short insertions_and indels short_tandem strs multi nucleotide polymorphisms mnps structural_variations svs and others these different classes of variants are typically represented in the variant_call vcf which provides a format for storing variant_calling results for diverse variant types generated by different tools different sequence_analysis software_tools often represent the same sequence variant in different ways in a vcf file making it non trivial to integrate and compare variants across call sets however the impact of ambiguous variant representations on the analysis of sequence_data is under appreciated and there is no standard guideline for consistent representation of variants here we provide a formal definition and algorithm for variant normalization our definition and algorithm enable the representation of variants in an unambiguous unique way we show that existing variant_calling software_tools often do not consistently represent complex variants finally we demonstrate how our normalization method helped integrate different variant call sets in the genomes
