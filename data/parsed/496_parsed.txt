databases_and a self updating road_map of the cancer_genome motivation since the cancer_genome tcga files have been accessible through http from a public site creating entirely new possibilities for cancer informatics by enhancing data discovery and retrieval significantly these enhancements enable the reporting of analysis results that can be fully traced to and reproduced using their source data however to realize this possibility a continually updated road_map of files in the tcga is required creation of such a road_map represents a significant data modeling challenge due to the size and fluidity of this resource each of the cancer_types is instantiated in only partially_overlapping sets of analytical platforms while the number of data_files available doubles approximately every months results we developed an engine to index and annotate the tcga files relying exclusively on third generation web technologies web specifically this engine uses javascript in conjunction with the world_wide consortiums w c resource_description rdf and sparql the query_language for rdf to capture metadata of files in the tcga open_access http directory the resulting index may be queried using sparql and enables file level provenance annotations as well as discovery of arbitrary subsets of files based on their metadata using web standard languages in turn these abilities enhance the reproducibility and distribution of novel results delivered as elements of a web_based computational ecosystem the development of the tcga roadmap engine was found to provide specific clues about how biomedical big_data initiatives should be exposed as public resources for exploratory_analysis data_mining and reproducible_research these specific design elements align with the concept of knowledge reengineering and represent a sharp departure from top_down approaches in grid initiatives such as cabig they also present a much more interoper able and reproducible alternative to the still pervasive use of data portals availability a prepared dashboard including links to source_code and a sparql endpoint is available at http bit ly tcgaroadmap a video tutorial is available at http bit ly tcgaroadmaptutorial the cancer_genome tcga is a joint project of the national_cancer nci and the national_human nhgri to comprehensively apply genome_analysis technology to the study of the biomolecular basis of cancer nci concretely this project has analyzed tumor and normal samples from over patients which resulted in the collection and public availability of types of genomic and clinical data for cancers these data types include gene_expression single_nucleotide mirna copy_number dna_methylation and somatic_mutations along with tissue slide images and clinical_outcomes since this data has been available via an http repository http usa gov otmjac this report details the creation and study of a road_map of the tcgas http repository created to enable the use of this unprecedented biomolecular data resource in the creation of web applications and enhance the reproducibility of biomolecular research delivered as elements of a computational ecosystem in a previous_report the authors have identified a resource_description rdf data model describing the contents of tcga file repository the resulting rdf map of the tcga contents is available http rdf s db googlecode com hg tcga rdf and can be efficiently traversed by a sparql engine to quickly discover which files document results that satisfy any number of the constraints recognized by the model for example as illustrated in a webcast accompanying that manuscript http youtu be bi bf tagu one could identify which files describe patients from a specific cancer_center that provided samples that were profiled for dna copy_number since then the tcga initiative has greatly expanded the number of patients the volume of data and the diversity of analytical platforms used the complexity of the data available has also increased each cancer type has a unique only partially_overlapping subset of available data types more importantly in there was a momentous change in the level of data interoperability of the tcga data repository data_files are now available directly through http calls to a central directory located at http usa gov otmjac this opens entirely new opportunities for interactive reproducible data analysis and visualization indeed as the tcga and other collaborative initiatives of this scope evolve and expand it is not reasonable to expect that they will conform to a narrowly defined format or structure for the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author s published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work in large data_gathering exercises such as the tcga the degree of conservation in the structure of the data decreases with distance to the biological signal in the case of the tcga this effect is manifest in the increased fluidity of metadata about files e g their location the protocols by which they are accessed relative to the contents of those files which remains static to capture this fluidity in a queryable fashion the tcgas open_access http site is scraped into a collection of rdf triples describing the locations of and relationships between individual files by capturing the date first seen the date last seen and the date last modified reproducible resolution of sets of files in the tcga is enabled querying for all files first seen before a given date allows reproduction of an analysis done in the past assuming none of the files have been removed similarly reproducing analyses performed before the initial scrape of the tcga can be accomplished by querying by last modified date rather than date first seen files that have been removed can be detected by looking for those with a last seen date earlier than the latest last seen date in the repository their existence in the repository indicates they at snapshot of a dashboard element showing the results
