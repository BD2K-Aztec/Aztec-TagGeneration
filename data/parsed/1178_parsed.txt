correcting population_stratification in genetic_association using a phylogenetic approach_motivation the rapid development of genotyping technology and extensive cataloguing of single_nucleotide snps across the human_genome have made genetic_association the mainstream for gene_mapping of complex human_diseases for many diseases the most practical approach is the population_based design with unrelated_individuals although having the advantages of easier sample_collection and greater_power than family based designs unrecognized population_stratification in the study samples can lead to both false_positive findings and might obscure the true association_signals if not appropriately corrected methods we report phylostrat a new method that corrects for population_stratification by combining phylogeny constructed from snp genotypes and principal coordinates from multi_dimensional scaling mds analysis this hybrid_approach efficiently captures both discrete and admixed population structures results by extensive simulations the analysis of a synthetic genome_wide association dataset created using data from the human_genome diversity project and the analysis of a lactase height dataset we show that our method can correct for population_stratification more efficiently than several existing population_stratification correction methods including eigenstrat a hybrid_approach based on mds and clustering and stratscore in terms of requiring fewer random snps for inference of population_structure by combining the flexibility and hierarchical nature of phylogenetic_trees with the advantage of representing admixture using mds our hybrid_approach can capture the complex population structures in human populations effectively software availability codes can be downloaded fromthe rapid development of genotyping technology and extensive cataloguing of single_nucleotide snps across to whom correspondence should be addressed the human_genome have made genetic_association the mainstream for gene_mapping of complex human_diseases for many diseases the most practical approach is the population_based design with unrelated_individuals although having the advantages of easier sample_collection and greater_power than family based designs population_based design is prone to population_stratification population_stratification refers to the presence of a systematic difference in allele_frequencies between subpopulations in a study due to ancestry difference between study subjects unrecognized population_stratification can lead to both false_positive findings and can obscure the true association_signals if not appropriately corrected there are three types of population structures that might be observed in genetic_association discrete population_structure consists of populations that are remotely related such as europeans africans and asians and the population_structure is easy to discern as the individuals are clearly separated admixed population_structure consists of subjects of admixed ancestry such as african_americans and hispanic americans with different individuals having different degrees of admixture and that cannot be separated into discrete clusters intercontinental gradients can also be considered as admixed although the degree of admixture is smaller than african_americans and hispanic americans in other scenarios we may see hierarchical population_structure that consists of both discrete and admixed population structures hierarchical population structures may be seen in studies that involve multi_ethnic cohorts which are becoming increasingly common in genetics consortiums recognizing the issue of population_stratification induced by population structures various methods have been developed to control for population_stratification two early approaches are genomic control and structured association the genomic control method corrects for stratification by adjusting association_statistics with an overall inflation_factor obtained from a set of random markers that are not associated with the phenotypes of interest however some markers differ in their allele_frequencies across ancestral_populations more than others thus the uniform adjustment may be insufficient at markers having strong differentiation across ancestral_populations and may be superfluous at markers lacking such differentiation structured association uses structure program to assign the study subjects to discrete subpopulations and then aggregates evidence of association within each subpopulation this method is computationally_intensive andpage to evaluate our proposed method we carried_out extensive simulations including discrete population_structure admixed population_structure and a synthetic casecontrol gwas dataset generated from the hgdp data which represents hierarchical population_structure we assessed whether the proposed method can appropriately correct for population_stratification by estimating type_i and also assessed its power in detecting disease association we compared phylostrat with four other methods including i the conventional cochranarmitage trend_test which does not control for population_stratification ii the eigenstrat approach iii the mds clustering approach and iv the stratscore approach for stratscore as suggested by the authors dr michael epstein personal communication we adjusted the continuous stratification scores obtained from principal_components rather than the quartiles of the stratification scores because this modified_version of stratscore generally leads to smaller type i errors than the original method under the simulation_settings we considered we did not compare with the genomic control approach becauseand li and yu have demonstrated its unsatisfactory performance for type_i and power estimation significance was evaluated at the level we have developed a new method to correct for population_stratification in genetic_association by combining information obtained from phylogenetic_trees and mds analysis our method represents relations between individuals genetic_background using a set of phylogenetic bipartitions and principal coordinates from mds analysis and incorporates them as covariates in a regression_framework to adjust for the confounding_effect due to hidden population_stratification as shown in our simulations this hybrid_approach effectively captures both discrete and admixed population structures it yields a more appropriate correction for population_stratification than eigenstrat mds clustering and stratscore under discrete population structures its performance is similar to these three approaches under admixed population structures to evaluate the performance of our method when the population_structure is hierarchical we applied our method to the hgdp dataset which contains real genetic_variation patterns although none of the methods could completely remove the confounding_effect of population_stratification phylostrat performs favorably against the other methods and yields type_i that are closer to the nominal level to test the performance of our method in real genetic_association we applied our method to a lactaseheight dataset and found that phylostrat is able to correct for population_stratification with only aims smaller than the number of aims required by the other methods our results suggest that phylogenetics is a robust and useful tool for inferring complex population structures and appropriate utilization of information captured by phylogenetics trees can help correct for population_stratification in genetic_association especially when the number of random snps is small we note that as the number of random snps used for inference of population_structure increases e g when m the type i errors of phylostrat eigenstrat and mds clustering are all close to the nominal level under simulation_settings we considered but the type i errors of stratscore are conservative with the patterns similar to those seen in tables and supplementary these results suggest that when only a small number of random snps are available one might consider using phylostrat to control for population_stratification but when the number of random snps is large eigenstrat would be a preferable approach as it is computationally faster it is worth noting that the bipartitions obtained from the phylogenetics tree can be used together with principal_components as basis_functions to build the stratification scores dr glen satten personal communication page
