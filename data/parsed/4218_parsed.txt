data_and shapepheno unsupervised extraction of shape phenotypes from biological image collections motivation accurate large_scale phenotyping has recently gained considerable importance in biology for example in genome_wide technological_advances have rendered genotyping cheap leaving phenotype acquisition as the major_bottleneck automatic image_analysis is one major strategy to phenotype individuals in large_numbers current approaches for visual phenotyping focus predominantly on summarizing statistics and geometric measures such as height and width of an individual or color histograms and patterns however more subtle but biologically informative phenotypes such as the local deformation of the shape of an individual with respect to the population mean cannot be automatically extracted and quantified by current_techniques results we propose a probabilistic machine_learning model that allows for the extraction of deformation phenotypes from biological images making them available as quantitative_traits for downstream_analysis our approach jointly models a collection of images using a learned common template that is mapped onto each image through a deformable smooth transformation in a case study we analyze the shape deformations of guppy fish poecilia reticulata we find that the flexible shape phenotypes our model extracts are complementary to basic geometric measures moreover these quantitative_traits assort the observations into distinct groups and can be mapped to polymorphic genetic_loci of the sample set with the advent_of genotyping techniques an unprecedented breadth of genotypic datasets can be generated opening doors to large_scale association studies promising sufficient power to understand the genetic underpinning of more subtle phenotypes that characterize the sample as phenotyping often to whom correspondence should be addressed requires manual labor and expert_knowledge a major_bottleneck now lies with the identification and quantification of informative traits currently the quantification of phenotypic_traits is predominantly done in a semi manual fashion rendering the task of analyzing large_datasets expensive time consuming and error_prone in order to address these shortcomings the automated analysis of biological images has become a staple in modern biology high_throughput imaging_techniques for various types of microscopy and other imaging_modalities have become common in the experimental environment automated_image for bioimaging attempts to deal with the flood of data and subsumes a large variety of tasks and methods for a comprehensive_review see peng and common tasks include the counting of cells in microscopy_images and differential analysis of distinct cell_types key_challenges in bioimage_informatics stem from the breadth and individuality of natural_variation within these images and dealing with the inherent noise in biological imaging tasks in order to deal with these factors machine_learning have raised considerable attention and are used to tackle various complicated tasks in realistic settings for example in the analysis of appearance phenotypes machine vision has been used to quantify the extent of existence of predefined visual_features or detect interesting appearance features that characterize the data visual appearance features usually pertain to specific local properties of the depicted objects however more general visual phenotypes often are also biologically informative such as the description of the shape of an object and the quantification of global including size and height as well as local i e locally deformed parts of an image shape variations an example where such a method is useful is the characterization of the shapes of guppy fish which so_far can only be analyzed by labor_intensive manual geometric phenotype measurements on hundreds of fish as performed in our goal is to automatically_determine and quantify differences among observed shapes in biological images in order to interpret them as shape phenotypes and facilitate downstream_analysis for instance association tests of traits with putative causal_factors in the genome in this work we propose an unsupervised machine_learning to quantify shape variations of a given object class depictedin a set of images one per individual or sample we postulate the existence of an unobserved reference shape called a template we proceed with joint learning of this shared template and the imagespecific shape deviation from this reference allowing every image to be aligned to it the resulting template iteratively converges to an idealized mean image from which the observed images are generated through deformation fields that explain the variation in shape of each image the converged model can also be run backwards yielding a reconstruction of every image from the template and the mapping fields r in the general task of aligning two or more images is also known as registration where a correspondence between pixels of one image and pixels of another image is established for exampleperform a simpler form of registration where images are aligned to a known template in contrast to previous_studies our method does not require explicit knowledge of the template a priori neither is supervision like setting of landmarks or outline selection binarization on each image required instead shapepheno discovers and objectively quantifies deformation phenotypes on unannotated images in a fully unsupervised fashion while retaining interpretable features and results thus our approach_facilitates obtaining accurate non trivial measurements on large_datasets where human labor is costly and error_prone in section we present a case study of our method on guppy fish poecilia reticulata the individuals in this dataset are subject to variation in appearance and shape interestingly both appearance and shape variability have previously been shown to exhibit considerable genetic components in section we describe the basic approach of quantifying shape phenotypes using our model we demonstrate that these quantitative_traits are orthogonal to traditional geometric measures section and show practical utility of these traits in the context of two fundamental types of downstream_analyses first in section we show how learned shape_features allow for grouping the observed images into plausible similarly shaped or deformed subgroups based on characteristic deformation patterns second in section we show that quantitative shape phenotypes can be associated to variable genetic_loci in the guppy genome this analysis serves both as a step towards obtaining further knowledge as to the underlying biological_processes that lead to variation of these phenotypes as well as a natural validation step suggesting that the automatically determined phenotypes are biologically_relevant we applied shapepheno to a dataset that shows the lateral aspect of male guppy fish p reticulata the goal was to obtain local deformation patterns that are informative about typical distortions of the shape among the individuals which also display considerable variation of appearance traits and size we demonstrate further use of our method in two tasks clustering of populations according to deformation patterns and association studies to link genotypes to deformation phenotypes we have proposed a generative probabilistic_model that extracts deformation phenotypes by registering images to a latent learned template in an unsupervised fashion our method presents a novel clean framework for researchers to quantify and describe subtle local deformation patterns and use them for downstream_analyses like clustering or genetic_association tests we applied our method to a bioimaging task where we discovered significant deformation patterns in images of guppy fish we also showed that shapepheno can be used for automated quantification of geometric measurements and showed good correspondence to manually labeled data more important than accurate geometric traits shapepheno yielded deformation fields that characterize the variability in shape and could be used to identify low_rank pca factors genome_wide association plot showing the association strengths with the first two pca deformation phenotypes corresponding to the x and y direction the significance threshold of false_discovery fdr is shown as thin line in the diagram snps are plotted in order of linkage_groups while significant hits on lg as described in section are highlighted lg contains markers with function in sex_determination yielding additional informative peaks for shape determination of shape variability while simple distance measurements intercorrelate strongly the deformation phenotypes we propose describe orthogonal shape factors and are thus novel holistic descriptors of shape we showed practical utility of these pca deformation phenotypes in the context of clustering grouping the data into clusters exhibiting characteristic deformation we also performed a gwas with the same traits which yielded biologically sound results in agreement with previous results on geometric approximations of shape seeand unpublished observations of c d we are convinced that comprehensive genomic_analyses on larger datasets can be performed by using this method with a rigorous treatment of image_acquisition higher image_resolution and higher marker_density unsupervised extraction and quantification of subtle morphological phenotypes as done here is the logical next step in automated_image the relevance of these new types of methods is expected to rise quickly as dataset sizes increase providing the necessary statistical_power to identify and quantify complex phenotypic_variation
