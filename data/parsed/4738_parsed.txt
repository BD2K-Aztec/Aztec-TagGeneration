genetics_and treeqtl hierarchical error control for eqtl findings commonly used multiplicity adjustments fail to control the error_rate for reported findings in many expression_quantitative eqtl studies treeqtl implements a hierarchical multiple testing procedure which allows control of appropriate error_rates defined relative to a grouping of the eqtl hypotheses availability_and the r package treeqtl is available for download atthe goal of eqtl_analysis is to gain insight into the genetic_regulation of gene_expression typically this is carried_out by testing a vast collection of hypotheses h vg probing association between the genotype at variant v and the measured expression for gene g where v m g g m is on the order of hundreds of thousands and g of tens_of given the large number of hypotheses tested the need to adjust for multiplicity is universally recognized and the false_discovery fdr is typically adopted as the target global error_rate in an effort to improve interpretability reporting of results is typically organized along more general findings such as the discovery of genes subject to local regulation egenes or regulatory snps esnps the adopted strategy for multiplicity adjustment needs then to offer guarantees on these reported global discoveries for example imagine testing the h vg hypotheses using the bh rule and defining as an esnp those variants v for which h vg is rejected for at least some gene g while this would control the fdr among the h vg rejections it would not control any measure of global error for the discovery of esnps as shown by the simulations inresearchers in the eqtl field have recognized this challenge and have additionally noted that since local regulation is more common than distal hypotheses probing these two mechanisms should be tested separately however there is no single standard in the literature for error_rates targeted or error controlling strategies for example one finds the notion of pergene error_rates or the application of bonferroni across genes in local regulation while for distal effects significance cut_offs vary from to this makes comparison across studies and replicability challenging
