mulrf a software_package for phylogenetic_analysis using multi copy gene_trees mulrf is a platform independent software_package for phylogenetic_analysis using multi copy gene_trees it seeks the species_tree that minimizes the robinsonfoulds rf distance to the input trees using a generalization of the rf distance to multi labeled trees the underlying generic tree distance measure and fast running time make mulrf useful for inferring phylogenies from large collections of gene_trees in which multiple evolutionary_processes as well as phylogenetic error may contribute to gene_tree discord mulrf implements several features for customizing the species_tree search and assessing the results and it provides a user_friendly graphical_user gui with tree visualization the species_tree search is implemented in c and the gui in java swing availability mulrfs executable as well as sample datasets and manual are available atresolving phylogenetic_trees from large genomic_datasets remains a challenge for evolutionary_biologists one major_problem is to reconcile the often conflicting phylogenetic signals from different genes although some of these conflicts can be explained by stochastic or systematic_error biological_processes such as incomplete_lineage gene_duplication and loss and lateral transfer also contribute to gene_tree discord an effective phylogenetic method must address the multiple sources of discord among gene_trees while remaining computationally_tractable for large genomic_datasets non probabilistic methods like those implemented in genetree igtp phylonet and sprsupertree and probabilistic methods like those implemented in best beast stem mp est and phyldog can infer species_trees while accounting for incongruence among genes although these methods differ widely in their details with the exception of bucky their reconciliation models are based on a single biological cause of discordance among gene_trees e g deep coalescence also some of these methods like sprsupertree and bucky are designed only for singly labeled input trees introduced an alternative approach for building unrooted species_trees from collections of unrooted multi copy gene_trees i e trees with multiple leaves having the same label this approach is based on the mulrf distance a generalization of the robinsonfoulds rf distance the mulrf distance between a species_tree and an input gene_tree is obtained by first extending the species_tree by adding additional copies of a leaf label in the star tree_topology the rf distance is then calculated between the multi copy gene_tree and the extended species_tree the mulrf distance between a species_tree and an input gene_tree can be computed in time linear in the number of leaves of the multicopy gene_tree a mulrf supertree is a species_tree that minimizes the sum of the mulrf distances to the input gene_trees the mulrf cost_function is not explicitly linked to any biological_process and its input gene_trees are not limited to orthologous gene sequences computing mulrf supertrees is np_hard but there is an efficient hill climbing heuristic for estimating them based on the unrooted subtree prune and regraft spr local_search here we describe mulrf version a software_package that incorporates this heuristic along with several features to improve the species_tree search and assess the results these features include the ability to i weight the input gene_trees ii constrain the species tree_topology in the tree search iii automate multiple heuristic searches and iv evaluate the score of alternate species tree_topologies the software_package also provides a graphical_user with tree visualization to facilitate the evaluation of the results mulrf is a software_package for phylogenetic_inference using multi copy gene_trees based on a generalization of the rf distance in experiments on biological or simulated_datasets mulrf has performed well compared with both probabilistic and non probabilistic supertree approaches mulrfs speed and performance on a variety of datasets suggests that the program is well suited for species_tree reconstruction from large genomic_datasets multi copy gene_tree g and the species_tree s the extension s of s relative to g is also shown the mulrf distance between g and s which is the rf distance between g and s is
