experimental_design schemes for learning boolean_network models_motivation a holy_grail of biological_research is a working_model of the cell current modeling frameworks especially in the proteinpro tein interaction_domain are mostly topological in nature calling for stronger and more expressive network models one promising alternative is logic_based or boolean_network modeling which was successfully_applied to model signaling regulatory_circuits in human learning such models requires observing the system under a sufficient number of different conditions to date the amount of measured data is the main bottleneck in learning informative boolean models underscoring the need for efficient experimental_design strategies results we developed novel design approaches that greedily select an experiment to be performed so as to maximize the difference or the entropy in the results it induces with respect to current best fit models unique to our maximum_difference approach is the ability to account for all possibly exponential number of boolean models displaying high fit to the available data we applied both approaches to simulated_and from the efgr and il signaling_systems in human we demonstrate the utility of the developed strategies in substantially improving on a random_selection approach our design schemes highlight the redundancy in these datasets leading up to fold savings in the number of experiments to be performed availability_and source_code will be made available upon acceptance of the manuscript network_analysis tools have become over the last decade the method of choice for studying genome_wide data yielding important insights into gene function interaction and evolution nevertheless most of these tools especially in the proteinprotein interaction_domain have been limited to pure topological_analysis of the pertaining networks calling for stronger and more expressive network models recently boolean_network modeling has been successfully attempted at signaling_networks yielding a qualitative functional understanding of signaling_pathways and the ability to predict their behavior under different perturbations and environmental_cues however because of the sparsity of the currently available data learning such models de_novo remains a formidable task requiring computational strategies to efficiently prioritize experimental_conditions that will best reveal the underlying model we refer the reader tofor a comprehensive survey of boolean modeling an alternative modeling_technique for signaling_pathways dynamics based_on odes was thoroughly studied these equations offer a mechanistic chemically based view on the change in the level of cellular species as a function of the levels of their interactors the dependency of such a detailed modeling on the availability of experimental_data has triggered two lines of work of algorithmic experimental_design the first addressing the challenge in parameter_estimation and the second addressing the model identification problem nevertheless the application of this formalism to largescale modeling is limited by the large number of required parameters whose estimation is difficult in contrast to the relatively rich literature on odes experimental design_algorithms for boolean_networks are scarce proposed an experimental_design scheme involving two principal entities a predictor that generates models given an experimental_data and a chooser that selects the next experiment to be conducted based on information_theoretic principles these two entities were used in an iterative manner to learn a genetic network from gene_expression data a similar entropy based criterion was used byto learn regulatory relations downstream to a given signaling_pathway proposed an experimental_design algorithm for learning regulatory_networks that maximizes at each step an estimate of the expected information_gain in the context of signaling_networks we have previously sketched a maximum_entropy based experimental_design scheme but the scheme was not completely defined nor its utility was tested here we propose two comprehensive experimental_design strategies the first realizes the maximum_entropy principle to guide the selection of experiments in the context of boolean_networks learning the second strategy learns de_novo experiments that maximize the disagreement between current best fit models a criterion that we term maximum_difference for this optimization task we propose a novel algorithm that considers the entire space of candidate models and possible experiments we implement and test these strategies on simulated and real experimental_data using two detailed boolean models for egfr and il_signaling we show that both strategies can be used to prioritize experiments and discover redundancies among them considerably outperforming a random choice scheme in particular we find that the maximum_difference criterion is superior to all other approaches in all the settings we tested leading to fold savings in the number of experiments to be performed with respect to the available experiment sets to whom

our main contribution is in the development of an algorithm to optimally solve the maximum_difference design criterion while exploring the space of all optimal models under all possible experiments in addition we implemented a method based on the well studied criterion of maximum_entropy and demonstrated its utility over a random_selection of experiment as well as its limitations under varying conditions our evaluation of these schemes indicated that under many conditions especially in the face of scarce data and increasing complexity of the underlying system our novel maximum_difference approach outperforms the maximum_entropy scheme our findings_suggest that current studies might suffer from redundant experimentation with respect to the available models of the systems at hand furthermore results on simulated_data suggest that by adopting an experimental_design scheme much of the redundancy may be eliminated thus our approach should be beneficial for the study of systems whose underlying model is sufficiently detailed and may be formalized as a boolean_network on the methodological side the maximum_difference approach is limited to considering the differences between pairs of models calling for a generalized approach that considers multiple models additionally in our current sampling procedure we rely on the ilp solver to retrieve a diverse family of models maximum_entropy and similar approaches should benefit from the development of other strategies that better sample the model space
