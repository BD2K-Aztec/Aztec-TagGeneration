anges reconstructing ancestral_genomes maps anges is a suite of python programs that allows reconstructing ancestral_genome maps from the comparison of the organization of extant related genomes anges can reconstruct ancestral_genome maps for multichromosomal linear genomes and unichromo somal circular genomes it implements methods inspired from techniques developed to compute physical_maps of extant genomes examples of cereal amniote yeast or bacteria ancestral_genomes are provided computed with anges availability anges is freely_available for download at http paleoge nomics irmacs sfu ca anges documentation and examples are available together with the package the reconstruction of the organization of ancestral_genomes is a long_standing problem motivated by several applications in comparative_genomics it has received a renewed interest during the past_few due among others to the increasing number of sequenced and assembled_genomes and major methodological advances two general approaches have been followed by recent methods the global parsimony aims at computing ancestral gene orders that minimize the number of genome_rearrangements following the pioneering work of sankoff et_al it can now address hard problems of ancestral_genome reconstruction the local parsimony approach that was pioneered infollows principles used in computing physical_maps of extant genomes and was explored in several recent_articles in a series of recent_articles we followed the latter approach and described different methods for computing ancestral_genome maps from the comparison of extant_species all methods are centered on variants of a combinatorial framework widely used to compute physical_maps of extant genomes the consecutiveones property we implemented this framework for the reconstruction of animal fungi and plant ancestral_genomes and showed its validity on well accepted ancestral_genomes as well as its robustness to parameter change in the present note we describe anges a suite of python programs implementing and extending several of these methods to reconstructing both eukaryotic and prokaryotic ancestral_genome maps it is currently the only available method able to handle a wide_range of genetic or genomic_data on any domain of life
