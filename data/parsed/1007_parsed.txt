close lower_and for the minimum reticulate_network of multiple phylogenetic_trees motivation reticulate_network is a model for displaying and quantifying the effects of complex reticulate processes on the evolutionary_history of species undergoing reticulate evolution a central computational_problem on reticulate networks is given a set of phylogenetic_trees each for some region of the genomes reconstruct the most parsimonious reticulate_network called the minimum reticulate_network that combines the topological information contained in the given trees this problem is well known to be np_hard thus existing_approaches for this problem either work with only two input trees or make simplifying topological assumptions results we present novel results on the minimum reticulate_network problem unlike existing_approaches we address the fully general_problem there is no restriction on the number of trees that are input and there is no restriction on the form of the allowed reticulate_network we present lower_and on the minimum number of reticulation events in the minimum reticulate_network and infer an approximately parsimonious reticulate_network a program called pirn implements these methods which also outputs a graphical_representation of the inferred network empirical results on simulated and biological data show that our methods are practical for a wide_range of data more importantly the lower_and match for many datasets especially when the number of trees is small or reticulation level is low and this allows us to solve the minimum reticulate_network problem exactly for these datasets reticulate evolution a form of evolution with hybridization and genetic exchanges between two species are common in many organisms bacteria plants fish amphibians and many others for better understanding of reticulate evolution several reticulate evolutionary_models have been proposed and actively studied to address various reticulate processes such as hybrid speciation lateral_gene and recombination since most of these models are in the forms of networks we call them reticulate networks we refer the readers to for surveys of different reticulate_network models the key computational_problem related to these models is the inference of reticulate networks depending on the types of biological_processes involved data for network_inference may be in different forms such as phylogenetic_trees for some short genomic_regions called genes in this article or aligned dna_sequences in this article we focus on inferring reticulate networks from a set of correlated phylogenetic_trees here is the biological motivation for our problem suppose multiple phylogenetic_trees called gene_trees in this article are reconstructed each from some gene for these species due to reticulate evolution different genomic_regions say genes may be inherited from different ancestral_genomes and their evolutionary_histories may not be the same but are still related thus these trees are correlated but not identical no single phylogenetic_tree can faithfully model the evolution of the species and a more complex network model i e reticulate_network as studied in e g is needed imagine we are given a set of true gene_trees and a true reticulate_network that models the evolutionary_history of these genes the network can be considered as a compact_representation of these gene_trees in the sense that one should be able to trace a gene_tree within the network we say such a gene_tree is displayed in the network this motivates a natural problem which is called the holy_grail of reticulate evolution in given a set of gene_trees reconstruct a reticulate_network that displays every given gene_tree such an inferred network reveals important correlation of evolutionary_history of multiple genes since there exists many such networks a common formulation is to find the one with the fewest reticulation events such a network is called the minimum reticulate_network the central computational_problem on reticulate networks the minimum reticulate_network problem is given a set of gene_trees reconstruct the minimum reticulate_network that displays these gene_trees this formulation may be reasonable when reticulation is believed to be rare in general this problem is computationally_challenging even the case with only two gene_trees is known to be np complete there are several existing_approaches for reconstructing the exact minimum reticulate networks when there are only two gene_trees clearly restricting to just two gene_trees is a big limitation more gene_trees will be more informative to phylogenetic_inference and dna_sequences of many genes are available alternatively there are also a number of approaches making simplifications to the reticulate_network model e g by imposing additional topological_constraints on reticulatepage i i i
