genetics_and pleiogrip genetic_risk prediction with pleiotropy motivation although several studies have used bayesian classifiers for risk prediction using genome_wide snp datasets no software can efficiently perform these analyses on massive genetic datasets and can accommodate multiple_traits results we describe the program pleiogrip that performs a genome_wide bayesian_model search to identify snps associated with a discrete phenotype and uses snps ranked by bayes_factor to produce nested bayesian classifiers these classifiers can be used for genetic_risk prediction either selecting the classifier with optimal number of features or using an ensemble of classifiers in addition pleiogrip implements an extension to the bayesian search and classification and can search for pleiotropic relationships in which snps are simultaneosly associated with two or more distinct phenotypes these relationships can be used to generate connected bayesian classifiers to predict the phenotype of interest either using genetic data alone or in combination with the secondary phenotype s a naive bayesian_classifier nbc is a simple efficient and robust tool that can be used to capture the complex genetic_basis of a multigenic trait and can predict a subject phenotype based on the posterior_probability of the trait given the individuals genetic_profile such classifier can be built using a large number of genetic_variants each with a relatively small contribution to the total genetic_risk however the use of nbcs and similar bayesian_methods are relatively uncommon in genetics and although general use software does exist that is capable of performing bayesian modeling and prediction many of these software utilities are not well suited to the high_dimensionality of genome_wide data we have developed a stable easy to use software_package capable of performing these analyses efficiently and accurately using exact bayesian computations in addition although methods are available to identify associations between genetic_loci and individual phenotypes few methods can detect pleiotropic associations in which loci are simultaneously associated with multiple_phenotypes and use the pleiotropic associations to improve genetic_risk prediction in we showed that pleiotropic associations can be modelled via the construction of simple bayesian_networks and that these models can be applied to produce single or ensembles of bayesian classifiers that leverage pleiotropy to improve genetic_risk prediction testing with simulated_and has shown that these models may improve genetic_risk prediction under certain circumstances our software_package pleiogrip is capable of both pleiotropic genetic_risk prediction as well as prediction using nbcs bayes_factor that do not pass a user assigned significance threshold default threshold e are dropped for each snp that passes this threshold and hence is associated with at least one phenotype the simultaneous association of the snp with additional phenotypes is scored by the bayes_factor and accepted if the bayes_factor increases snps are ranked by the bayes_factor of the selected associations and nested classifiers ae ae r are constructed such that ae uses only the top_ranked snp ae uses the top two snps and so forth pleiogrip is stable computationally_efficient and offers a flexible new tool to gwas investigators interested in bayesian genetic_risk prediction analyses either with or without pleiotropy
