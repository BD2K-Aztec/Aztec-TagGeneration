memgen a general web_server for the setup of lipid_membrane simulation systems motivation molecular_dynamics simulations provide atomic insight into the physicochemical_characteristics of lipid_membranes and hence a wide_range of force_field families capable of modelling various lipid types have been developed in recent_years to model_membranes in a biologically_realistic lipid_composition simulation systems containing multiple different lipids must be assembled results we present a new web_service called memgen that is capable of setting up simulation systems of heterogenous lipid_membranes memgen is not restricted to certain lipid force_fields or lipid types but instead builds membranes from uploaded structure files which may contain any kind of amphiphilic molecule memgen works with any all atom or united atom lipid representation availability_and memgen is freely_available without registration at http memgen molecular_dynamics md_simulations of lipid_membranes have come of age since the first simulation of a bilayer membrane more than years_ago van_der md_simulations have been used to study various processes at atomic or nearatomic resolutions such as lipid diffusion solute permeation electroporation undulation and phase_transition in addition they are required to provide a realistic environment for simulations of membrane_proteins to this end a range of lipid force_fields have been developed which reproduce membrane parameters such as the area per lipid order parameters and x_ray scattering factors atomistic lipid force_fields can be separated into united atom and all atom force_fields following an alternative approach we present the new web_server memgen that automatically sets up lipid_membrane simulation systems the server is not restricted to certain force_fields lipid types or specific md_simulation software the user uploads one or more lipid structure files http memgen uni goettingen de alternatively any amphiphilic molecule such as an alcohol or detergent may be uploaded subsequently the server generates a compact_representation of each lipid that is aligned along the z axis to avoid atomic overlaps in the assembled membrane after building the membrane with the requested molar fractions of each lipid the server hydrates the membrane with a requested number of water_molecules per lipid eventually counter_ions and optionally sodium_chloride is added the final structure is provided for download in pdb format which can be processed by any md software we tested memgen using lipids from a wide_range of all atom and united atom force_fields including various sterol detergent and alcohol molecules see supporting discussion tested lipids contained between one and six lipid tails and different head group types the energy minization and equilibration of the systems were numerically stable an example is shown in supplementaryin the supporting material it is important to note that memgen provides a highly_ordered and hence unphysical initial configuration which requires careful equilibration for at least nanoseconds memgen does not provide or maintain lipid force_field files these must be taken from the force_field developers web_sites or from repositories such as lipidbook domanskidoman by design memgen does not generate asymmetric bilayers with differing compositions of the two monolayers because the areas per lipid are not additive in lipid mixtures it is difficult to predict the equilibrated membrane area of some lipid mixtures however since membranes are nearly incompressible any area mismatch between the two monolayers results in large lateral pressures to set up such asymmetric membranes the user may first equilibrate two symmetric systems removing an appropriate number of lipids manually to achieve the same equilibrium area and subsequently merge one leaflet from each simulation
