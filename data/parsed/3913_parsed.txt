read based phasing of related individuals motivation read based phasing deduces the haplotypes of an individual from sequencing_reads that cover multiple_variants while genetic phasing takes only genotypes as input and applies the rules of mendelian_inheritance to infer haplotypes within a pedigree of individuals combining both into an approach that uses these two independent sources of informationreads and pedi greehas the potential to deliver results better than each individually results we provide a theoretical_framework combining read based phasing with genetic haplotyp ing and describe a fixed parameter algorithm and its implementation for finding an optimal_solution we show that leveraging reads of related individuals jointly in this way yields more phased variants and at a higher accuracy than when phased separately both in simulated_and coverages as low as for each member of a trio yield haplotypes that are as accurate as when analyzed_separately at coverage per individual availability_and https bitbucket org whatshap whatshaphumans are diploid and determining the sequences of both homologous copies of each chromosome is desirable for many reasons these two sequences per chromosome are known as haplotypes the process of obtaining them is known as haplotyping or phasing two terms that we will use interchangeably haplotype resolved genetic data can be used for instance for population_genetic of admixture migration and selection but also to study allele specific gene_regulation compound_heterozygosity and their roles in human disease we refer the reader tofor detailed reviews on the relevance of haplotyping general approaches for haplotyping there are three major approaches to phasing first haplotypes can be inferred from genotype_information of large cohorts based on the idea that common_ancestry gives rise to shared haplotype tracts as reviewed by this approach is known as statistical or population_based phasing it can be applied to unrelated_individuals and only requires genotype data which can be measured at low_cost while very powerful for common_variants this technique is less accurate for phasing rare_variants and cannot be applied at all to private or de_novo variants second haplotypes can be determined based on genotype data of related individuals known as genetic haplotyping to solve the phasing problem one seeks to explain the observed genotypes under the constraints imposed by the mendelian laws of inheritance while being parsimonious in terms of recombination_events for larger pedigrees such as parents with many children this approach yields highly_accurate phasings on the other hand it is less accurate for single mother father child trios and has the intrinsic limitation of not being able to phase variants that are heterozygous in all individuals third the sequences of the two haplotypes can be determined_experimentally called molecular haplotyping many techniques do not resolve the full_length haplotypes but yield blocks of varying sizes approaches furthermore largely differ in the amount of work dna and money they require on one end of the scale next_generation ngs instruments generate local phase_information of the length of a sequenced fragment at everdecreasing costs another approach consists in breaking both homologous_chromosomes into larger fragments and separating them into a number of pools such that each pool is unlikely to contain fragments from the same locus of both haplotypes this can for instance be achieved by dilution followed by bar coded short_read to achieve molecular haplotyping over the range of a full chromosome protocols have been invented to physically separate the two homologous_chromosomes for example by microscopybased chromosome isolation fluorescence activated sorting or microfluidics based sorting these and other experimental_techniques for molecular haplotyping have been surveyed by snyderwe report the results of wmec wmec and pedmec g for both datasets real and simulated all combinations of the three methods two datasets and six different average coverages and were run the predicted phasings are compared to the ground_truth phasing for the respective dataset that is for the real_dataset we compare to the population_based phasing produced by shapeit for the simulated dataset we compare to the true haplotypes that gave rise to the simulated reads shows the fraction of unphased snps in comparison to the phasing error_rate see section for all conducted experiments a perfect phasing would be located in the bottom left corner the influence of coverage increasing the average coverage is beneficial for phasing for all three methods wmec wmec and pedmec g and both datasets the phasing error_rate and the fraction of unphased snps decrease monotonically when the average coverage is increased as is clearly visible in the effect is much more drastic for wmec than for pedmec however apparently wmec needs more coverage to compensate for pacbios high_error while pedmec can resort to exploiting family information to resolve uncertainty the value of family information when operating on the same input coverage pedmec g clearly outperformed wmec and even wmec in all cases tested this was true for phasing error_rates as well as for the fraction of phased positions on the real_dataset with average coverage for instance wmec andwmec reached an error_rate of and while it was for pedmec g most remarkingly pedmec g delivers excellent results already for very low coverages when working with an average coverage as low as for each family_member it achieves an error_rate of and a fraction of unphased snps of on real_data in contrast wmec needs average coverage on each individual to reach similar values error_rate and unphased snps when running on data pedmec g s error_rate and fraction of unphased positions decrease to and respectively therefore it reaches better results while requiring only a third of the sequencing_data which translates into significantly_reduced sequencing_costs comparison of real and simulated_data when comparing results for simulated_and i e top and bottom plots in the curves appear similar with some important difference in terms of the fraction of phased snps y axis results are virtually_identical this indicates that our simulation pipeline establishes realistic conditions regarding this aspect differences in terms of error_rates x axis are larger in general error_rates in the real_data are larger than in the simulated_data which might be partly caused by a too optimistic error_model during read simulation on the other hand the population_based phasing used as ground_truth for the real_dataset will most likely also contain errors especially lowfrequency variants present difficulties for population_based phasers next we therefore compare our ground_truth statistical phasing to the independent phasing provided by xgenomics three way comparison with xgenomics shows the results of a three way comparison of ground_truth statistical phasing xgenomics and pedmec g on coverage data we observe that the total fraction of cases where there is disagreement between the three methods is below out of these xgenomics and the statistical phasing agree in a sizeable fraction of cases shown in blue in these cases the pacbio based pedmec g is likely wrong given pacbios high read error_rate the existence of such cases is not surprising on the other hand there also is a significant fraction of cases where pedmec g and xgenomics agree shown in red indicating likely errors in the statistical phasing cases where pedmec g and the statistical phasing agree but disagree with xgenomics are very rare which is likely due to the low_error of short_read underlying the xgenomics phasing and the resulting highly_accurate phasing shapeit trio and duohmm right shows the same three way comparison but uses the results obtained from shapeit when run in trio mode we see that this improved the phasing for the child but dramatically worsened the agreement for the parents with more than of all phased snp_pairs for which xgenomics and pedmec g agreed but disagreed with shapeit trio running duohmm o to improve the shapeit trio phasing did not lead to any changes which might be related to that duohmm is designed to be run for large cohorts of related individuals phase_information beyond block boundaries genetic phasing operates on genotypes of a pedigree without using any sequencing_reads illustrates a case where we have two blocks that are not connected by reads in any individual nonetheless phase_information can be inferred from the genotypes each block contains a snp that is homozygous in both parents and heterozygous in the child which immediately establishes which haplotype is maternal and which is paternal in both blocks note that this in turn also implies the phasing of the parents by design pedmec g implicitly exploits such information to demonstrate this we used the real_dataset and merged all blocks reported by pedmec g into one chromosome wide block and determined the fraction of cases where phases were correctly inferred between blocks and hence between two snps that are not connected by reads in any individual this resulted in a fraction of correctly inferred phased averaged over all individuals and coverages standard_deviation repeating the same for wmec yielded correctly inferred phased as expected equalling a coin flip runtimes all experiments have been run on a server with two intel_xeon e cpus cores each running at ghz the implementation in whatshap is sequential i e only using one cpu core in all cases the time spent reading the input_files dominated the time spent in the phasing routine itself processing all three individuals of the coverage real_dataset took min min and min for wmec wmec and pedmec g respectively this time included all i o and further processing of these times and s were spent in the phasing routine respectively for input coverage total processing took and min for wmec wmec and pedmec g respectively of this s were spent in the phasing routines respectively we conclude that the phasing algorithm presented here is well suited for three way comparison of phasings provided by shapeit xgenomics and pedmec g on coverage data of all pairs of consecutive snps phased by all three methods the percentages of cases where the phasing reported by one method disagrees with the other two are reported missing to cases where all three methods agree left shapeit run with default_parameters corresponding to our ground_truth phasing right shapeit run with pedigree_information two disjoint unconnected haplotype_blocks for which phase_information can be inferred from the genotypes read based phasing of related individuals i handling current datasets swiftly in the future we plan to further optimize the implementation of i o subroutines and provide automatic chromosome wise parallelization of data_processing we have presented a unifying framework for integrated read based and genetic haplotyping by generalizing the whatshap algorithm we provide a fixed parameter tractable method for solving the resulting np_hard optimization_problem which we call pedmec when maximum coverage and number of individuals are bounded the algorithms runtime is linear in the number of phased variants and independent of the read_length making it well suited for current and future long_read sequencing_data this is mirrored by the fact that the runtime is dwarfed by the time required for reading the input_files in practice pedmec can use any provided costs for correcting errors in reads as well as for recombination_events by using phred scaled probabilities as costs minimizing the cost can be interpreted as finding a maximum_likelihood phasing in a statistical_model incorporating mendelian_inheritance read_error and recombination testing the implementation on simulated and real trio data we could show that the method is notably more accurate than phasing individuals separately especially at low coverages beyond enhanced accuracy our method is also able to phase a greater fraction of heterozygous variants compared to single individual phasing being able to phase more variants is a key benefit of the integrative approach whereas read based phasing can in principle only phase variants connected by a path through the covering reads adding pedigree_information enables even phasing of variants that are not covered in all individuals since the algorithm can fall back to using genotype_information illustrates the increased connectivity while phasing a trio resulting in more phased variants in practice genetic haplotyping alone cannot phase variants that are heterozygous in all individuals emphasizing the need for an integrative approach as introduced here we demonstrate that such an approach indeed yields better result and recommend its use whenever both reads and pedigree_information are available most remarkingly the presented approach is able to deliver outstanding performance even for coverages as low as per individual on par with performance delivered by single individual haplotyping at coverage per individual future work we plan to implement phasing of de_novo variants observed in the child which would be impossible with pure genetic haplotyping but is straightforward with our approach since runtime is exponential in the maximum physical coverage pruning of datasets is required in practice the read selection approach currently implemented in whatshap aims to retain reads that both cover and connect many variants at the same time in particular for heterogeneous combinations of datasets such as paired_end or mate_pair reads together with long_reads for pedigrees each dataset is currently pruned individually but results would likely improve if pedigree structure was taken into account in this step finally since we show that it is possible and beneficial to integrate both read based and genetic phasing the next obvious question is whether it is possible to modify our unified theoretical_framework to one that also includes statistical phasing
