mp geneticsynth inferring biological_network regulations from time series mp geneticsynth is a java tool for discovering the logic and regulation mechanisms responsible for observed biological dynamics in terms of finite_difference recurrent equations the software makes use of i metabolic p systems as a modeling framework ii an evolutionary approach to discover flux regulation functions as linear_combinations of given primitive functions iii a suitable reformulation of the least_squares method to estimate function parameters considering simultaneously all the reactions involved in complex dynamics the tool is available as a plugin for the virtual laboratory metaplab it has graphical and interactive interfaces for data preparation a priori_knowledge integration and flux regulator analysis availability and implemention source_code binaries documentation including quick start guide and videos and case studies are freely_available atbiological system modeling is a central methodology for unraveling complex interactions in molecular_species and understanding the internal logic of metabolic regulatory and signaling_processes mathematical and computational_models are used to formally represent knowledge of biological_processes which is usually acquired from experiments a key goal is represented by the automatic inference of model structure and parameters from observed data several reverse_engineering methodologies and related software were proposed to solve this problem simulated_annealing particle swarm intelligence genetic_algorithms ga and other optimization techniques were used with both differential and unconventional models here we present mp geneticsynth a tool based on ga and multivariate_regression for the synthesis and the analysis of flux regulation functions from observed time series within the modeling framework of metabolic p systems mp systems the evolutionary approach on which the software is based provides new perspectives on the analysis of biological_network regulations main applications range from metabolic to gene_expression and signaling_networks although the methodology lends itself to be applied also to other contexts where fluxes of matter or information have to be inferred from time series the main strengths of the proposed tool are the possibility to integrate observed data with a priori_knowledge and to generate models even if exact reaction_rates or parts of the stoichiometry are unknown
