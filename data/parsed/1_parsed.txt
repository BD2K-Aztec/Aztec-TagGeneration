systems_biology cflux high performance software_suite for c metabolic_flux c based metabolic_flux c mfa is the state of the art method to quantitatively_determine in vivo metabolic reaction_rates in microorganisms cflux contains all tools for composing flexible computational c mfa workflows to design and evaluate carbon labeling experiments a specially developed xml language fluxml highly_efficient data_structures and simulation algorithms achieve a maximum of performance and effectiveness support of multicore cpus as well as compute clusters enables scalable investigations cflux outperforms existing_tools in terms of universality flexibility and built in features therewith cflux paves the way for next generation high_resolution metabolic_flux with carbon labeling experiments c mfa matured as the state of the art technique to infer directly immeasurable in vivo central metabolic reaction_rates the fluxome by rigorous mathematical_modeling progress in measurement techniques and scaled down experimentation has raised the experimental throughput and coverage to which isotope labeled tracers in the metabolism are quantified this has encouraged the usage of c mfa for cell wide analyses of complex cells such as eukaryotes mammalian_cells or fungi such applications drastically increase the computational_burden and cannot be adequately_treated with existing all purpose software built on experiences made with its successful predecessor cflux the high performance software_suite cflux is designed to overcome computational and modeling limitations to increase the flexibility and scope of c mfa major unique features of cflux are i tailor made algorithms in combination with a novel code generation approach leading to highly_efficient machine code ii the xml_based document format fluxml to specify ultimate universal models and all kind of measurements iii support of high_performance environments and iv seamless setup of user_defined processing pipelines for serial evaluations moreover the multi_platform software omix may be used for convenient modeling and visualization purposes with respect to these features cflux exceeds the functionality of existing c mfa software systems namely metran and fiatflux as well as the cflux clones openflux c fia nmr flux and influx s specification of generic measurements is possible more than syntactical and semantical errors are detected and indicated by expressive error warning messages
