structural_bioinformatics jmetalcpp optimizing molecular_docking problems with a c metaheuristic framework motivation molecular_docking is a method for structure_based and structural molecular_biology which attempts to predict the position and orientation of a small_molecule ligand in relation to a protein receptor to produce a stable complex with a minimum binding_energy one of the most widely used software_packages for this purpose is autodock which incorporates three metaheuristic techniques we propose the integration of autodock with jmetalcpp an optimization framework thereby providing both single and multi objective algorithms that can be used to effectively solve docking problems results the resulting combination of autodock jmetalcpp allows users of the former to easily use the metaheuristics provided by the latter in this way biologists have at their disposal a richer set of optimization techniques than those already provided in autodock moreover designers of metaheuristic techniques can use molecular_docking for case studies which can lead to more efficient algorithms oriented to solving the target problems availability_and jmetalcpp software adapted to autodock is freely_available as a c source_code atthe development of techniques such as high_throughput protein purification x_ray and nuclear_magnetic have contributed in the discovery of many structural details of proteinprotein and ligandprotein complexes such advances in association with the completion of the human_genome have allowed the identification of many therapeutic drug_targets in this context molecular_docking is a method of structure_based that has been in development since the early s this approach is based on two well defined steps i determining the position and orientation of the ligand within the target receptor and ii assessing the affinity between the two structures by analyzing the binding_energy scores and selecting those ligandprotein conformations with minimum binding_energies for the past_two there has been an attempt to improve docking molecular_techniques therefore many researchers in this field have focused on improving the quality of the docking_results this depends on the energy scoring_function for evaluating the results obtained and an optimization_algorithm to detect the best state characterized by a minimum of binding_energy furthermore another challenge is to develop software solutions the scoring_functions of which allow the rotation around torsional degrees_of of the flexible ligands and side_chains of receptors an example of these software_packages is autodock a c toolbox which has become the most cited and one of the most used software_packages in molecular_modeling studies and also an efficient tool for virtual drug_screening which has been applied in real cases that involve flexibility the release of autodock provides three optimization algorithms a simulated_annealing and two genetic_algorithms gas one of which referred to as the lamarckian ga incorporates a local_search these algorithms are metaheuristic techniques which are high_level techniques that rule a set of underlying simpler methods typically heuristics designed to find optimal or nearoptimal solutions to a given optimization_problem as mentioned one important research area is to find appropriate search_methods capable of producing the most accurate solutions to the docking problems in this context this article proposes a software platform oriented to provide a set of metaheuristic techniques allowing molecular_docking problems to be optimized our approach has been to integrate autodock with jmetal an object oriented framework for multi_objective with metaheuristics which has become one of the most popular software_tools in the field by multi_objective we refer to solving problems that have two or more conflicting objectives that have to be maximized or minimized at the same time if an optimization_problem is composed of a unique objective_function we say that it is a single objective problem the underlying idea is to run the algorithms in jmetalcpp and to use the scoring_function of autodock the original jmetal software is written in java script so we have built a c implementation from scratch called jmetalcpp http jmetalcpp sourceforge net the idea being to achieve a clean and efficient integration with autodock by doing this the resulting platform can benefit on the one hand the biologists interested in applying other algorithms than those provided by autodock to solve their target problems on the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com other hand researchers in metaheuristics frequently search for real_world problems to assess the performance of new algorithms so our solution could lead to the appearance of more efficient techniques for solving molecular_docking problems to the best of our knowledge this platform is the first to integrate a set of single and multi objective metaheuristics to solve docking problems the use of the jmetalcpp framework provides several advantages for those researchers in drug_discovery who are interested in improving the docking_results with metaheuristics that are different from the searching methods provided by autodock to demonstrate the benefits of our proposal we evaluated a set of single objective metaheuristics implemented in jmetalcpp on a first standard benchmark provided byand a second benchmark that involves flexibility in side_chains of arg residue of human_immunodeficiency protease receptors in this article we have demonstrated that it is possible to improve upon the results obtained by the autodock algorithms in some scenarios furthermore jmetalcpp can be considered a useful tool for advanced users or developers with little c knowledge who can implement new metaheuristic techniques that can be integrated into this framework with relative_ease consequently these techniques can be quickly integrated inside autodock the web_site of jmetalcpp provides user instructions on how to install and run the jmetalcpp framework for future work additional developments and improvements to be implemented in jmetalcpp are being planned such as the integration of new single e g cma es and multi objective metaheuristic techniques e g sms emoa we are also considering integrating the autodock vina docking function a recently_developed energy function the use of which is spreading throughout the autodock user community
