data_and predicting biodegradation products and pathways a hybrid knowledge and machine_learning approach_motivation current methods for the prediction of biodegradation products and pathways of organic environmental_pollutants either do not take into account domain_knowledge or do not provide probability estimates in this article we propose a hybrid knowledge and machine_learning based_approach to overcome_these in the context of the university of minnesota pathway prediction system um pps the proposed solution performs relative reasoning in a machine_learning framework and obtains one probability estimate for each biotransformation rule of the system as the application of a rule then depends on a threshold for the probability estimate the trade_off between recall sensitivity and precision selectivity can be addressed and leveraged in practice results results from leave_one show that a recall and precision of can be achieved for a subset of transformation rules therefore it is possible to optimize precision without compromising recall we are currently integrating the results into an experimental version of the um pps server in silico methods to predict products and pathways of microbial biotransformations of chemical substances are increasingly sought due to rapidly_growing data requirements for regulatory chemical risk_assessment at the european cf reach and global level existing_methods for the prediction of biotransformation_products and pathways can be categorized as either knowledge or machine_learning based_approaches each of the two approaches has its strengths_and knowledge based_approaches such as meteor for the prediction of mammalian metabolism or the university of minnesota pathway predictionpage
