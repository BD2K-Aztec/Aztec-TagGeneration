epitoolkit a web_based workbench for vaccine_design epitoolkit is a virtual workbench for immunological questions with a focus on vaccine_design it offers an array of immunoinformatics tools covering mhc genotyping epitope and neo epitope_prediction epitope selection for vaccine_design and epitope assembly in its recently re implemented version epitoolkit provides a range of new functionality and for the first time allows combining tools into complex workflows for inexperienced users it offers simplified interfaces to guide the users through the analysis of complex immunological data_sets availability_and http www epitoolkit de contactepitope based vaccine_design offers novel and rational ways to develop vaccines based on genomic_information the design process undergoes several steps the first step aims at identifying antigenic_peptides called epitopes that induce a t cell_mediated reaction after presentation on the cell_surface by proteins of the major_histocompatibility mhc in the second step a subset usually of size epitopes is selected forming the basis of the vaccine due to the high polymorphism within the mhc cluster each individual possesses a unique set of mhc alleles and therefore presents a different set of epitopes hence it is not only necessary to identify the individuals mhc genotype but also to tailor the epitope selection to match the mhc allele restrictions of a population population optimized vaccine or that of an individual personalized vaccines the third step of the design pipeline is concerned with the delivery of the selected epitopes a common strategy concatenates the epitopes into a so_called string of beads polypeptide the epitope order within a string of beads plays_a especially in degradation therefore it is necessary to optimize the ordering such that the recovery probability of the epitopes is maximal since the underlying data and the interdependencies of the design pipeline are complex and require bioinformatics_tools to obtain optimal results we developed a web_based epitoolkit etk to make such approaches accessible to a broader audience etk extends its predecessor by supporting mhc genotyping and epitope assembly besides epitope discovery and epitope selection thus it covers each of the described design steps and can be used for personalized or population optimized vaccine_development as well as for other immunological applications e g large_scale epitope_prediction additionally functionalities such as the supported prediction_methods and input_formats have been extended also etk is now based on a customized version of the open_source platform galaxy which allows a flexible combination of tools into workflows a reliable recording and sharing of results and the integration with high_performance resources with etk we provide a flexible and yet easy to use platform for rational vaccine_design beyond the presented application etk can be used to tackle a manifold of other immunological questions and thus should not only be valuable for applied medical but also for basic immunological research
