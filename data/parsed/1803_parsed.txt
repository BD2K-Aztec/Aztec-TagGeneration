sequence_analysis feature based_classifiers for somatic_mutation detection in tumour normal paired sequencing_data the study of cancer_genomes now routinely involves using next_generation ngs to profile tumours for single_nucleotide snv somatic_mutations however surprisingly few published bioinformatics_methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic_mutations from ngs_data and existing_tools are often inaccurate yielding intolerably high false prediction rates as such the computational_problem of accurately inferring somatic_mutations from paired tumour normal ngs_data remains an unsolved challenge results we present the comparison of four standard supervised machine_learning for the purpose of somatic snv prediction in tumour normal ngs experiments to evaluate these approaches random_forest bayesian additive regression tree support_vector and logistic_regression we constructed features representing candidate somatic snvs from breast cancer_genomes originally predicted with naive methods and subsequently revalidated to establish ground_truth labels we trained the classifiers on this data consisting of true somatic_mutations and non somatic_mutation positions and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these methods using a cross_validation framework and hold out test ngs_data from both exome_capture and whole_genome shotgun platforms all learning algorithms employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature_selection improved the predictive_accuracy over standard_approaches by statistically_significant margins in addition using unsupervised_clustering of the ground_truth false_positive we noted several distinct classes and present evidence suggesting non overlapping sources of technical artefacts illuminating important directions for future study availability software called mutationseq and datasets are available from http compbio bccrc ca the genome_wide search for functionally_important somatic_mutations in cancer by emergent cost_effective next_generation ngs_technology has begun to revolutionize our understanding of tumour biology the discovery of diagnostic mutations new cancer_genes arid a pbrm ppp r a idh ezh insights into tumour evolution and progression and definitions of mutational landscapes in tumour_types myeloma lymphoma among many others provide important examples of the power and potential of ngs in furthering our knowledge of cancer_biology using ngs to interrogate cancers for somatic_mutations usually involves sequencing tumour dna and dna derived from nonmalignant or normal_tissue often blood from the same patient consequently cancer focused ngs experiments differ_considerably in experimental_design from the study of mendelian_disorders or normal human variation in cancer studies sequence_reads from the two matched_samples are aligned to a reference human_genome and lists of predicted variants using single_nucleotide snv callers e g samtools soapsnp varscan snvmix gatk vipr are compared in the tumour and normal data using naive approaches those variants appearing in the tumour but not the normal sample would be considered putative somatic_mutations and provide the investigator with a list of candidates to follow_up for functional impact and clinical_relevance unfortunately such naive approaches often result in false predictions and we suggest herein that the problem of computational_identification of somatic_mutations from ngs_data derived from tumour and matched normal dna remains an unsolved challenge as a result labour_intensive and often costly validation experiments are still required to confirm the presence of predicted somatic_mutations for both research_purposes and clinical interpretation although some false predictions may be due to under sampled alleles most can be attributed to detectable artefacts that we argue can be leveraged in principled inference techniques to improve computational predictions many different approaches towe studied the use of feature based_classifiers for the purpose of somatic_mutation detection in tumour normal pair ngs_data using an extensive set of ground_truth positions we trained four different machine_learning using features extracted from existing software_tools and novel features we computed ourselves all four classifiers statistically significantly_outperformed popular software_packages used in a naive way to detect somatic_mutations treating the tumour and normal data independently results were consistent between a cross_validation analysis of the training data and a completely_independent test_dataset derived from an orthogonal sequencing_platform our results encapsulate three key results i machine_learning can be trained using principled machine_learning to significantly improve somatic_mutation detection ii feature_selection analysis revealed that our classification_method selects different features in the tumour and normal datasets to optimize classification ability underscoring that simultaneous rather than independent analysis of the paired data is important and iii we identified five distinct groups of false_positive this last result indicates that feature_based analysis of negative or wild_type positions can be helpful to guide future_developments in software pipelines that operate upstream of variant_calling our results underscore the advantages of developing cancer specific tools for ngs_data that can capitalize on the unique experimental_design of tumour normal paired data our conclusions support the notion that principled feature_based machine_learning classification frameworks will be well placed to leverage evolving trends in the cancer ngs field thereby reducing the burden of downstream validation efforts with more accurate_predictions
