genomic dark_matter the reliability of short_read illustrated by the genome mappability score motivation genome resequencing and short_read are two of the primary tools of genomics and are used for many important_applications the current state of the art in mapping uses the quality values and mapping quality_scores to evaluate the reliability of the mapping these attributes however are assigned to individual_reads and do not directly measure the problematic repeats across the genome here we present the genome mappability score gms as a novel measure of the complexity of resequencing a genome the gms is a weighted probability that any read could be unambiguously mapped to a given position and thus measures the overall composition of the genome itself results we have developed the genome mappability analyzer to compute the gms of every position in a genome it leverages the parallelism of cloud_computing to analyze large_genomes and enabled us to identify the of the human mouse fly and yeast genomes that are difficult to analyze with short_reads we examined the accuracy of the widely used bwa samtools polymorphism discovery pipeline in the context of the gms and found discovery errors are dominated by false_negatives especially in regions with poor gms these errors are fundamental to the mapping_process and cannot be overcome by increasing_coverage as such the gms should be considered in every resequencing project to pinpoint the dark_matter of the genome including of known clinically_relevant variations in these regions availability the source_code and profiles of several model_organisms are available at http gmashort read_mapping has become one of the most important tools in molecular_biology with many significant applications to understanding human_health and disease plant and animal genomics and basic biological_processes the algorithms for efficiently mapping reads to the genome are now rapidly maturing but until now it was an open question of how to interpret the reliability of those mappings prior working focusing on the mapping quality_score or the uniqueome were narrowly focused on individual_reads or individual subsequences and missed the larger genomic_context here we have presented a novel probabilistic metric the gms for identifying and quantifying the regions of the genome that can be reliably mapped under various experimental_conditions we have also developed the gma pipeline for computing the gms profile
