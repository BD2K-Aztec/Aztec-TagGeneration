clusterngo a user_defined modelling platform for two stage clustering of time series data motivation simple bioinformatic_tools are frequently used to analyse time series datasets regardless of their ability to deal with transient phenomena limiting the meaningful_information that may be extracted from them this situation requires the development and exploitation of tailor made easy to use and flexible tools designed specifically for the analysis of time series datasets results we present a novel statistical application called clusterngo which uses a model_based algorithm that fulfils this need this algorithm involves two components of operation component constructs a bayesian non parametric model infinite mixture of piecewise_linear sequences and component which applies a novel clustering methodology two stage clustering the software can also assign biological meaning to the identified clusters using an appropriate ontology it applies multiple_hypothesis to report the significance of these en richments the algorithm has a four phase pipeline the application can be executed using either command_line or a user_friendly graphical_user the latter has been developed to address the needs of both specialist and non specialist users we use three diverse test cases to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed_strategy in all cases clusterngo not only outper formed existing algorithms in assigning unique go term enrichments to the identified clusters but also revealed novel insights regarding the biological_systems examined which were not uncovered in the original publications availability_and the c and qt source codes the gui applications for windows os x and linux operating_systems and user_manual are freely_available for download under the gnu gpl v license athigh throughput technologies in the life_sciences generate massive_amounts of information by allowing the measurement of thousands of entities simultaneously however understanding the underlying biological_information and drawing meaningful_results from such huge data_sets is a challenge clustering is among the most
