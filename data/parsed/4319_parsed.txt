soap ultra_fast gpu based parallel alignment_tool for short_reads soap is the first short_read alignment_tool that leverages the multi processors in a graphic processing unit gpu to achieve a drastic improvement in speed we adapted the compressed full text index bwt used by soap in view of the advantages_and of gpu when tested with millions of illumina_hiseq length_bp reads soap takes s to align a million read_pairs onto the human_reference and is at least and times_faster than bwa and bowtie respectively for aligning_reads with up to four mismatches soap aligns slightly more reads than bwa and bowtie this is because soap unlike bwa and bowtie is not heuristic based and always reports all answers
