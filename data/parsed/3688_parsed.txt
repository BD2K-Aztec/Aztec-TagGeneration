structural_bioinformatics preferential use of protein domain pairs as interaction mediators order and transitivity motivation many proteinprotein_interactions ppis are mediated by protein_domains the structural data of multi domain ppis reveal the domain pair or pairs that mediate a ppi and implicitly also the domain pairs that are not involved in the interaction by analyzing such data preference relations between domain pairs as interaction mediators may be revealed results here we analyze the differential use of domain pairs as mediators of stable interactions based on structurally solved multi domain protein_complexes our analysis revealed domain pairs that are preferentially used as interaction mediators and domain pairs that rarely or never mediate interaction independent of the proteins context between these extremes there are domain pairs that mediate protein interaction in some protein contexts while in other contexts different domain pairs predominate over them by describing the preference relations between domain pairs as a network we uncovered partial order and transitivity in these relations which we further exploited for predicting interaction mediating domains the preferred domain pairs and the ones over which they predominate differ in several properties but these differences cannot yet determine explicitly what underlies the differential use of domain pairs as interaction mediators one property that stood up was the overabundance of homotypic interactions among the preferred domain pairs supporting previous suggestions on the advantages in the use of domain self interaction for mediating protein interactions finally we show a possible association between the preferred domain pairs and the function of the complex where they reside domains are considered as the fundamental building_blocks determining the structure and function of proteins many domains were specialized to mediate the interaction of proteins with other molecules for example there are dna_binding rnabinding domains and domains that mediate interactions between proteins proteinprotein_interaction ppi is usually achieved either via interactions between domains and short motifs pawson to whom correspondence should be addressed often in transient interactions or by domaindomain interactions ddis often in stable interactions analyses of structurally solved ppis determined the domain pairs that are used as interaction mediators further analysis of these ddis has revealed distinct domain pairs that are repeatedly used as interaction mediators in different protein contexts moreover it was shown that a statistically_significant fraction of the interactome of various organisms can be attributed to these interacting domain pairs and that they are evolutionarily_conserved it is conceivable that protein_domains that mediate interactions with other molecules were optimized through evolution to perform this function therefore while the domain repertoire of a proteome defines thousands of theoretically possible interacting domain pairs only a fraction of these pairs seem to actually mediate protein interactions furthermore certain domain pairs mediate interactions in some protein contexts but not in others in which there are other domain pairs opted for this task as exemplified in the data of multi domain ppis solved by crystallography reveal many examples of such variability in the utilization of domain pairs as interaction mediators for example the self interaction of the domain hpt pfam accession pf is used for mediating the interaction in all solved complexes containing it independent of other domains on the other hand the ghmp kinase n_terminal domain pf mediates dimerization by self interaction in some protein contexts e g mevalonate_kinase but not in others e g galactokinase where other domains mediate the dimerization notably the structural data of multi domain ppis reveal the domain pair or pairs that mediate a ppi and implicitly also the domain pairs that are not involved in the interaction enabling a systematic analysis of such preference relations here we carry out such an analysis using reliable ddi and ppi data from solved structures of multi domain protein_complexes we report on a partial order in the preferential use of domain pairs as interaction mediators compare properties of the domains that may underlie this order and show by a few examples possible functional_implications of our findings we also demonstrate the utilization of this order for predicting the domains mediating experimentally_determined ppis the recent accumulation of a vast amount of ppi data has enabled the study of ppi_networks for review see as well as of the inter relations between ppis and ddis e g where we employed network_analysis tools to study the preference relations between domain pairs as interaction mediators in this network thepage presented are rates of success in ddi prediction according to the number of possible domaindomain combinations in interacting_protein in comparison to the expected random success_rate e g the random success_rate in case of two domain pairs is the shown data are based on interacting_protein with at most possible domain pairs we confirmed this approach by fold and fold_cross shown here when a domain pair in the test_set does not occur in the network of domain pair relations training_set the interaction cannot be predicted success_rates are therefore described for those domain pairs that appear in both the test and training_sets the random success_rates were calculated according to the number of potential domain pairs in ppis taking_into the number of domain pairs that actually mediate the interaction nodes are domain pairs and edges point from domain pairs mediating the interaction to all possible domain pairs in the complex over which they predominate analysis of this network revealed an order between domain pairs which was consistent across various protein pairs carrying the corresponding domains of note the relatively small number of solved complexes implies that the network of domain pair relations is of low connectivity since many couples of domain pairs may never appear in the same complex disenabling an edge between them accordingly this network is composed of many subnetworks of connected components each showing a partial view of the domain pair relations thus the phenomenon that we have identified of order of the domain pairs by their preferential use as interaction mediators is re discovered in many subnetworks of domain pair relation networks however in the context of the whole network due to the missing edges this order should be regarded as partial order thus our analysis shows that not only there are domain pairs that mediate ppis and others that do not but also the ones capable of mediating interaction can be partially ordered by their suitability to this task the main discovery of our study that there is an order of domain pairs as interaction mediators raises additional questions as to the domain pair properties that may underlie the revealed preferences conceivably such preferences might develop through evolution and therefore we asked whether the preferred pairs are more ancient than the ones over which they predominate and whether they show higher plasticity that allows them to accommodate in various protein contexts these properties showed very modest differences between the compared domain pairs although highly statistically_significant pointing to tendencies that might be further substantiated with accumulation of more data of interacting_proteins alternatively as we found in our analysis of functional_implications it may be that the preference relations are the result of local solutions to the functional constraints of each protein complex since these solutions differ between different complexes specific properties might have implications in only subsets of the data and therefore we observed only subtle tendencies when applying the analysis of the properties to the whole data our prominent findingthat the preferred domain pairs show high_abundance of homotypic interactionsis consistent_with reporting that homotypic interactions are statistically_significantly over represented in the data of ddis especially among ddis conserved in various organisms furthermore our finding that when possible homotypic interactions are preferred also for heterodimerization further supports the advantage suggested for homotypic interactions in stabilizing protein_complexes these advantages include a duplicated effect for stabilizing mutations and lower mean energy of the interfaces compared to that of heterotypic interactions another hint at the advantage of homotypic interactions is the relative_abundance of functional sites found at the interface of homodimers in addition it was demonstrated that early in evolution a bias towards very low_energy complexes may have driven the selection of symmetrical structures it is possible that following such considerations early in evolution certain domains adjusted themselves for self interaction such domains could later recruit other domains to create multi_domain whose interactions are mediated via the homotypic interactions this conjecture is further supported by our finding that the same homotypic domain interactions mediating multi domain ppis are also found in homodimers of single_domain data not shown the high_abundance of homotypic interactions among the preferred domain pairs may raise the concern that the order that we have identified is simply a reflection of the advantage of homotypic interactions to test this we repeated the analysis including only heterodimers that do not contain domains capable of self interaction data not shown this analysis again identified a consistent order between domain pairs implying that it is not due to the preference of homotypic interactions our analysis while based on the currently available limited dataset of structurally derived ddis in multi domain ppis provides intriguing insights into the preference relations between domain pairs the order that we identified is robust and is revealed when using datasets based on various systems of domain definitions and when analyzing extensions or sub sections of the datasets suggesting that it will persist when more ddi data become available at present the order that we identified is partial because many parts of the network of domain pair relations are disconnected due to missing_data as more and more protein_complexes of multiple domain combinations will be solved the repertoire of domain pair relations will be enriched and the preference relation network might become more connected this will enable improved_prediction of ddis based on the network_structure and a deeper_understanding as to the molecular principles that make some domain pairs more suitable than others for mediating interactions
