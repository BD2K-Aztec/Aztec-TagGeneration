data_and the necessity of adjusting tests of protein category enrichment in discovery proteomics motivation enrichment tests are used in high_throughput experimentation to measure the association between gene or protein expression and membership in groups or pathways the fishers_exact is commonly used we specifically examined the associations produced by the fisher test between protein identification by mass_spectrometry discovery proteomics and their gene_ontology go term assignments in a large yeast dataset we found that direct_application of the fisher test is misleading in proteomics due to the bias in mass_spectrometry to preferentially identify proteins based on their biochemical_properties false inference about associations can be made if this bias is not corrected our method adjusts fisher tests for these biases and produces associations more directly attributable to protein expression rather than experimental bias results using logistic_regression we modeled the association between protein identification and go term assignments while adjusting for identification bias in mass_spectrometry the model accounts for five biochemical_properties of peptides i hydrophobicity ii molecular_weight iii transfer energy iv beta_turn frequency and v isoelectric_point the model was fit on peptides from proteins identified in yeast proteomics datasets with a false_discovery in analyzing the association between protein identification and their go term assignments we found that out of of fisher tests that showed significant association q value were non significant after adjustment using our model simulations generating yeast protein_sets enriched for identification propensity show that unadjusted enrichment tests were biased while our approach worked well enrichment tests are commonly performed in high_throughput discovery research such as mass_spectrometry they are used for instance to determine the association between to whom correspondence should be addressed whether a protein is expressed in a particular condition and membership in a particular biologically_relevant category such as gene_ontology go term assignment discovery of significant associations such as go terms with over or underrepresentation of expressed proteins then provide new hypotheses and directions for further research these enrichment tests are commonly carried_out by using fishers exact or chi_square these are the most basic of the enrichment tests others have been proposed such as gene_set however given their clear_cut nature fishers exact tests are still often applied and are considered robust enough to be used as a guide or ranking mechanism for biological categories of proteins in discovery research mass_spectrometry has now become the standard tool in high_throughput discovery proteomics it enables measurement of expressed proteins as opposed to gene sequences that control and enable most biological_processes research studies will often compare the distribution of expressed proteins in a given set of conditions or between organisms the problem with analyzing proteomics_data however is the bias in how proteins are identified which is a function of their biochemical_properties these biases can affect tests of enrichment for expressed proteins within proteins sets and produce misleading biological conclusions in discovery proteomics_studies if they are not accounted for to address this we demonstrate an approach to adjust fishers exact tests specifically for protein identification bias our approach is similar to propensity_scores developed for observational_studies in epidemiology to adjust comparisons due to confounding_variables possibly associated with grouping and outcome_variables this helps avoid finding spurious relationships between study groups propensity_scores are used by building a model to predict the probability that an object has a given outcome based on potentially_confounding covariates they are then used to create strata that are balanced by their covariates in our case the study groups are the protein categories go terms and the response variable is protein identification by mass_spectrometry we used logistic_regression to model the relationship between protein identification protein go term assignment and propensity_scores of proteins assigned to the go term see section our method is different from those which adjust enrichment p values by accounting for the hierarchical relationships between go terms and not for protein propensities when we analyzed a large yeast proteomics dataset we found that many significant associations between go terms and protein_identifications found using the fishers_exact were actually not significant by our method in addition some non significant fishers exact tests became significant by our method but the number was smaller given these results we believe that our method_produces associations which are more directly attributable to true differences in protein expression between categories rather than the inherent experimental bias in discovery proteomics the peptide model developed on the training_set indicated that mass_spectrometry indeed preferentially identifies peptides with particular properties with molecular_weight and hydrophobicity having the largest influence model_selection on the test_dataset indicated that a model with quadratic terms with the exception of hydrophobicity provided superior_performance over a model with linear terms by receiver_operator roc_curve analysis supplementary_material this is to be expected given the relationship between many of the peptide properties and the probability of peptide_identification as a validity check of our peptide model predicted probabilities from our model were compared with a model using a random_forest approach the enhanced signature peptide predictor esp roc_curve analysis indicated that our logistic_model outperformed the random_forest area under the curve versus possible explanations could be overfitting or high correlation between peptide properties indicating non independence between variables also the esp model was not developed specifically for shotgun_proteomics and is possibly inappropriate in our scenario developing and training our own model was therefore a logical choice another advantage of our logistic_model it that it is easier to deduce that molecular_weight and hydrophobicity have by far the most influence on the probability of peptide_identification by mass_spectrometry for protein propensity_scores the propensity for each protein was determined by aggregating the predicted probabilities of its trypticwe introduce here a discovery proteomics_data analysis method for performing accurate tests of enrichment for expressed proteins by adjusting for the bias in mass_spectrometry to identify proteins with particular biochemical_properties the fact that mass_spectrometry instruments preferentially identify proteins has been studied previously to our knowledge however no one before has used this information to adjust enrichment tests to more accurately determine which categories of proteins are significantly associated with over or underrepresentation of expressed proteins our approach theoretically works on any type of protein category go terms kegg_pathways or otherwise it is certainly logical from a biological standpoint that proteins with similar biochemical_properties associate in similar categories very hydrophobic proteins for example often tend to be associated with cell_membranes e g go in it is these biochemical_properties that translate into varying propensities for identification in mass_spectrometry and make adjusting enrichment tests necessary to avoid incorrect conclusions of biological_significance in discovery proteomics experiments we emphasize again that previous methods to adjust the significance of enrichment tests on go terms do so in an entirely different manner than our approach these other methods work by de correlating related go terms in various ways by accounting for the relationships between go terms unlike their approach we adjust for the nature of the data itself by considering the propensity of some proteins to be preferentially identified in mass_spectrometry also the functionality of these previous methods is largely confined to the go or produces trivial results on non hierarchical categories whereas our method is category independent for instance it works on kegg_pathways that are not hierarchically_structured although a caveat with our method may be that it is specifically_designed for mass_spectrometry data mass_spectrometry has basically become the standard method in discovery proteomics also despite the fact that we have applied our method to protein identification it is relevant for comparing quantitative expression this is due to the fact that the inherent bias in how proteins are identified remains true in how they are quantified e g using spectral counts or total ion_current for determining their concentrations adjusting for identification bias is obviously less relevant for relative expression since comparisons are made between identical_sequences across conditions however adjustment for identification bias may improve precision in measurements of protein expression by more optimally weighting individual_peptides thereby improving the power of tests for relative expression so it is apparent that nave application of enrichment tests is problematic enrichment tests are intended to measure the true difference in expression between protein_sets not bias in how proteins are measured we would like to state here that assessing the areas of possible variation and biases in data is an important analytical exercise transparent statistical_models in research such as the logistic_model that we have employed herein can more clearly illuminate areas of variability and possible bias also all instrumentation methods certainly contain biases in measurement therefore adaptations of our approach could be applied to other high_throughput analysis approaches our intent is to open the door to the possibilities of adjusting enrichment tests for other sorts of data gathered by a myriad of various means
