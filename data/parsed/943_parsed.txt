chase chromatin analysis and exploration tool we present chase a cross_platform desktop_application developed for interactive visu_alization exploration and clustering of epigenomic data such as chip_seq chase is designed and developed in close collaboration with several groups of biologists and bioinformati cians with a focus on usability and interactivity data can be analyzed through k_means specifying presence_or of signal in epigenetic data and performing set operations between clusters results can be explored in an interactive heat map and profile plot interface and exported for downstream_analysis or as high_quality figures suitable for publications availability_and software source_code mit_license data and video tutorials available atepigenetics is the study of changes in the regulation of gene activity and expression that are not dependent on gene sequence advances in dna_sequencing have enabled researchers to investigate the epigenetic state of cells by profiling modifications such as histone_methylation across the whole_genome using techniques such as chromatin_immunoprecipitation chipseq while computational_methods to interpret chip_seq continue to evolve and improve many questions cannot be easily addressed in an automated fashion and biologists need to be engaged directly in data_processing and interpretation several techniques such as chromasig and chromhmm use probabilistic methods for the discovery of epigenetic signatures but often require significant computational skill to use platforms such as cistrome and seqmonk www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects seqmonk provide a tool chain of diverse analysis methods and graphical interfaces for improved usability however they offer limited interactivity and visualization genome_browsers such as the washu epigenome browser are popular interactive visualization_tools that plot data along a reference_genome coordinate and display epigenomic marks as separate tracks vertically stacked to facilitate comparison local_regions can be viewed one at a time but obtaining an overview of global data patterns can be challenging more recently epiviz provides a scripting interface in addition to the genome_browser to allow invoking r functions and displaying the results within the tool however this extension remains accessible only to users with relevant technical_skills to lower this computational barrier we had previously_developed spark which employed an interactive v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com visualization for pattern discovery particularly in the early data exploration phases however support for cluster comparison and the ability to directly query for clusters with specific data patterns remain outstanding needs in addition we realized that most biologists prefer a standard heat map visualization for communicating and publishing results observing the limitations of available solutions we designed and developed chase in close collaboration with several groups of biologists and bioinformaticians with a focus on usability and interactivity the main features include bullet exploration through multiple linked interfaces including an interactive heat map and profile plot bullet automatic clustering using k means or manual clustering by sorting and selecting items in the heat map bullet querying for absence or presence of signal in epigenomic marks bullet comparing clusters by performing set operations bullet exporting results for downstream_analysis as well as producing high_quality figures for publications examples included in the supplementary document we used chase to study the relationships between dna_methylation histone_modifications and several dna_binding regulatory_proteins in mouse_embryonic mescs data available at the tool website after loading the data we performed a clustering across promoter_regions using chip_seq for h_k and h_k histone_modifications characteristic of transcriptionally_active and silent promoters respectively we specified these two marks for clustering by selecting the corresponding check boxes in k means pane the clustering_results are shown in a tree in the workspace pane in a with each cluster connected to the corresponding section in the heat map in c the top cluster shows low h_k blue and moderate to high h_k yellow red indicative of active promoters in contrast the middle cluster has moderate h_k and h_k blueyellow typical of transcriptionally poised or bivalent promoters the bottom cluster contains low levels of both modifications blue indicative of inactive promoters we used the contextual menu to appropriately label each of the clusters in the workspace pane we wanted to examine the dna_methylation of these subpopulations as well as to study the tet family of proteins known to catalyze the oxidation of methylcytosine mc to hydroxylmethylcytosine hmc consistent with recent_reports we observed high levels of hmc in the presence of tet at bivalent promoters in the middle cluster of c intriguingly the top cluster of c shows high levels of tet but only low to moderate levels of mc and hmc consistent with the model that h_k marked promoters harbor very low levels of dna_methylation we also investigated the enrichment of the eset histone_methyltransferase at gene_promoters this protein catalyzes the methylation of h k and deposition of h_k at retrotransposons and certain gene_promoters examining h_k and eset chip_seq revealed that eset bound promoters in the top and middle clusters were almost all devoid of h_k this raised the possibility that eset functions at promoters independent of its catalytic_activity perhaps to positively_influence transcription furthermore the presence of h_k at both the top and middle clusters may prevent the bound eset from depositing h_k at such genomic_sites although these observations have yet to be validated by further lab experiments this example demonstrated the effectiveness of chase for deriving new hypotheses
