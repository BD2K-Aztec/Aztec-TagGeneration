structural_bioinformatics contact_map using a large_scale ensemble of rule sets and the fusion of multiple predicted structural_features motivation the prediction of a proteins contact_map has become in recent_years a crucial stepping_stone for the prediction of the complete d structure of a protein in this article we describe a methodology for this problem that was shown to be successful in casp and casp the methodology is based on i the fusion of the prediction of a variety of structural_aspects of protein residues ii an ensemble strategy used to facilitate the training_process and iii a rule_based machine_learning system from which we can extract human_readable explanations of the predictor and derive useful information about the contact_map representation results the main part of the evaluation is the comparison against the sequence_based contact prediction_methods from casp where our method presented the best rank in five out of the six evaluated met rics we also assess the impact of the size of the ensemble used in our predictor to show the trade_off between performance and training time of our method finally we also study the rule sets generated by our machine_learning system from this analysis we are able to estimate the contribution of the attributes in our representation and how these interact to derive contact predictions contact_map cm prediction is one of the most challenging problems within the field of protein_structure psp this is due to the sparseness of the contacts i e the positive examples and the large training_sets millions of instances gbs of disk_space that are generated by using just a few thousands of proteins cm can provide_crucial for improving psp methods in a variety of ways providing restraints candidate conformations reconstructing approximate d structures from the cm or selecting good models most cm prediction_methods use a sequence based_approach using machine_learning through the years many techniques have been applied to cm prediction such as neural_networks support_vector genetic_programming or random_forests moreover many sources of information can be used for cm prediction beside evolutionary_information used by all methods some use predicted_secondary ss predicted solvent_accessibility sa correlated_mutations contact propensity statistics over the connecting segment between the pair of target residues or global protein information the diversity of information_sources as well as the fact that cm datasets can easily reach millions of residue pairs requires the use of methods that can cope with both large instance sets and high_dimensionality spaces this article introduces the prediction methodology with which we have participated in the last two editions of the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp experiment under the name infobiotics the main characteristics of this predictor are i an ensemble architecture designed to alleviate the sparseness and large training_set sizes of the cm problem ii the fusion of several predicted d structural_features beside the usual ss and sa we also use the less frequently used coordination_number cn and our own d metric called recursive convex_hull rch which models the degree of burial of an amino_acid aa within a protein by modelling a proteins structure as a series of nested convex hulls and assigning each residue to a certain hull and iii a robust genetic_algorithms based rule learning system called biohel http icos cs nott ac uk software biohel html that has been designed to cope with both large_numbers of instances and large dimensionality spaces and has been successfully_applied across a broad range of bioinformatics problems we assess the prediction capacity of our method first on a set of non redundant protein_chains and afterwards on the casp and casp free modelling targets finally we compare the performance of our method against the top sequence_based in casp showing that our method is very competitive being the top_ranked sequence_based method in most metrics we also assessed the influence of the size of the ensemble architecture on its performance finally the added benefit of using a rule_based machine_learning system such as biohel is that we can study the human_readable solutions it produces to understand how the system predicts identifying which attributes are the most useful and how they interact to whom correspondence should be addressed we have evaluated our cm predictor according to the casp evaluation rules where i only long_range at least residues apart are considered ii the predicted contacts are ranked by confidence iii only the top_ranked l and l predicted contacts l chain_length are considered and iv the performance_metrics considered are accuracy acc defined as tp tp fp and xd defined as where pp i is the percentage of predicted pairs with a distance between i and i pa i is the percentage of all pairs with a distance between i and i and d i is the upper_limit of the ith bin normalized to
