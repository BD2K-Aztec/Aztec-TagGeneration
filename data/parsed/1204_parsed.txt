structural_bioinformatics crossfinder assisted mapping of protein crosslinks formed by site specifically incorporated crosslinkers protein crosslinking has been used for decades to derive structural_information about proteins and protein_complexes only recently however it became possible to map the amino_acids involved in the crosslinks with the advent of high_resolution ms here we present crossfinder which automates the search for crosslinks formed by site specifically incorporated crosslinking amino_acids in lc_ms data availability_and an executable version of crossfinder for windows machines bit is freely_available to non commercial users it is bundled with a manual and example data for decades protein crosslinking has been a widely used technique to obtain information about the structural architecture of proteins and protein_complexes the full potential of the technique however was achieved only recently when it became technically_feasible to map the precise amino_acids that are involved in the crosslink by high_accuracy mass_spectrometry ms and dedicated bioinformatic_tools that mine the ms datasets applications include probing protein conformations mapping interaction surfaces between proteins and elucidating the structural architectures of protein_complexes crosslinking can be induced for example by adding a chemical with two reactive groups to a protein solution the chemical will then crosslink accessible amino_acids several software solutions exist to map these kinds of crosslinks from ms data alternatively the crosslinker can be site specifically installed into the protein e g during chemical_synthesis or by using genetically_encoded crosslinking amino_acids sitespecifically attached crosslinkers have several advantages see for discussion among them is the possibility to target the crosslinker to specific regions of the protein through this targeted approach we could e g validate a crystal interface in solution dedicated software_tools to map crosslinks formed by site specifically installed crosslinkers are scarce unfortunately to map such crosslinks we previously_developed a collection of matlab scripts programming_skills were needed to use the scripts however limiting their practicality moreover the scripts lacked a convenient workflow had no intuitive_user and it was not possible to easily visualize and browse through the results collectively these issues limited wide_spread application of crosslinking approaches in which the crosslinking moiety is sitespecifically incorporated into the protein we introduce here an easy to use executable version of crossfinder that intuitively integrates all steps of the analysis
