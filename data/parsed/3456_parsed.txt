pathway analysis by randomization incorporating structure paris an update motivation we present an update to the pathway_enrichment tool pathway analysis by randomization incorporating structure paris that determines aggregated association_signals generated from genome_wide results pathway based analyses highlight biological_pathways associated with phenotypes paris uses a unique permutation strategy to evaluate the genomic_structure of interrogated pathways through permutation_testing of genomic_features thus eliminating many of the over testing concerns arising with other pathway analysis approaches results we have updated paris to incorporate expanded pathway definitions through the incorporation of new expert_knowledge from multiple database sources through customized user provided pathways and other improvements in user flexibility and functionality genome_wide gwas have been successful in identifying genetic_variants that have revealed new insights into the genetic_architecture of complex human_diseases and traits however most reported gwas variants confer only incremental risk and only explain a small proportion of disease heritability pathway analysis algorithms were created to aggregate singlevariant statistical_analysis results to identify pathways with enrichment of genetic_associations these build a higher_level abstraction of single_variant data and collapse it into biologically informed gene_sets comprising pathways version of the pathway analysis by randomization incorporating structure paris tool was created to evaluate aggregated association_signals generated from gwas experiments across pathways of interest including the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg_pathway paris groups the snps into linkage_disequilibrium ld and linkage equilibrium le features defined based on available ld_information for the population of interest these features are further grouped into pathways defined by online or manually_curated sources and analysis is performed using a file defining the composition of the defined pathways of interest a file containing the association_statistics and a file defining the ld block regions for the target population the significance of a pathway is determined by permutation_testing of random pathways of similar composition composed of ld and le blocks of similar size in each permutation the features in a pathway are replaced by a randomly_selected set of features of similar size and number thus mimicking the physical features of the pathway of interest the total number of features with a significant p value is compared between the true and random pathways if the pathway of interest contains a higher number of significant features than the random pathways the pathway of interest will then be considered significant this approach was chosen to minimize execution time to allow for a more flexible user input and to correct the analysis for genome_structure paris additionally allows for assessment of the contribution of each gene to the overall pathway signal providing information about whether or not it appears many genes are contributing to a signal or instead one gene with many significant features contributes to the signal detected for a specific pathway this provides a faster method compared to other methods that re compute association_statistics the method by which paris corrects for gene size and ld were extensively tested and were reported in the previous_article the paris program only requires gwas results that meet the input requirements i e include variant position chromosome_number and p value here we describe paris v a new python implementation of paris as part of the biofilter software_suite outlines the updates to paris where orange elements represent changes to the software_tool the previous version of paris was designed as a stand alone program now we have updated and adapted paris to be part of biofilter which via the library of knowledge integration database allows broader access to external databases including kegg gene_ontology go reactome biogrid mint pfam pharmgkb and netpath in addition to manually_curated pathways and provides a more flexible and user_friendly command_line user_interface as a result of integrating paris into biolfilter analysis options are extended to include all of those available in the biofilter program additionally users now have the option to prioritize the permutation space to increase execution performance and omit unnecessary calculations for low impact variants with p value above a user_defined threshold that do not contribute to the final_result paris permutations will terminate early if the user specified p value threshold is reached as part of the improved user_interface paris now allows for better error identification compared to the previous version input errors will print to the screen or logfile when encountered additionally paris now channels error_prone results to an output_file that separates unused input to invalid files one new option is the ability to correct for errors in variant position mapping in the case that a variant was mapped to a wrong chromosome the program automatically re maps the variant to the correct chromosome this change is tracked in the log file and can be checked by the user a crucial new aspect in paris version is the extension of feature boundaries these can now be expanded beyond physical gene boundaries to match variants within user specified distances outside the ld feature region of interest paris is now able to utilize custom ld and le information beyond the default hapmap northern europeans from utah ceu population a guided example for using the paris package is included in the supplementary_materials paris was originally developed to evaluate the non random aggregation of common_variant single marker gwas signals that do not necessarily attain gwas level significance but that approach significance and aggregate in biological_pathways of interest thus providing a method by which to detect the presence of concomitant biological trends across pathways and other connections between genes and biological_features in terms of genetic_associations the prior version of paris had limited access to outdated databases as part of the biofilter package paris now accesses updated knowledge sources thus relaying the most pertinent biological_information relevant to analysis paris now incorporates a more user_friendly interface in addition to accessing the options available in biofilter limitations of paris include that results are limited to the scope of the input_data i e if gwas results from an array with poor genomic coverage are evaluated by paris the pathways of interest will necessarily be limited to those with variants present in the input additionally paris includes ld_information from european_populations ceu however user_defined ld definitions can be used future versions will incorporate more diverse ld definitions in conclusion paris version allows for more flexible and extended utilization beyond the initial version while also giving results that are consistent with the original implementation and thus providing an updated tool for secondary pathway analysis of genome_wide data
