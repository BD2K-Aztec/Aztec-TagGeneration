regulatory_interactions maintaining self_renewal of human_embryonic as revealed through a systems analysis of pi_k motivation maintenance of the self_renewal state in human embry onic stem_cells hescs is the foremost critical step for regenerative_therapy applications the insulin mediated pi_k is well appreciated as being the central pathway supporting hesc self_renewal however the regulatory_interactions in the pathway that maintain cell state are not yet known identification of these regulatory pathway_components will be critical for designing targeted interventions to facilitate a completely defined platform for hesc propagation and differentiation here we have developed a systems analysis approach to identify regulatory_components that control pi_k in self renewing hescs results a detailed mathematical_model was adopted to explain the complex regulatory_interactions in the pi_k we evaluated globally sensitive processes of the pathway in a computationally_efficient manner by replacing the detailed model by a surrogate meta model our mathematical_analysis supported by experimental_validation reveals that negative_regulators of the molecules irs and pip primarily govern the steady_state of the pathway in hescs among the regulators negative_feedback via irs reduces the sensitivity of various reactions associated with direct trunk of the pathway and also constraints the propagation of parameter_uncertainty to the levels of post receptor signaling_molecules furthermore our results suggest that inhibition of negative_feedback can significantly increase p akt levels and thereby better support hesc self_renewal our integrated mathematical_modeling and experimental workflow demonstrates the significant_advantage of computationally_efficient meta model approaches to detect sensitive targets from signaling_pathways availability_and fortran codes for the pi_k and the rs hdmr implementation are available from the authors upon request long_term maintenance of human_embryonic hescs in the self_renewal state requires a fine balance of many signaling_pathways including pi k tgf wnt and erk several earlier_studies have reported that the pi_k plays_a in balancing self_renewal and differentiation but with limited mechanistic_details the pioneering work by singh et_al first recognized the presence of molecular_switches controlled by the pi_k that promotes self_renewal in its active_state and strengthens the differentiation_signals in its inactive_state kinase p akt is a key effector of the pi_k and participates in critical_functions like survival metabolism protein_synthesis cell_cycle etc in addition in hescs p akt regulates the activity of pluripotency factors like c_myc and controls the levels of differentiation molecules like psmad p erk p gsk in the self_renewal state therefore maintaining high levels of p akt is necessary for long_term self_renewal of hescs in spite of the recognized role of p akt there is limited understanding on the maintenance of p akt levels in hescs by the network of regulatory_interactions the pi_k includes several positive_and and negative_regulators like the molecules ptp pten ship that together influence its state analysis of such regulatory_interactions will be helpful in the design of targeted molecules to support self_renewal this however requires a quantitative systems level approach rather than a restricted study of few interactions therefore in the current work we have used an integrated experimental and computational_approach to identify regulatory_interactions maintaining p akt levels during hesc self_renewal this being the first effort toward modeling the pi_k dynamics in hescs our workflow includes the following critical steps i determine a mathematical structure adequately describing the hesc system ii determine the parameter range over which the model captures hesc behavior iii identify the relative importance of components of the pathway in hescs and iv validate the model predicted sensitive processes in hescs these steps result in a validated mathematical representation of the pathway for hescs however any modeling effort of a biological system is incomplete without understanding how parameter variability affects its predictions we treat this as an important requirement because of the notorious cell to cell variability in hesc systems we therefore v analyze the propagation of uncertainty in the pathway under various states to whom correspondence should be addressed of the identified sensitive regulators this will in turn allow identification of processes that promote a robust behavior under experimental variability to accomplish these objectives we started with a wellestablished ordinary_differential ode model of insulin mediated pi_k developed for adipocytes by the model is a compendium of accepted knowledge of the pathway and has been successfully tested in many mammalian_systems we developed a systematic procedure to adopt the sedaghat model to a system of self renewing hescs we first performed extensive parameter sampling to identify the mechanisms relevant for hescs we next evaluated the most significant_contributors to the active levels of key molecules using global sensitivity analysis gsa we adopted random_sampling high_dimensional model representation rs hdmr based meta modeling_approach to overcome the large monte_carlo mc sampling requirements of the traditional gsa the model predicted sensitive processes were successfully validated by a series of perturbation experiments our workflow thus demonstrates the application of computationally_efficient techniques for mechanism detection in uncertain systems like hescs the current work has developed a mathematical structure of the pi_k validated by experiments to describe self renewing hescs adoption of rs hdmr a powerful metamodeling technique allowed feasible evaluation of gsa of the complex non linear pathway an important conclusion from our study is that the maintenance of p akt levels and hence the self_renewal state of hescs is controlled by many of the negative processes of the pathway additionally non linear interactions identified by rs hdmr show that the existing negative_feedback plays an important role of desensitizing the pathway to input perturbations and thus regulates the steady_state distribution of molecules in self renewing hescs inhibition of negative_feedback can significantly increase p akt levels and support self_renewal but with a trade_off associated with increased variability such mechanistic analysis of new systems like hescs is a critical step toward identification of new targets for optimizing cell
