gene_expression accounting for non genetic_factors by low_rank representation and sparse regression for eqtl_mapping motivation expression_quantitative eqtl studies investigate how gene_expression levels are affected by dna_variants a major_challenge in inferring eqtl is that a number of factors such as unobserved covariates experimental artifacts and unknown environmental_perturbations may confound the observed expression levels this may both mask real associations and lead to spurious association findings results in this article we introduce a low_rank representation to account for confounding_factors and make use of sparse regression for eqtl_mapping lors we integrate the low_rank representation and sparse regression into a unified_framework in which single_nucleotide and gene_probes can be jointly analyzed given the two model_parameters our formulation is a convex_optimization we have developed an efficient algorithm to solve this problem and its convergence is guaranteed we demonstrate its ability to account for non genetic effects using simulation and then apply it to two independent real_datasets our results indicate that lors is an effective tool to account for non genetic effects first our detected associations show higher consistency between studies than recently_proposed methods second we have identified some new hotspots that can not be identified without accounting for non genetic effects nowadays both gene_expression levels and hundreds of thousands of single_nucleotide snps can be measured by high_throughput this allows us to systematically explore the relationship between gene_expression levels and genotypes whether a gene is differentially_expressed with different genotypes or alleles at a specific locus the loci that are associated with gene_expression levels are known as expression_quantitative eqtl recently a large number of eqtls have been found in eqtl studies these findings provide insights on how gene_expression levels are affected by specific genetic_variants they may further help to prioritize disease associated loci and contribute to disease understanding an important issue in eqtl_mapping is that a fairly_large proportion of the measured gene_expression variations may not be caused by genetic_variants but by some other factors including cellular state environmental_factors and experimental_conditions a typical example is the batch_effect which may arise when sub groups of samples were processed by different laboratories different technicians or on different days because these factors are unrelated to genetic_variants we call them non genetic_factors in the rest of the article some of the non genetic effects can be directly measured for example when the batch information is available the batch_effects may be adjusted e g an empirical_bayes method_named combat however in practice non genetic_factors may not be directly and completely observable and thus remain hidden for example showed that cell culture_conditions have an unnegligible influence on a large_number gagnonreported that a substantial within batch_effect exists in the microarray quality_control study expression heterogeneity eh arises when these hidden_factors are not taken into account in statistical_analysis showed that eh not only leads to the reduction of statistical_power but also spurious association_signals in eqtl_mapping recently capturing eh in gene_expression studies has drawn the attention of researchers many methods have been proposed to infer the hidden_factors by some forms of factor_analysis and adjust the inferred factors as if they were observed one well known method that attempts to address_these is the surrogate_variable sva it performs principal_component while taking genotypes into consideration and uses permutation to choose the number of principal_components proposed the intersample correlation emended ice eqtl_mapping method in which a linear_mixed was introduced to model the hidden_factors when modeling eh used the covariance_matrix of the gene_expression data as the eh covariance_matrix in their ice model however this estimate is inconsistent and thus reduces the power of eqtl_mapping introduced another linear_mixed named to whom correspondence should be addressed lmm eh which corrected the inconsistency of the estimated eh covariance_matrix once the latent covariance_matrix has been estimated lmm eh can scan every gene snp pair alternatively jointly modeled snps gene_probes and hidden confounders into a bayesian_framework despite its greatly_increased power in eqtl_mapping its heavy computational_burden might limit its usage proposed another model named panama and borrowed some computational_techniques from gaussian_process and further improved the performance of eqtl_mapping however during the model optimization panama may be trapped in a local optimum because the optimization_problem is not convex in this article we introduce an alternative formulation to address_this we propose a low_rank representation to account for non genetic_factors and make use of sparse regression for eqtl_mapping lors we integrate the low_rank representation and sparse regression into a unified_framework in which snps and gene_probes can be jointly analyzed given the two regularization parameters the optimization of the model structure is a convex problem we have developed an efficient algorithm to solve this convex problem and its convergence is guaranteed we demonstrate its usefulness through its applications to both synthetic data and real_data
