sequence_analysis sensitive gene fusion_detection using ambiguously mapping rna_seq read_pairs motivation paired_end whole transcriptome_sequencing provides evidence for fusion_transcripts however due to the repetitiveness of the transcriptome many reads have multiple high_quality mappings previous methods to find gene_fusions either ignored these reads or required additional longer single reads this can obscure up to of fusions and unnecessarily discards much of the data results we present a method for using paired_end to find fusion_transcripts without requiring unique mappings or additional single_read sequencing using simulated_data and data from tumors and cell_lines we show that our method can find fusions with ambiguously mapping read_pairs without generating numerous spurious fusions from the many mapping locations the discovery of chimeric_transcripts emerging from different and potentially distant genes has introduced another layer of complexity to the genome additionally the importance of fusion_transcripts in the genesis and progression of cancer is becoming increasingly apparent fusion_transcripts may be the product of trans_splicing the joining of two different transcripts emerging from distinct and often distant genes this is especially common among lower eukaryotes where trans_splicing is part of normal transcript processing however trans_splicing has also been observed in higher_eukaryotes including humans additionally fusions may be produced by adjacent genes yielding a single joined rna product creating a read through transcript fusion_transcripts can also result to whom correspondence should be addressed from genomic rearrangement that brings together two once distant regions of the genome probably the best known example of this type of fusion is bcr_abl a product of a chromosomal_translocation found in many hematologic cancers and a successful drug_target in addition a growing list of fusion_genes are being found in both hematologic and solid_tumors that are the product of genomic lesions or transsplicing thus the study of fusion_transcripts has implications clinically as well for our basic understanding of the genome the development of high_throughput methods such as rna_seq has offered an opportunity to hasten a fuller characterization of the transcriptome including the identification of fusion_transcripts demonstrated the potential of the technology by applying transcriptome_sequencing to several tumors and cancer_cell using two different sequencing protocols they were able to detect known fusions such as tmprss_erg in a prostate_cancer cell_line and bcr_abl in a leukemia cell_line additionally they identified and experimentally confirmed multiple previously_unidentified fusions later carried_out similar work on the melanoma transcriptome finding novel fusions alongside these biological discoveries has been the development of computational_tools and frameworks for the detection of fusion_transcripts from rna_seq developed a method for joining partial alignments of single rna_seq to find splice_junctions and gene_fusions upon application of the method to a public dataset they found hundreds of examples of transcripts that apparently spanned different chromosomes but were doubtful that many were genuine fusion_genes created a probabilistic_method for aligning rna_seq read_pairs that uses expectationmaximization em to find maximum_likelihood alignments they showed that paired_end better cover splice_junctions than single reads and that their method can reliably identify splice_junctions then by augmenting their approach with long single reads they were able to identify gene_fusions in two cancer_cell common to all of these efforts has been the requirement that a fusion_transcript be supported by reads that map uniquely to the genome or transcriptome maher and colleagues required single best_hit mappings to the genome or mapped short nt illumina a read_pair that maps to a fusion between genes a and b may also map to homologous_genes leading either to spurious fusion candidates or the elimination of read_pairs supporting a true fusion from consideration paired_end to sequences derived from nt roche reads required paired_end to map uniquely and at least one end of a read to unambiguously map to a junction between exons required each partial alignment for each read to be unique considered fusion discovery with short paired_end infeasible and found putative fusions with uniquely mapping nt single reads these strategies highlight a key difficulty in the analysis of transcriptome sequencing_data the transcriptome is filled with repetitive and similar sequences and many reads cannot be unambiguously mapped to a reference some of the repetitiveness is attributable to known repeat families such as the alu repeat_sequence which can be found both in and utrs as well as occasionally in coding_sequence additionally many genes are part of gene_families or have paralogs or expressed pseudogenes and thus share sequence_homology with other parts of the transcriptome reads mapping to these genes or regions of these genes will often map well to other loci ambiguously mapped_reads are a concern for all transcriptome_sequencing analyses and have previously been addressed by discarding them or by proportionately allocating them over the different positions to which they map however this issue becomes more prominent for gene_fusions because combinations of mappings are considered consider for example a fusion between a pair of genes a and b it is possible that a read_pair that maps to this fusion will also map to paralogs of each gene say a and b if all of these mappings were accepted as true then three spurious fusions would be called if the read_pair was discarded because of its ambiguous mappings evidence for the true fusion would be disregarded as we detail below our simulations indicate that these ambiguously mapping reads are present in up to of the possible gene_fusions underscoring the significance of the problem in this article we propose a method to discover fusion_transcripts that exploits ambiguously mapping rna_seq read_pairs does not require additional long nt or greater single_read sequencing and decreases the occurrence of mapping artifacts we begin by mapping read_pairs to the transcriptome independently without imposing any unique mappability criterion we then find pairs which do not map to the same gene and build a set of possible gene_fusions from the mappings of each read next we employ a generative_model of rna_seq that utilizes mapping qualities and insert_size distributions to resolve any ambiguous mappings after the convergence of the em technique used to find maximum_likelihood transcript_abundances we perform a final partial expectation step for the discordantly mapping read_pairs to find optimal fusion assignments for pairs that span fusion junctions in this way rather than discarding ambiguously mapping read_pairs or allowing them to overstate the number of fusions present we find the best supported fusions by using the mappings of all the reads in the dataset the quality of those mappings and the implied insert_sizes of read_pairs that span a fusion site this allows our method to more sensitively detect gene_fusions than if ambiguously mapping read_pairs were discarded we have implemented our method on simulated_data generated from fusions between genes with very high similarity to other genes to demonstrate that our method can resolve the ambiguous mappings to find the correct fusions when it is possible to do so we then implemented it on reads derived from neoplastic and hyperplastic prostate_tissue and recovered the known tmprss_erg along with several read through fusions without finding many spurious poorly supported fusions as a result of allowing reads to have many mappings finally using publicly_available data from several melanoma_tumors and cell_lines we find fusion_events that would not be detectable without allowing for multimapping reads that span the fusion site in this article we have demonstrated a method to use discordantly and often ambiguously mapping rna_seq read_pairs to identify fusion_transcripts in doing so we bring the increasingly_sophisticated methods_employed to estimate transcript_abundance in the presence of multimapping reads to the problem of fusion discovery in contrast to previously_proposed methods for fusion identification that focus on reads that map to the junction between two genes our method estimates fusion transcript_abundances by considering physical coverage over the entire length of the proposed fusion in addition it employs several filters to minimize experimental artifacts finally it does not require that any single_read sequence hit the point of fusion instead it uses implied insert_sizes and known exon boundaries to determine the most likely point of fusion this would be a liability if a fusion_transcript contained partial exons but reported fusions to date suggest that a vast_majority of fusions do indeed involve the joining of whole exons from different genes the breakpoints occurring in introns and the splice_sites remaining unchanged several avenues for future development are apparent from this work here we chose to use refseq transcripts as the reference against which reads are mapped this allowed us to avoid the issue of reads that map to splice_junctions because the splice_junction sequence would be contiguous in the transcript_sequence however it prevents us from identifying transcripts that are produced by novel or aberrant_splicing which is common in cancer or are significantly altered by rna_editing it may be fruitful to combine the approach described here with methods that identify splice_junctions and expressed regions of the genome de_novo additionally fusion_transcript discovery shares many parallels with the problem of resolving genomic_rearrangements especially the challenges of repetitive sequence the adaptation of the methods developed here to genomic_sequencing may prove useful in this related field
