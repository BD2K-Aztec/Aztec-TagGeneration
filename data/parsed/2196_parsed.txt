genetics_and highssr high_throughput ssr characterization and locus development from next gen sequencing_data microsatellites are among the most useful genetic_markers in population biology high_throughput of microsatel lite enriched libraries dramatically expedites the traditional process of screening recombinant libraries for microsatellite_markers however sorting through millions of reads to distill high_quality polymorphic_markers requires special algorithms tailored to tolerate sequencing_errors in locus reconstruction distinguish paralogous loci rarify raw_reads originating from the same amplicon and sort out various artificial fragments resulting from recombination or concatenation of auxiliary adapters existing programs warrant improvement results we describe a microsatellite prediction framework named highssr for microsatellite genotyping based on high_throughput we demonstrate the utility of highssr in comparison to roche gsassembler on two roche gs flx runs the majority of the highssr assembled loci were reliably mapped against model_organism reference_genomes highssr demultiplexes pooled libraries assesses locus polymorphism and implements primer for the design of pcr_primers flanking polymorphic_microsatellite as sequencing_costs drop and permit the analysis of all project samples on next generation platforms this framework can also be used for direct simple_sequence genotyping microsatellites or simple_sequence ssrs are tandemly_repeated dna motifs bp in length that typically harbor high levels of sequence_polymorphism this level of variability has led to widespread use of ssrs in many areas of molecular_biology including applications in forensics and paternity testing population_genetics and conservation management of biological resources until recently the major_obstacle to ssr use was slow and costly de_novo isolation of ssrs for each taxon being investigated ssr marker development has typically involved fractionation of the genome enrichment for ssr containing fragments construction of a clone_library from the enriched fraction sanger_sequencing of clones and informatics analysis to identify ssr containing fragments and pcr primer sites the procedure continues with the evaluation of amplification efficiency and polymorphism of each locus thus it entails considerable time and investment to develop the large_numbers of ssrs necessary to study patterns of diversification between populations or to construct genetic_maps next_generation are revolutionizing the process of ssr discovery by reducing cost and time to a fraction of what was previously needed but the millions of raw sequencing_reads they produce necessitates in silico automation of ssr prediction and locus classification in this article we present the highssr framework for ssr discovery and locus development from generated raw_data highssr facilitates the recognition of ssr motifs the parsing of mid tagged sequences for identification of multiplexed samples the identification of unique ssr loci within a sample and the development of pcr_primers for the recovered loci unlike other methods highssr first predicts ssrs for all input_sequences and later uses the ssrs as pivots to assemble loci in other words it begins by grouping reads based on their ssr motif and proceeds toward locus identification through comparisons of the more complex flanking_regions the approach greatly_reduces computational time by eliminating the need for all against all alignments as implemented in qdd framework and therefore permits ssr locus identification and development from millions of reads simultaneously it also takes_advantage of a postgresql database for efficient data management throughout the process in this article we evaluate highssr using multiplexed ssr enriched sequences collected on the roche gs flx platform first hereafter the first run we examine two siblings of a non model butterfly of conservation concern euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti because previously_reported lepidoptera ssr primers to whom correspondence should be addressed failed for their genotyping next hereafter the second run we evaluate the performance of highssr in a multiplexed experiment of species including mosquito cress plant and chestnut blight fungus aedes_aegypti arabidopsis_thaliana and cryphonectria parasitica respectively for which there are published genomes and also nine populations of euphydryas butterfly without reference_genomes in the first run highssr reduced million raw sequence_reads to unique ssr containing loci with a consensus size of nt shared between two samples tables and the number of reconstructed loci is substantially lower than the number of putative loci because paralogous loci and loci with flanking_sequences of low complexity are removed three of primer_pairs chosen for genotyping from the first run were verified in three individuals by sanger_sequencing as reported in supplementary_materials the number of sequences demultiplexed from the second run is reported in supplementary_materials and positively_identified mids out number false_positives by two orders_of the number of predicted false_positives compares directly to that predicted by roche demultiplexing utility sffinfo with several hundred false_positives per quarter plate region lists the number of unique loci reconstructed using highssr in comparison to gsassembler for model species in the second run for all but one sample a aegypti highssr recovered at least five times more loci than gsassembler in our experiments we ran gsassembler on raw_reads from the same sample although gsassembler can report microsatellite polymorphisms among the variants found default assembly settings proved very rudimentary for efficient microsatellite handling we mapped all loci recovered by highssr to the published genomes of a thaliana a aegypti and c parasitica using gsmapper with default_parameters to test highssrs ability to assemble complex loci and parse orthologs into separate loci all reconstructed loci were also reciprocally mapped with blastn using an expectation threshold of between and of all loci recovered by highssr mapped to the published genomes and of the mapped regions corresponded to unique non overlapping locations in the genome locus reconstruction based on the muscle guide_tree consensuses d and x are treated as paralogs if they are too distant arrows indicate what consensuses are combined according to a guide_tree toward unified consensus representing a multiple_alignment combining corresponding raw_reads schematic representation of multiple_sequence used for locus reconstruction the consensus is reconstructed by assigning a nucleotide at each position most common in the multiple_alignment column corresponding to that positionprograms predicting ssrs within genomic_dna can be subdivided into several categories according to their underlying approach repeatmasker http www repeatmasker org and dust simple are used to mask low complexity fragments in biological_sequences to speed up genome_wide pattern match searches star and troll look for predefined tandem motifs in the query_sequence trf is a popular ssr prediction and scoring tool that is based on sound probabilistic_model trdb insatdb trbase vntrfinder along with polypredictr o and ucsc_genome use trf as an internal microsatellite prediction engine we also adopted trf for ssr prediction following the observation that raw sequencing_reads frequently contain sequencing artifacts and polymorphic variations highssr represents an improvement over existing programs for the discovery of ssrs from next generation sequence files highssr reconstructs more loci than roche gsassembler newbler majority of the highssr assembled loci map against the reference_genome all the loci mapped against the reference_genomes in unique non overlapping positions
