mace mutation oriented profiling of chemical response and gene_expression in cancers the mutational_status of specific cancer lineages can affect the sensitivity to or resistance against cancer drugs the mace database provides web based_interactive tools for interpreting large chemical_screening and gene_expression of cancer_cell in terms of mutation and lineage categories gi data of chemicals against individual nci cell_lines were normalized and organized to statistically identify mutation or lineage_specific chemical responses similarly dna microarray_data on nci cell_lines were processed to analyze mutation or lineage_specific gene_expression a combined analysis of gi and gene_expression data to find potential associations between chemicals and genes is also a capability of this system this database will provide_extensive systematic information to identify lineage or mutation specific anticancer_agents and related gene_targets availability_and the mace web database is available at http mace sookmyung ac kr various drug_responses are induced by somatic_mutations in cancers approaches to the analysis of gene_functions related to drug_sensitivity are becoming a popular strategy for overcoming drug_resistance and for predicting drug_sensitivity some efforts have focused on the lineage dependent association between cell_lines and drug response and the identification of mutation dependent compound sensitivity currently many small_molecule databases have been developed including several of the following databases chemical_information with biological_activity and target information chemical search_engines with a variety of cheminformatics tools and chemical_information with extended response profiles on biological_samples most of these databases are focused on the collection of chemical_information not organized for quantitative analysis some studies integrating drug response with genomic_data have been established on a plentiful of cell_lines but for limited_numbers of chemicals thus we developed a web_based database mace mutation oriented analysis of chemical response and gene_expression to provide mutation or lineage oriented profiling of chemical response and gene_expression on a wide_variety of cancer_cell from nci datasets the nci by thenci cancer_cell the quantified response data gi the concentration that inhibits_growth by are available for more than chemical_compounds this resource can be used to find relationships among compound structure mechanism of action cell_lineage and tumor mutations he and the nci cell_lines represent nine cancer lineage types breast cnscentral nervous_system colon leukemia melanoma lung ovarian prostate and renal mace includes top most frequently mutated genes which are found in more than cell_lines tp cdkn a pten kras braf pik_ca apc c_myc amp stk ctnnb smad rb mlh nras and tn stromal mutations in these genes are known to be involved in cancer related cellular_pathways tp is a tumor_suppressor and somatic_mutations in tp are the most common genetic changes found in human cancer defects in the gene cyclin_dependent a cdkn a is involved in the genesis of many tumor_types pten is a tumor_suppressor and pik_ca is an oncogene these proteins make up the ptenpi k signaling_pathway which is involved in the regulation of many cancer related pathways kras nras and braf are oncogenes involved in the erbb signaling_pathway which mediates cell_growth and malignant_transformation through kinase pathway activation apc is a tumor_suppressor and ctnnb is an oncogene mutations in these genes cause defects in wnt_signaling high expression of the oncogene c_myc c_myc amp and mutational inactivation of the tumor_suppressor rb cause dysregulation of cell_cycle control stk has been identified as a tumor_suppressor involved in the development of cancer especially in lung_cancer mutation of smad results in disruption of tgfbeta_signaling and occurs frequently in association with malignant_progression genetic_mutation of mlh is associated with colon_cancer and activated expression of tn stromal is related to human breast_cancer mace provides tools for category based analysis of chemical response or gene_expression in cancer_cell finding a correlation between chemical response and gene_expression on nci cell_lines and d or d based chemical structural searches in real_time the term category refers to mutational or lineage groups of cell_lines and thus a specific category indicates a specific mutation or lineage e g braf or lung
