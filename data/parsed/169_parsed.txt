a graphical method for reducing and relating models in systems_biology motivation in systems_biology an increasing collection of models of various biological_processes is currently developed and made available in publicly_accessible repositories such as biomodels net for instance through common exchange formats such as sbml to date however there is no general method to relate different models to each other by abstraction or reduction relationships and this task is left to the modeler for re using and coupling models in mathematical biology model reduction techniques have been studied for a long time mainly in the case where a model exhibits different time scales or different spatial phases which can be analyzed_separately these techniques are however far too restrictive to be applied on a large_scale in systems_biology and do not take into account abstractions other than time or phase decompositions our purpose here is to propose a general computational_method for relating models together by considering primarily the structure of the interactions and abstracting from their dynamics in a first step results we present a graph_theoretic formalism with node merge and delete operations in which model reductions can be studied as graph_matching problems from this setting we derive an algorithm for deciding whether there exists a reduction from one model to another and evaluate it on the computation of the reduction relations between all sbml models of the biomodels net repository in particular in the case of the numerous models of mapk signalling and of the circadian_clock biologically_meaningful mappings between models of each class are automatically inferred from the structure of the interactions we conclude on the generality of our graphical method on its limits with respect to the representation of the structure of the interactions in sbml and on some perspectives for dealing with the dynamics availability the algorithms described in this article are implemented in the open_source modeling platform biocham available atin our algorithm the set of all morphisms or a proof of nonexistence are obtained by backtracking in the experiments reported below the computation time was limited with a timeout of min but most of the problems were solved in s on standard pc quadcore at ghz constraint based graph_matching algorithms have shown their effectiveness and efficiency to analyze and automatically relate biochemical_reaction models on a large_scale namely among the curated models of the systems_biology repository biomodels net of course such an automatic correspondence between models inferred solely from the structure of the reaction graph may be biologically erroneous in some cases in particular small reaction graphs can be recognized as motifs of biologically unrelated large reaction graphs nevertheless the search for subgraph epimorphisms between all models of the biomodels net repository revealed connected components roughly corresponding to the different models of similar biological_systems for the mapk signaling_cascade the circadian_clock and the calcium oscillation models automatically exhibiting morphisms corresponding to model reductions as well as isomorphisms corresponding to variants of the same model with different parameter_values on the other hand the cell_cycle models of this repository often originate from ode_models that have been transcribed in sbml rules without correctly reflecting the structure of the interactions as a result many model reductions could not be detected as graph morphisms more work is thus needed to curate the expression of these models in sbml and also to restrict mappings by considering the information on molecular_species present in the annotations for instance although necessarily imperfect this approach opens a new way to query systems_biology model repositories and study model reductions as subgraph epimorphism problems before taking_into constraints on the stoichiometry and the dynamics of the reactions as a perspective for future work the formal ground presented here in terms of graph operations and graph morphisms is currently used to investigate mathematical conditions under which the kinetics are compatible with graph reduction operations such as for instance bullet reaction deletions for slow reverse reactions bullet reaction mergings for reaction chains with a limiting reaction bullet molecular_species deletions for species in excess bullet molecular mergings for quasi_steady approximations
