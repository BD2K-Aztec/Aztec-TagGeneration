predicting drug_target using restricted boltzmann machines motivation in silico prediction of drug_target plays an important role toward identifying and developing new uses of existing or abandoned drugs network based_approaches have recently become a popular tool for discovering new drug_target dtis unfortunately most of these network based_approaches can only predict binary interactions between drugs and targets and information about different types of interactions has not been well exploited for dti prediction in previous_studies on the other hand incorporating additional information about drug_target relationships or drug modes of action can improve_prediction of dtis furthermore the predicted types of dtis can broaden our understanding about the molecular basis of drug_action results we propose a first machine_learning approach to integrate_multiple types of dtis and predict unknown drug_target relationships or drug modes of action we cast the new dti prediction_problem into a two layer graphical_model called restricted boltzmann machine and apply a practical learning algorithm to train our model and make predictions tests on two public_databases show that our restricted boltzmann machine model can effectively capture the latent features of a dti network and achieve excellent_performance on predicting different types of dtis with the area under precision_recall curve up to in addition we demonstrate that integrating_multiple types of dtis can significantly_outperform other predictions either by simply mixing multiple types of interactions without distinction or using only a single interaction type further tests show that our approach can infer a high fraction of novel dtis that has been validated by known experiments in the literature or other databases these results indicate that our approach can have highly practical relevance to dti prediction and drug_repositioning and hence advance the drug_discovery availability software and datasets are available on request drug_development currently remains an expensive_and process with extremely_low success_rate it typically takes years and million billion to bring a new drug to market in recent decades the rate of the number of new drugs approved by the us food_and versus the amount of money invested in pharmaceutical_research and development has significantly_declined this productivity problem has urged drug developers to seek new uses for existing or abandoned drugs such a new strategy is also called drug_repositioning or drug_repurposing a strong support for the possibility of drug_repositioning is the increasingly accepted concept of polypharmacology i e individual_drugs can interact with multiple_targets rather than a single target for example serotonin and serotonergic drugs can interact with both ht g_protein and ht a ion channel_proteins even though these two target_proteins are not related in sequence or structure this polypharmacological property of a drug enables us to identify more than one target that it can act on and hence develop its new uses in silico prediction of interactions between drugs and target_proteins provides an important tool for drug_repositioning as it can significantly reduce wet laboratory work and lower the cost of the experimental determination of new drug_target dtis various methods have been proposed for in silico dti prediction when d structures are available molecular_docking is commonly used to virtually screen a large number of compounds against a target protein when d structures of molecules are absent a number of different approaches have been developed to address the in silico dti prediction_problem most of these structure free methods can be grouped into two classes namely ligand based and network based_approaches a representative ligand based_approach is the similarity ensemble approach which predicts new dtis using d structure similarity of ligands although ligand based_approaches are able to discover a number of dtis that have been validated experimentally they have difficulty in identifying drugs with novel scaffolds that differ from those of reference_compounds numerous network based_approaches have been proposed to exploit latent features of dti profiles and have recently become a popular tool for dti prediction and drug_repositioning although these network based_approaches have achieved promising results most of them can only predict binary dtis that is they can only determine_whether a drug interacts with a target protein but cannot tell how they interact with each other however individual dtis generally have different meanings for example drug_target pairs can be described by different relationships such as direct and indirect interactions a direct interaction is usually caused by protein ligand_binding whereas an indirect interaction can be induced by the changed expression to whom

annotated with different drug modes of action e g activation and inhibition here drug modes of action may be slightly different from the term used in the literature e g in this article we mainly use this term to represent the following three specific types of interactions binding activation and inhibition hereinafter we will use types of dtis to represent both drugtarget relationships and drug modes of action a network in which links are associated with different meanings is called the multidimensional network lund zhou in our context we call a dti network where links are annotated with different types of interactions the multidimensional dti network on the one hand types of dtis provide additional useful information which can be incorporated into a multidimensional network to improve dti prediction on the other hand the predicted types of dtis can extend our understanding about the molecular basis of drug_action despite these positive aspects current rich_information about types of dtis has not been well exploited for dti prediction and how to incorporate such information into a multidimensional network to predict different types of dtis still remains_an in this article we propose an effective machine_learning approach to accurately_predict different types of dtis on a multidimensional network unlike previous network based_approaches which only predict binary dtis our approach not only identifies new dtis but also infers their corresponding types of interactions such as drug_target relationships or drug modes of action our approach uses a generalized version of a two layer undirected graphical_model called restricted boltzmann machine rbm to represent a multidimensional dti network which encodes different types of dtis in addition we apply a practical learning algorithm called contrastive divergence cd to train our rbm model and predict unknown types of dtis to our knowledge our work is the first approach to predict different types of dtis on a multidimensional network which not only describes binary dtis but also encodes their corresponding types of interactions we have tested our algorithm on two public_databases namely matador gunther and stitch which contain information about drug_target relationships and drug modes of action respectively our tests demonstrate that our rbm model can be used as a highly powerful_tool for integrating different types of dtis into a multidimensional network and predicting different types of interactions with high_accuracy in particular our results show that integrating different types of dtis into prediction with distinction can achieve the area under precision_recall curve aupr up to which can significantly_outperform other predictions either by simply mixing multiple types of interactions without distinction or using only a single interaction type further tests show that our approach can predict a high percentage of novel dtis that has been validated by known experiments in the literature or other databases these results indicate that our approach can have potential applications in drug_repositioning and hence advance the drug_discovery in this article we proposed a first machine_learning approach to predict different types of dtis on a multidimensional network our approach uses an rbm model to effectively encode multiple sources of information about dtis and accurately_predict different types of dtis such as drug_target relationships or drug modes of action tests on two public_databases showed that our algorithm can achieve excellent prediction_performance with high aupr scores further tests indicated that our approach can infer a list of novel dtis which is practically useful for drug_repositioning although our algorithm has been tested only on direct and indirect drug_target relationships and three drug modes of action it is general and can be easily extended to integrate other types of dtis e g phenotypic_effects current version of our prediction algorithm only considers connections between drugs and targets in the future we will extend our approach to exploit the connections within target_proteins or drugs for example the sequence similarity_scores between target_proteins the substructure similarity_scores between drugs or drugdrug_interactions can be also incorporated into our prediction model as the conventional version of an rbm does not allow the connections within the same layer such an extension will require careful thought currently our algorithm has been tested only on two databases i e matador and stitch we will test it on more data in the future for example it will have more significance if we can predict dtis based on human proteins and all molecules in pubchem or a similar database finally we are also seeking wet laboratory collaborators to experimentally verify the highest scoring dtis predicted by our algorithm dtis that are observed in chembl drugbank and stitch are marked with c d and s respectively
