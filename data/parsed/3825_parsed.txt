systems_biology quacn an r package for analyzing complex biological_networks quantitatively motivation network based representations of biological data have become an important way to analyze high_throughput data to interpret the large amount of data that is produced by different high_throughput networks offer multifaceted aspects to analyze the data as networks represent biological_relationships within their structure it turned out to be fruitful to analyze their topology therefore we developed a freely_available open_source r package called quantitative analysis of complex_networks quacn to meet this challenge quacn contains different information_theoretic and non information_theoretic topological network descriptors to analyze classify and compare biological_networks availability quacn is freely_available under lgpl via cran http cran r project org_web quacn to analyze structural data networks have become more and more a key_technology in systems_biology examples of underlying networks are biological_pathways proteinprotein_interactions correlation networks mutual_information networks etc clearly graph_theoretical concepts like classical graph descriptors e g degree_distribution clustering coefficients or betweenness can be used to analyze complex biological_networks these descriptors help to generate statements about network_characteristics like hubs clusters modules etc additionally there exists a large number of more sophisticated and expressive graph measures using information_theory for example lists a large number of descriptors that can be used to analyze molecular_networks they can also be utilized to analyze complex biological_networks e g gene_networks proteinprotein_interaction etc however a study to investigate the performance of these descriptors on biological_networks does not exist so_far moreover the biological meaning of these descriptors has not been explored until now to whom correspondence should be addressed topological descriptors can be used to classify and compare correlation networks created from microarray_data and to characterize chemical_compounds in order to identifying potential_drug etc we implemented a selection of sophisticated topological network measures and provide them as a package for the free_and environment r r offers several packages and methods to infer networks from biological data e g minet or wgcna which can be directly analyzed with quacn topological descriptors can be used to classify and compare correlation networks created from micro array data as published in to characterize chemical_compounds identifying potential_drug etc little is known what network_characteristics can be captured using topological descriptors exactly we recommend quacn to investigate the behavior of topological network measures on large complex_networks further we hope that the package will be helpful when exploring questions concerning the structure of biological_networks in the context of systems_biology there exist a few stand alone applications to calculate topological descriptors which are designed to work with molecular_networks due to the fact that r is commonly used in the field of bioinformatics and that biological_networks are not stored in molecular file_formats a new r package has been developed r offers a wide_range of methods to import existing networks and biological data quacn contains a selection of topological network descriptors to analyze classify and compare complex_networks we want to direct ones attention to the parametric graph entropy measures that are at the moment only available within this package they facilitate to exploit machine_learning to derive hypothesis from complex biological_datasets quacn is a a powerful open_source package for the analysis of complex biological_networks in future work we plan to apply the integrated measures on various biological research_questions and extending the range of functions with new promising descriptors for the coming versions of quacn
