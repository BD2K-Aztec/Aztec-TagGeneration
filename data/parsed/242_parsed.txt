data_and a method for finding consensus breakpoints in the cancer genome from copy_number data motivation recurrent dna breakpoints in cancer_genomes indicate the presence of critical functional_elements for tumor development identifying them can help determine new therapeutic_targets high_dimensional dna microarray_experiments like arraycgh afford the identification of dna_copy breakpoints with high_precision offering a solid basis for computational estimation of recurrent break_point locations results we introduce a method for identification of recurrent break_points consensus breakpoints from copy_number aberration data_sets the method is based on weighted kernel counting of breakpoints around genomic_locations counts larger than expected by chance are considered significant we show that the consensus breakpoints facilitate consensus segmentation of the samples we apply our method to three arraycgh datasets and show that by using consensus segmentation we achieve significant dimension_reduction which is useful for the task of prediction of tumor_phenotype based on copy_number data we use our approach for classification of neuroblastoma tumors from different age_groups and confirm the recent recommendation for the choice of age cutoff for differential treatment of months we also investigate the epi genetic properties at consensus breakpoint locations for seven datasets and show enrichment in overlap with important functional genomic_regions availability implementation in r of our approach can be found atdna breaks occur often during cell replication and are especially dangerous if the dna_repair do not succeed in restoring the damaged locus correctly erroneous dna_repair events can disrupt essential mechanisms that maintain the integrity of the cell and on rare occasions can cause the cell to become cancerous insertions deletions amplifications translocations and inversions are types of dna structural_damage frequently observed in cancer_genomes that occur as a consequence of unrepaired dna_breaks tumor_genomes exhibit hundreds of dna breakpoints some of them promote tumor development by disrupting crucial functional_elements and thus survive the selective_pressure that acts on cancer_cells these breakpoints tend to recur in tumors of the same type suggesting common progression mechanisms other breakpoints may have no or less effect on tumor_progression e g the contribution of non recurrent breakpoints that appear at arbitrary locations in the genome is difficult to evaluate identifying relevant breakpoint hotspots and characterizing their influence on tumor_phenotype can help to identify molecular factors responsible for tumor_progression and thus to develop new therapeutic_strategies very high_resolution microarray_technologies for genomewide measurement of copy_number such as arraycgh or snp_arrays can reveal dna breakpoints related to copy_number changes in cancer_genomes the resolution of microarray based_technologies can be very high with the distance between probes being as little as kb facilitating sufficiently accurate estimation of the location of a dna breakpoint the estimation is carried_out by performant segmentation_algorithms such as cbs presently large collections of high_resolution arraycgh data are publicly_available at the gene_expression geo http www ncbi nlm nih gov geo the cancer_genome tcga http cancergenome nih gov and other repositories for many types of cancer in this article we introduce an algorithm for identifying recurrent breakpoints or consensus breakpoints in tumor cohorts based on dna_copy aberration data the approach is called consensus breakpoints by kernel smoothing c ks pronounce as seeks c ks identifies genomic_locations around which breakpoints tend to accumulate more frequently than expected by chance and assigns to each a significance z_score the input of our algorithm consists of the locations of breakpoints of all tumors in the cohort therefore the computational running time is independent of the resolution of the experimental assays that produced the data in a competing approach for identifying breakpoint hotspots called neighborhood breakpoint conservation nbc is presented nbc is applied directly to to whom correspondence should be addressed the raw log ratios of arraycgh experiments the authors devise a special single array segmentation_algorithm which assigns to each pair of adjacent probes a probability of a breakpoint occurring between them then locations of recurrent breakpoints are analytically estimated and sorted by significance p value nbc has two main shortcomings first the segmentation models are based on parametric assumptions that are specific to arraycgh data and therefore not applicable to next_generation second the complexity of the nbc algorithm is high the segmentation step using a dynamic program that requires quadratic runtime in the number of array probes therefore nbc does not scale well to the most recent microarray_platforms such as agilent m or affymetrix snp by identifying consensus breakpoints our approach can afford consensus segmentation of a set of cancer_genomes which is a generalization of the single sample segmentation procedure we assume that between two consecutive consensus breakpoints each tumor has constant copy_number given for example by the average log_ratio in the case of microarrays we call these regions consensus regions to validate the c ks algorithm we use the consensus regions as super features in classification tasks that predict some binary indicator of tumor_phenotype we applied our method to seven arraycgh datasets from five cancer_types with various phenotypical annotations we show that in comparison with models trained on probe data the accuracy of the classification_models using the consensus regions is comparable and sometimes higher hence disregarding all breakpoints that are not consensus breakpoints does not adversely impact the predictive_power of the model we also show that consensus segmentation affords substantial dimension_reduction of the sample data without significant loss of information moreover we present an important biological finding that arose from our classification_models using c ks segmentation specifically the tumor_genomes of neuroblastoma patients of different age_groups are most distinct when the age grouping is defined as months against months our finding has potential impact on differential therapy of neuroblastoma patients which are currently divided_into two prognostic_groups months at diagnosis good prognosis and older poor_prognosis our result is also supported by other studies for a qualitative validation of the c ks algorithm we investigate genomic and epigenomic properties of the genomic_locations corresponding to consensus breakpoints and show that they tend to be enriched in functional_elements and certain dna sequence_patterns these associations are interesting and deserve further biological investigation we have introduced the algorithm c ks for identifying consensus breakpoints from dna copy_number data the algorithm takes as input the list of breakpoints occurring in the tumor cohort c ks uses a weighted kernel counting for evaluating the abundance of breakpoints around genomic_locations prediction of age group based copy_number data from the neuroblastoma dataset the input_features were the consensus regions resulting from segmentation with c ks a class weighted accuracy as a function of the age cut_off b feature weights in absolute value for all models dark red corresponds to weights close to zero irrelevant features and shades of yellow to white mark increasingly relevant_features for prediction the features are ordered according to the genome position on the right side the weighted class accuracy is shown a significance z_score is associated to each consensus breakpoint resulting from a comparison with null scores obtained via random permutation we also introduced the concept of consensus segmentation which is a generalization of the single sample segmentation procedure we used the consensus segmentation for representing the data into a space of lower dimensionality and carried_out classification tasks with tumor_phenotype as outcome variable we applied the c ks algorithm to seven arraycgh datasets we showed that despite the significant dimension_reduction the consensus segmentation driven by the consensus breakpoints results in comparable accuracy of prediction of the tumor_phenotype often the prediction_accuracy increases after segmentation especially in cases in which the number of samples is small based on our classification_models the copy_number aberration profiles of neuroblastoma tumors are most distinct between age_groups defined using a cut_off of months our finding confirms recent recommendations from the research_community based on arguments not incorporating copy_number profiles we believe that our result is important as it provides with a biologically founded explanation to the impact of age at diagnosis on outcome we also showed that the genomic_regions identified as tightly aligned consensus breakpoints are enriched in overlap with functional_elements such as gene_promoters cpg islands several histone_modifications and insulators which constitute interesting biological findings that deserve further investigation to conclude we describe an algorithm for identifying consensus breakpoints and a method for consensus segmentation of copy_number aberration data the substantial dimension_reduction achieved by consensus segmentation with no loss of essential predictive_information can constitute the basis of efficient downstream_analysis and data_integration properties of consensus breakpoint regions given by epiexplorer on the y axis various genomic and epigenomic properties are listed on the x axis we show the percentage of consensus breakpoint regions overlapping with each of the properties in gray the consensus breakpoints from each dataset are represented in red the random reference is shown with standard_deviation bars in white summary on the overlap of individual breakpoints with epi genomic properties
