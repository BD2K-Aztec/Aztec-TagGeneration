data_and auc based biomarker ensemble with an application on gene scores predicting low_bone motivation the area_under roc_curve auc long regarded as a golden measure for the predictiveness of a continuous score has propelled the need to develop auc based predictors however the auc based ensemble methods are rather scant largely due to the fact that the associated objective_function is neither continuous nor concave indeed there is no reliable numerical algorithm identifying optimal_combination of a set of biomarkers to maximize the auc especially when the number of biomarkers is large results we have proposed a novel auc based statistical ensemble methods for combining multiple_biomarkers to differentiate a binary response of interest specifically we propose to replace the non continuous and non convex auc objective_function by a convex surrogate loss function whose minimizer can be efficiently identified with the established framework the lasso and other regularization techniques enable feature selections extensive simulations have demonstrated the superiority of the new methods to the existing_methods the proposal has been applied to a gene_expression dataset to construct gene_expression scores to differentiate elderly_women with low_bone bmd and those with normal bmd the aucs of the resulting scores in the independent test_dataset has been satisfactory conclusion aiming for directly maximizing auc the proposed auc based ensemble_method provides an efficient means of generating a stable combination of multiple_biomarkers which is especially useful under the high_dimensional settings given that there are multiple_biomarkers and a binary response of interest e g case and control it is often of substantial interest to combine the biomarkers to form a strong scoring system for the differentiation of cases from controls while the choice of the predictive measure is not unique the most appealing choice is the area_under roc_curve auc in the casecontrol study to whom correspondence should be addressed for finite samples auc is simply the non parametric two sample mannwhitney u test_statistics unlike the measures such as misclassification rate the auc reflects the intrinsic predictive value of a score in that it does not depend on the prevalence of the cases and thus is invariant under the casecontrol sampling therefore it is natural to combine biomarkers by maximizing the auc under roc_curve however it is notoriously_difficult to maximize the auc numerically since the objective_function is neither continuous nor convex ad_hoc methods have been proposed to tackle the numerical problem for example sigmoid function has been used to approximate the indicator function used in calculating auc however the smoothed objective_function may still have multiple local maximums with no guarantee of locating the global maximizer by using the commonly used numerical algorithms in view of these challenges we propose a class of ensemble methods aiming for maximizing auc with multiple_biomarkers specifically we introduce a class of convex surrogate loss functions to approximate the non convex auc greatly facilitating computation and optimization motivated by recent_advances in data_mining we have proposed a class of methods combining biomarkers to construct a scoring system boosting the resulting auc under the roc_curve a prevalence free summarization of intrinsic predictive_values of a continuous score the method is easily adapted to high_dimensional cases wherein one may need to identify informative features from thousands of candidate_biomarkers in high_dimensional case we propose to apply lasso regularization to yield a parsimonious combination maximizing the auc on the other hand lasso is neither the unique nor the universally optimal regularization method for analyzing high_dimensional due to the convexity of the proposed loss function it is straightforward to couple m j with other penalty functions such as elastic_net adaptive lasso and scad which may have superior_performance to simple lasso in specific settings the key proposal is to target a convex surrogate loss function instead of a discontinuous mannwhitney rank statistic while in this article we have focused on the hinge loss function corresponding to the norm support_vector our results can be extended to accommodate other versions of svm loss
