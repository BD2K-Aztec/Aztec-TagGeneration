genetics_and hotspot software to support sperm typing for investigating recombination_hotspots motivation in many organisms including humans recombination clusters within recombination hot_spots the standard method for de_novo detection of recombinants at hotspots is sperm typing this relies on allele_specific at single_nucleotide designing allele_specific by hand is time consuming we have therefore written a package to support hotspot detection and analysis results hotspot consists of four programs asp looks up snps and designs allele_specific aso constructs allele specific oligos for mapping recombinants xov implements a maximum_likelihood method for estimating the crossover rate six finally simulates typing data understanding recombination is one of the classic problems in biology in the past_decade the quantitative underpinnings of the debate about the function of recombination have dramatically improved as a result of population_genomics based on genome_sequencing a major result of such studies is that in many organisms including humans recombination is localized in recombination_hotspots still direct_observation by typing of the products of recombinationusually sperm cellsis highly_desirable to check and refine the results of population_genetic inference sperm typing is usually carried_out after determining snps in a genomic_region given a set of snps linkage_disequilibrium ld can be computed between pairs of them leading to the discovery of ld blocks punctuated by hotspot candidate_regions a few kb wide the best known method for measuring the frequency of crossover at a candidate hotspot is the full crossover assay where allele_specific are designed against snps located_upstream and downstream of the putative recombination hotspot asps nested sets of phased asps are then used in repulsion phase on pools of sperm dna such that only molecules affected by a crossover are amplified to map the crossover breakpoints the snps of the amplification product are typed using allele specific oligos asos recombination results in crossovers as well as non crossovers which are characterized by short non reciprocal gene_conversion tracts both types of recombinants can be simultaneously detected by modifying the full crossover assay such that one of the two sets of allele_specific is replaced by a set of universal_primers the resulting half crossover assay allows the selective amplification of either haplotype targeted recombinant molecules are isolated by sequential aso hybridization to each snp within the hotspot interval using asos complementary to the haplotype not amplified under this protocol hybridization products may still be due to crossovers o however any stretch of the haplotype not amplified that is detected without the exchange of flanking markers must be the result of a non crossover event o snp annotation and the design of asps asos and universal_primers are typically done by hand which is slow and error_prone especially when screening many hotspot candidates we have written the software_package hotspot to assist with this
