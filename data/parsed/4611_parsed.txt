systems_biology the majority of endogenous microrna targets within alu_elements avoid the microrna machinery repetitive_elements are very widely spread in primate genomes most prominent is the case of the short interspersed elements and in particular the alu_elements which are present in more than a million copies in the human_genome such massive presence of foreign genomic_elements which are perceived as predominantly selfish dna may represent a substantial potential informational load on the genome accordingly the retrotransposition of alus may contribute to human disease including a diversity of cancers at the same time the spread of genetic_material may also represent an opportunity to introduce evolutionary novelty into the genome indeed alu_elements may become exons and may harbour functional transcription_factor and micrornas mirna_binding in particular smalheiser and torvik identified many mrnas that contain alus in their untranslated_regions utrs within which there are targets for dozens of mirnas along with these negative and positive potential_contributions to cellular and organismal fitness it is conceivable that the spread of many of the retroelements was restricted evolutionarily so that most of the current elements are largely benign possibly the insertion of retroelements into mrnas was not random but was affected by features that minimize their impact on functional_elements in the genome focusing here on potential mirna_binding within alus in utrs we provide evidence that the majority of mirna_targets within alus are non functional and presumably ignored by the mirna machinery we propose three features that allowed the insertion of alu hosted mirna_targets into mrnas with minimal distortion of mirna regulation still a minority of the insertions appears not to possess any of these features and may thus represent cases in which alu insertions contributed novel functional mirna_targets to the primates lineage in the present study we demonstrate that potential mirna_targets within alus are largely non functional and are not bound by the mirna machinery we suggest that insertions of alus into mrnas were tolerated largely when mirna_targets within them were likely to be less functional despite the strong indications that alu contained putative mirna_target do not tend to affect_gene there are clearly cases where such targets within alus can be functional in particular smalheiser and torvik described many mrnas that contain alus in their utr within which there are target_sites for dozens of mirnas in their study most of the mirnas suggested to target alus were within the c mc cluster which is a primate specific cluster that contains many alu sequences that might have facilitated its expansion these mirnas might have evolved in coordination with the alu sequences to create an effective targeting reported that there are a few mirnas with predicted sites per megabase within alu sequences and proposed that such mirnas protect against alu transposition we find that although the potential regulatory effect of alus is huge their actual contribution to regulation of gene_expression by the mirna machinery might be limited clearly this does not exclude other regulatory_roles of the mirna alu interplay such as a role of mirnas in maintaining genomic_stability by the repression of transposable_elements the three features that permit alu insertions into the utr of genes are inherently very different from one another mutually_exclusive territories imply an evolutionary_mechanism as it appears that alu insertions near utr ends were selected against one intriguing hypothesis is that alus inserted near the ends of utrs might have forced important mirna_targets to move towards the middle of the utr where they become less effective another scenario supported by our findings is that alus near the ends might have introduced new mirna_binding at locations where such targets are likely to be highly functional grossly disrupting the conserved regulation of the gene additionally it is conceivable that insertion of alus near the ends of utrs may be deleterious also for reasons that are unrelated to mirna function the tight secondary_structure presents an inherent feature of the alu itselfalus have high rna_secondary content a property that might have allowed insertion without a major effect on gene_regulation as mirna_targets are less functional within tight secondary_structure the editing mechanism presents another layer which has the potential to be regulated at a cellular_level as its impact might vary_greatly among different cell_types as a function of their editing capacity this could potentially contribute to changes in the transcriptome during developmental_processes as well as in response to any internal or external signal that affects editing efficiency importantly levels of adar enzymes which perform the a to i editing are altered in cancer it is thus tempting to speculate that mirna_targets within alus escape editing in cancer_cells leading to an elevation in their functionality such mechanism might contribute in interesting ways to post_transcriptional deregulation of gene_expression in cancer in addition rna_editing has the potential to create new potential mirna_targets as previously_suggested by liang and landweber rna_binding rbps can also affect the potential of the mirna machinery to bind and act on the mrna showed that the presence of binding_motifs for specific rbps within mrnas can affect the way in which these mrnas are regulated by mirnas for which they contain targets specifically mrnas that were downregulated on mirna overexpression were found to be enriched for two u rich motifs that bind the protein elavl whereas mrnas upregulated in response to mirna overexpression were enriched for an au_rich we therefore tested whether such rbp binding_elements may account for the reduced efficacy of alu contained mirna_targets however we could not find evidence for a selective contribution of the three rna binding_motifs described in jacobsen et_al to the differential efficacy of targets inside versus outside alus rather we found that these motifs are evenly_distributed in mrnas with the target inside or outside of alus and thus their existence or depletion cannot explain the lack of functionality of mirna_targets within alus yet the existence of other rbp binding_motifs that are unequally present in these two types of target_mrnas cannot be ruled_out and should be the subject of future analyses we also examined the potential for combined effects of the various features on alu contained mirna_targets supplementarypresents a venn_diagram addressing the characteristics applicable to each mirna_target inside alu for all conserved mammalian mirnas most of the targets appear to use more than one feature supporting the conjecture that an interaction between two or more features is needed to reduce dramatically the targets functionality importantly consistent with the earlier suggestion of smalheiser and torvik there are mirna_targets that might be functional as they are located in the ends of the utr have a loose secondary_structure and cannot be edited when looking at all targets within alus which could potentially escape the location and structure criteria we find targets among the top targets are two with the gcacuu site which appear in many alus and comprises the target of numerous mirnas as discussed by smalheiser and torvik however in a randomized simulation its appearances in the escaping targets were not found statistically_significant our ability to identify at least some of these characteristics enables to single out the more relevant mirna_targets and subject them to future_functional
