factor graph analysis of live_cell data reveals mechanisms of cell_fate motivation cell_fate have a strong stochastic component the identification of the underlying_mechanisms therefore requires a rigorous statistical_analysis of large ensembles of single cells that were tracked and phenotyped over time results we introduce a probabilistic_framework for testing elementary hypotheses on dynamic cell_behavior using time lapse cell imaging data factor graphs probabilistic_graphical are used to properly account for cell_lineage and cell phenotype information our model is applied to time lapse movies of murine granulocyte macrophage progenitor gmp cells it decides between competing_hypotheses on the mechanisms of their differentiation our results theoretically substantiate previous experimental_observations that lineage instruction not selection is the cause for the differentiation of gmp cells into mature monocytes or neutrophil_granulocytes availability_and the matlab_source is available atcell fate decisions appear as robust phenomena on the tissue level however the underlying_mechanisms are hidden behind a large_variability on the level of individual cells the deterministic and the stochastic components of these decision_processes can only be identified through the statistical_analysis of a large number of cells high content live_cell time lapse imaging has become a major technique for the investigation of cell_behavior the amount of data produced by this method requires automation at all stages starting from cell identification and tracking of cells the extraction of relevant morphological_features from single_cell images up to the biological_interpretation of the results excellent bioinformatics_tools have been developed for the purpose of cell identification cell_tracking and feature_extraction so_far biological analysis of time lapse movies focused on the detection of abnormal cell_phenotypes after introducing perturbations like rna_interference this led to the development of hidden_markov that either in a supervised or in an unsupervised fashion classify cells according to their morphology and their environmental_context in this work we develop a factor graph_model which provides a probabilistic_framework for testing the compatibility of biological_hypotheses with time lapse imaging data such data allow the tracking of individual cells comprising all of their progeny over extended time periods for each cell image features like morphology cell_cycle time or motility can be extracted all these different pieces of information on cellular development divisional history and differentiation can be summarized into a pedigree like structure termed cellular genealogy in which the founder cell represents the root and the progeny are arranged in the branches to our knowledge only two attempts have been made to analyze such tree structured data in a rigorous probabilistic way using genealogies as input_data we develop a factor graph_model which describes the genealogy by a random biological_process with meaningful and interpretable parameters factor graph models have been tremendously successful in coding theory because they give rise to highly_efficient algorithms for maximum_likelihood mle and the calculation of marginal probabilities the time complexity of these algorithms is linear in the number of nodes given that the number of neighbors of a node is bounded by three in our case this allows us to run a markov_chain mcmc_algorithm for parameter learning our factor graph_model for genealogies requires only seven parameters simulations show that these parameters can be identified accurately to further assess the robustness of our model we analyze genealogies generated by a mathematically different and considerably more complex model of stem_cell we are able to recover its relevant kinetic_characteristics in our application the factor graph_model decides between alternative_hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of hematopoietic progenitor_cell hpc differentiation it is under debate whether cytokines instruct the differentiation of progenitor_cells into specific_cell or whether they select lineage committed cells types by allowing their proliferation or survival looking merely at the relative cell abundances at the end of the differentiation process all scenarios lead toimage processing left cell entities are identified on a series of consecutive pictures of the same area on a cell_culture plate they are linked to their respective predecessor on the previous image right the topological information on cell_fates is represented as a genealogy a forest of rooted binary trees nodes represent cells at a certain time point and edges indicate the parent_offspring relation from top to bottom the vertex color informally indicates phenotypic_information assigned to each cell such as the presence_or of fluorescent cell_type markers b construction of the factor graph each node of the genealogy is represented by a hidden variable node empty circle and the probability of an event linking cells between consecutive time points is represented by a hidden factor node empty square the cell image data are represented by observable variable nodes shaded circles an observable factor node black square links each observable variable node to its corresponding hidden variable node and it encodes the probability of observing the image data given the hidden cell state the factor graph encodes the models likelihood_function the product of all factor nodes c specification of the local probability functions assigned to the factor nodes we assume that each cell can be in one of three states blue progenitor_cell state red green differentiated states left each edge in the graph represents one of four events that can occur persistence of the cell cell_division differentiation and apoptosis the edges are labeled with the unknown probabilities for the respective event which determine the probability functions of the hidden factor nodes right the functions related to the observable factor nodes are conditional probability_distributions of the single_cell image data given the cells state indistinguishable outcomes namely the dominance of one cell_type we construct a reversible jump mcmc_algorithm which is able to identify the most realistic scenario as well as the corresponding lineage_specific differentiation proliferation and cell death_rates our analysis of a hpc time lapse imaging experiment identifies unequal proliferation as the driving_force for the asymmetric differentiation of murine granulocyte macrophage progenitors gmps cells into either mature monocytes or neutrophil_granulocytes high_throughput time lapse imaging poses new challenges to computational_biology the analysis of cellular genealogies requires the development of statistical_methods that are able to test_hypotheses on data with a branched dependency_structure the most advanced method so_far that deal with this kind of data is markov tree_models they can be cast as factor graph models in which the fate of the children is assumed independent of each other given the state of the parent cell this assumption has the advantage that markov trees allow the straightforward generalization of the baum welch algorithm for parameter learning however in cases when diverging daughter cell_fates are coupled this model is not appropriate we have developed a simplistic but efficient factor graph_model which can test the compatibility of basic biological_hypotheses with this kind of data the factor graph_model has an intuitive parametrization of its factor nodes which reflects key_properties of the cellular system differentiation proliferation apoptosis biological_hypotheses can be formulated in terms of parameter restrictions the local factor nodes and their parametrization can be exchanged very easily in this framework thus our model can be easily adapted to model high_dimensional readouts from each cell image or to model other cell states aneuploidy cancerosity quiescence we perform hypothesis discrimination and parameter_estimation using a reversible jump mcmc_algorithm more efficient algorithms for parameter_estimation such as an em_algorithm would be convenient they are currently under development due to its flexibility we expect the factor graph framework to have a wide_range in particular because advances in microscopy allow the investigation of cell to cell state variability at the subcellular_level the factor graph_model can be extended to account for the micro environment of a cell given by cell contacts cell_wall turgor local concentration of signaling_molecules or concentration_gradients such variables might be included into the observations vector o v for each cell image v a promising application will be the modeling of multicellular_organism development for example plant embryos can be tracked and at the same time chemo physical_properties of each cell can be measured which can reveal to which extent lineage mechanical_forces or location within a tissue determine cell_fate
