genome_wide detection of intervals of genetic_heterogeneity associated with complex_traits motivation genetic_heterogeneity the fact that several sequence_variants give rise to the same phenotype is a phenomenon that is of the utmost interest in the analysis of complex phenotypes current approaches for finding regions in the genome that exhibit genetic_heterogeneity suffer from at least one of two shortcomings i they require the definition of an exact interval in the gen ome that is to be tested for genetic_heterogeneity potentially missing intervals of high relevance or ii they suffer from an enormous multiple_hypothesis problem due to the large number of potential candidate intervals being tested which results in either many false_positives or a lack of power to detect true intervals results here we present an approach that overcomes both problems it allows one to automatically find all contiguous sequences of single_nucleotide in the genome that are jointly associated with the phenotype it also solves both the inherent computational_efficiency problem and the statistical problem of multiple_hypothesis which are both caused by the huge number of candidate intervals we demonstrate on arabidopsis_thaliana genome_wide data that our approach can discover regions that exhibit genetic_heterogeneity and would be missed by single locus mapping conclusions our novel approach can contribute to the genome_wide discovery of intervals that are involved in the genetic_heterogeneity underlying complex phenotypes availability_and the code can be obtained at http www bsse ethz ch mlcb research bioinformatics and computational_biology sis html genetic_heterogeneity is the phenomenon that several distinct sequence_variants may give rise to the same phenotype one refers to allelic_heterogeneity if these variants are located in the same gene and to locus heterogeneity if they occur in several distinct genes this phenomenon is of the utmost_importance to the exploration of the genetic_basis of complex phenotypes as most complex phenotypes have been found to be affected by numerous loci rather than a single locus the common ways of computing associations between genotype and phenotype are rather limited in their ability to detect genetic_heterogeneity standard genome_wide gwas compute correlations between single_genome positions primarily single_nucleotide snps and the phenotype of interest wellcome_trust the smaller the sample_size and the more snps that are involved in a phenotype the less likely it is that genetic_heterogeneity can be detected by this type of single locus mapping gene based tests quantify whether or not the number of sequence_variants in one gene is enriched in cases versus controls although this approach does consider the combined effect of several snps it is also restrictive in the sense that it only checks entire genes for association it will
