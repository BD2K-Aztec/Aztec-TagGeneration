systems_biology phylopro a web_based for the generation and visualization of phylogenetic profiles across eukarya with increasing numbers of eukaryotic genome_sequences phylogenetic profiles of eukaryotic_genes are becoming increasingly informative here we introduce a new web_tool phylopro http compsysbio org phylopro which uses the available eukaryotic genome_sequences to visualize the evolutionary_trajectories of user_defined subsets of model_organism genes applied to pathways or complexes phylopro allows the user to rapidly_identify core conserved elements of biological_processes together with those that may represent lineage_specific innovations phylopro thus provides a valuable resource for the evolutionary and comparative_studies of biological_systems
