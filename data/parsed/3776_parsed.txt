pseknc general a cross_platform package for generating various modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions the avalanche of genomic_sequences generated in the post genomic age requires efficient computational_methods for rapidly and accurately identifying biological_features from sequence_information towards this goal we developed a freely_available and open_source package called pseknc general the general form of pseudo k tuple nucleotide_composition that allows for fast and accurate computation of all the widely used nucleotide structural and physicochemical_properties of both dna and rna_sequences pseknc general can generate several modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions including conventional k tuple nucleotide compositions moreaubroto autocorrelation coefficient moran autocorrelation coefficient geary autocorrelation coefficient type i pseknc and type_ii pseknc in every mode physicochemical_properties are available for choosing moreover it is flexible enough to allow the users to calculate pseknc with user_defined properties the package can be run on linux mac and windows systems and also provides a graph ical user_interface availability_and the package is freely_available at http
