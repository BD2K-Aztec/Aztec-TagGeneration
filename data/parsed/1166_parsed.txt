sequence_analysis copred prediction of fold go molecular_function and functional_residues at the domain level only recently the first resources devoted to the functional_annotation of proteins at the domain level started to appear the next step is to develop specific methodologies for predicting function at the domain level based on these resources and to implement them in web_servers to be used by the community in this work we present copred a web_server for the concomitant prediction of fold molecular_function and functional sites at the domain level based on a methodology for domain molecular_function prediction and a resource of domain functional_annotations previously_developed and benchmarked availability_and copred can be freely accessed at http csbg cnb csic es copred the interface works in all standard web_browsers webgl natively supported by most browsers is required for the in line preview and manipulation of protein d structures the web_site includes a detailed help section and usage examples the computational_prediction of functional features for newly_sequenced proteins is an active field of research because of the pace at which these raw sequences are obtained and the difficulties associated with the experimental functional characterization the most widely used strategy for function prediction is to transfer to the query_sequence the functional features e g global function and functional_residues available for a homologous protein in a given database or annotation resource because of technical and historical reasons most of these resources associate functional descriptors to whole proteins instead of individual_domains nevertheless domains are the evolutionary structural and functional_units of proteins and at least in the case of molecular_functions these can be individually assigned to particular domains or groups of domains within protein_chains the functional_independence of protein_domains is exemplified by the fact that many domains found in multi_domain also exist in isolation as independent proteins in other organisms although associating molecular_functions to whole chains without distinguishing the particular domain s responsible for them is not an issue for many applications it can lead to problems in other cases as molecular_functions are generally associated with whole chains in the annotation resources function prediction_methods servers based on matching against these annotations predict molecular_function at the whole chain level only recently the first functional_annotations at the domain level started to appear highlighting the importance of associating molecular_functions to domains and the consequences of not doing so in particular cases accordingly prediction_methods adapted to these resources and intended for predicting functions at the domain level are required we have developed one of these methods and showed that its performance in assigning function is higher that a traditional sequence_based search the method is based on a resource of gene_ontology molecular function_annotations go mf at the structural_domain level in short profiles are built for the structural_domains sharing the same go mf term and the same fold so that they can be structurally aligned a significant match of a particular region of a query_sequence against one of these profiles can be interpreted as a concomitant prediction of fold and go mf function for the corresponding domain additionally the conserved positions in these profiles can be interpreted as functional sites and consequently transferred to the aligned positions of the query_sequence so as to obtain clues on possible functionally_important positions for full details on the methodology and its evaluation see lopez and pazos here we present copred a web_server that allows any user to access this method and generate predictions using in the simplest case only the query_sequence as input the predictions can be inspected in a graphical interactive interface and downloaded in a number of standard formats shows some representative screenshots of copreds web_interface on the input page the user can upload the amino_acid of the query_protein as only input although an advanced options button allows expanding the input form so as to modify some parameters of the method there is also a fill with example button to test the server right away with the example described in the help page after a successful run which normally takes s all the results can be accessed from a single page with different panels that can be expanded collapsed the first row represents the query_sequence itself blue in and expanding it allows to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com retrieving some data on the input including a job id that can be later used to recover the results of previous runs via the results option on the input page the results basically consist of a list of profiles matching different regions of the query_sequence including information on the fold and go mf term represented by each of them for each hit a graphical_representation of the region of the query_sequence matched against the profile is shown using a color scale from green to black to represent the hits significance e value consequently this unexpanded list of hits provides a first overview of the domain_composition of the query_sequence and the possible folds functions of its domains in the example shown in the results are clearly pointing to the presence of two domains an n_terminal one associated with the c scop fold p loop nucleotide phosphate hydrolases and gtp related go mf terms and the middle domain associated with the b fold reductase isomerase elongation_factor common domain and rna bindingrelated go mf terms these features are in agreement with the domain_composition structural folds and functions of this example query_protein elongation_factor additionally a set of red dots represent the predicted functional sites transferred from the conserved positions of the corresponding profile according to a conservation threshold controlled by the scroll bar at the top of the page expanding a given item of the hit list provides additional information on the corresponding profile match such as detailed information on the go mf term and scop fold with links to the corresponding databases the sequence of the query_protein is also shown highlighting the region domain matching that particular profile and the transferred functional_residues there is also an interactive representation of the d structure of a representative member of that profile this can be manipulated e g zoomed rotated and so forth in this d view the region aligned against the query and the conserved_residues are highlighted there is also a link for opening a jalview applet showing the multiple_sequence associated with the profile which also includes the query_sequence the implicit d model for that region domain of the query_protein is also shown in a jmol applet www jmol org conserved positions are highlighted in both representations this implicit d model which can be also downloaded as a standard pdb_file from another link contains the backbone atoms of a representative template from the profile with the residues
