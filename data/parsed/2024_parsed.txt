genome_analysis genome_wide dna sequence_polymorphisms facilitate nucleosome_positioning in yeast motivation the intrinsic dna_sequence is an important_determinant of nucleosome_positioning some dna sequence_patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation while others can inhibit nucleosome formation nucleosome_positioning influences the overall rate of sequence_evolution however its impacts on specific patterns of sequence_evolution are still poorly_understood results here we examined whether nucleosomal_dna and nucleosome depleted dna show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture on a genome_scale in yeast we found that sequence_polymorphisms in nucleosomal_dna tend to facilitate nucleosome formation whereas polymorphisms in nucleosome depleted dna tend to inhibit nucleosome formation which is especially evident at nucleosome disfavored sequences in nucleosome free regions at both ends of genes sequence_polymorphisms facilitating nucleosome_positioning correspond to stable nucleosome_positioning these results reveal that sequence_polymorphisms are under selective constraints to maintain nucleosome_positioning contact the nucleosome is the fundamental unit of eukaryotic chromatin which consists of a histone_octamer around which a stretch of bp dna is wrapped most of the dna is wrapped in nucleosomes with adjacent nucleosomes generally separated by bp of unwrapped linker dna the nucleosome limits the accessibility of nucleosomal_dna to regulatory dna_binding nucleosome_positioning thus plays_an in the regulation of diverse_cellular including dna_replication recombination repair transcription chromosome_segregation and cell_division nucleosome_positioning is determined by multiple factors including the intrinsic dna_sequence dna_methylation histone variants post_translational transcription_factors and chromatin remodelers sequence_evolution can be under selection to facilitate specific cellular_processes there is evidence for selection on synonymous codons required for accurate translation to whom correspondence should be addressed sequence_patterns in exons are also under selection to facilitate correct splicing genome_wide analysis on nucleosome_positioning in yeast has revealed that linker dna evolves more slowly than nucleosomal_dna a possible explanation is that nucleosomes occlude the dna from access to most dna_repair proteins resulting in low repair efficiency in nucleosomal_dna experimental_evidence indicates that dna_sequences differ greatly in their abilities to bend and twist consequently some dna sequence_patterns facilitate nucleosome formation whereas others distort nucleosome formation the intrinsic dna_sequence is one dominant_factor responsible for nucleosome_positioning linker dna based nucleosome depletion signals have been shown to be more critical for nucleosome_positioning than nucleosome formation signals an alternative explanation for the slower sequence_evolution rates of linker dna is that the extent of sequence_evolution in linker dna is under selection to maintain the nucleosomal organization although the impact of nucleosome_positioning on the overall rate of sequence_evolution is clear its impacts on specific patterns of sequence_evolution remain to be elucidated in this study we investigated into the relationship between nucleosome_positioning and nucleotide polymorphism patterns within saccharomyces_cerevisiae populations we analyzed genomewide single_nucleotide snp data in s cerevisiae populations we found distinct polymorphism biases between nucleosomal_dna and nucleosome depleted dna polymorphism patterns that facilitate nucleosome formation are preferred in nucleosomal_dna while polymorphism patterns with nucleosomeexcluding properties are favored in nucleosome depleted dna we also found that nucleotide polymorphism patterns that facilitate nucleosome_positioning correspond to stable nucleosome_positioning page
