computational_identification of morfs in protein_sequences motivation intrinsically_disordered of proteins play_an in the regulation of various biological_processes key to their regulatory_function is the binding of molecular_recognition features morfs to globular protein_domains in a process known as a disorder to order transition predicting the location of morfs in protein_sequences with high_accuracy remains an important computational challenge method in this study we introduce morf_chibi a new computational_approach for fast and accurate prediction of morfs in protein_sequences morf_chibi combines the outcomes of two support_vector svm models that take advantage of two different kernels with high noise tolerance the first svm s is designed to extract maximal information from the general contrast in amino_acid between morfs their surrounding regions flanks and the remainders of the sequences the second svm t is used to identify similarities between regions in a query_sequence and morfs of the training_set results we evaluated the performance of our predictor by comparing its results with those of two currently available morf predictors morfpred and anchor using three test_sets that have previously been collected and used to evaluate morfpred and anchor we demonstrate that morf_chibi outperforms the other predictors with respect to different evaluation metrics in addition morf_chibi is downloadable and fast which makes it useful as a component in other computational prediction_tools availability_and intrinsically_disordered protein regions idrs are amino_acid that lack a unique d structure in solution proteins that are dominated by idrs are called intrinsically_disordered idrs are enriched in binding_sites that play significant roles in signaling and regulatory_functions through binding to other proteins because of this functionality their interactions need to be both specific and reversible the computational_identification of candidate binding locations in idrs is an important task in bioinformatics and an area of growing interest currently there are two main approaches to this problem being developed the first is based on the analyses of short_linear sequence_motifs slims slims are defined as conserved_sequence stretches of amino_acids that are enriched in idrs and promote interactions with specific domains the second line of research is based on the theory that long interaction prone segments in idrs called molecular_recognition features or morfs fold upon interacting with partners these morfs vary in size and can be up to residues long various computational_methods have been developed to identify slims and morfs in protein_sequences including morfpred mfspssmpred pepbindpred anchor slimpred slimdisc slimfinder and retro morfs despite the fact that both morfs and slims are interaction prone elements in idrs the methods used to identify them have been very different because of their short_length the identification of slims is very challenging and associated with the risk of high_false fprs therefore reliable identification of novel instances of known slims or the de_novo identification of slims often relies on evolutionary_information or the use of nonsequence information such as protein interaction data predictors of morfs take advantage of the fact that they are on average longer than slims which increases the signal to noise_level for sequence_features that distinguish morfs in idrs from their surroundings it is clear that there are overlaps between what can be defined as slim or morf however in this study we focus only on computationally identifying morfs as defined initially by all currently available morf prediction_tools have been benchmarked by comparing their performances to those of two state_ofthe predictors that use very different approaches anchor and morfpred anchor is a downloadable predictor that is based on three properties of the residues in a polypeptide_chain binding residues must be in a long disordered region residues are not able to fold with their neighbors and residues are able to interact with globular_domains a propensity value is generated by computationally predicting each of these three properties using the energy estimation_approach of iupred and finally a weighted_sum is used to join these three propensities into a single score the weights of each of these three components and the neighborhood sizes of the first two five values in total are learned from a small training_set unlike predictors that rely on traditional machine_learning tools such as svms and neural_networks the chance of this training_process to over fit the training data is minimal morfpred is a web_based three step predictor first an svm with a linear kernel determines a morf propensity_score based on nine sets of features physiochemical_properties of amino_acids from the amino_acid index conservation information in the form of position_specific pssm generated with psi_blast relative_solvent estimated by the real spine predictor flexibility b factor predicted by profbval and the results of five different intrinsic_disorder predictors then an alignment e value is computed by aligning the input_sequence to the training sequences using psi_blast finally the morf propensities of input_sequence residues are adjusted by taking the alignment e values into account performance evaluation using three different datasets provided area under the receiver_operator roc_curve of for morfpred and for anchor to the best of our knowledge there is no predictor that has shown a significantly better performance than morfpred in a direct comparison however its software is not down loadable and therefore its use is limited to online submissions it is significantly_slower than anchor it can only process a maximum of five protein_sequences at a time and it is limited to sequences with up to amino_acids here we introduce a new approach for predicting morfs in protein_sequences that we call morf_chibi we developed morf_chibi by taking_into several properties of morfs that have been identified in previous_studies the amino_acid of morfs is different from that of the general protein population and contrasts most with the sequences flanking them flanks in addition there are sequence_similarities between morfs that can be exploited to improve morf predictions finally there is a very high_level of noise in the data the values of the top features used byto identify morfs show a very high variance in order to integrate this knowledge we use a three step approach in which we generate sets of features from the physicochemical_properties of the amino_acids that represent different regions of proteins train two svm models one to target direct similarities between morf sequences and the other to focus on the general contrast of the amino_acid of morfs flanks and the general protein population and finally compute a propensity for each residue to be a morf residue by joining the propensities as probabilities generated by the two svm models using bayes rule the final predictor morf_chibi is down loadable fast and has no upper_limit on the size of protein_sequences even though it is only uses the amino_acid index morf_chibi is more accurate than anchor and morfpred first we identified an appropriate set of features for each of the two morf_chibi models then morf_chibi was evaluated on test new and exp and its results compared with morfpred and anchor we present a new approach morf_chibi for predicting morfs within protein_sequences we compared its performance to that of anchor and morfpred using three different test_sets that have previously been assembled by the results demonstrate that morf_chibi outperforms both predictors in auc accuracy and success_rate with high_efficiency summarizesnote auc and success_rate values of the three morf predictors using the three datasets test new and exp and compares the properties and the performances of the three predictors using the test_dataset the increased performance of morf_chibi is related to several points first two different types of information are targeted by morf_chibi sequence_similarity information and composition contrast information the search for the former is justified by the fact that there exist sequence_similarities between morfs indeed morfs from different proteins that bind the same target can have a significant level of sequence_identity hence one can see svm t as the part of morf_chibi that targets new instances of known morfs targeting purely composition contrast information with svm s can in contrast be seen as a de_novo search for morfs this objective was achieved by using a synthetic dataset with only composition contrast information for the training of svm s training on synthetic sequences may appear problematic however it is justified based on the premise that new morfs can be identified due to an inherent difference in amino_acid between them and their surroundings a second advantage of our approach is the use of a novel two step feature_selection in the first step each svm parameter is selected to best fit its target information whereas in the second a set of complementary features is selected to maximize the svm performance finally technical subtleties also contributed to the high performance of morf_chibi a weighted auc as an objective_function in feature_selection to improve tpr at low fpr and svm models with noise tolerance kernels to overcome the high_level of noise in the data while the outputs of both morf pred and anchor include a numeric propensity value as well as a binary categorical prediction for each residue of being part of a morf the morf_chibi output is limited to the numerical propensity values we did not include a categorical prediction because different proteins are likely to have different levels of propensity_scores and researchers are likely to require different cutoff_values based on different applications we believe that although convenient providing categorical predictions by assigning a static cutoff value can be a misleading oversimplification however if one needs such a cutoff we suggest a value around at this cutoff morf_chibi has a tpr fpr of and on test and new respectively overall morf_chibi is light fast and the most accurate morf predictor available today which makes it useful in the analysis of small and large_datasets as it is down loadable morf_chibi can be used as an input component for other programs we would like to stress again that there exist overlaps in the definition of morfs and slims but that morf_chibi just like morfpred has been trained to predict morfs only other predictors are better suited to identify slims in idrs and structured domains
