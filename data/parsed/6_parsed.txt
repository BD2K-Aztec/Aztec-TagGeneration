structural_bioinformatics drobot automated generation of diverse and well packed protein_structure decoys motivation computationally generated non native protein_structure conformations or decoys are often used for designing protein_folding simulation_methods and force_fields however almost all the decoy_sets currently used in literature suffer from uneven root_mean rmsd distribution with bias to non protein like hydrogen_bonding and compactness patterns meanwhile most protein decoy_sets are pre_calculated and there is a lack of methods for automated generation of high_quality decoys for any target_proteins results we developed a new algorithm drobot to create protein_structure decoys by free fragment assembly with enhanced hydrogen_bonding and compactness interactions the method was benchmarked with three widely used decoy_sets from ab_initio and comparative modeling simulations the decoys generated by drobot are shown to have significantly_enhanced diversity and evenness with a continuous distribution in the rmsd space the new energy_terms introduced in drobot improve the hydrogen_bonding network and compactness of decoys which eliminates the possibility of native_structure recognition by trivial potentials algorithms that can automatically create such diverse and well packed non native conformations from any protein_structure should have a broad impact on the development of advanced protein force_field and folding simulation_methods availiablity and implementation it has been more than years since anfinsen first showed that the native_structure of protein molecules corresponds to the state with the lowest free_energy however ab_initio of proteins from the first principle remains a significant unsolved_problem in biophysics and computational_biology one of the major_barriers is the difficulty in designing accurate force_fields that can recognize the native_state as the lowest energy and meanwhile possess an energy funnel with a medium range energy rmsd correlation that can guide the folding simulation towards the native_state a critical step to protein_folding force_field development is the preparation of a set of non native protein_structures usually generated by computer called structure decoys which can be used to guide the design train and benchmark of the energy_terms however creating appropriate structure decoys is highly non trivial and many efforts have been made to address the problem for example proposed to construct structure decoys by randomly rotating structural segments of known native structures around a set of selected flexible hinges since native_structure features such as hydrophobic v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com core and contact specificities of amino_acids can be destroyed in the segment permutations the native_structure can be quite easily recognized by knowledge_based that were extracted from the statistics of experimental_structures to partly amend this issue and xu and zhang generated structure decoys by ab_initio simulations through rosetta and quark programs respectively because extensive energy optimizations are conducted in the folding simulations one advantage of the folding based decoy set is that the native states cannot be easily recognized from the decoys by simple knowledge_based however one issue of such decoy_sets is that ab_initio simulations cannot generate near native_structure conformations say a due to the inherent difficulties in ab_initio in particular for the medium to large size proteins with complicated topology this renders the decoys useless for the potential development that aims to recognize near native structures e g for high_resolution refinement to enrich near native decoy generation john andproposed to generate decoys by mutations of threading alignments followed by comparative modeling using modeller similarly constructed structure decoys by iterative threading assembly simulations based on i tasser because these decoys are built on specific homologous templates the conformations are often aggregated into a few clusters around the template structures which make it difficult to examine the continuous energy funnel and the energy rmsd correlation of the force fieldsuch energy funnel and correlation are critical in guiding successful protein_folding simulations even though many decoy_sets used in literature were generated by extensive folding simulations somewhat surprisingly almost all the currently existing decoy_sets have some level of correlations between the rmsd to the native and the radius_of or secondary_structure distribution see supplementary this means that the structure deviations have been created by sacrificing the hydrogen_bonding networks and or the compactness of the native structures in the decoy construction simulation processes therefore the native_structure can be easily discriminated from the decoys by simply counting their secondary_structure density or the compactness score energy training based on such decoys may introduce extra bias to the secondary_structure and compactness weights that are not reflected in the native structures to improve the quality of the decoy structures proposed a strategy to refine existing decoy_sets by extra energy_minimization simulations meanwhile additional decoy structures were added from the native_structure perturbation and random dihedral_angle sampling to increase the difficulty of decoy recognition by various scoring_functions finally it is important to note that many protein_folding and structure_prediction studies need structure decoys for specific protein targets that the authors are interested in however most decoy_sets in literature have been pre generated which further limits their use for more general studies in this work we aim to develop a new algorithm drobot dedicated for high_quality protein decoy generation by the extension of i tasser based fragment structure assembly simulations to increase structure diversity multiple continuously distributed structure scaffolds will be collected from the pdb library with new energy_terms introduced to enhance the hydrogen_bonding and residue packing interactions the on line server and the executable program are freely_available zhanglab ccmb med umich edu drobot which allow users to generate high_quality structure decoys from any given target structures
