systems_biology drug_target interaction prediction through domain tuned network_based motivation the identification of drugtarget_interaction dti represents a costly_and step in drug_discovery and design computational_methods capable of predicting reliable dti play_an in the field recently recommendation methods relying on network_based nbi have been proposed however such approaches implement naive topology based_inference and do not take into account important features within the drugtarget domain results in this article we present a new nbi method called domain tuned hybrid dt hybrid which extends a well established recommendation technique by domain based knowledge including drug and target similarity dt hybrid has been extensively tested using the last version of an experimentally_validated dti database obtained from drugbank comparison with other recently_proposed nbi methods clearly shows that dt hybrid is capable of predicting more reliable dtis availability dt hybrid has been developed in r and it is available along with all the results on the predictions through an r package at the followingdetecting and verifying new connections among drugs and targets is a costly process from a historical point_of the pharmaceutical chemists approach has been commonly focused on the development of compounds acting against particular families of druggable proteins drugs_act by binding to specific proteins hence changing their biochemical and or biophysical activities with many consequences on various functions furthermore because proteins operate as part of highly interconnected cellular_networks i e the interactome networks the one gene one drug one disease paradigm has been challenged in many cases for this reason the concept of polypharmacology has been raised for those drugs acting on multiple_targets rather than a single one these polypharmacological features of drugs bring a wealth of knowledge and enable us to understand drug side_effects or find their new uses namely drug_repositioning nevertheless many interactions are still unknown and given the significant amount of resources needed for in situ experimentation it is necessary to develop algorithmic methodologies allowing the prediction of new and significant relationships among elements interacting at the process level in the literature several computational_tools have been proposed to afford the problem of dti prediction and drug_repositioning traditional_methods rely either on ligand based or receptorbased approaches among ligand based_methods we can cite quantitative_structure and a similarity_search based_approach on the other hand receptor based_methods such as reverse docking have also been applied in drugtarget dt binding_affinity prediction dti prediction and drug_repositioning however the latter have the shortcoming that cannot be used for targets whose d structures are unknown recently much attention has been devoted to network based and phenotype based_approaches most of these methods rely on the successful idea of using bipartite graphs in a bipartite_graph linking us food_and drugs to proteins by dt binary associations is exploited identified new dtis using side effect similarity make use of transcriptional_responses predicted and validated new drug modes of action and drug_repositioning recently have presented drug_repositioning methods exploiting public gene_expression data furthermore developed a bipartite_graph learning method to predict dti by integrating chemical and genomic_data present a technique based on network_based nbi implementing a naive version of the algorithm proposed by all these results clearly show the good performance of this approach on the other hand knowledge about drug and protein domain is not properly exploited vanuse a machine_learning starting from a dti network to predict new ones with high_accuracy the calculation of the new interactions is done through the regularized least_squares algorithm the regularized least_squares algorithm is trained using a kernel gipgaussian interaction profile that summarizes the information in the network the authors

and genomic_information this improved the accuracy in particular for small_datasets introduced their network based random_walk with restart on the heterogeneous network nrwrh algorithm predicting new interactions between drugs and targets by means of a model based on a random_walk with a restart in a heterogeneous network the model is constructed by extending the network of dti interactions with drugdrug and proteinprotein similarity networks this methodology shows excellent_performance in predicting new interactions however its disadvantage is due to its random nature mainly caused by the initial probabilities selection proposed the bipartite local modelinteraction profile inferring blm nii algorithm interactions between drugs and targets are deduced by training a classifier i e support_vector or regularized least square this is achieved by exploiting interaction information drug and target similarities this classifier is appropriately extended to include knowledge on new drug_target candidates this is used to predict the new target probability of a specific drug the algorithm is highly_reliable in predicting interactions between new drug_target candidates on the other hand its capability of training several distinct classifiers to obtain the final model is not strong enough in this present article we propose a novel method called domain tuned hybrid dt hybrid it extends the nbi algorithm proposed inand applied in cheng et_al by adding application domain_knowledge similarity among drugs and targets is plugged into the model despite its simplicity the technique provides a complete and functional framework for in silico prediction of drug and target relationships to demonstrate the reliability of the method we conducted a wide experimental analysis using four benchmark_datasets drawn from drugbank we compared our method with the one proposed by the experiments clearly show that dt hybrid overcomes the problems shown by the naive nbi algorithm and it is capable of producing higher quality predictions in this article we propose a method called dt hybrid which extends nbi and the hybrid algorithms by integrating previous domain dependent knowledge experiments show that this extension improves both algorithms in terms of prediction of new biologically_significant interactions in the supporting materials we report a comprehensive analysis of dt hybrid and hybrid together with their behavior varying the only for dt hybrid and parameters illustrates the result of comparing nbi hybrid and dt hybrid in terms of precision and recall enhancement dt hybrid clearly outperforms both nbi and hybrid in recovering deleted links it is important to point out that hybrid algorithms are able to significantly improve recall e r measuring the prediction ability of recovering existing interactions in a complex network illustrates the receiver_operating roc_curves calculated over the complete drugbank dataset simulations were executed times and the results were averaged to obtain a performance evaluation experiments show that all three techniques have a high truepositive rate against a low false_positive however hybrid algorithms provided better performance than nbi in particular clearly shows an increase of the average areas under the roc_curves auc in the complete dataset a detailed analysis can be found in the supporting materials section this indicates that hybrid algorithms improve the ability of discriminatingnote the sparsity is obtained as the ratio between the number of known interactions and the number of all possible interactions note for each algorithm the complete drugbank dataset was used to compute the precision and recall metrics and the average area_under auc the parameters used to obtain the following results are and values are obtained using the top predictions bold values represents best results known links from predicted ones the increase of the auc values for the dt hybrid algorithm demonstrates that adding biological_information to prediction is a key choice to achieve significant results demonstrates that exploiting biological_information leads in most cases to a significant increase of the adjusted precision and recall illustrates the roc_curves calculated on the enzymes ion_channels gpcrs and nuclear_receptor datasets using the top predictions finally it can be asserted that adding similarity makes prediction more reliable than an algorithm such as nbi which applies only network_topology to score computation indeed using only known interactions of a new structure without any target information makes it impossible to predict new targets for this drug this weakness is a problem for all methods based on recommendation techniques the introduction of new biological structures is equivalent to the addition of isolated nodes in the network whose weight based on the equation is always zero such a weight ultimately leads to the impossibility of obtaining a prediction for this new molecule another important feature of the dt hybrid algorithm that we would like to highlight is its ability of increasing performance by keeping computational_complexity acceptable the asymptotic complexity of the nbi algorithm is o n m whereas that of dt hybrid is o n m m however parallelization and optimization techniques can be easily applied to speed computation we investigated the dependence of dt hybrid prediction quality with respect to the and parameters see the supporting materials for the details results show that we cannot discern a law that regulates the behavior of the metrics based on the values of these parameters they depend heavily on the specific characteristics of each dataset and therefore require a priori analysis to select the best ones in the reported results we made such analysis before to run our experiments to establish the parameters yielding the best results in terms of precision and recall enhancement finally notice that our analysis has shown an increase in the precision recall and auc neglecting other metrics such as recovery personalization and surprisal this was done because the latter measure only the capability of analyzing the structure of an interaction_network without evaluating the biological_significance of predictions dt hybrid is a technique proposed for the prediction of new interactions between small_molecules thanks to the domain dependent additional knowledge it clearly outperforms the nbi algorithm for dti prediction dt hybrid integrates biological_knowledge and the bipartite interaction_network into a unified_framework this yields high_quality and consistent interaction prediction allowing a speedup of the experimental comparison of dt hybrid hybrid and nbi through the precision and recall enhancement metric and the average area_under auc calculated for each of the four datasets listed inprecision enhancementnote the results were obtained using the optimal values for and parameters as shown in the supporting materials we set for both hybrid and dt hybrid concerning the parameter we have the following setting enzymes ion_channels gpcrs nuclear_receptors bold values represents best results
