computational framework for next_generation of heterogeneous viral_populations using combinatorial pooling motivation next_generation ngs allows for analyzing a large number of viral_sequences from infected patients providing an opportunity to implement large_scale molecular surveillance of viral_diseases however despite improvements in technology traditional protocols for ngs of large_numbers of samples are still highly cost and labor_intensive one of the possible cost effective_alternatives is combinatorial pooling although a number of pooling strategies for consensus sequencing of dna samples and detection of snps have been proposed these strategies cannot be applied to sequencing of highly_heterogeneous viral_populations results we developed a cost_effective and reliable protocol for sequencing of viral samples that combines ngs using barcoding and combinatorial pooling and a computational framework including algorithms for optimal virus specific pools design and deconvolution of individual samples from sequenced pools evaluation of the framework on experimental and simulated_data for hepatitis_c showed that it substantially reduces the sequencing_costs and allows deconvolution of viral_populations with a high_accuracy availability_and the source_code and experimental data_sets are available atnext generation sequencing ngs generates a large number of viral_sequences carried in samples of infected_individuals offering novel prospects for studying microbial_populations and understanding pathogen evolution and epidemiology ngs provides an opportunity to implement a large_scale molecular surveillance of infectious_diseases for monitoring of disease_dynamics and providing for informed guidance for planning public_health although ngs offers a significant increase in throughput sequencing of viral_populations from a large number of specimens is prohibitively expensive_and therefore development of a strategy for rapid and cost_effective massive viral sequencing is a key to effective molecular surveillance owing to a high mutation_rate rna_viruses exist in infected hosts as highly_heterogeneous populations of genetic_variants which are commonly referred to as quasispecies genetic viral_variants can be detected using highly_variable subgenomic regions that can be easily amplified and sequenced although genetic_information presented in short subgenomic regions does not allow for identification of all variants it is sufficient for transmission networks inference study of drug resistantce and intrahost viral evolution to reduce the cost of sequencing of multiple viral samples multiplexing through barcoding is usually used although this is a straightforward approach to a simultaneous sequencing of many viral_strains it requires individual handling of each sample starting from nucleic_acid to pcr and library_preparation which increases the costs of sequencing per specimen decoding of samples sequenced using large_libraries of barcodes may be highly affected by ngs errors additionally besides introduction of bias in amplification of different viral_variants using pcr_primers with different barcodes that may affect distribution of reads maintaining a large library of barcodes is daunting an alternative strategy is combinatorial pooling commonly it was used for tests producing binary results recently several pooling strategies were proposed for more complex assays based on dna_sequencing snp_calling and a rare alleles detection the pooling problem for viral quasipecies sequencing is fundamentally different from all existing pooling protocols previously_developed methods assume that a single consensus_sequence must be reconstructed for each sample in contrast for viral_quasispecies sequencing it is imperative to reconstruct the whole population_structure of each sample that includes multiple sequence_variants and their frequencies this problem formulation and the nature of heterogeneous viral_populations require a completely novel approach for pool design and deconvolution we propose a protocol for a cost_effective ngs of complex viral_populations which combines barcoding and pooling and includes the following steps i mixing samples in a specially_designed set of pools so that the identity of each sample is encoded in the composition of pools ii sequencing pools using barcoding iii pools deconvolution pd i e assignment of viral_variants from the pools to individual samples this approach significantly minimizes the number of pcr and ngs runs reducing the cost of testing and hands on time additionally pooling provides opportunity for pcr_amplification of viral_variants from each sample in different mixtures of samples generated in each pool thus introducing variation in amplification biases and contributing to sequencing of a more representative set of viral_variants from each sample pooling based sequencing of highly mutable viruses such as human_immunodeficiency and hepatitis_c hcv is particularly difficult because of the complexity of intrahost viral_populations the assessment of which can be distorted by pcr or sampling_biases it is essential to detect both major and minor viral subpopulations since the latter often have important clinical_implications mixing of a large number of specimens or specimens with significant differences in viral_titers may contribute to underrepresentation of viral_variants from some samples in pools suggesting that size and composition of pools should be carefully_designed stochastic sampling from genetically_diverse intra host viral_populations usually produces variability in compositions of sets of variants in different pools obtained from the same sample additionally mixing specimens may differentially bias pcr_amplification contributing to mismatching between viral_variants sampled from the same host in two pools with different specimen compositions thus straightforward approaches cannot be used for samples deconvolution indicating that a more complex approach based on clustering techniques is needed to increase the effectiveness of cluster based deconvolution and minimize possible clustering errors it is important to minimize mixing of genetically close samples as can be expected in epidemiologically related samples and samples collected from a small geographic_region in this article we present the first computational framework for combinatorial pool based sequencing of highly_heterogeneous viral samples the framework includes pools design and pd stages we formulate the pool design problem as an optimization_problem and propose a heuristic_algorithm to solve it we propose a method for inference of samples from sequenced pools based on a novel maximum_likelihood clustering_algorithm for heterogeneous viral samples we report the results of the framework evaluation using simulated and experimental hcv data
