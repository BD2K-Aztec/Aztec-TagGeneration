deciphering subcellular processes in live_imaging datasets via dynamic probabilistic networks motivation designing mathematical tools that can formally describe the dynamics of complex intracellular_processes remains a challenge live_cell reveals changes in the cellular_states but current simple approaches extract only minimal information of a static snapshot results we implemented a novel approach for analyzing organelle behavior in live_cell data based on hidden_markov hmms and showed that it can determine the number and evolution of distinct cellular_states involved in a biological_process we analyzed insulin mediated exocytosis of single glut vesicles a process critical for blood glucose_homeostasis and impaired in type_ii by using total_internal tirfm hmm analyses of movie sequences of living_cells reveal that insulin controls spatial and temporal_dynamics of exocytosis via the exocyst a putative tethering protein complex our studies have validated the proof_of of hmm for cellular_imaging and provided_direct for the existence of complex spatial temporal_regulation of exocytosis in non polarized cells we independently confirmed insulin_dependent spatial_regulation by using static spatial statistics methods conclusion we propose that hmm based_approach can be exploited in a wide avenue of cellular_processes especially those where the changes of cellular_states in space and time may be highly complex and non obvious such as in cell_polarization signaling and developmental_processes both fixed and live_cell imaging_studies often employ only visual_inspection or very limited statistical_analysis such as comparisons of means based on the expected effects of some treatment in static imaging a variable of interest is compared under different conditions at a single or few time points live fluorescence_microscopy has the potential to reveal dynamic changes in a given variable at multiple time points and under different treatments the resulting temporal_sequence of data_points extracted from a movie sequence is the starting_point for understanding the dynamics of a cellular_process with the advantages of lower background disturbance and higher temporal_resolution total_internal tirfm has been widely used for investigating the dynamics of membrane_trafficking events such as exocytosis of secretory_vesicles during exocytosis a vesicle generated inside a cell fuses with the plasma_membrane this process is essential for the delivery of membrane_receptors and secreted substances to the cell_surface and thus critical for normal cellular function in all eukaryotic_cells live_cell generates data sequences of such complexity that a precise and meaningful description of a biological_process necessitates a dynamic quantitative approach characterization of organelle behavior by visual_inspection is hampered by the lack of unique criteria for and thus user bias in defining putative_functional cellular_states and low sampling it is common to attempt to formulate these criteria based on measurements of a variable of interest to illustrate in live_cell one may wish to determine how direction and rate of displacement of an organelle changes over time a natural approach is to assume that some arbitrary observed rates or directionalities represent real cellular_states e g plusend motion of a vesicle along a microtubule corresponding to a kinesin_motor and minus end motion to a dynein due to an inherent variability in noisy biological_systems a manual assignment of two states will lack flexibility and precision and may fail to characterize unclear patterns e g if an organelle pauses due to competing motors applying subjective criteria may also result in overlooking important aspects of systems dynamics which are difficult to observe by naked_eye precluding complete characterization of the underlying_molecular robust_methods are needed that can deal with data uncertainty determine correctly the number of states and reveal the timing of state_transitions such methods have the potential to precisely describe spatial and temporal_dynamics of biological_processes in our previous work we focused on the spatial aspect of exocytosis by using end_point analysis we were able to obtain a static description of the distribution of exocytic events on the cell
