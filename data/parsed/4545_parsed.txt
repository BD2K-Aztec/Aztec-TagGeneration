telescoper de_novo of highly repetitive_regions motivation with advances in sequencing_technology it has become faster and cheaper to obtain short_read from which to assemble genomes although there has been considerable progress in the field of genome_assembly producing high_quality de_novo assemblies from short_reads remains_challenging primarily because of the complex repeat structures found in the genomes of most higher organisms the telomeric regions of many genomes are particularly difficult to assemble though much could be gained from the study of these regions as their evolution has not been fully characterized and they have been linked to aging results in this article we tackle the problem of assembling highly repetitive_regions by developing a novel algorithm that iteratively extends long paths through a series of read overlap graphs and evaluates them based on a statistical_framework our algorithm telescoper uses short and long insert libraries in an integrated way throughout the assembly process results on real and simulated_data demonstrate that our approach can effectively resolve much of the complex repeat structures found in the telomeres of yeast genomes especially when longer long insert libraries are used recent_advances in high_throughput hts technologies have dramatically_reduced the cost of producing reference_genomes for new species and characterizing whole_genome variations in multiple_individuals of a population however the assemblies produced by current_algorithms are often incomplete report that a de_novo shotgun assembly of the human_genome using short_reads is shorter than the reference assembled using more laborious means and that of segmental_duplications are represented indeed it is well recognized that there is room for better algorithmic use of the data especially for repetitive_regions which are one of the primary challenges in assembly telomeres are particularly complex and repetitive and thus very difficult to assemble correctly not only does each telomere contain repeats within itself but often telomeres on different chromosomes are very similar existing assembly algorithms thus frequently fail to assemble telomeric regions from short_read due to this lack of complete assembly telomere evolution has not been fully characterized though a great_deal is to be gained from it as telomeres have been linked to ageing high_quality to whom correspondence should be addressed telomere assemblies could help us learn more about the variation in telomeres within and between species in addition characterizing telomere gene_families and their regulation could help us clarify the function of telomeres and how they change as we age genome_assembly is the challenge of piecing together reads to reconstruct the original genome reads are obtained from various technologies with varying read_length error_rates and coverage sanger chemistry reads range in length from around to bases newer_technologies such as illumina complete genomics helicos life_sciences solid and ion_torrent provide reads at vastly lower_costs for greater throughput but at the expense of length initial improvements in assembly from short_read focused on how to process the sheer quantity of data and how to detect overlaps the de_bruijn proved a useful data_structure for this purpose and is used by pioneering short_read assemblers such as velvet and euler usr and subsequent assemblers including soapdenovo allpaths abyss and cortex many hts platforms produce paired_end or mate_pair reads which we collectively refer to as read_pairs the paired nature of these reads constitutes a powerful source of information significantly facilitating genome_assembly improved use of readpair information lies at the heart of recent works such as allpathslg the pe assembler and the paired de_bruijn innovations of which are primarily in earlier use of short insert read_pairs allpaths_lg requires reads of length around bases sequenced from short fragments of length_bp so that on average each read_pair overlaps by bases this means that in general each read_pair can be merged into a single longer read corresponding to the fragment a drawback of this approach is in the very specific type of data required which differs from the standard library_construction of fragments bp in size the pe assembler builds short stretches in non repetitive_regions first similar to unitigs see section for a definition in a de_bruijn and then extends these iteratively using reads with mates that map to the increasing already assembled portion a similar idea is also used infor resequencing with a reference where insertions are assembled as iterative extensions of existing sequences the paired de_bruijn method entails building a so_called a bruijn_graph in which vertices track pairs of reads instead of single reads with two vertices being merged only if the merging is consistent with the associated pairs of reads to our knowledge this method remains largely theoretical at this time and it has been tested only on simulated_data with perfect reads a theoretical observation fromis that longer long insert libraries can substantially_improve assembly we have introduced several new ideas for de_novo geared towards highly repetitive_regions our preliminary assembler telescoper proceeds by iteratively extending paths and selecting between them using the empirical distributions formed by both longinsert and short insert paired_end the utility of telescoper was validated in a study on both real and simulated_data from the kb telomeric regions of each chromosome of s cerevisiae for all three datasets tested telescoper produced more continuous assemblies than the other algorithms considered in our evaluations we tried to include the strongest and most popular algorithms with available implementation unfortunately allpaths_lg could not be included because of its small_fragment library requirement mentioned in section we considered several standard metrics for comparing assemblies but we note that the task of comparing genome_assemblies is a large one with several papers exclusively devoted to it other researchers are currently working on algorithms for identifying assembly errors using features derived from read_mapping rather than having this be a downstream process we believe that it would help to incorporate such features directly into an assembly algorithm here we make an effort in this direction by scoring assembly extensions according to read_mapping statistics although the scoring_scheme used in this article may not be optimal we have demonstrated that the idea of simultaneously pursuing multiple extensions and concurrently using multiple libraries to score and select among them is promising the current_implementation of telescoper can be used as a finishing algorithm to extend contigs into repetitive_regions and produce better assemblies for telomeres other applications include targeted de_novo of structural_variants and highly variant regions such as human_leukocyte future work will include extending the ideas presented here to whole genome_assembly improving error_correction producing more exhaustive listings of potential paths and more thorough evaluation of the alternate paths also additional validation metrics such as those explored bycan be incorporated as well we often see cases where if we took the union of all assemblies we could produce a much better final_product this suggests that assembly is not a solved problem and that the strengths of different algorithms can potentially be combined to produce better assemblies we believe the ideas behind telescoper have the potential to improve de_novo significantly and provide a comprehensive picture of previously unresolved repetitive_regions
