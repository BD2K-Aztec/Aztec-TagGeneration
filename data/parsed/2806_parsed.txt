data_and massifquant open_source kalman filter_based xc ms isotope trace feature_detection motivation isotope trace it detection is a fundamental step for liquid or gas_chromatography xc ms data analysis that faces a multitude of technical_challenges on complex samples the kalman_filter kf application to it detection addresses some of these challenges it discriminates closely eluting its in the m z dimension flexibly handles heteroscedastic m z variances and does not bin the m z axis yet the behavior of this kf application has not been fully characterized as no cost free open_source implementation exists and incomplete evaluation standards for it detection persist results massifquant is an open_source solution for kf it detection that has been subjected to novel and rigorous methods of performance evaluation the presented evaluation with accompanying annotations and optimization guide sets a new standard for comparative it detection compared with centwave matchedfilter and mzmine alternative it detection enginesmassifquant detected more true its in a real lc_ms complex sample especially low_intensity its it also offers competitive specificity and equally_effective quantitation accuracy availability_and massifquant is integrated into xcms with gpl license and hosted by bioconductor http bio conductor org annotation data are archived at http hdl lib byu edu parameter_optimization code and documentation is hosted at https the most important automated data analysis step in a typical quantitative omics xc ms analysis_pipeline is the isotope trace it detection in liquid or gas_chromatography lc_ms or gc_ms with either specified as xc ms analytes elute with chromatographic_separation and are subsequently measured by the mass_spectrometer it detection is the first and essential step in enumerating the signals of these analytes it detection is a trivial task when performed on data derived from simple mixtures but can be highly_challenging for complex_mixtures because there are i large_numbers of analytes that coelute many show interlocking or overlapping isotope envelopes ii an unknown number of analytes iii an abundance of its with low_signal iv significant intensity variation in the signal composing lower abundance its because of dynamic range limitations of the spectrometer and v heteroscedastic m z variance as a function of intensity for most mass_spectrometers unisotropic m z variance means that the data comprising the tails of an it have larger m z variance than the data around the mode and that low_abundance its have a larger m z variance than high_abundance its though difficult to achieve increasing the sensitivity and accuracy of it detection software influences the entire downstream analytical pipeline an example vast numbers of peptides go unidentified in proteomic analyses a more sensitive it detection would allow researchers to track and quantify these peptides leveraging identifications acquired in other samples it goes without saying that accurately determining it boundaries and distinguishing signal from noise improves quantitation results furthermore accuracy in it detection can also result in more accurate precursor mass estimates and therefore yield an increase in both the number and quality of peptide_identifications most it detection software such as matchedfilter rely on the creation of fixed width m z bins buckets to facilitate finding and quantifying eluting analytes though bucketing is computationally_efficient for complex datasets it is impossible to find a bin size and position that excludes closely co eluting its while also being broad enough to fully capture the it of interest to address this shortcoming developed a software_package centwave which uses a binless pre scan to first identify regions of interest composed of centroids a centroid is a m z intensity measurement pair at a given time scan of the chromatographic dimension once a region is specified the centroids are then collapsed into a one dimensional chromatogram and wavelet_based curve_fitting is performed to separate closely eluting its the approach is appealing because the to whom correspondence should be addressed initial algorithm identifies zones of interest in a binless way and because the algorithm used for detecting its using intensity fluctuation in the time domain is sophisticated however in this approach subtle shifts in m z value are ignored when data are combined into a one dimensional chromatogram its that are close in m z or with poor chromatographic profiles may not be properly resolved the same yeardeveloped tracmass which includes a binless it detection algorithm that fully uses m z information in distinguishing its tracmass uses a chromatographically traversing d kalman_filter model kf one dimension focused on m z values and the other on intensity valuesto determine which centroids belong with each extending it the decision to incorporate a centroid is made by carefully weighing all previous m z and intensity evidence of that it so mis incorporation of centroids is rare as the kfs incorporate more data furthermore the kf accounts for the heteroscedastic variance within the same it as intensity values change the kf approach can disentangle even the most closely eluting chromatographic its furthermore for the non expert user tracmass requires few user parameters for effective operation despite its apparent promise for it detection in complex samples no peer_reviewed publication had compared tracmass performance to leading options until just recently with tracmass this is not an isolated deficiencymost it detection_algorithms are not rigorously evaluated because of the difficulty of establishing ground_truth data especially for lower abundance its other compelling binless methods for quantitation may benefit from a similar evaluation as presented here here we make available an open_source implementation of the tracmass algorithm called massifquant and integrate it into the popular xcms software_suite like tracmass massifquant uses a d kf to quickly accurately and adaptively find its in highly complex samples without resorting to binning and its open license gpl enables further extension and inspection we indicate how the kf adapts to m z variance and describe two major modifications which mitigate known limitations of tracmass we detail novel metrics for evaluating xc ms it detection and use these metrics with manually_annotated data to perform a detailed_evaluation of massifquant centwave matchedfilter and mzmine performance on different lc_ms platforms
