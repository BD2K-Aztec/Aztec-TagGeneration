genome_analysis repitools an r package for the analysis of enrichment based epigenomic data epigenetics the study of heritable somatic phenotypic changes not related to dna_sequence has emerged as a critical component of the landscape of gene_regulation the epigenetic layers such as dna_methylation histone_modifications and nuclear architecture are now being extensively_studied in many cell_types and disease settings few software_tools exist to summarize and interpret these datasets we have created a toolbox of procedures to interrogate and visualize epigenomic data both array and sequencing based and make available a software_package for the cross_platform r language availability the package is freely_available under lgpl from the r forge web_site repitools r forge r project org contact epigenetics is the study of the phenotypic changes unrelated to dna_sequence epigenomics is the large_scale study of epigenetics with various genome_wide assays having been introduced in the past_few and with many epigenome mapping projects on the horizon dna_methylation is one of the best studied epigenetic_marks and can be assayed genomewide using restriction_enzyme bisulphite or enrichment based_approaches reviewed in another significant class of epigenetic_regulators is histone_modifications typically studied using chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip in combination with microarrays chip_chip or next_generation chip_seq there are limited general tools available for the exploratory_analysis and summarization of enrichment based epigenomics data seeof laird we present repitools a software_package for the r environment that is focused on the analysis of enrichment based epigenomic data examples are shown to illustrate the diversity of tools within the package many further examples can be found in the comprehensive users guide the routines have been tested on affymetrix and nimblegen tiling microarrays and illumina_genome sequencing_data generic data types are used so that other platforms can be easily supported to whom correspondence should be addressed there are relatively few tools currently available for the analysis of epigenomic data we have developed repitools a software_package for the r environment it contains many useful functions for quality_assessment visualization summarization and statistical_analysis of epigenomics experiments the package makes use of aroma affymetrix and several bioconductor_packages for various preprocessing_steps and may require an intermediate understanding of r for some features a comprehensive user_manual is available and examples can be run using supplied data the analysis of large affymetrix tiling_array datasets is facilitated through the memory_efficiency afforded by the aroma affymetrix package
