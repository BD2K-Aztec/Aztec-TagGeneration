msprogene integrative proteogenomics beyond six frames and single_nucleotide ongoing advances in high_throughput have facilitated accurate proteomic measurements and provide a wealth of information on genomic and transcript_level in proteoge nomics this multi omics_data is combined to analyze unannotated organisms and to allow more accurate sample specific predictions existing analysis methods still mainly depend on six frame translations or reference protein databases that are extended by transcriptomic information or known single_nucleotide snps however six frames introduce an artificial sixfold increase of the target_database and snp integration requires a suitable database summarizing results from previous_experiments we overcome_these by introducing msprogene a new method for integrative proteogenomic analysis based on customized rna_seq driven transcript databases msprogene is independent from existing reference_databases or annotated snps and avoids large six frame translated databases by constructing sample specific_transcripts in addition it creates a network combining rna_seq and peptide information that is optimized by a maximum flow algorithm it thereby also allows resolving the ambiguity of shared peptides for protein inference we applied msprogene on three datasets and show that it facilitates a database independent reliable yet accurate prediction on gene and protein level and additionally identifies novel genes availability_and msprogene is written in java and python it is open_source and available at http sourceforge net_projects msprogene high_throughput in both genomics and proteomics have driven the development of a variety of methods to analyze the large_amounts of data generated rna_seq techniques measure the transcriptome while mass_spectrometry allows identification and quantification of proteins that were expressed the field of proteogenomics combines this multi omics_data for more accurate and sample specific analyses in recent_years proteogenomic studies have become more and more popular focusing on deeper_understanding of model_organisms or exploring currently unannotated genomes despite this popularity methods that are jointly focusing on genomics transcriptomics and proteomics so_far mainly rely on sixframe translations or extensions of existing reference protein databases six frame translation has the advantage of being independent from any a priori annotation of the nucleotide_sequence however it introduces an artificial sixfold increase of the unknown target_database which can result in a bias in peptide_identification in contrast reference protein databases for instance extended by known single_nucleotide snps from databases such as dbsnp are not as prone to this bias as six frame translations but these approaches depend on existing annotations and thus cannot be applied to unannotated organisms without reference proteomes further they might not contain all information necessary to identify mutated or novel genes and even error tolerant search approaches may not be sufficient to recover these unannotated genes thus recent_studies also rely on transcriptome information to provide better suited databases
