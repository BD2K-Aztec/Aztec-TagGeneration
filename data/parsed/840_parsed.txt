caged opossum motif enrichment_analysis from cage derived tsss with the emergence of large_scale cap_analysis cage datasets from individual labs and the fantom consortium one can now analyze the cis regulatory_regions associated with gene_transcription at an unprecedented level of refinement by coupling transcription_factor tfbs enrichment_analysis with cage derived genomic_regions caged opossum can identify tfs that act as key_regulators of genes involved in specific mammalian_cell and tissue_types the webtool allows for the analysis of cage derived transcription_start tsss either provided by the user or selected from mammalian samples from the fantom project with pre_computed tfbs predicted with jaspar tf binding_profiles the tool helps power insights into the regulation of genes through the study of the specific usage of tsss within specific_cell and or under specific conditions availability_and the caged oposum web_tool is implemented in perl mysql and apache and is available atthe cap_analysis cage technology has revolutionized our capacity to analyze the promoter and enhancer regionsthe cis_regulatory regionsthat are active in cell_types and tissues at specific timepoints over human and mouse cage peaks were identified through the fantom project providing both the precise location of transcription_start tsss and a quantitative measure of transcriptional_activity in the studied samples it provides the scientific_community with an unprecedented opportunity to analyze the cis regulatory_regions acting upon the transcription of rnas from the identified tsss tfs acting upon them for instance gene promoter_regions specifically the tools look for the enrichment of motifs in a set of foreground sequences compared to a set of background ones by combining sample specific cage derived tsss with tf_binding profile enrichment_analysis it now becomes possible to predict the tfs that are likely involved in the regulation of active genes associated with tsss we hereby introduce the caged opossum tool to perform tf_binding profile enrichment_analysis from genomic_regions derived from cage data this work is part of the fantom project data downloads genomic_tools and co published manuscripts are summarized here http fantom gsc riken jp
