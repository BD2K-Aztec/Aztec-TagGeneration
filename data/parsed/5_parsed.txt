structural_bioinformatics dmol js molecular_visualization with webgl dmol js is a modern object oriented javascript_library that uses the latest web technologies to provide interactive hardware accelerated three_dimensional representations of molecular data without the need to install browser plugins or java dmol js provides a full featured api for developers as well as a straightforward declarative interface that lets users easily share and embed molecular data in websites availability_and dmol js is distributed under the permissive bsd open_source source_code can be found at http dmol csb molecular_visualization is an essential tool for computational chemists and biologists due to the demanding nature of three_dimensional d graphics most molecular viewers are desktop applications the need to install specialized applications and in some cases the restrictive nature of the software licenses introduces hurdles to the sharing of molecular data unlike a desktop_application a standards based client side web_application comes pre installed with every computer and mobile_device with a modern web_browser and can be seamlessly integrated into online environments for accessing and analyzing molecular data currently jmol http www jmol org is the most used web_based molecular viewer jmol is implemented as a java_applet and includes a custom rendering engine for efficiently rendering common molecular data representations such as spheres and sticks due to this custom rendering engine and javas optimizing just in time compiler the performance of jmol can approach that of native desktop applications however due to heavily publicized security failures the java install base is shrinking even when java is installed users are presented with multiple security prompts that must be correctly navigated before a java_applet such as jmol can run to address these concerns jsmol was developed jsmol is the product of applying a java to javascript translator to jmol however particularly for large and complex visualizations the performance of jsmol lags behind that of jmol an alternative to the software based rendering of jmol jsmol is to use hardware accelerated graphics as is done with desktop applications this is enabled by the recently adopted webgl standard which is now supported natively by all major desktop and mobile browsers pv http biasmv github io pv and glmol http webglmol sourceforge jp are two examples of webgl based molecular viewers glmol was the first webgl viewer and uses the three js http threejs org framework for interfacing with webgl however glmol lacks a full featured api and the use of the three js library results in performance inefficiencies we forked glmol and radically reworked its architecture to overcome these deficiencies and create dmol js pv like dmol js uses webgl directly but has a focus on displaying protein_structures and does not provide the same set of features as dmol js dmol js is an high performance interactive viewer for d molecular data that requires no plugins to work in modern desktop and mobile web_browsers dmol js provides a full featured api to javascript developers but can also be used by html authors and
