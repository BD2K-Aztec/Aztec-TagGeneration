loess correction for length_variation in gene_set based genomic sequence_analysis motivation sequence_analysis algorithms are often applied to sets of dna rna or protein_sequences to identify common or distinguishing_features controlling for sequence length_variation is critical to properly score sequence_features and identify true biological_signals rather than length_dependent artifacts results several cis_regulatory module discovery algorithms exhibit a substantial dependence between dna_sequence score and sequence_length our newly_developed loess method is flexible in capturing diverse score length relationships and is more effective in correcting dna_sequence scores for length_dependent artifacts compared with four other approaches application of this method to genes co expressed during drosophila_melanogaster embryonic mesoderm development or neural_development scored by the lever motif analysis algorithm resulted in successful recovery of their biologically validated cis_regulatory codes the loess length correction_method is broadly_applicable and may be useful not only for more accurate inference of cis_regulatory codes but also for detection of other types of patterns in biological_sequences availability source_code and compiled code are available froman important task in computational_biology is to score dna rna or protein_sequences for a variety of features these features may range from relatively basic sequence properties such as gc_content or evolutionary_conservation to more complex measures of putative biological_function such as the presence of transcription_factor tfbss or of tfbs clusters organized into cisregulatory modules crms e g transcriptional enhancers such general computational endeavors often face the central challenge of properly accounting for input_sequences of varying lengths to whom correspondence should be addressed accounting properly for dependence between a sequence score and its length is critical to identify a true_biological signal rather than a correlation artifact a greater sequence_length offers greater opportunities for finding good local matches by chance alone for instance artifacts associated with length dependence were noted in the early days of searching sequence_databases a nearly linear correlation was often observed between the best local similarity_score and the length of the sequence match in the queried database even when those sequences were unrelated more recently adjusting for sequence_length dependence was also found necessary in analysis of next_generation rna_seq since the number of reads_mapped to a gene depends on its transcript_abundance and length transcript length may confound gene_expression analysis with a bias for calling a higher proportion of long transcripts as expressed more highly in the drosophila_melanogaster genome for instance genes have varying non coding sequence_lengths ranging from to bp a prior study found that genes with more complex expression_patterns tend to have longer non coding_sequences in prior investigations of crms and cisregulatory codes it was observed that for various input tfbs motifs there was a notable correlation between a genes non coding sequence_length i e totalmelanogaster the length of a genes non coding_sequence varies across four orders_of from to bp for instance the c somatic mesoderm fc gene_set has on average lengthier non coding_sequences with a median of kb kb mean as compared with kb kb mean for all genes in the genome a difference that must be accounted for to avoid computational artifacts among other genes mesodermal genes and non sop genes have complex gene_expression and lengthy non coding_sequences and supplementary for example as shown in the c gs has a median non coding sequence_length of kb as compared with kb for all d melanogaster protein_coding wmw p value thus gs analyses that examine non uniform sequence_lengths must correct for length variability to avoid_potential artifacts we first show that dependence between a genes crm score and its non coding sequence_length affects several crm prediction_algorithms we then compare our loess method to other normalization_methods in correcting for this dependence and in identifying validated cis_regulatory codes dependence of the score of a biological sequence on the length of the sequence may confound or conceal true biological_signals here we have shown that this problem occurs for several well known crm prediction_algorithms we have presented a general method to adjust for length dependence of a dna_sequence score our loess fit approach is consistent in reducing the correlation between sequence_length and score not only in comparison to other methods e g length division ld pca based_methods and linear log regression llr but also in absolute terms supplementary in the context of cis_regulatory code discovery loess fit correction allowed the lever algorithm to recover experimentally_validated codes in two different biological_contexts in d melanogaster compared with other normalization approaches loess fit performed favorably in recovering the validated codes and does not suffer from the artifacts that llr and pca may yield supplementary in addition loess fit correction is useful in application to a variety of crm prediction_algorithms in analyses aimed at identifying putative cis_regulatory codes our gss were based on relatively stringent biological evidence we focused on gss comprising genes that are expressed in relatively homogeneous cell_types that were confirmed by in situ_hybridization and that have prior experimental_evidence for a cis_regulatory code gss could be constructed alternatively to comprise genes with shared gene_ontology go annotation terms or pathway involvement some major_advantages of loess as compared with other regression_methods are that it does not call for a priori specification of a fitting function and that it is a flexible and simple fitting approach used for a wide_range of purposes our data_points are generally dense e g however potential_limitations of the loess fit method may arise in small or sparse datasets where loess might overfit or inaccurately fit the data_points on another level to avoid generating non monotonic loess curves that might overfit the data we have empirically chosen the value of the smoothing parameter to be robust across various motif combinations and gss supplementary figs s and s potential artifacts might arise in a dataset with varying data density such as around the extreme ends of a distribution where loess interpolation might deviate from the sparse points that it tries to fit we seldom encountered such deviations which occurred mostly for genes with particularly short non coding sequence_lengths and with low gene crm scores where the loess curve could go below zero to guard against such deviations we implemented a small saturation threshold t so that the loess curve fit loess max t fit loess always remains or a small value t above we considered the possibility of score inflation where the loess curve came close to zero however since the scores fit by the loess curve are also generally close to zero and of the same order of magnitude their ratio will not be inflated of course an outlier score that is much greater than the loess curve will be inflated however
