detection of differentially_methylated in whole_genome bisulfite sequencing_data using local_getis statistics motivation dna_methylation is an important epigenetic_modification that has essential role in gene_regulation cell_differentiation and cancer development bisulfite_sequencing is a widely used technique to obtain genome_wide profiles and one of the key tasks of analyzing bisulfite sequencing_data is to detect differentially_methylated dmrs among samples under different treatment conditions although numerous tools have been proposed to detect differentially_methylated single cpg_site dmc between samples methods for direct dmr detection especially for complex study_designs are largely limited results we present a new software getisdmr for direct dmr detection we use beta binomial_regression to model the whole_genome bisulfite sequencing_data where variations in methylation_levels and confounding_effects have been accounted for we employ a region wise test_statistic which is derived from local_getis statistics and considers the spatial_correlation between nearby cpg_sites to detect dmrs unlike existing_methods that attempt to infer dmrs from dmcs based on empirical criteria we provide statistical_inference for direct dmr detection through extensive simulations and an application to two mouse datasets we demonstrate that getisdmr achieves better sensitivities positive_predictive more exact locations and better agreement of dmrs with current biological_knowledge dna_methylation is a stable epigenetic_modification that plays_a in numerous biological_processes such as genomic_imprinting regulation of gene_expression cell_differentiation development and carcinogenesis the presence of large_scale aberrant_dna pattern typically with site_specific hypermethylation in tumor_suppressor and global hypo methylation in oncogenes compared to normal_tissue is a hallmark feature of various types of cancers the whole_genome wgbs which combines the bisulfite_treatment with next_generation becomes the state of the art technology in investigating dna_methylation pattern at single_base with relatively high coverage across multiple samples the bisulfite_treatment converts un methylated_cytosines to uracils while leaving the methylated_cytosines unchanged thus it allows for the discrimination between methylated and unmethylated cpg_sites methylation proportion at each cpg_site is usually defined as the proportion of molecules with cytosine methylated c ct and is used to summarize the pattern of dna_methylation over the past_few a number of approaches have been proposed for assessing differentially_methylated dmrs from wgbs data one of the most straightforward method is to use the fishers_exact to compare the methylation proportions among different treatment groups at each cpg_site recently saito et_al developed the commet which is built based on hidden_markov and designed to detect dmrs between a pair of samples though these methods are easy to implement and can compare a pair of samples obtained either directly from the experiment or by pooling together samples under the same experimental_condition these methods do not take the between sample variations into account and cannot adjust for confounding_effects when replicates are available converging evidences suggest that close by cpg_sites tend to have similar methylation proportions with the assumption that methylation proportions change smoothly along the genome and the adjacent cpg_sites have similar methylation proportions various smoothing based_methods have been proposed to detect dmrs although the smoothing procedures adopted by these methods may differ in details all of them employ local averaging to improve the precision of the methylation proportion estimates especially for cpg_sites with low coverage for example the bsmooth method first estimates the methylation proportions with a local likelihood smoother and then performs the statistical_test using a signal tonoise statistic a dmr is claimed when groups of consecutive cpgs with the signal to noise statistics larger than a cutoff selected based on its marginal distribution biseq first employs a local smoothing technique and then detects dmrs based on the smoothed methylation proportion estimates the key difference between biseq and bsmooth is that biseq adopts a hierarchical testing procedure to detect dmrs and takes the spatial correlations among p values of adjacent cpg_sites into account the biseq requires the specification of a set of candidate_regions that may be differentially_methylated and thus it is only suitable for detecting dmrs in targeted bisulfite sequencing_data though smoothing based_methods make use of information from adjacent cpg_sites in most cases they require biological_replicates and thus cannot be applied to the datasets without replicates currently the wgbs is quite costly which prohibits the obtainment of multiple replicates for different experimental_conditions given limited budget it is quite common that some of the biological_replicates are combined into one sample before library generation for sequencing_experiments moreover there are situations where biological_replicates are hard to obtain especially in retrospective_studies regression based_methods have also been proposed to detect dmrs for example methylkit assumes that the number of methylated reads follows a binomial_distribution and models the methylated reads within the logistic regression_framework the p values are calculated and multiple_comparisons are adjusted using a sliding linear_model method as methylation proportions vary significantly across individuals failure to consider the variability across individuals may result in inflated_type beta binomial_regression has been recently_introduced to model methylation proportions in wgbs data as it can take both the sampling and epigenetic variations into account for example dss method uses a lognormal beta_binomial bayesian_hierarchical to describe the methylated reads and the dmr is defined as the cpg_site with p value less than a pre specified threshold the dss method allows information_sharing across different cpg_sites to improve precision of the test but the correlation of p values for proximal sites is not explicitly modeled in the dmr detection this may reduce both the sensitivity_and of the test the methylsig method also models the methylated reads using a betabinomial distribution and the likelihood_ratio is used to detect differentially_methylated single cpg dmc site although the methylsig can be used to identify dmcs it does not have the mechanism to detect dmrs which is of more biological_relevance radmeth adopts a beta binomial_regression to calculate the p values of each cpg_site and then combines the information from p values within base_pairs bp beta binomial_regression based_methods can explicitly take both the epigenetic and sampling variations into account but they mainly focus on detecting dmcs and have limited_power of identifying dmrs they usually pre specify a certain length for the dmr and then combines the information within the window to infer the significance of the detected dmrs however compelling evidences suggest that the length of dmrs can range from a few base_pairs to thousands of base_pairs and a fixed_length of dmr certainly contradicts with the existing biological_knowledge compared with detecting dmcs dmr detection has several advantages first locating the regions with multiple dmcs are one of the most basic goals for methylation studies second as pointed_out by bock after adjusting for multiple_comparisons for dmc detection only the strongest differences tend to remain_significant targeting at detecting dmr rather than single dmc can substantially reduce the number of hypothesis being tested and thus increases the statistical_power to overcome the current_limitations we develop getisdmr a genome_wide analysis tool for direct dmr detection getisdmr utilizes a beta binomial_distribution with biological_replicates or binomial_distribution without biological_replicates to model the methylated reads when bioloigcal replicates are available it also adopts a regression_framework to account for the potential confounding_effects it further uses a local_getis statistic which is widely used in identifying statistically_significant spatial clusters of high low values hot_spots to detect dmrs the length of detected dmrs is determined by the data and the statistical_inference of the detected dmrs is also provided in the following sections we first lay out the details of the method and then we compare our method with commet bsmooth and dss through simulation_studies we further apply our method to two public available mouse datasets and finally we briefly discuss our results in this work we present a novel statistical_method getisdmr to detect dmrs from wgbs datasets the proposed method_utilizes the beta_binomial regression_model to account for confounding_effects as well as biological and sampling variations it further uses a local_getis statistic to combine_information from nearby cpg_sites to detect dmrs the region wise overall test_statistic allows for the detection of dmrs directly which reduces the number of hypothesis being tested and increases the power of the proposed method through extensive simulations we have demonstrated the proposed method had comparable or higher sensitivities and positive_predictive in detecting dmrs than commet bsmooth and dss one strength of the proposed method is that it utilizes the betabinomial regression_framework and models the methylation proportions corresponding to experimental as well as other independent and potential_confounding as found bythat dna_methylation proportions could be influenced byconfounder such as age_and and thus it is important to take these confounding_variables into consideration to avoid bias effect_estimates the beta_binomial regression_model can account for biological_variability and therefore reduces the rate of false_positives compared with a standard logistic regression_model compared with the beta regression_model which is a widely used technique to model outcomes within the range between and the betabinomial regression increases power even at moderate coverage as it takes the coverage depth into consideration another strength of our method is that the getisdmr adopts region wise test_statistics based on local_getis statistics to directly detect dmrs currently most of the existing_methods focus on detecting dmcs and then identify dmrs based on some prespecified empirical criteria although getisdmr can be used to detect dmcs as we performed the beta binomial_regression for each cpg_site independently our method focuses on detecting dmrs directly and provides statistical_inference for direct dmr detection it has been reported by various researchers that dna_methylation proportions are spatially_correlated along the genome and our own data shows that the p values from the beta binomial_regression are also spatially_correlated in the getisdmr method we first derived a z_score and then we employed the local_getis statistics to account for the spatial_correlation in dmr detection detecting dmrs from wgbs data is similar to that of hot_spot detection where local_getis statistics have been widely used indeed most of the local_getis statistics calculated based on the z scores are approximately normally distributed as most of the cpg_sites are not dmcs any regions with abnormal large or small local_getis statistics may indicate a spatial hot_spot and in our case it indicates a dmr one of the challenges of defining the local_getis statistics is to calibrate the spatial_correlation among z scores although spatial correlations decrease with the increase in the distance between cpg_sites the magnitude of the correlation is quite data dependent in our method instead of pre specifying a weight function to account for the correlation we use a kernel_function to capture this relationship and let the data to determine the magnitude of the parameters this makes our method robust to various datasets with different underlying spatial_correlation structures we further showed the asymptotic distribution of the region wise test_statistic i e g mvn n and controlled the region wise false_discovery therefore our method can well control the false_positive and it provides statistical_inference not only for dmcs but also for dmrs it is worth mentioning that the proposed method is quite flexible to the study_designs as the dmr detection only requires p values for example for studies where replicates are not available the fishers_exact could be used to calculate p values for each cpg_site we could then use the same procedure to detect dmrs for studies with more than treatment groups the likelihood_ratio could be performed to assess the treatment effects and the same local_getis statistic based procedure could be used to detect dmrs for longitudinal_studies or studies with clustered effects robust estimation of the beta_binomial model_parameters can be used and the same local_getis statistic based procedure could be employed to infer dmrs in real_data application we applied the proposed method to two public available mouse datasets the first dataset is designed to investigate methylation proportions at different tissues of mouse and it only has one sample per tissue i e one sample from the bone_marrow tissue and one sample from the kidney_tissue in total our method
