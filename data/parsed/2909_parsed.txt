metamodules identifies key functional subnetworks in microbiome related disease downloaded from motivation the human_microbiome plays_a in health and disease thanks to comparative metatranscriptomics the cellular_functions that are deregulated by the microbiome in disease can now be computationally explored unlike gene centric approaches pathway based_methods provide a systemic view of such functions however they typically consider each pathway in isolation and in its entirety they can therefore overlook the key differences that i span_multiple pathways ii contain bidirectionally deregulated components iii are confined to a pathway region to capture these properties computational_methods that reach beyond the scope of predefined pathways are needed results by integrating an existing module discovery algorithm into comparative metatranscrip tomic analysis we developed metamodules a novel computational framework for automated identification of the key functional differences between health and disease associated communities using this framework we recovered significantly_deregulated subnetworks that were indeed recognized to be involved in two well studied microbiome mediated oral diseases such as butanoate production in periodontal_disease and metabolism of sugar alcohols in dental_caries more importantly our results indicate that our method can be used for hypothesis_generation based on automated discovery of novel disease related functional subnetworks which would otherwise require extensive and laborious manual assessment availability_and metamodules is available at https bitbucket org alimay metamodules contact a may vu nl or s abeln vu nl supplementary_information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online the human_microbiome is a functional community that plays an important role in health and disease disorders that have been previously linked to for instance the gut_microbiome include cardiovascular_disease and type_diabetes because distinct populations of microbes from different patients can harbor remarkably_similar functional_capabilities the pathogeneses of these diseases may not necessarily be related to specific microbial_population shifts from the health associated microbiome phenotypic_differences are therefore better explained by changes in the regulation of cellular_mechanisms for instance in the form of under or overexpression of certain metabolic_pathways or parts thereof a prerequisite for this is the ability to identify differentially_expressed functional systems using computational_pipelines that can operate at the systems level the availability of such pipelines is likely to lead to increased discovery of preventive and therapeutic_targets in microbiome related_diseases metagenomics and metatranscriptomics are two powerful approaches for studying respectively the functional capability and activity of microorganisms in environmental and clinical samples the latter provides a more direct view into disease associated factors since microbial_activity is often clinically more relevant than microbial genetic potential supporting this are recent_observations of many metagenomically abundant gene_families being consistently downregulated at the transcriptional level for instance in the human_gut comparative metatranscriptomics meta rna_seq aims at identifying the functions that are significantly_differentially by microbial_communities under different conditions because the number of active microbial genes can reach up to several millions the functional profile of a sample is commonly constructed by mapping mrna reads first to genes and then to higher_level functional_units such as kegg orthology groups kos kos are organism independent identifiers that group together proteins of similar biochemical_functions as with genes they can be used to perform differential_expression using packages such as edger and deseq since interpreting_results at ko level is not straightforward this is typically followed by pathway or gene_set as in another common approach is to use bioinformatics_pipelines such as megan or humann to map kos to predefined functional_modules and pathways such as those in the kegg and metacyc databases and then to identify the deregulated functional_units as in pathway based_approaches provide invaluable insights into disease biology however they have a number of shortcomings that are critical for the identification of functional markers first they consider each predefined pathway individually and therefore ignore the interactions between pathways that may be crucial for discovering causal biochemical_mechanisms second collapsing the expression levels of kos into pathways or modules can have two undesired outcomes non differentially but highly_expressed functions within a pathway can obfuscate significant differences of other parts of the same pathway moreover pathways that contain up and downregulated genes may be determined as non differentially_expressed overall finally significantly_deregulated pathway regions that are not covered by predefined module delineations cannot be identified methods that address the above limitations of pathway based_methods have been previously_reported by combining protein_protein with gene_expression data introduced the concept of identifying connected subsets of regulatory_genes that are responsible for changes in expression under different conditions this concept has since been extended to other settings including networks of enzymatic and regulatory_elements the central idea in these methods can be summarized in three main steps i constructing a mathematical network graph that captures the core molecular_interactions in biological_pathways ii assigning numerical scores that reflect biological_activity or response to the components edges nodes in the network and finally iii performing a search on the network to identify the highly scoring subnetworks that delineate the biological hotspots from the rest of the network for a review see the current work introduces metamodules a novel approach that focuses on comparative metatranscriptomic datasets for identifying metabolic subnetworks of significantly_deregulated orthologous gene groups an earlier work in this direction is metapath a method for finding differentially_abundant enzymatic subnetworks in metagenomic_datasets the biological_questions addressed by our method and metapath are fundamentally different whereas metapath is specifically_designed to find subnetworks of reactions that are either enriched or depleted as a whole in a given experimental_condition metamodules focuses on finding connected subsets of significantly_deregulated ortholog gene groups note that the subnetworks discovered by metapath do not have to be composed of significantly differentially_abundant or expressed elements instead the statistical_significance of these subnetworks is evaluated using a bootstrapping strategy on the other hand as it is designed with a metatranscriptomic focus our approach uses statistics that are tailored to the properties of rna_seq following the work by our method specifically searches for connected subnetworks that predominantly contain significantly_differentially kos which can be either up or downregulated in different experimental_conditions finally the exact search algorithm used by metamodules heinz guarantees to find the optimal maximum scoring subnetwork within the input network we applied metamodules to previously_published metatranscriptomic datasets of two well studied oral microbiome related_diseases periodontal_disease and dental_caries periodontal gum disease originates from an unbalanced host microbiome interaction that leads to an enhanced host inflammatory_response if left_untreated it causes the destruction of tooth supporting structures and may eventually result in tooth_loss dental_caries tooth_decay is one of the most common chronic_diseases where the main cause is a net overproduction of acids during microbial carbohydrate fermentation in the oral_cavity leading to the demineralization of dental_hard using metamodules we recovered significantly_deregulated connected subnetworks of functions that are important in a number of mechanisms previously associated with these diseases such as the production of metabolites that inhibit human cell_growth in periodontal_disease our results indicate that using high_throughput data our methodology can be used to generate new hypotheses automatically by uncovering novel disease related metabolic mechanisms in microbial_communities although we demonstrated it on microbiomerelated disease datasets in this study metamodules can be used for datasets from any type of comparative metatranscriptomic studies
