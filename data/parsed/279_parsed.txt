bioinformatics_discovery structural bioinformatics_analysis of base_pairing probabilities of rna_molecules involved in protein_rna motivation understanding the details of proteinrna interactions is important to reveal the functions of both the rnas and the proteins in these interactions the secondary_structures of the rnas play_an because rna_secondary in proteinrna complexes are variable considering the ensemble of rna_secondary is a useful approach in particular recent_studies have supported the idea that in the analysis of rna_secondary the base_pairing probabilities bpps of rnas i e the probabilities of forming a base_pair in the ensemble of rna_secondary provide richer and more robust information about the structures than a single rna_secondary for example the minimum_free or a snapshot of structures in the protein_data however there has been no investigation of the bpps in proteinrna interactions results in this study we analyzed bpps of rna_molecules involved in known proteinrna complexes in the protein_data our analysis suggests that in the tertiary_structures the bpps which are computed using only sequence_information for unpaired nucleotides with intermolecular hydrogen_bonds hbonds to amino_acids were significantly_lower than those for unpaired nucleotides without hbonds on the other hand no difference was found between the bpps for paired nucleotides with and without intermolecular hbonds those findings were commonly supported by three probabilistic_models which provide the ensemble of rna_secondary including the mccaskill model based on turners free_energy of secondary_structures proteinrna interactions play_important in various aspects of biological_processes such as splicing translation and rna_silencing recently several experimental_techniques have been developed to investigate proteinrna interactions in addition the increasing number of determined d structures of proteinrna complexes deposited in the protein_data pdb has promoted many computational studies to understand the detailed mechanisms_underlying the proteinrna interactions most of these studies consistently_showed the importance of electrostatic_interactions between the positively_charged of the proteins and the negatively_charged phosphate_groups of the rna however only a few studies have considered the role of rna_secondary in the protein_rna although many rna_binding are known to recognize the specific secondary_structures of their partner rna in addition the secondary_structures are phylogenetically_conserved and are closely_related to the functions of rnas one difficulty for analyzing rna_secondary in proteinrna complexes in the pdb is that only snapshots of the secondary_structures are available but they are variable in reality moreover the probability of forming a specific rna_secondary such as the minimum_free often becomes extremely_small typically these facts are known as the ambiguity or uncertainty of rna_secondary to tackle this uncertainty a probability_distribution of secondary_structures has been considered in many analyses of rnas specifically base_pairing probabilities bpps that provide probabilities for each base_pair with respect to an ensemble of rna_secondary are often used for rna_secondary analysis see section for the detailed definition of bpps for example the bpps played essential roles in the analysis of an rna aptamer in which an unstable stem in the rna aptamer was confirmed by both computational_analysis of bpps and biochemical_experiments this indicates the importance of considering the ensemble in the analysis of rnas however there is no study that considers the ensemble of rnas in the analysis of protein_rna in this study we systematically investigate bpps of rna_molecules involved in known proteinrna complexes taken from the pdb see section for the detailed dataset more specifically bpps of both paired and unpaired nucleotides section with and without intermolecular hydrogen_bonds hbonds to amino_acids see section for the detailed definition are to whom correspondence should be addressed systematically_analyzed see section in the analysis we tried three probabilistic_models of rna_secondary section including the mccaskill model based on turners energy_model when computing bpps and confirmed that our results are consistently supported
