inferring data specific micro_rna function through the joint ranking of micro_rna and pathways from matched micro_rna and gene_expression data motivation in practice identifying and interpreting the functional_impacts of the regulatory_relationships between micro_rna and messenger_rna is non trivial the sheer scale of possible micro_rna and messenger_rna interactions can make the interpretation of results difficult results we propose a supervised framework pmim built upon concepts of significance combination for jointly ranking regulatory micro_rna and their potential functional_impacts with respect to a condition of interest here pmim directly tests if a micro_rna is differentially_expressed and if its predicted targets which lie in a common biological_pathway have changed in the opposite_direction we leverage the information within existing micro_rna target and pathway_databases to stabilize the estimation and annotation of micro_rna regulation making our approach suitable for datasets with small_sample in addition to outputting meaningful and interpretable results we demonstrate in a variety of datasets that the micro_rna identified by pmim in comparison to simpler existing_approaches are also more concordant with what is described in the literature availability_and this framework is implemented as an r function pmim in the package sydseq available from http www ellispatrick com r packages micro_rna mirna are a class of small_non which down regulate_gene through basepairing mirna down regulate the expression of genes by inhibiting their translation or promoting the degradation of their target messenger_rna mrna dysregulation of mirna can lead to a variety of human_diseases with mirna being shown to play a critical regulatory_role in many cellular_pathways and functions such as developmental timing cell_death cell_proliferation immunity and patterning of the nervous_system as such investigating the functional_impacts of mirna may further the understanding of many diseases one of the first steps to understand how a mirna could regulate a biological_process is predicting which mrna can directly interact with a mirna irrespective of a particular dataset or condition there exist many computational algorithms for predicting the target_genes of mirna such as targetscan mirbase and pictar these algorithms essentially attempt to identify whether a mrna contains the binding_motif of a mirna this remains an active area of research as there is generally not a large consensus between algorithms attempting to identify a mirna that is regulating a set of genes in response to a particular condition or treatment is also an established problem a simple approach for identifying candidate mirna mrna regulatory_relationships is to identify a differentially_expressed de mirna and look for large negative pair_wise correlations between that mirna and the genes that it is predicted to bind to another common approach is to identify a de mirna and then use predicted binding target information to perform an enrichment_analysis on the de genes or mirna mrna correlations an important but often overlooked factor to both of these approaches is the combination of the significance from the test on the mirna with the test on its targets not combining these tests may produce results that are overly conservative as two p value cutoffs are performed instead of one this could result in biologically_significant signal being missed as mirna can potentially target hundreds or even thousands of genes if a mirna and its targets are identified as de then further pathway_enrichment is often performed to make any results biologically interpretable this adds another level of statistical complication and yet another p value cutoff practically this style of analysis often produces a list of de mirna a list of de mirna_targets and a list of pathway analyses for each mirna these nested lists can quickly become unmanageable in some sense broadening an exploratory_analysis instead of focusing it instead of performing functional pathway analysis as an after thought directly considering how mirna interact with annotated pathways may help the interpretation of their function it is well documented that the predicted gene_targets of mirna are often overrepresented for annotated functional pathways likewise annotated pathways are overrepresented for predicted gene_targets of mirna see supplementary section s for further explanation this observation suggests that pathway_databases contain stable information about mirna mrna regulatory_networks if leveraged effectively this information could improve both the power and interpretability of results to this end we propose an integrative_analysis for pathways micro_rna and mrna pmim incorporating publicly_available biological_network information and mirna_target predictions together with experimental rna_seq and mirna seq data this novel framework is the first to allow for the joint ranking of interesting mirna and pathways by directly testing for mirna that target a group of genes from a specific biological_pathway in response to a treatment or condition this approach produces one list of biologically interpretable results instead of the multiple lists generated by the previously described methods also due to its simplicity it is free of the statistically demanding task of estimating complex mirna mrna interactions making it suitable for datasets with small_sample a resampling scheme was used to evaluate if there is mirna regulation in any of the datasets and to illustrate the importance of having accurate predicted binding target and pathway matrices when implementing pmimde and pmimcor shows the results from the resampling scheme applied to four different datasets randomising either the pathway kegg or predicted binding target targetscan matrices reduces the number of mir pathways that are called significant in all four datasets randomising both matrices reduces the number of mir pathways further this suggests that both kegg and targetscan matrices contain information pertinent to mirna regulation this is also suggestive that mirna may be regulating gene_expression in each of the datasets while observed in all datasets this pattern is observed most strongly in the melanoma data with the number of identified mir pathways dropping from to mir pathways after randomization in order to compare the mirna rankings of four methods mirna de cmimde pmimde and pmimcor a strategy based on broad literature_searches is used methods which rank highly mirna that have been associated with the conditions in each of the datasets in the literature would be considered favourable plots the tp against fp for the region of small fp for each of the four datasets full roc_curves can be found in supplementary_file s for this region of small fp pmimcor performs better than or comparably to all other approaches in every dataset this is becausefor any fp it generally has a higher tp i e its curve is higher than the others in the melanoma dataset all methods appear to perform comparably in the remaining three datasets pmimcor performs most favourably with a simple mirna de test generally performing worst the method pmimcor appears to be identifying more mirna that have been associated each of the datasets in the literature than the other methods the prognostic strategy is used to compare the concordance of the mirna identified by each of the methods and their corresponding target_genes if a mirna has been identified as a prognostic_marker its target_genes should also be able to predict prognosis shows boxplots of the classification error_rates of these target_genes for each of the cancer datasets these error_rates were calculated after training a dlda on the most de targeted genes of each method the choice of this number is shown to be not too influential on the results in supplementary in all three datasets cmimde pmimde and pmimcor deliver error_rates less than in the melanoma dataset all mirna based_methods perform similarly with simply taking the most de genes performing dramatically worse in lung all the integration based_methods cmimde pmimde and pmimcor perform favourably to the other two approaches who have error_rates of both pmimde and pmimcor appear most preferable in the ovarian dataset supplementarydemonstrates that these results are relatively robust to the choice of the number of genes under consideration unsurprisingly methods that integrate both mirna and gene data show greater concordance in behaviour between their identified mirna and genes our proposed methods pmimde and pmimcor rank both mirna and pathways concurrently which can improve biological_interpretation to illustrate thislists the top mir pathways identified by pmimcor in the notch dataset in this dataset notch has been conditionally deleted in the brain of mice using a nestin cre driver cortical samples were isolated from matched mutant and control adult_mice the affected mir pathways are consistent with known notch function in the nervous_system notch_signalling has been associated with als and alzheimers_disease ch vez and loss of notch leads to neurodegeneration in the olfactory system furthermore notch_signalling is known to play_important in axon_guidance synaptic_plasticity and learning and memory notch_signalling also possesses significant cross_talk with other signalling_pathways including the jak_stat finally notch_signalling regulates growth and differentiation and as such is implicated in many cancers in keeping with this notch is a key_regulator of neurogenesis in the brain the identified mirpathways are therefore consistent with the existing_literature and provide a biological_context for understanding how misregulation of mirna in notch mutants can affect neuronal_function the key strength of pmimde and pmimcor is to rank both mirna and pathways concurrently i e rank the top mir pathways as such these may be considered favourable approaches for integration as they facilitate interpretation and directly address the biological_question however quantitatively assessing the performance of these rankings is not trivial in the absence of the known truth as such we have assessed the performance of the proposed methods via three evaluation techniques while individually these techniques are suggestive at best concurrently they provide a more complete picture of each methods performance our proposed method has recently been applied to an experiment using microarrays to investigate the associations between mirna and gene_expression with braf_mutations and patient prognosis in stage_iii metastatic_melanoma in comparison to other state of the art methods used in the analysis our approach provided insights that could not be easily made using the other approaches it has been our experience that the joint ranking of mirna and pathways provided by pmim makes the information from studying mirna mrna interactions more easily_accessible and interpretable the notch dataset is previously unpublished and has a small_sample yet still identifies signal concordant with the predicted phenotype this is promising in two ways firstly it demonstrates the benefits of using a predefined network_structure as opposed to one derived empirically deriving a large complex network using six samples would generally be ill advised however using the predefined mir pathways pmimcor is able to identify signal demonstrating that small samples experiments can still be informative even when calculating correlations on only six samples secondly as this dataset is unpublished and still identifies signal concordant with the literature it protects against publication_bias in the evaluation approach in both the literature search_strategy and prognostic strategy the integration approaches cmimde pmimde and pmimcor generally perform better than using only the gene or mirna data this potentially demonstrates the value of integrating data to ask complex questions alternatively there are arguments why both of the evaluation strategies should be biased towards the integration approaches and it is reassuring to observe the results concordant with these expected biases in the literature search_strategy a mirna may be more likely to have been associated with a condition in the literature if that mirna and its targets have been observed as changed whilst in the prognostic strategy as the mirna for each method are chosen outside of cross_validation performance could be biased towards those methods that use gene information the general framework described in this paper has some natural extensions it is possible to extend pmim to cover experiments with multiple conditions by combining the p value from testing the equality of group means using a one way anova of the mirna_expression with the correlations between the mirna and the genes in a mir pathway also many significance combination approaches can be modified to include weights including stouffers method weights could be included to increase the impact of genes that are thought to be highly influential on the biology in question our integration approach has raised some statistically interesting questions that should warrant_further to transcend the typical modularized analysis framework our approaches make use of p value combination methods to combine significance by combining significance from a de test of one mirna with tests on multiple gene_sets pmim suffers from an issue associated with correcting for multiple_comparisons while there has been some research into correction for multiple_comparisons in the presence of correlated pathways this methodology could be extended further to account for having correlated summary_statistics from multiple mirna it would also be interesting to establish whether it is more appropriate to correct for multiple testing before or after utilising a p value combination method like fisher or osp in addition to considering how individual mirna regulate a set of gene mirna are also known to act in groups to regulate genes one broad group of statistical_methods aims to identify groups of genes that are potentially being regulated by a mirna or group of mirna such methods include canonical_correlation nonnegative_matrix multivariate random_forests and integrative bayesian_analysis statistically these methods can be thought of as ways of identifying relationships between a high_dimensional multivariate response and high_dimensional multivariate covariates unfortunately as these methods are attempting to identify large complex_networks their results are very dependent on sample_size as with the simpler univariate tests the interpretation of the outputs from these methods can quickly become intimidating due to the many pathway analyses being performed on multiple lists of results for datasets with sufficient sample_size our framework may be used as a first pass of analysis before implementing more sophisticated or intricate approaches we can easily incorporate other functional databases into the pmim framework the framework is not restricted to any specific databases such as the targetscan and kegg databases that were used as the predicted binding target and pathway_databases respectively in this paper depending on the question of interest and the desired interpretation scientists could easily substitute the pathway database with other functional relevant databases such as those on gsea or david the resampling scheme outlined in the evaluation as well as a further strategy outlined in section of the supplementary_file could both be used to assess the viability of any alternate predicted binding target or functional database we have included an evaluation of thea table of the top mir pathways identified by pmimcor in the notch dataset the table consists of four columns the mirna that was identified as changed the direction the mirna_expression changed a significance score of the mir pathway and the pathway contained the target_genes information in the protein_protein database iref in section of the supplementary_file we described a general framework pmim for integrating mirna_expression gene_expression and annotation_information from this framework three methods were proposed cmimde pmimde and pmimcor the method cmimde is a formalization and mild improvement of previously described approaches for identifying regulatory mirna the methods pmimde and pmimcor are both novel methods for identifying if a mirna is regulating a set of genes that also share some common biological_function each of these methods relies on a predefined network_structure derived from mirna binding target predictions and or biological_pathway annotations making them suitable for use on experiments with limited replication the proposed pmimde and pmimcor are the first methods to jointly rank mirna and pathways in relation to a condition of interest which greatly_facilitates biological_interpretation
