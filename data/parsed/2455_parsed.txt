inferring_gene from gene_expression data by path consistency algorithm based on conditional mutual_information motivation reconstruction of gene_regulatory grns which explicitly represent the causality of developmental or regulatory_process is of utmost interest and has become a challenging computational_problem for understanding the complex regulatory_mechanisms in cellular_systems however all existing_methods of inferring grns from gene_expression have their strengths_and in particular many properties of grns such as topology sparseness and non linear dependence are generally in regulation_mechanism but seldom are taken into account simultaneously in one computational_method results in this work we present a novel method for inferring grns from gene_expression data considering the non linear dependence and topological_structure of grns by employing path consistency algorithm pca based on conditional mutual_information cmi in this algorithm the conditional dependence between a pair of genes is represented by the cmi between them with the general hypothesis of gaussian_distribution underlying gene_expression data cmi between a pair of genes is computed by a concise formula involving the covariance_matrices of the related gene_expression the method is validated on the benchmark grns from the dream_challenge and the widely used sos dna_repair network in escherichia_coli the cross_validation results confirmed the effectiveness of our method pca cmi which outperforms significantly other previous methods besides its high_accuracy our method is able to distinguish direct or causal interactions from indirect associations availability all the source data and code are available at an important problem in molecular_biology is to identify and understand the gene_regulatory grns which explicitly represent the causality of developmental or regulatory_process microarray_technologies have produced tremendous amounts of gene_expression data which provide opportunity for understanding the underlying regulatory_mechanism the reconstruction or reverse_engineering of grns which aims to find the underlying_network of genegene_interactions from the measurement of gene_expression is considered one of most important goals in systems_biology for this the dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods dream program was established to encourage researchers to develop new efficient computation methods to infer robust grns a variety of approaches have been proposed to infer grns from gene_expression data such as discrete models of boolean_networks and bayesian_networks differential_equations regression_method and linear_programming although many popular network_inference have been investigated there are still a large space for current models to be improved recently information_theoretic approaches are increasingly being used for reconstructing grns several mutual_information mi based_methods have been successfully_applied to infer grns such as aracne clr and minet in general these approaches start by computing the pair_wise mis between all possible pairs of genes resulting in an mi matrix the mi matrix is then manipulated to identify the regulatory_relationships mi provides a natural generalization of the correlation since it measures non linear dependency which is common in biology and therefore attracts much attention another page in order to validate our method pca cmi was applied to several simulation datasets as well as real gene_expression as for simulation_data we tested two synthetic datasets from the dream dialogue for reverse_engineering assessment and methods challenge as for real_gene we applied our method to the well defined sos dna_repair network with experiment dataset in e coli and also rice oryza_sativa l gene_expression data supplementary_materials the predictive results were evaluated by following measures i e sensitivity sn or true_positive tpr false_positive fpr positive_predictive ppv and accuracy acc mathematically they are defined by tpr tp tp fn where tp fp tn and fn are the numbers of true_positives false_positives true_negatives and false_negatives respectively tpr and fpr are also used to plot the receiver_operating roc_curves and the area_under auc is calculated in this work we proposed a novel method pca cmi to infer grns from the benchmark validations pca cmi is an effective method and the comparison results show its advantages comparing to linear methods like lp lasso and pca pcc our method can cover non linear relations between gene_pairs based on mi and cmi from information_theory they can detect the non linear statistical dependence which is in accordance with the complexity of biology instead of linear assumption in addition pca cmi can distinguish the direct_interactions or correlations from indirect ones which are important for causality analysis for example consider three genes forming a causal chain the first gene couples to the second and the latter to the third gene in this case a pair_wise mi analysis would yield dependencies also between the first and third genes and we could not decide whether this coupling is made directly or mediated by the second one an alternative to overcome the problem is to consider partial conditional dependence or correlation to this end partial mi as proposed is a general approach because it relates to non linear dependencies needs no explicit modeling and further represents the information between two observations that is not contained in a third one thus in this way we can discover the real underlying coupling or dependence_structure to illustrate the significance of the inferred networks the average correlation underling the inferred regulations was compared with that of random gene_pairs we chose the result of the method performed on a rice o sativa l gene_expression dataset geo access number gse with significantly differential_expression genes t test p the average mi and pearsons_correlation pcc between gene_pairs from inferred edges by pca cmi were also computed the average pcc was randomly repeated five times supplementary figures s and s describe the histograms of mis and pccs supplementary_materials the result shows that cmi can significantly quantify the correlations of gene_pairs for the general pca genes i j and k are randomly_selected in order to reduce the computational_complexity to reduce computational_complexity but not sacrifice the accuracy to detect the true regulatory_interactions we adopted an optimal strategy to select l genes from t adjacent genes for randomly_selected gene_pair i and j which also ensures the local optimality of the algorithm for example suppose that there are t t genes which are adjacent with both genes i and j when constructing the l order l t network all the l order cmis for the possible combinations of l conditional genes from t genes are computed and the maximum one or the geometric mean of them is selected to decide the existence of regulation it is well known that the pca is not robust for some inputs in order to improve the robustness and accuracy of the inference in large_scale datasets modular analysis is adopted in our algorithm specifically the first level network is inferred by pcacmi then subnetworks are identified from the first level network by module finder methods such as cfinder each modular network can be re inferred again by pca cmi and the resulting networks are called second level subnetworks the bi level integrative_method of pca cmi can improve accuracy for avoiding the effects of wrong edges in a largescale network the performance of such bi level method was tested on dream_challenge insilico datasets and the acc value actually improved from to supplementary in addition the pca based on partial coefficient correlation is not robust for the correlation estimator of pcc in which a small quantity of outliers suffices to completely distort the resulting network a comparison study on correlation measure for mi and pcc based_methods from gene_expression showed that mi is more robust than pcc with respect to missing expression values however there is some limitation for pca cmi as same as that of aracne pca cmi cannot directly infer edge directionality which is also a general limitation of many other methods especially for these methods that do not use time series data another limitation of pca cmi the same as other methods based on general mi is that it cannot detect all regulatory relations in particular those with time delay between transcriptional_factors and their target_genes although mi is a symmetric measure which cannot derive the direction of an edge this limitation can be relieved by a two tier approach in which an undirected grn is inferred first and then edge directionality is accessed via other method like multiple_linear method or specific biochemical perturbation method in this work we proposed a novel method pca cmi for inferring grns from gene_expression data by taking_into the nonlinear dependence and sparse structure of grns in this algorithm the conditional_independence between a pair of genes is represented by cmi between this gene_pair given certain other gene s with the hypothesis of gaussian_distribution for gene_expression data cmis between gene_pairs are calculated by a concise formula involving the covariance_matrices of the related gene_expression the proposed method performed superior to other methods on the benchmark grns from the dream_challenge real sos dna_repair network in e coli and real rice networks both the cross_validation results and comparison studies demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in addition pca cmi is able to distinguish the direct regulatory_relationships from indirect ones
