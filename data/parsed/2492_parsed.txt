systems_biology in silico site of metabolism prediction for human ugt catalyzed_reactions motivation the human uridine_diphosphate glucuronosyltransfer ase enzyme_family catalyzes the glucuronidation of the glycosyl group of a nucleotide sugar to an acceptor compound substrate which is the most common conjugation pathway that serves to protect the organism from the potential toxicity of xenobiotics moreover it could affect the pharmacological profile of a drug therefore it is important to identify the metabolically labile sites for glucuronidation results in the present study we developed four in silico models to predict sites of glucuronidation for four major sites of metabolism functional_groups i e aliphatic hydroxyl aromatic hydroxyl carboxylic_acid or amino nitrogen respectively according to the mechanism of glucuronidation a series of local and global molecular_descriptors characterizing the atomic reactivity bonding_strength and physical_chemical were calculated and selected with a genetic_algorithm based feature_selection approach the constructed support_vector classification_models show good prediction_performance with the balanced accuracy ranging from to on test_set for further validation our models can successfully_identify of experimentally_observed sites of metabolisms for an external test_set containing molecules availability_and the software somugt based on our models is available at www dddc ac cn adme jlpeng somugt human uridine_diphosphate udp glucuronosyltransferases ugts are major phase_ii drug_metabolizing that catalyze transfer of glucuronic_acid from udp_glucuronic to various substrates containing nucleophilic functional_group e g alcohols phenols carboxylic_acids amines thiols and so forth up until now human ugt proteins have been identified and they can be classified in four families ugt ugt ugt and ugt these isoforms are widely_distributed and can be found in liver intestine kidney lung and skin both endogenous e g bilirubin and xenobiotic e g drug chemicals can be metabolized by this family of enzymes yielding water_soluble products that are easier to be excreted most of those isoforms possess the overlapping substrate_specificities as well as the capacity to metabolize a variety of structure unrelated substances for example ugt a can catalyze glucuronidation of phenols carboxylic_acids and amines in addition to an essential detoxification mechanism for structurally_diverse drugs the glucuronidation can also lead to short_duration of action and the loss of pharmacological_activity of the drugs in such cases medicinal chemist needs to optimize the lead compound to improve its pharmacokinetic_properties for example to reduce potential for glucuronidation designed metabolically more stable compounds by incorporating substituents at the ortho position of the phenolic hydroxyl_group or exchanging the phenyl group in addition strategy like bioisosteric modifications of phenol moiety was also reported to overcome the issue of rapid glucuronidation in contrast the property that glucuronidation may lead to a minimized systemic_exposure can be used to reduce adverse_events for example designed inhaled p inhibitors by introducing functional_groups prone to be metabolized via cytochromes p cyps or ugts to achieve high intrinsic clearance therefore glucuronidation provides access to modifying the pharmacokinetic_profile during lead_optimization it is necessary to identify whether a compound can be glucuronidated as well as which functional_group of the compound is able to undergo the reaction normally the ugt catalyzed biotransformation is determined_experimentally by metabolite_identification techniques however given that such experimental_techniques are cost intensive and time consuming there is growing interest to develop reliable in silico models to predict and deepen our understanding of the reaction till now only the crystal_structure of c terminal domain of human ugt b was determined accordingly current computational_models for ugtmediated reaction were based on the reported substrate profile early studies mainly focused on analyzing kinetic_constants for the glucuronidation of homologous series of substrates suggesting that glucuronidation rate was related to to whom correspondence should be addressed molecular lipophilic electronic and or steric properties miners smith and sorich extensively_studied substrates and nonsubstrates of ugt isoforms reaction phenotyping by trying various machine_learning classification_models for discriminating substrates of different ugt isoforms were developed they also applied the strategy of pharmacophore fingerprint analysis to mine the structure signature related to glucuronidation and found that local environment of nucleophilic site played_an in identifying potential sites of metabolism soms though many computational studies have been reported to simulate reaction rate and phenotyping models predicting sites of glucuronidation were rare reported navenave bayes models trained for eight ugt isoforms using three quantum_chemical qc and constitutional descriptors their results indicated that the local environment of nucleophilic site is an important feature to characterize the som of glucuronidation and general chemical_properties may be of secondary importance however this study was based on a small dataset containing only dozens of glucuronidated sites which limited its application to structurally_diverse compounds outside the range of training data in the present study we combined local qc descriptors and global physicalchemical properties to build four classification_models to predict sites of glucuronidation using the learning method support_vector svm and a dataset covering a large chemical diversity space first human ugt catalyzed_reactions were retrieved from mdl metabolite database and potential sites of glucuronidation were marked by matching predefined smarts strings then both qc and geometrical descriptors were calculated to train svm classifiers for each type of sites i e aliphatic hydroxyl aromatic hydroxyl carboxylic and amino nitrogen in the end model performance was assessed by fold_cross fold cv and test_set for further validation another molecules were collected and predicted using our constructed models in the present work we developed four in silico models to predict human ugt catalyzed soms for the following potential sites aliphatic hydroxyl aromatic hydroxyl carboxyl_group aliphatic aromatic amino nitrogen and heterocyclic nitrogen extensive validations were carried_out on the models and the results demonstrated good predicting performances on both internal and external tests among the ga selected descriptors we found that local descriptors such as bond_strength between reactive_site and its neighbor and fukui atomic reactivity indices are important to characterize the glucuronidation potential of a site moreover the distribution analysis of global descriptors suggested that molecules with higher lipophilicity and relatively small molecular_size are generally more liable to glucuronidation overall the current study may provide insight for understanding human phase_ii metabolic_profile of a chemical and the resulted in silico models allow chemists to make rational decisions more quickly during pharmacokinetic lead_optimization
