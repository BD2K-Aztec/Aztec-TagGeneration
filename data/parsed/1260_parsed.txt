gene_expression data based filtering for replicated high_throughput transcriptome sequencing_experiments during the past_years next generation high_throughput hts technology has become an essential tool for genomic and transcriptomic studies in particular the use of hts technology to directly sequence the transcriptome known as rna_sequencing rna_seq has revolutionized the study of gene_expression by opening the door to a wide_range of novel applications unlike microarray_data which are continuous rna_seq represent highly_heterogeneous counts for genomic_regions of interest typically genes and often exhibit zero inflation and a large amount of overdispersion among biological_replicates as such a great_deal of methodological research e g has recently focused on appropriate normalization and analysis techniques that are adapted to the characteristics of rna_seq seefor a review of rna_seq technology and analysis procedures as with data arising from previous technologies such as microarrays or serial_analysis hts_data are often used to conduct differential analyses in recent_years several approaches for gene by gene tests using gene level hts_data have been proposed with the most popular making use of poisson overdispersed poisson or negative_binomial distributions because a large number of hypothesis_tests are performed for gene by gene differential analyses the obtained p values must be adjusted to address the fact that many truly null_hypotheses will produce small p values simply by chance to address this multiple_testing several well established procedures have been proposed to adjust p values to control various measures of experiment wide false_positives such as the false_discovery although such procedures may be used to control the number_of that are detected they are often at the expense of the power of an experiment to detect truly differentially_expressed de genes particularly as the number of genes in a typical hts dataset may be in the thousands or tens_of to reduce this impact several authors in the microarray literature have suggested the use of data filters to identify and remove genes that appear to generate an uninformative signal and have no or little chance of showing significant evidence of differential_expression only hypotheses corresponding to genes that pass the filter are subsequently_tested which in turn tempers the correction needed to adjust for multiple testing in recent work advocate for the use of independent data filtering in which the filter and subsequent test_statistic pairs are marginally independent under the null_hypothesis and the dependence_structure among tests remains largely unchanged pre_and filter ensuring that post filter p values are true p values for such an independent filter to be effective it must be positively correlated with the test_statistic under the alternative hypothesis indeed it is this correlation that leads to an increase in detection_power after filtering in addition bourgon et_al demonstrate that non independent filters for which dependence exists between the filter and test_statistic e g making use of condition labels to filter genes with average expression in at least one condition less than a given threshold can in some cases lead to a loss of control of experiment wide error_rates several ad_hoc data filters for rna_seq have been used in recent_years including filtering genes with a total read_count smaller than a given threshold and filtering genes with at least one zero count in each experimental_condition however selecting an arbitrary threshold to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http

to filter genes in this way does not account for the overall sequencing_depth or variability of a given experiment one exception to these ad_hoc filters is the work of in which a comparison between expression levels of exonic and intergenic_regions was used to find a threshold for detectable expression above background in various human and mouse_tissues where expression was estimated as reads per kilobase per_million rpkm the threshold of rpkm identified in this work has in turn been applied to several other studies e g canovas however to our knowledge although filters for read_counts are routinely used in practice little attention has been paid to the choice of the type of filter or threshold used or its impact on the downstream_analysis in this article we propose a novel data based procedure to choose an appropriate filtering threshold based on the calculation of a similarity_index among biological_replicates for read_counts arising from replicated high_throughput transcriptome sequencing_data this technique provides an intuitive datadriven way to filter rna_seq and to effectively remove genes with low constant expression levels our proposed filtering threshold may be useful in a variety of applications for rna_seq including differential_expression clustering and co expression analyses and network_inference in the following we apply the normalization approach proposed byfor mean and maximum based filters although other types of normalization may be appropriate for some data for gene by gene comparisons between two conditions we illustrate the use of the proposed filter in conjunction with the model proposed in the deseq bioconductor_package version which has been developed to model count_data with a small number of replicates in the presence of overdispersion p values are adjusted for multiple testing using the benjaminihochberg procedure to control the false_discovery we note that the filtering method proposed here may also be used in conjunction with other popular_methods e g edger see the supplementary_materials for additional discussion of the normalization and statistical_testing methods used in this work in practice there may be some question about the appropriate point in the analysis_pipeline to apply data filters should normalized data first be filtered then normalization factors re estimated and the model_fit i e mean and dispersion parameters estimated should normalization factors and model_parameters be estimated based on the full data and the data filtered only at the end of the analysis_pipeline the difference between the two options is non trivial particularly as the differential analysis approaches implemented in the deseq and edger packages both borrow information across genes whether all or only those passing the filter to obtain per gene parameter_estimates in this work we present results based on the application of filters applied as late in the pipeline as possible i e after library size and dispersion parameter_estimation a more detailed discussion of this issue is included in the supplementary_materials
