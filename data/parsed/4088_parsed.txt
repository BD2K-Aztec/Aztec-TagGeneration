rtfbsdb an integrated framework for transcription_factor analysis transcription_factors tfs regulate complex programs of gene_transcription by binding to short dna_sequence here we introduce rtfbsdb a unified_framework that integrates a database of more than tf_binding with tools to easily and efficiently scan target gen ome sequences rtfbsdb clusters motifs with similar dna_sequence specificities and integrates rna_seq or pro seq data to restrict analyses to motifs recognized by tfs expressed in the cell_type of interest our package allows common analyses to be performed rapidly in an integrated environment availability_and rtfbsdb available at https github com danko lab rtfbs db transcription_factors tfs regulate complex programs of gene_expression by modulating the rates of several steps early in transcription tfs bind degenerate dna_sequence typically bp located in regulatory_regions known as promoters enhancers and insulators identifying the coordinates of tf_binding within the genome is a crucial step in many genomic_analyses however motif_discovery is a challenging computational_problem owing to the short lengths and high degeneracy of tf_binding using experimentally_derived sources of tf_binding is one strategy to improve accuracy by constraining the motif_discovery problem to known binding sequences this strategy requires extensive knowledge about the dna_sequence specificities of tfs which have historically been time consuming to measure experimentally recently high_throughput experimental_approaches have allowed the systematic discovery of motifs for thousands of tfs moreover strategies to impute binding_motifs using tf amino_acid extend these resources to most species with a sequenced_genome these developments make the use of known tf_binding a powerful strategy in many common applications here we introduce rtfbsdb an open_source pipeline for transcription_factor tfbs identification and analysis which integrates experimentally_derived tf_binding data for thousands of tfs unlike other tfbs identification tools rtfbsdb integrates high_throughput measurements of gene_expression for tfs associated with each motif for downstream tfbs scanning and identification rtfbsdb uses the rtfbs package peterson et_al unpublished a highly_flexible and efficient implementation of many tfbs scanning tasks many common and complex analyses can be solved by rtfbsdb in as little as a single_line of r we demonstrate rtfbsdb using genomic_data from the encode_project
