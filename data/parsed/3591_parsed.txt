databases_and plio an ontology for formal description of protein_ligand motivation biomedical_ontologies have proved to be valuable tools for data analysis and data interoperability proteinligand_interactions are key_players in drug_discovery however existing public ontologies that describe the knowledge space of biomolecular_interactions do not cover all aspects relevant to pharmaceutical modelling and simulation results the proteinligand interaction ontology plio was developed around three main concepts namely target ligand and interaction and was enriched by adding synonyms useful annotations and references the quality of the ontology was assessed based on structural functional and usability features validation of the lexicalized ontology by means of natural_language nlp based_methods showed a satisfactory_performance f score through integration into our information_retrieval environment we can demonstrate that plio supports lexical search in pubmed_abstracts the usefulness of plio is demonstrated by two use case_scenarios and it is shown that plio is able to capture both confirmatory and new knowledge from simulation and empirical_studies availability the plio ontology is made freely_available to the public atbiological and medical ontologies are formal representations of biomedical knowledge they have been proved to be very useful for the communication of biomedical information through controlled_vocabularies definitions and proper metadata annotation numerous examples have demonstrated their value for data_mining and knowledgediscovery approaches ontologies have been used for automated reasoning for large_scale annotation of entire to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as genomes for data_mining in microarray_data for prediction of biomolecular_interactions and for semantic and ontological search in unstructured information_sources such as scientific text http www nlm nih gov mesh meshhome html the biological domain has developed a large portfolio of widely_accepted and widely used ontologies http www ebi ac uk ontology lookup including gene_ontology the sequence ontology and the microarray_gene database ontology in parallel the medical sector has generated its own portfolio with e g the foundational model of anatomy snomed systematized nomenclature of medicine and icd international statistical classification of diseases and related health_problems http www who int classifications icd en however relevant knowledge in the pharmaceutical sector has not yet been addressed by the public scientific_community some proprietary efforts to organize the knowledge relevant for pharma industry exist to our state of knowledge the biowisdom pharma ontology http www biowisdom com metawise is the only ontological resource representing a substantial part of the pharma world this proprietary ontology comprises substantial evidence extracted from literature and incorporates a broad_spectrum of public sources in fact a good part of the biowisdom ontology underlying their ontology framework is taken from public ontologies however these public ontologies are organized in a way that new options for ontology alignment and reasoning are created motivated by the publicprivate research_project neuroallianz a nationally funded project on joint academicindustrial drug_discovery in the area of dementia http www bmbf de en php we have started to develop an ontology representing knowledge about proteinligand_interactions with this article we present proteinligand interaction ontology plio plio is representing knowledge about the interaction of proteins and ligands including drugs and has a different scope and conceptual resolution than the molecular_interaction ontology an important feature of plio is that it links directly from an ontology framework describing proteinligand_interactions to the mathematical formulas relevant for the computation of some of the entities represented in the ontology to our knowledge this is the first example for an ontology which directly links from acurrently the existing ontologies e g smo mio and dio describe molecular_interactions at the complex macro scale level as a biological event but they do not address the fundamental physics behind an interaction occurring between a ligand and its target besides differences in scope between plio and the ontologies mentioned above the main difference lies in the characterization of interactions between target and ligand plio is a focused ontology in terms of representing proteinligand_interactions at the micro scale level e g electrostatic_interaction van_der and covalent_bonding explicitly representing the major known features involved in proteinligand_interactions from different points of view such as biophysics chemoinformatics molecular_modelling and experimental methodology for example the interaction concept in dio is represented as the event when ligand an effecter interacts with its biological target objects and triggers certain output biological event this biological event representation of interaction which is present in both dio and smo is another way to look at the physical_interactions between molecules however this kind of representation ignores intra_and molecular forces that govern the interactions in the design of plio special_attention has been paid to the usability profile of the ontology which addresses to what extent the set of annotations and metadata of the ontology contributes to its usability and application by end_users for this reason plio is distinct from other ontologies in providing extra mathematical and web hyperlink annotations so that quantitative concepts and parameters can be directly calculated online when integrated into our information_retrieval system plio leveraged the efficiency of semantic information_retrieval and knowledge representation by providing the possibility to perform ontological search in two directions in depth using concepts hierarchy and in breadth utilizing synonyms associated with each concept it not only detected the established knowledge but also allowed for gain of information which otherwise could not be explicitly detected this approach_enables users to exploit the added value of gained information for generation of novel hypotheses
