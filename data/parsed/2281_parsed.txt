structural_bioinformatics identification of cavities on protein surface using multiple computational_approaches for drug binding_site motivation proteinligand binding_sites are the active_sites on protein surface that perform protein functions thus the identification of those binding_sites is often the first step to study protein functions and structure_based there are many computational algorithms and tools developed in recent decades such as ligsite cs c pass q sitefinder surfnet and so on in our previous work metapocket we have proved that it is possible to combine the results of many methods together to improve the prediction result results here we continue our previous work by adding four more methods fpocket ghecom concavity and pocasa to further improve the prediction success_rate the new method metapocket and the individual approaches are all tested on two datasets of unbound bound and bound structures as used before the results show that the average success_rate has been raised at the top prediction compared with previous work moreover we construct a non redundant dataset of drugtarget complexes with known structure from drugbank drugport and pdb database and apply metapocket to this dataset to predict drug binding_sites as a result drug binding_sites on protein target are correctly_identified at the top prediction and it is better than the best individual approach availability the web_service of metapocket and all the test datasets are freely_available projects biotec tu dresden de metapocket and http sysbio proteins perform their biological_functions in biological_processes mainly by interacting with other molecules such as other proteins small_molecules dnas and rnas usually not all the residues on a protein surface participate in these interactions thus identification of these functional sites is of great_importance to understanding the function of a protein and the mechanism of the interactions in addition knowledge of these functional sites can be used to guide the mutagenesis experiments there exist a number of cavities or to whom correspondence should be addressed pockets on protein surface where small_molecules bind therefore identification of such cavities is often the starting_point in protein ligand_binding for protein_function and structure_based proper ligand_binding detection is a prerequisite for proteinligand docking and high_throughput virtual_screening to identify drug_candidates in drug_discovery processes many computational algorithms and tools have been developed in last two decades to identify pocket for proteinligand binding_site most of the existing_methods can be classified into two types geometry based and energy based the geometry based_methods can be further classified into grid based sphere based and shape based in the gridbased methods the protein_structure is projected into a d grid and the grid points are categorized into different types according to their positions related to the protein then the solvent grid points are clustered using some geometry attributes and those grid points near the pocket sites can be recognized ligsite ligsite cs pocketpicker ghecom and concavity are the representatives of this type of method in the sphere based_approaches the common strategy is to fulfill protein surface with spheres of different radius layer_by and a cutting method is applied during the fulfilling process the final pocket sites are those regions that are rich with fulfilled spheres this kind of methods include surfnet pass phecom and pocasa approaches based on shape theory include cast and fpocket cast computes the triangulations of the proteins surface_atoms and these triangulations are grouped by letting small_sized ones flow toward the neighboring larger one the pocket sites are the collection of empty triangles different from cast fpocket uses the idea of sphere which is a sphere contacting four atoms on its boundary and containing no inside atom the next step is to identify clusters of spheres close together and those clusters are potential pocket sites in comparison to geometry based method q sitefinder aims to find pocket sites by computing the interaction_energy between protein atoms and a small_molecule probe in q sitefinder layers of methyl ch probes are initialized on protein surface to calculate the van_der interaction_energy between the protein atoms and the probes then the probes are clustered into many groups and are ranked by the total_energy of probes those clusters with high_energy will be the potential ligand_binding sitehound hernandez is similar to q sitefinder but it includes lennard_jones and electrostatics energy_terms and uses different types of probes to calculate interaction_energy however it is difficult to compare their performance systematically because of different evaluation criteria and dataset being used in our previous work we compared ligsite cs sufnet pass and q sitefinder using the same dataset and criteria later on we combined these four methods and introduced a new consensus tool called metapocket to improve the prediction success_rate because there are many new tools developed recently we continued our work on metapocket by including four more free available tools fpocket ghecom concavity and pocasa these tools were chosen because they are freely_available either with source_code or executable binary in this work we improve the workflow and the way of mapping ligand_binding residues and propose a new dataset for drugtarget complexes the web_server design architecture is also improved as we developed a new on line visualization system we named the new version metapocket mpk in contrast to the old version of metapocket mpk we demonstrated that mpk performed better than mpk and each of the individual methods by extensive validation and comparison first we applied mpk to the original three datasets of bound unbound and bound complexes as we used before in our previous work we proved that mpk improved the success_rate up to than mpk second we built a novel dataset of drugtarget complexes and applied both mpk and mpk to this new dataset mpk also showed better performance than its previous version with an improvement of up to for the success prediction rate furthermore we compared mpk to each single method and showed that mpk achieved success_rate over the best single method although many computational_approaches have been developed to identify pocket for ligand_binding prediction there are a few methods that predict protein druggability how to discriminate druggable cavities from non druggable ones is still a challenge problem nayal and honig used the program screen to locate and analyze the surface cavities of a non redundant set of proteins co crystallized with drugs and they found that using cavity_size alone as a criterion predicted drug binding_sites with coverage with aid of random_forests and physicochemical structural and geometric features the prediction coverage was improved to in another recent work different pocket descriptors including pocket volume size solvent_accessible hydrophobicity score etc have been integrated as a drug score in the fpocket program package to score the druggability of cavities as shown in metapocket can detect about of the drug binding_sites at the top predictions using a simple scoring_function z_score in order to gain better druggability prediction_accuracy we are planning to develop new druggability prediction method which will consider many physicalchemical and structural sequence_features this is beyond the scope of this work and hence is not described here nevertheless we proposed a dataset of drugtarget complexes with available structures in this work which can be further used to evaluate new structure based drugability prediction_methods to make our tool available to the community we developed a new web_server for mpk with better design and software architecture in the new web_server eight single methods are called in parallel to reduce computational time each of eight single methods is treated as a plug in in mpk and thus it is easy to add other new predictors when available with this design pattern the new web_server is much more extensible than its previous version it is important to mention that some of the eight methods might fail to return any prediction results for some reasons this plug in pattern makes our server automatically detect the failed methods and the algorithm is only applied to those results from successful methods this feature makes mpk server more robust than mpk the users can provide a pdb id and a chain id or upload their own structures the server will output the prediction results from eight single methods and the meta pocket sites of mpk based on those results the predicted pocket sites and those surrounding residues can be downloaded as standard pdb files or directly be visualized in the server based on jmol http www jmol org plug in it only takes about s to min to finish pocket identification depending on the size of protein we envisage that our web_server will become an all in one tool for proteinligand binding_site to the community and provide useful guide to structure based functional_annotation site_directed experiments proteinligand docking and large_scale virtual_screening
