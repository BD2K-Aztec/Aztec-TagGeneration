civi circular genome visualization with unique features to analyze sequence_elements we have developed civi a user_friendly web_based to create custom circular maps to aid the analysis of microbial_genomes and sequence_elements sequence related data such as gene name cog class pfam_domain gc and subcellular_location can be comprehensively viewed quantitative gene related data e g expression ratios or read_counts as well as predicted sequence_elements e g regulatory_sequences can be uploaded and visualized civi accommodates the analysis of genomic_elements by allowing a visual interpretation in the context of i their genome wide_distribution ii provided experimental_data and iii the local orientation and location with respect to neighboring genes civi thus enables both experts and non experts to conveniently integrate public genome data with the results of genome analyses in circular genome maps suitable for publication circular genome representations provide an excellent way to comprehensively inspect genome_wide data various tools have been developed to generate these circular visualizations including cgview genomevx genewiz and dnaplotter tools such as brig cgview comparison tool circos and circleator can also visualize genome comparisons and in some cases visualize links between genome_sequence and other types of information the tools described above are well suited for the visualization of high_throughput like sequence_similarities or read_counts but have limited functionality in relation to smaller_scale activities such as reconstructing transcription networks and finding gene_functions associated to genetic_elements moreover with the exception of genewiz they require laborious and sometimes complex uploads of genome and annotation data in we published mgcv a linear genomic_context visualization_tool tailored to provide a simple and quick visual access to the publicly_available genomic_data from ncbi the tool incorporated the capabilities of the earlier mgv and extended the visualization with data export options to advance the gene specific analysis of microbial_genomes we now present civi which has been developed using the same philosophy to extend the circular viewing options provided by the original mgv the extensions include the possibility to display annotation data like cog category pfam_domain or subcellular_location directly on the genome map and to reveal the position of selected annotations through a keyword_search option civi also enables theupload and visualization of custom data such as the positions of genomic_elements and the export of associated data the latter include the function_annotations and or sequences of neighboring genes as well as information on the distance distribution of the elements with respect to the genes the resulting circular maps can be edited and the pictures exported in svg png and pdf format finally civi offers a completely new interface and back end with enhanced usability interactivity via mouse over and speed civi is a versatile and easy to use web_application to create custom circular genome maps it provides a visual integration of publicly_available genomic_data and additional provided data the latter including e g gene_expression data and genomic_elements the functional analysis of latter elements is aided by the characterization of their genomic_context a feature that is unique to civi shows that the former genome contains a region that seems to have been inserted indicated by orange box and which is clearly associated with a deviating gc percentage th ring in bacillus_species carbohydrate uptake and metabolism is governed by a phenomenon called carbon catabolite_repression which is mediated by ccpa ccpa binds to a characteristic dna operator sequence called cre located just upstream of the regulated gene s variability between the operator sequences was assumed to cause a variability in the response depending on the level of repression the postulated operator dependent_variable response was tested_experimentally and confirmed all of the characteristic properties of ccpa mediated regulation are apparent in an integrative visualization of the transcription_factor predictions th and th ring gene_expression data th and th ring and the gene_annotation cog category carbohydrate transport and metabolism th ring b the provided analysis of the genomic_context of the predicted ccpa binding_sites confirms the validity of the input motif as it is mainly found upstream of genes and close to the translation start
