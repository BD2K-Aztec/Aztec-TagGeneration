genetics_and a bayesian_approach using covariance of single_nucleotide data to detect differences in linkage_disequilibrium patterns between groups of individuals motivation quantifying differences in linkage_disequilibrium ld between subgroups can highlight genetic regions or sites under selection and or associated with disease and may have utility in trans ethnic mapping studies results we present a novel pseudo bayes_factor pbf approach that assess differences in covariance of genotype_frequencies from single_nucleotide snp data from a genome_wide study the magnitude of the pbf reflects the strength of evidence for a difference while accounting for the sample_size and number of snps without the requirement for permutation_testing to establish statistical_significance application of the pbf to hapmap and gambian malaria snp data reveals regional ld differences some known to be under selection availability_and the pbf approach has been implemented in the bald bayesian_analysis of ld differences c software and is available from http homepages lshtm ac uk tgclark downloads contact comparing linkage_disequilibrium ld patterns between groups such as cases and controls or sub populations can provide an insight into genetic regions under selection and or association with disease in fact comparisons between different ethnic_groups may be used to calibrate the resolution of association using trans ethnic mapping as well as indicate the appropriateness of genotypic imputation using sequence_data from a reference hapmap panel a number of approaches have been suggested for quantifying ld differences haplotype_sharing methods te meerman and van_der are usually applied in a casecontrol setting where it is assumed that pairs of cases would tend to be more closely_related than pairs of controls while casecontrol pairs would be even more distantly_related on average such approaches isolate regions of interest using pairwise_comparisons of lengths of haplotype_sharing to whom correspondence should be addressed they can be generalized to compare different sub populations and use u statistics and permutations to determine statistical_significance other methods compare the matrices of pairwise ld metrics e g r and d of different sub populations in particular they calculate differences in the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and perform permutations to determine statistical_significance thresholds here we present an alternative approach that does not require permutations and is based on analysis of covariance of genotype_frequencies we propose a bayes_factor statistic that quantifies the degree to which covariance_matrices from sub populations are different we compare our method with an eigenvalue difference evd approach and apply it to data from the hapmap and a subset of controls from a genome_wide gwas of malaria in a gambian population the pbf metric is a potentially robust and flexible measure to quantify differences in ld between sub groups which does not require time consuming permutation approaches to infer statistical_significance moreover being bayesian it readily allows for the incorporation of prior information such as knowledge of candidate_regions of selection depending on the sub groups of interest regional differences in ld may be indicative of selection recombination and or phenotypic_variation the magnitude of the pbf reflects the difference in the covariances of genotype_frequencies accounting explicitly for the number of samples and snps contributing the assumption of gaussian allele counts is more likely to hold in non ascertained polymorphisms and large_numbers of snps but our simulation and real_data results suggest that method may be robust to deviations if another distribution is considered more suitable for allele counts or non conjugate priors adopted then it may be possible to obtain the posterior_distribution and perform inference using markov_chain bayes_factors can be estimated in such settings see for an example usually at greater computational expense a number of other non bayesian approaches to compare covariance_matrices could be considered as alternatives some robust to missing_data evd based_methods are easy to calculate impose few assumptions and it is possible to take advantage of known distributional properties associated with eigenvalues in addition it is possible to extend evd approaches to a bayesian setting facilitating full probabilistic_inference in conclusion we present a new approach for quantifying ld differences in genomewide studies which may have potential utility in a trans ethnic fine_mapping setting
