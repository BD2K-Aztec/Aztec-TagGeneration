jspeciesws a web_server for prokaryotic species circumscription based on pairwise genome comparison jspecies web_server jspeciesws is a user_friendly online service for in silico calculating the extent of identity between two genomes a parameter routinely used in the process of poly phasic microbial_species circumscription the service measures the average nucleotide_identity ani based on blast anib and mummer anim as well as correlation indexes of tetra nucleotide signatures tetra in addition it provides a tetra correlation search function which allows to rapidly compare selected genomes against a continuously updated reference_database with currently about published whole and draft_genome for comparison own genomes can be uploaded and references can be selected from the jspeciesws reference_database the service indicates whether two genomes share genomic identities above or below the species embracing thresholds and serves as a fast way to allocate unknown genomes in the frame of the hitherto sequenced species availability_and jspeciesws is available atdna dna_hybridization ddh measures the degree of genomic similarity between two pools of dna_molecules despite that distinct ddh determination methods frequently lead to different results since nearly years it is considered as the gold_standard for species delineation rossell o m ora and in times of cost efficient sequencing with scientists having easy access to thousands of publicly_available genome_sequences the species delineation based on user_friendly computational pairwise genome comparisons to determine overall genome relatedness indices has emerged this approach has already been widely_accepted by the scientific_community and specialized tools like the stand alone software jspecies richter and rossell o m ora or similar solutions have proven to provide valuable ogri results here we present the jspecies web_server jspeciesws a webbased implementation of the core_features of the original jspecies software for easy user access and extended functionality it represents the latest development of jspecies in terms of usability recent_studies that electronic in silico pairwise ogri can replace standard_laboratory based ddh in order to simplify and at the same time substantiate this central aspect of prokaryotic species delineation in addition ogri allows taxonomists to quickly verify the species affiliation of any public genome_sequence and to identify wrongly annotated submissions jspeciesws will help to further propagate this approach by providing fast and easy access to the corresponding analyses and a comprehensive genomes reference_database
