motif em an automated computational_tool for identifying conserved_regions in cryoem structures we present a new first of its kind fully_automated computational_tool motif em for identifying regions or domains or motifs in cryoem maps of large macromolecular assemblies such as chaperonins viruses etc that remain conformationally conserved as a by product regions in structures that are not conserved are revealed this can indicate local molecular flexibility related to biological_activity motif em takes cryoem volumetric maps as inputs the technique used by motif em to detect conserved sub structures is inspired by a recent breakthrough in d object_recognition the technique works by constructing rotationally invariant low_dimensional representations of local_regions in the input cryoem maps correspondences are established between the reduced representations by comparing them using a simple metric across the input maps the correspondences are clustered using hash tables and graph_theory is used to retrieve conserved structural_domains or motifs motif em has been used to extract conserved domains occurring in large macromolecular assembly maps including as those of viruses p and epsilon ribosome s groel that remain structurally_conserved in different functional_states our method can also been used to build atomic_models for some maps we also used motif em to identify the conserved folds shared among dsdna bacteriophages hk epsilon and though they have low_sequence the key_processes in a cell the fundamental building_block of life are carried_out or at least influenced by large macromolecular assemblies lmas such as ribosomes and chaperonins understanding their structures and interactions is needed for understanding their mechanisms and hence essential for a complete understanding of life processes at the molecular level a major development over the last years has been the success of cryoem in the very challenging_task of determining and understanding the structures of lmas often in the molecular mass_range million da cryoem has emerged as a method distinctly more suited for determining and understanding structures of lmas in under near native conditions and inferring conformation flexibility by capturing snapshots of dynamic_processes associated with their working to whom correspondence should be addressed mechanisms with recent automation advances cryoem structures of large assemblies can be obtained at subnanometer resolution within few days of work structural_comparison is a critical step in structural_biology research using cryoem for instance in order to derive the functional mechanism of a newly determined structure it is often compared with structures for instance same molecule in different functional_states already determined and studied by x_ray or cryoem in this article we present a new fully_automated first of its kind computational_tool motif em which is meant to solve an important structural_comparison problem p p is defined as follows compare a non atomic_resolution structure i e a cryoem map from emdb with another structure either another cryoem map or a map blurred from a crystal_structure and identify_conserved structural_domains or motifs or sub map if there is any between the pair of input structures the by product of solving p is revelation of the regions in the input pair which are not conserved between them these non conserved_regions can point to local molecular flexibility related to biological_activity if the input pair are same molecule in two different functional_states for instance two cryoem maps of ribosome s are shown_inand b solving p with these two maps as input means detecting the location and shape or domain boundary of the two domains s and s shown as yellow and blue regions respectively inand d that are known to be structurally_conserved between the two maps the by product of solving p for this pair of s is the revelation of the regions which are notconserved or flexible between the input structure pair i e the red regions as detected by motif em inand d this region has been implicated with ef g binding and and trna locomotion prior to motif em there was no direct and fully_automated way of solving p without substantial prior_knowledge unavailable at times such as the occurrence of the common conserved subregion in the two input maps as a high_resolution structural homolog in some domain databank such as scop see section for more details structural_comparison tools like motif em are useful as conserved_motifs or domains can point to conserved active_sites indicating function sharing evolutionary_relationships or drug binding targets for therapies the remaining non conserved_regions in the input structure pair revealed as by product can point to local molecular flexibility related to biological_activity motifem is expected to work with cryoem maps upto the resolution when structural_domains and assembly components in the maps remain detectable which is typically believed to be or betterpage i i i now we report the outcome of applying motif em on some instances of p motif em was run on a ghz cpu cluster located at stanford university http biox stanford edu motifem took upto min on the cluster to generate the outcomes the same implementation of motif em is available for download and use at http ai stanford edu mitul motifem the images of structures shown were generated using ucsf chimera package from the resource for biocomputation visualization and informatics at the university of california san_francisco for cryoem maps surface representation was used we have described a new first of its kind computational_tool motif em that can identify structural_motifs or domains that are conserved between a pair of cryoem maps as a by product regions that are not conserved are also revealed such a tool is useful as conserved structural entities can point to conserved active sitesindicating common function evolutionary links and drug binding targets for therapies the non conserved_regions revealed as by product can point to local molecular flexibility related to biological_activity apart from breaking an input map pair into conserved and non conserved_regions motif em can i dock existing atomic_resolution domains into cryo_em maps ii propose atomic_resolution models for some cryoem maps and iii compare maps with conserved structures but little sequence_similarity the distinct advantage of using motif em is that it enables the users to directly and automatically compare and analyze two cryoem structures otherwise the conventional way has been indirect comparison via docked structural homologs or backbone traced models both not always available which can introduce errors from imperfect docking and modeling into the structural analysis overall this required significant manual intervention in the future we would like to do structure comparisons using motif em on a much larger scale such as comparing a given cryoem map with all the available structures in various databanks such as ebi cryoem and pdb databanks and detecting previously_unknown links between the cryoem map and all other known structures
