cgat computational genomics analysis toolkit computational genomics seeks to draw biological inferences from genomic_datasets often by integrating and contextualizing next_generation data cgat provides an extensive suite of tools designed to assist in the analysis of genome_scale from a range of standard file_formats the toolkit enables filtering comparison conversion summarization and annotation of genomic_intervals gene_sets and sequences the tools can both be run from the unix command_line and installed into visual workflow builders such as galaxy availability the toolkit is freely_available froma central task in computational genomics is to extract biologically_meaningful summaries and annotations from short_read to facilitate both visualization and statistical_analysis commonly this process starts by mapping next_generation ngs_reads and quantitating their distribution in genomic_features such as transcripts with expression_level and transcription_factor with peak scores this initial contextualization phase is well supported by specialized tools such as tophat cufflinks or macs in a second phase datasets are typically integrated to allow interpretation asking for example how many transcription_factor are associated with each of exonic intronic flanking and intergenic genomic_annotations this phase necessarily relies on computational_tools that can describe integrate and summarize a variety of feature files produced from the initial phase and external annotation sources here we introduce a collection of tools that assist genomic scientists in successfully performing this crucial data_integration and interpretation phase bridging the gap from raw_data to biologically interpretable results we have made extensive use of these tools in a number of ngs projects
