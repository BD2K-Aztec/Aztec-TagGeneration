a graph_kernel approach for alignment_free domain peptide interaction prediction with an application to human sh_domains motivation state of the art experimental_data for determining binding_specificities of peptide recognition modules prms is obtained by high_throughput like peptide arrays most prediction_tools applicable to this kind of data are based on an initial multiple_alignment of the peptide ligands building an initial alignment can be error_prone especially in the case of the proline_rich peptides bound by the sh_domains results here we present a machine_learning approach based on an efficient graph_kernel technique to predict the specificity of a large set of human sh_domains which are an important class of prms the graph_kernel strategy allows us to i integrate several types of phy sico chemical_information for each amino_acid ii consider high order correlations between these features and iii eliminate the need for an initial peptide alignment we build specialized models for each human sh_domain and achieve competitive predictive_performance of area under precision_recall curve compared with area under precision_recall curve for state of the art methods based on position_weight we show that better models can be obtained when we use information on the noninteracting peptides negative_examples which is currently not used by the state of the art approaches based on position_weight to this end we analyze two strategies to identify subsets of high_confidence negative data the techniques introduced here are more general and hence can also be used for any other protein_domains which interact with short pep tides i e other prms availability the program with the predictive_models can be found at http www bioinf uni freiburg de software sh pepint sh pepint tar gz we also provide a genome_wide prediction for all human sh_domains which can be found undersh domains are an important class of peptide recognition module and probably the most widespread protein domain found in protein databases thus sh_domains are involved in many cellular_processes such as signaling cell communication growth and differentiation furthermore the sh complexity corresponds with the complexity of the genome these domains specifically recognize short_linear proline_rich peptide_sequences sh_domains have a conserved barrel fold which is formed by five or six strands arranged in two anti_parallel sheets sh_domains are amino_acids in length and mainly found in intra cellular_proteins approximately sh_domains are known in the human_proteome as of human proteins contain proline_rich regions and sh_domains recognize proline_rich peptides it is an open challenge to understand how the hundreds of sh_domains achieve a high_specificity in selecting their physiological partners to regulate specific_biological the canonical proline_rich peptide motifs recognized by most of the human sh_domains have a pxxp core and are classified in two major groups class_i the consensus_sequences for these two groups are denoted as xpxp class i and pxpx class_ii where x represents any naturally_occurring amino_acid represents a hydrophobic amino_acid and represents as a positively_charged amino_acid normally arginine and lysine structural studies of the sh peptide_complexes with class_i motif suggest that these two types of peptide ligands bind to an sh_domains in opposite orientations previous_studies reveled that the positively_charged in the peptide_sequence such as arginine and lysine play_an in the binding with the respective sh_domain based on the characteristics of the binding_site the sh_domains prefer either one or the other pepitde motif peptide motifs can be further classified into subgroups depending on the tolerance for the substitution of the lysine_residue with the arginine_residue although most human sh_domains bind with class i and or class_ii motifs a subset of sh_domains have the ability to recognize noncanonical or atypical peptide motifs for example nck sh_domains and the sh_domains from eps family are able to bind with a pxxdy motif eps and its sh_domain have an important role in mitogenetic signaling overexpression of eps increased epidermal growth_factor transformation and mitogenic responsiveness to epidermal_growth to whom correspondence should be addressed sh_domain is probably the most widespread class of protein recognition modules the interactions mediated by sh_domains precision_recall curves and auc roc_curves for the multi domain gaussian graph_kernel md g gk the single domain gaussian graph_kernel sd g gk the single domain linear graph_kernel gk and the musi tool for six related sh_domains the error_bars represent respective standard_deviation alignment_free domainpeptide interaction prediction i constitute an important class of protein interactions involved in many cellular_process we presented a computational_approach to predict domainpeptide interactions using available highthroughput data the method is an alignment_free approach based on an efficient graph_kernel although here we present an application to sh_domains the method is general and can thus be trained to predict any proteinpeptide interaction for which high_throughput data exists current methods for proteinpeptide interaction require often an initial multiple_alignment of the bound peptides as this is an error_prone process especially in the case of sh_domains where peptides are proline_rich one risks to introduce a significant amount of noise and obtain under performing models in addition current methods are often linear_models e g pwms and are therefore not able to represent high order correlations between amino_acid nonlinear method exist but have to deal with the high model_complexity resulting from exponential number of high order correlations achievable even for relatively short peptide_sequences if one uses the full alphabet of amino_acids it becomes hard to gain sufficient data for a correct estimation of these complex models one common solution is to use a reduced alphabet where each letter represents an entire amino_acid class this strategy however leads to inferior performance especially when specific amino_acids are preferred at specific positions an alternative approach is to determine important interaction first by using resolved d domainpeptide structures the major_obstacle for the widespread application of this approach however is the limited availability of such structural data in this article we use a different approach we consider an alignment_free approach based on a graph_representation of the peptide_sequence where different abstraction levels are available in a unified way by applying an efficient graph_kernel method we were able to model high order correlations that span different abstraction levels e g a feature could represent a specific residue that has to be three positions to the right of a hydrophobic residue the regularization provided by the svm optimization scheme finally ensures that the model_complexity is appropriately controlled and that only the features relevant for the task at hand are selected discarding the abstraction information experiments not shown i e using only the amino_acid code information leads to statistically significantly_lower sensitivity this confirms the intuition that using physico_chemical in the feature definition can adequately model cases that would otherwise be poorly covered by a sufficient number of sequences it was also important to optimize the encoding order therefore we performed an experiment with different encoding order and proposed the best order to represent our graph see supplementary interestingly the experimentally crossvalidated optimal parameters value r d suggests that high order amino_acid correlations are required to obtain the best predictive_performance and that therefore linear_models are inadequate although we have previously used the nspdk graph_kernel approach for clustering rna_structures here differently from the rna or molecular case we do not have an obvious and natural way to encode information as a graph the guiding principle behind the choice of the proposed feature encoding is to add abstract information like charge or hydrophobicity in a somewhat soft and incremental way rather than using an extended alphabet and maintaining a sequence_encoding the proposed graph encoding allows us to obtain features that are increasingly specialized we have experimental_evidence see supplementary that a different choice in the ordering of the abstract information would yield suboptimal results which become evident in the presence of imbalanced data additionally we have investigated the performance of a string kernel the k_mer kernel along with other types of kernels applied to the pure amino_acid i e without any additional information also in this case there is an evident drop in performance see section comparison with other predictive methods and supplementaryin the supplementary_information this confirms the intuition that using physico_chemical in the feature definition can adequately model cases that would otherwise be poorly covered by a sufficient number of sequences interestingly we experimentally_observed that highorder amino_acid correlations are required to obtain the best predictive_performance suggesting that linear_models are inadequate for this application another common practice is to use generative_models i e models that try to capture the density_distribution of the interacting peptides only we showed that using one class approaches is sub optimal even when considering models more expressive than the commonly used linear pwms the average predictive_performance of a graph kernel_based domain specific model that is trained in a discriminative fashion is auc pr compared with auc pr when trained in a one class way we tried to address the problem of selecting high_quality negative data the issue is known in literature see ben in the application domain of proteinpeptide interaction it has been shown that the common practice of generating negative instances by randomly shuffling peptide_sequences simply leads to decreased predicted performance as these instances do not resemble real biological_sequences and are not therefore useful to determine useful class boundaries we note however decreasing performance proportional to the level of class imbalance when the ratio of negative instances versus positive ones is within fold we maintain an auc pr but for ratios greater than performance drops to auc pr and lower see supplementary figs s and s we showed how the flexible graph_kernel approach allows the induction of multi domain models these models can leverage experimentally_verified binding_interactions on related domains and achieve high predictive_performance even on domains for which no training material was available finally we performed a genome_wide prediction of human sh peptide interactions all the learned models as well as all the genome_wide prediction interactions are available in http www bioinf uni freiburg de software sh pepint our approach is general enough and can easily be applicable to other similar domains like sh pdz and so forth as for future work given the computational_efficiency of these models a single domain model can be trained on k sequences in h we plan to provide a comprehensive set of predictors for all protein_domains for which high_throughput data are available
