gene_expression deriving transcriptional_programs and functional processes from gene_expression databases motivation a system wide approach to revealing the underlying molecular state of a cell is a long_standing biological challenge developed over the last decade gene_expression possess the characteristics of such an assay they have the capacity to reveal both underlying molecular_events as well as broader phenotypes such as clinical_outcomes to interpret these profiles many gene_sets have been developed that characterize biological_processes however the full potential of these gene_sets has not yet been achieved since the advent of gene_expression databases many have posited that they can reveal properties of activities that are not evident from individual_datasets analogous to how the expression of a single gene generally cannot reveal the activation of a biological_process results to address_this we have developed a high_throughput method to mine gene_expression databases for the regulation of gene_sets given a set of genes we scored it against each gene_expression dataset by looking for enrichment of co regulated_genes relative to an empirical null_distribution after validating the method we applied it to address two biological_problems first we deciphered the e f transcriptional_network we confirmed that true transcriptional_targets exhibit a distinct regulatory profile across a database second we leveraged the patterns of regulation across a database of gene_sets to produce an automatically generated catalog of biological_processes these demonstrations revealed the power of a global analysis of the data contained within gene_expression databases and the potential for using them to address biological_questions contact the state of a cell is reflected in its transcriptional_profile both molecular_events such as the activation of a cell_surface loss of function of a tumor_suppressor or initiation of the cell_cycle and functional_attributes sensitivity to therapeutics or propensity to metastasize are evident in gene_expression they can be measured on a dna to whom correspondence should be addressed microarray and recognized by computational algorithms because such a diverse range of molecular activities can be identified from the same gene_expression we argue that gene_expression contains the complete or nearly complete compendium of the underlying cellular_activities in other words a gene_expression embodies the state of a cell currently a major_challenge is to interpret gene_expression a common approach is to construct narratives based on the functions of the genes showing changes in gene_expression this is made difficult however by a limited understanding of what the genes do compounded by pleiotropy in gene function one solution to these problems is to consider that biological_processes are brought about by the activation of many genes thus taking_into the co_ordinated activities of sets of genes yields insight into processes that are not evident from the expression of single genes to capitalize on this idea many have generated gene_expression that evince a biological_activity although signatures can take different forms the vast_majority consists simply of lists of genes that are involved in biological_processes this type of signature is also called a gene_set and msigdb is the largest database to predict the activation of signatures from gene_expression many computational algorithms have been developed while these algorithms operate on single datasets many have anticipated methods that can tap into gene_expression databases ever since their development a decade_ago the expectation was that such resources contain rich biological phenotypes that could be mined for value to do this a wealth of approaches have been developed that can search gene_expression databases based on associated metadata but there are fewer options for searching the gene_expression themselves to date there have been two systems the first spell was developed to predict gene_ontology go terms for yeast genes based on patterns seen across a gene_expression database although it does score the datasets the focus is on the annotation of single genes and it does not provide a statistical_significance a more recently_developed algorithm does provide the significance but requires as input a weighted list of genes and thus cannot be applied to gene_sets which are unweighted therefore there is not yet an ability to fully capitalize on the data within gene_expression databases to address the need for a method to mine gene_expression databases we have developed a novel approach to identify the
