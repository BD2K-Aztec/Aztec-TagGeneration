genetics_and assessing multivariate gene metabolome associations with rare_variants using bayesian reduced rank regression motivation a typical genome_wide searches for associations between single_nucleotide snps and a univariate phenotype however there is a growing interest to investigate associations between genomics data and multivariate phenotypes for example in gene_expression or metabolomics_studies a common approach is to perform a univariate test between each geno typephenotype pair and then to apply a stringent significance cutoff to account for the large number of tests performed however this approach has limited ability to uncover dependencies involving multiple variables another trend in the current genetics is the investigation of the impact of rare_variants on the phenotype where the standard methods often fail owing to lack of power when the minor_allele is present in only a limited number of individuals results we propose a new statistical_approach based on bayesian reduced rank regression to assess the impact of multiple_snps on a high_dimensional phenotype because of the methods ability to combine_information over multiple_snps and phenotypes it is particularly suitable for detecting associations involving rare_variants we demonstrate the potential of our method and compare it with alternatives using the northern_finland with individuals for whom genome_wide snp data along with lipoprotein profiles comprising traits are available we discovered two genes xrcc andconcentrations of human metabolites are associated with risk of many common diseases for example low and high_density ldl and hdl_levels are associated with coronary_artery for this reason human_metabolism has been under intensive investigation and over the past_few several

example a large meta_analysis identified loci influencing the levels of total_cholesterol ldl hdl and triglycerides more recent_studies used finer subclassifications of metabolites and discovered dozens of novel loci despite these advances the variance explained by all reported single_nucleotide snps falls far below the suggested heritability of the common metabolites as estimated either from twin_studies or from more distantly_related individuals this motivates us to develop new approaches for association testing that could better use all information available to us the present day cohort_studies often come with a rich set of phenotypic_features examples in addition to metabolomics include studies of gene_expression and d facial imaging as a consequence we need statistical_methods that increase the power to uncover genotypephenotype dependencies by combining information over several related_phenotypes the underlying idea is that if a genetic_variant affects a trait then it is likely to affect other traits that are related to the first one and by testing for association with the two traits jointly power may be increased this reasoning can be taken a step further by testing all traits in high_dimensional omics_data simultaneously for example all metabolites in comprehensive metabolomic_profiles a comparison of different statistical_methods available for joint testing of complete metabolomics profiles was recently conducted besides testing several phenotypes simultaneously the ability to detect certain kinds of associations may be boosted by combining statistical_evidence over several snps usually this is done in a supervised manner such that snps related by location or function for example are tested_simultaneously combining information over multiple_snps is particularly crucial with rare_variants i e snps where the minor_allele is present in a small proportion of the population testing such snps individually is unlikely to yield significant findings because of limited_power most approaches for handling rare_variants are based on collapsing several rare snps into a single variable for example one can simply collapse several rare_variants into a single indicator telling whether any of the rare_variants is present in the individual or to count the number of rare_variants present in the individual the problem with the collapsing methods is the implicit assumption that the effects are in the same or a predefined direction a more sophisticated variance_component method avoiding this assumption is able to investigate the impact of several rare_variants on a univariate trait even if there exists a large number of methods for analyzing rare_variants none of those has been tailored for multivariate phenotypes on the other hand standard methods for multivariate phenotypes have not been thoroughly investigated in the context of rare_variants and we will see later in the text that severe overfitting may occur in summary methods for dealing with rare_variants in the context of multivariate phenotypes are clearly lacking in this article we derive a novel formulation of the bayesian reduced rank regression_model to detect multivariate associations between predefined groups of snps and a high_dimensional phenotype in particular our approach is suitable for analyzing both common and rare_variants our formulation incorporates prior_knowledge about effect_sizes to increase the power to detect associations furthermore it is capable of correcting for the number of snps considered which is important when testing a large number of snp groups of different sizes we validate our method by assessing associations between snps in all human genes one gene at a time and metabolic_profiles comprising fine_scale lipoprotein measurements for individuals from the northern_finland among the top scoring genes without known associations to the traits studied two genes xrcc and mthfd l replicated in a combined analysis of individuals from the cardiovascular_risk in young finns study yfs and individuals from the finrisk study additional_analyses of the same data confirmed that alternative_methods discovered only one of these associations and did not identify any further associations that were not known before we have presented a new statistical_method for investigating associations in genome_wide gwas datasets with multivariate phenotypes the method can combine_information over multiple_snps making it particularly suitable for studying rare_variants in the high_dimensional phenotype setting for this setup no methods known to the authors have beennote the table shows the numbers of gene metabolome associations that had false_discovery below the specified threshold the last column shows the number of putative novel associations within genes with fdr after removing the known associations as described in the main text presented before our method is based on estimating the proportion of total_variance of the phenotypes that is explained by the snps under consideration for this purpose we have derived a bayesian formulation of the reduced rank regression_model which enables us to incorporate our knowledge of the expected effects sizes in the analysis we used the new method to analyze a real gwas dataset with a multivariate lipoprotein phenotype two novel loci not previously associated with the phenotype were discovered and replicated in an analysis combining two additional datasets furthermore two more loci were found that replicated significantly in one but not in the other test_dataset possible reasons for the lack of success in replicating the findings in both the datasets include the following i the associations were false_positive in the first place ii the associations involved rare_variants that were not present in sufficient numbers to see the effects iii the imputation_accuracy of the rare_variants was not sufficient in all datasets iv the phenotype data although preprocessed in exactly the same way with all the datasets have not been fully equivalent for example the scaling of the phenotypes during preprocessing has been done using factors not exactly equal and the parameters learned in one data may thus not represent the effects adequately in another data only further studies will help to distinguish between the alternative_explanations for doing inference with the model the current_implementation uses mcmc sampling the computation time of which is approximately half an hour per gene on a ghz processor thus analyzing all human genes requires a cluster computer to parallelize the computations over the genes analytical approximations such as the variational or laplace approximations e g could be used to speed up the computations and based on our experiments with the current method are worth doing in the future alternative ways to use the model might also be considered for example focusing the analysis on variants with a predicted function could improve power to detect associations and lessen the computational_burden as another example we have used as the threshold for defining the rare_variants when computing their impact on the phenotypes results based on different thresholds could readily be extracted from the output of a single mcmc run and are likely to highlight different sets of genes
