mcast scanning for cis_regulatory motif clusters precise regulatory_control of genes particularly in eukaryotes frequently requires the joint action of multiple sequence specific transcription_factors a cis_regulatory module crm is a genomic locus that is responsible for gene_regulation and that contains multiple transcription_factor in close_proximity given a collection of known transcription_factor many bioinformatics_methods have been proposed over the past_years for identifying within a genomic_sequence candidate crms consisting of clusters of those motifs results the mcast algorithm uses a hidden_markov with a p value based scoring_scheme to identify candidate crms here we introduce a new version of mcast that offers improved graphical output a dynamic background model statistical confidence estimates based on false_discovery estimation and most significantly the ability to predict crms while taking_into epigenomic data such as dnase_i sensitivity or histone_modification data we demonstrate the validity of mcasts statistical confidence estimates and the utility of epigenomic priors in identifying crms availability_and mcast is part of the meme suite software toolkit a web_server and source_code are available ateukaryotic gene_regulation is carried_out by a variety of mechanisms involving transcription_factors micrornas dna_methylation nucleosome_occupancy and local as well as large_scale chromatin_structure the relative importance of these various mechanisms is subject to debate however the joint influence of multiple transcription_factors on gene_regulation is clearly an important component of the eukaryotic gene regulatory system in practice a single transcription_factor is neither specific enough nor binds strongly enough to achieve and maintain access to the genomic_dna consequently most regulatory loci contain binding_sites for multiple factors that act in concert to upregulate or downregulate one or more target_genes such sites are known as cis_regulatory crms an important and well studied problem in computational_biology is the crm scanning problem the input to this task is a collection of transcription_factor plus a set of dna_sequences the latter may comprise a complete genome or a set of regions of interest such as upstream regions of annotated_genes the crm scanning algorithm searches for clusters of occurrences of the given motifs hence the output is a collection of candidate crms along with annotations indicating which motifs occur within each one the first crm scanning algorithm was lra since its introduction numerous other algorithmshave been described in the literature some with accompanying software and web_servers see supplementary_materials for a review of existing_methods some of these methods_employ a sliding_window approach whereas others use probabilistic_models such as hidden_markov here we introduce an improved implementation of the mcast algorithm mcast uses a motif based hidden_markov to scan for clusters of motifs its key features include a scoring_scheme based on p values and a method for calibrating the resulting scores to obtain statistical confidence estimates we have recently improved mcast in four ways first we have dramatically improved the graphical output produced by the tool supplementary the new output provides a schematic view showing the relative_position and statistical_significance of the motif occurrences in the crm the schematic view can be expanded into a detailed view displaying any region of the crm at the nucleotide level and the region of the crm displayed in the detailed view may be chosen interactively second to reduce false_positives due to unusual local base content we have added a dynamic background model selected based on the local gc_content around the current position in the genome third we have improved the multiple_testing methodology replacing the bonferroni adjustment with a false_discovery fdr_estimation procedure this change employs a reservoir sampling scheme to allow mcast to accurately estimate the percentage of motif scores drawn according to the null_hypothesis without running out of memory when scanning a large genome with many motifs fourth and most significantly to improve accuracy we have incorporated into mcast a method for converting epigenomic datadnase i sensitivity or histone_modification data from chip_seq experimentsinto a probabilistic prior we demonstrate that mcast provides state of the art discrimination power and that the incorporation of a dnase_i sensitivity prior significantly_improves its performance
