structural_bioinformatics e drug d d structure collections dedicated to drug_repurposing and fragment_based motivation in the drug_discovery field new uses for old drugs selective optimization of side activities and fragment_based fbdd have proved to be successful alternatives to high_throughput e drug d is a database of d chemical_structures of drugs that provides several collections of ready to screen sd files of drugs and commercial drug fragments they are natural inputs in studies dedicated to drug_repurposing and fbdd availability e drug d collections are freely_available chemoinfo ipmc cnrs fr e drug d html either for download or for direct in silico web_based screenings approved drugs represent very attractive and valuable starting_point for drug_discovery studies of drugs entering the market show that most of their drug progenitors or lead structures were known drugs or clinical candidates the rationale is that a drug usually acts on more than one target and may exhibit previously unknown_functions due to promiscuous off target interactions explaining efficacy and or side_effects examples of new therapeutic_indications for old drugs include the anti_emetic and hypnotic thalidomide originally withdrawn as a leprostatic agent or the anti_neoplastic finasteride for the treatment of hair_loss approved in over the years an increasing number of pharmaceutical_companies have been interested in drug_repurposing in order to reduce the risk and cost of the development of new chemical_entities the fragment_based fbdd approach represents another validated alternative to high_throughput it consists of identifying low_molecular molecules that are able to interact with a defined binding_site hits are then combined or grown into high_affinity ligands over the past_decade fbdd has become established as an effective approach and has led to the discovery of high_affinity bioactive_molecules some of which are in clinical development the rule of three provides a useful guideline when designing the fragment to whom correspondence should be addressed screening collection but the selection_criteria may also include privileged structures that are commonly found in known drug molecules this strategy is based on the assumption that molecules resembling existing_drugs are more likely to possess appropriate admet properties than random molecules e drug d has been purposely designed to provide free and ready to screen virtual collections of approved drugs and of their commercially_available substructures fragments these collections of compounds are natural inputs for various cheminformatic and virtual_screening applications
