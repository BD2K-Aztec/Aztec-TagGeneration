systems_biology chemopy freely_available python_package for computational_biology and chemoinformatics motivation molecular representation for small_molecules has been routinely used in qsar sar virtual_screening database_search ranking drug adme t prediction and other drug_discovery processes to facilitate extensive studies of drug molecules we developed a freely_available open_source python_package called chemoinformatics in python chemopy for calculating the commonly used structural and physicochemical features it computes drug feature groups composed of descriptors that include descriptor values in addition it provides seven types of molecular_fingerprint systems for drug molecules including topological fingerprints electro topological state e state fingerprints maccs keys fp keys atom pairs fingerprints topological torsion fingerprints and morgan circular fingerprints by applying a semi_empirical quantum_chemistry program mopac chemopy can also compute a large number of d molecular descrip tors conveniently availability the python_package chemopy is freely_available viamolecular features for small_molecules have frequently been used in the development of machine_learning in qsar qspr virtual_screening database_search similarity_search ranking drug adme t prediction and other drug_discovery processes these descriptors capture and magnify distinct aspects of molecular topology to investigate how molecular_structure affects molecular property currently these features were widely used to characterize ligand_molecules in the proteinligand network and predict new proteinligand associations to identify potential_drug following the spirit of chemogenomics several programs for computing molecular_descriptors have been developed such as march inside tops mode tomo comd dragon codessa molconn z http www edusoft lc com molconn chemistry development kit cdk indigo http ggasoftware com opensource indigo joelib rdkit http www rdkit org and avogadro unfortunately some of these tools are not comprehensive or are limited to only a certain kind of features additionally some are not freely and easily_accessible we implemented a selection of sophisticated molecular_features and provided them as a package for the free_and environment python the chemopy package aims at providing the user with comprehensive implementations of these descriptors in a unified_framework to allow easy and transparent computation to our knowledge chemopy is the first opensource package computing a large number of molecular_features based on the mopac optimization we recommend chemopy to analyse and represent the drugs or ligand_molecules under investigation further we hope that the package will be helpful when exploring questions concerning drug activity drug adme t and drugtarget_interactions in the context of computational_biology after accomplishing the previous goal we expect that our other groups may use the free code of chemopy and the new qsar_models to implement public web_servers such as mind best the users can run predictions of libraries of compounds using smiles codes as input chemopy contains a selection of molecular_descriptors to analyse classify and compare complex molecular_network they facilitate to exploit machine_learning to drive hypothesis from complex molecular datasets the usefulness of these molecular_descriptors covered by chemopy for representing structural_features of small_molecules has been sufficiently demonstrated by a number of published_studies of the development of machine_learning classification_systems the chemopy implementation of each of these algorithms was extensively tested by using a number of test molecules the computed descriptor values were compared with the known values for these molecules to ensure that our computation is accurate owing to the modular_structure of chemopy extensions or new functionalities can be implemented easily without complex and time consuming alterations of the source_code in future work we plan to apply the integrated features on various biological research_questions and extending the range of functions with new promising descriptors for the coming versions of chemopy
