gene_expression nease a method for gene_ontology subclassification of high_throughput high_throughput can identify genes whose expression_profiles correlate with specific phenotypes however placing these genes into a biological_context remains_challenging to help address_this we developed nested expression analysis systematic explorer nease nease complements traditional gene_ontology approaches by determining statistically enriched gene_ontology subterms within a list of genes based on co annotation here we overview an open_source version of the nease algorithm nease can be used either stand alone or as part of a pathway discovery pipeline availability nease is implemented within the multiple experiment viewer software_package available at http www tm org mev numerous studies indicate that high_throughput measurement of gene_transcription provides the means to examine how organisms respond on a genome_wide scale to experimental perturbations or to the development of pathological_conditions analysis of the data produced by these technologies typically results in lists of genes whose expression_patterns correlate with the phenotypes under study however placing these lists into a useful biological_context remains_a a common approach to this problem is to perform statistical assessment of categorical assignments of functional_attributes associated with genes identified in a particular analysis current functional enrichment algorithms can be classified into three main classes singular enrichment to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as analysis sea gene_set gsea and modular enrichment_analysis mea traditional sea approaches such as ease and onto express use a predefined list of differentially_expressed to linearly assess the enrichment of individual gene_ontology go terms in a term by term fashion with statistical_methods that include chi_square fishers_exact and binomial probability the gsea class on the other hand takes a no cutoff approach that utilizes expression data and associated experimental values from all genes in a microarray experiment to derive enrichment_scores for annotation terms in the original gsea method gene members of each functional category are rank ordered based on expression values to determine a maximum term enrichment score p values are then assigned to each term by a kolmogorovsmirnov like statistic the more recent mea class of algorithms use varied statistical_methods combined with network discovery approaches that improve enrichment sensitivity_and by evaluating the relationships among categorical assignments i e parents children siblings
