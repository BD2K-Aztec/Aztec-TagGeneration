data_and muxstep an open_source c multiplex hmm library for making inferences on multiple data types motivation with the development of experimental methods and technology we are able to reliably gain access to data in larger quantities dimensions and types this has great_potential for the improvement of machine_learning as the learning algorithms have access to a larger space of information however conventional machine_learning used thus far on single dimensional data inputs are unlikely to be expressive enough to accurately model the problem in higher dimensions in fact it should generally be most suitable to represent our underlying models as some form of complex networksng nsio with nontrivial topological_features as the first step in establishing such a trend we present muxstep an open_source library utilising multiplex networks for the purposes of binary_classification on multiple data types the library is designed to be used out of the box for developing models based on the multiplex network framework as well as easily modifiable to suit problem modelling needs that may differ significantly from the default approach described availability_and the full source_code is available on github https github com machine_learning that tackle problems such as classification clustering and decoding have been frequently found in a variety of applications a significant share of which is of bioinformatical nature have presented a review of these applications which includes but is not limited to knowledge extraction genomics and proteomics systems_biology and text_mining in a variety of fields perhaps especially bioinformatics the algorithms can be faced with learning from multiple types of data simultaneously the exact ways in which the processes producing each data type are connected may well be unknown or incompletely_understood which often results in having to make certain assumptions on their form to make the problem tractable one possible assumption is to model these inter process connections as multilayer networks in particular the special_case of multiplex networks could be very appropriate while still maintaining tractability informally a multiplex network is a multi_layered graph in which each layer is built over the same set of nodes and there may exist edges between nodes in different layers this models suitability arises from the fact that there exists a wide_variety of systems exhibiting natural multiplexity social_networks and epidemics modelling transportation networks biochemical and genetic_networks and research_communities to name a few we have developed the muxstep library motivated by the examples above as the to the best of our knowledge first publicly_available machine_learning library acquiring this methodology the problem we focus on is the very common problem of binary_classification the supplementary_materials also detail workflows thatextend it to k ary classification briefly muxstep is designed to process any ordered sequence of data_points where each data point is actually a tuple of several real valued data types furthermore it is possible to assign a discrete sub output to each tuple in the sequence thus encompassing a kind of mixture_model the muxstep library and this applications note are designed with the following primary_goals in mind i out of the box usefulness for new problems and providing an overview of its essential internals and a worked case study in a way that makes it easy for bioinformaticians to develop models based on multilayer networks ii ease of extending in the spirit of open_source with clear descriptions of the most common ways to extend it iii user_friendliness and potential educational value of its codebase with a well structured coding style and an abundance of comments and explanations of key algorithms involved
