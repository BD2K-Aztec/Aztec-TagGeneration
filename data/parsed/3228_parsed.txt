gene_expression netweavers an r package for integrative biological network_analysis with mass_spectrometry data the discovery of functionally_related groups in a set of significantly abundant proteins from a mass_spectrometry experiment is an important step in a proteomics analysis_pipeline here we describe netweavers network weighted averages for analyzing groups of regulated proteins in a network context e g as defined by clusters of proteinprotein_interactions netweavers is an r package that provides a novel method for analyzing proteomics_data integrated with biological_networks the method includes an algorithm for finding dense clusters of proteins and a permutation algorithm to calculate cluster p values optional steps include summarizing quantified pep tide values to single protein values and testing for differential_expression such that the data input can simply be a list of identified and quantified peaks the statistical_analysis of proteinprotein_interaction ppins in conjunction with mass_spectrometry ms data is an effective way to find functional_groups of identified proteins in large_networks several methods for network_analysis are already implemented in r but none are specific to label_free or labeled ms experiments the package ppistats provides tools for the analysis of ppins specifically for bait prey technologies degraph performs gene network differential exstatistical significance for each protein the resulting p values for individual proteins can be used in the network_analysis step which scores highly_connected subgraphs i e dense clusters with these p values because the need to specify many parameters can greatly impact the results we chose a highly data_driven cluster finding algorithm that requires only one parameter our protein and cluster scoring each require only one additional parameter we applied the r package to ms data from a phosphorylation study of human_embryonic see supplementary_file s for the experimental_design the r package vignette provided as supplementary_file s presents the code for summarizing the data performing hypothesis_testing and running the network_analysis using the reactome human ppin version netweavers identified clusters of proteins with roles in processes known to be involved in stem_cell see supplementary_file for these results results from netweavers applied to a null dataset and an example using data that were summarized and tested in another r package
