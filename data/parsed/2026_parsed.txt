genome_wide histone_acetylation data improve_prediction of mammalian transcription_factor motivation histone_acetylation hac is associated with open chromatin and hac has been shown to facilitate transcription_factor tf_binding in mammalian_cells in the innate_immune system context epigenetic_studies strongly implicate hac in the transcriptional_response of activated_macrophages we hypothesized that using data from large_scale sequencing of a hac chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq would improve the performance of computational_prediction of binding locations of tfs mediating the response to a signaling event namely macrophage_activation results we tested this hypothesis using a multi evidence approach for predicting binding_sites as a training test_dataset we used chip_seq derived tf_binding locations for five tfs in activated murine_macrophages our model combined tf_binding motif scanning with evidence from sequence_based sources and from hac chip_seq using a weighted_sum of thresholded scores we find that using hac data significantly_improves the performance of motif based tf binding_site furthermore we find that within regions of high hac local_minima of the hac chip_seq signal are particularly strongly correlated with tf_binding locations our model using motif scanning and hac local_minima improves the sensitivity for tf binding_site by over a model based on motif scanning alone at a false_positive cutoff of availability the data and software source_code for model training and validation are freely_available online atmammalian cells exhibit diverse transcriptional_profiles across different cell_types and conditions for example in immune_cells activated with different pathogen associated molecules to a large extent these profiles are controlled by the arrangement and chromatin_accessibility of cis_regulatory to whom correspondence should be addressed elements transcription_factors tfs bind specific sequence_elements in chromatin locations of permissive epigenetic or conformational_states leading to activation or repression of transcriptional_activity for mapping these regulatory_interactions it is particularly promising that the binding of a tf can now be measured genome_wide using chromatin_immunoprecipitation ip with sequence detection however antibody and cellular_material requirements preclude using chip_seq to screen for all tfs mediating a transcriptional_response there remains a need for computational_approaches that can in the absence of experimental tf_binding data leverage transcriptional data and genomic_information to identify the network of tfs and binding_sites that underlies a transcriptional_response an important tool for predicting mammalian tf_binding is motif scanning i e searching dna_sequence for matches within a library of sequence_motifs reported to be bound by specific tfs such a library enables mapping between a scanning identified sequence_element and one or more candidate tfs that may bind it however such motifs are often highly uncertain and they can be degenerate leading to a high_frequency of false_positive furthermore mammalian cis_regulatory can be tens of kilobases from transcription_start necessitating searching large sequence_regions and further increasing false_positives these issues undermine the performance of motif scanning as a standalone approach successful motifbased prediction of tf_binding depends on identifying the sequence_regions within the relevant cell_type that are likely to contain cisregulatory elements it has been observed that cis_regulatory tend to cooccur with chromatin or sequence_features that can be grouped in three categories i chromatin structural_features such as dnase_i ii epigenetic_marks such as histone_acetylation hac and iii sequence_features such as high_gc and conservation across species the hac mark which has been associated with active promoters and open chromatin is of particular relevance to transcriptional_regulation because the modification can be placed or removed in response to the cellular state these observations have spurred the development of approaches that integrate data for multiple types of chromatin features to improve the accuracy of tf_binding predictions various data_integration frameworks for binding_site have been used including the support_vector probabilistic methodsand its upstream_regulatory with tf_binding data and various feature tracks measured binding locations for the tf nfb p are shown in orange top row each feature track is displayed in colored vertical bars interspersed every bp hac chip_seq signal magenta valley scores vs for hac local_minima blue normalized nfb binding_site motif match scores red dna_sequence gc_content green nucleosome_occupancy score green and vertebrate conservation score for genomic_sequence green the nfb binding_sites correspond to local_minima in the hac chip_seq signal inset within a local minimum of the chip_seq signal magenta curve the smaller of the maximum signal values on either side of the local minimum is computed and the entire local minimum region is assigned that value as its vs and the value zero outside the local minimum region blue lines supplementary section s b the distribution of hac chip vs from stimulated cells in tf bound sites differs substantially from non tf bound sites as shown in the two histograms note the logarithmic vertical scale feature distributions first the tf specificity of the motif scanning was investigated across all five tfs the motif scanning score distribution from tfbss was significantly_higher than the distribution from non binding_sites supplementary next hac vs representing local_minima were computed and the distributions of vs at tfbss and non binding_sites were compared in lps_stimulated cells hac vs were significantly_higher at tfbss than at non binding_sites this motivated the use of hac chip data to improve predictions furthermore lps dependent tfbss were correlated with lps inducible hac local_minima supplementary table s and model performance first two feature models motifs plus one other feature were compared with a motifs only reference model based on the area under the sensitivity versus fpr curve supplementaryand the model with hac vs fromprediction performance area under the sensitivity versus fpr curve or roc_curve for models with motif scanning and one additional feature and a motifs only reference model data for models with three features are shown in supplementary larger bar values_correspond to better cross_validation average performance on the test_dataset the performance for the reference model is shown in the blue bar and vertical dotted line and a random model is shown as a negative control black bar the motifs only model outperformed the random model fold each green bar represents a model that used motif information plus a specific sequence_based feature gc_content etc each cyan bar represents a model that used motif information plus a hac chip_seq based feature supplementaryfor the complete fpr range the model with hac vs from stimulated cells gray curve outperforms the other models roc_curves were obtained by varying the prediction score cutoff section the lack of improvement for the nucleosome_occupancy based model is consistent with the very weak association between this feature and tf_binding supplementary stimulated cells had the highest performance improvement relative to the reference model increase p the hac chipseq signal also improved prediction_performance by but the improvement was highly_variable from tf to tf coefficient of variation see supplementary the model using the stimulated cell hac vs also outperformed the unstimulatedcell hac vs data by p in contrast to the hac chip derived datasets the three genomic_features gc_content conservation and nucleosome_occupancy score did not substantially_improve prediction_performance however the improvements due to gc_content increase and conservation were more consistent from tf to tf and thus in both cases were statistically_significant p next models with motifs plus two other features were compared with the best previous model motifs hac vs none of the models gave a statistically significant_improvement over the best two feature model supplementary these findings_suggest that more tf_binding data would be required to discriminate prediction performances of three feature models
