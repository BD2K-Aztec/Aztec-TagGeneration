systems_biology a framework for installable external tools in skyline skyline is a windows client application for targeted_proteomics method creation and quantitative data analysis the skyline document model contains extensive mass_spectrometry data from targeted_proteomics experiments performed using selected_reaction parallel reaction monitoring and data independent and data dependent acquisition methods researchers have developed software_tools that perform statistical_analysis of the experimental_data contained within skyline documents the new external tools framework allows researchers to integrate their tools into skyline without modifying the skyline codebase installed tools provide point and click access to downstream statistical_analysis of data processed in skyline the framework also specifies a uniform interface to format tools for installation into skyline tool developers can now easily share their tools with proteomics researchers using skyline availability_and skyline is available as a single click self updating web installation at http skyline maccosslab org this web_site also provides access to installable external tools and documentation the skyline software for quantitative targeted_proteomics has become increasingly popular since its original publication with registered users and instances started most weeks the rich skyline document schema contains extensive data generated from targeted_proteomics experiments this combination has motivated researchers and instrument vendors developing software_tools with applications in targeted quantitative_proteomics to seek seamless_integration with skyline the raw_material for this integration has long been available through custom reports designed inside skyline and exported to comma separated value files for further analysis the impact of third_party tools created to analyze these reports however has been limited by the difficulty with which they could be shared among researchers existing_tools have been developed outside of skyline in r python and java or exist as web_sites r ost et_al without detailed and specific knowledge of these tools and their running environments outside skyline researchers using skyline have found them difficult to install and use the skyline external tools framework was designed to address_these by providing a mechanism for researchers to create extensible shareable and user_friendly tools for use with skyline
