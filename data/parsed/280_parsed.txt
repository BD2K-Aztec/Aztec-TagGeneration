genetics_and analysis of case_control studies with known risk_variants motivation the question of how to best use information from known associated variants when conducting disease_association has yet to be answered some studies compute a marginal p value for each several nucleotide polymorphisms independently ignoring previously discovered variants other studies include known variants as covariates in logistic_regression but a weakness of this standard conditioning strategy is that it does not account for disease_prevalence and non random ascertainment which can induce a correlation_structure between candidate variants and known associated variants even if the variants lie on different chromosomes here we propose a new conditioning approach which is based in part on the classical technique of liability threshold modeling roughly this method estimates model_parameters for each known variant while accounting for the published disease_prevalence from the epidemiological literature results we show via simulation and application to empirical datasets that our approach outperforms both the no conditioning strategy and the standard conditioning strategy with a properly controlled false_positive furthermore in multiple_data involving diseases of low prevalence standard conditioning produces a severe drop in test_statistics whereas our approach generally performs as well or better than no conditioning our approach may substantially_improve disease_gene for diseases with many known risk_variants availability ltsoft software is available onlinethe nhgri catalog of published genome_wide gwas lists thousands of single_nucleotide snps associated with several hundred complex phenotypes however it is currently unknown how to optimally use these discovered snps when conducting additional gwas typically known variants are ignored and snps are tested independently for association via logistic_regression for case control phenotypes and linear_regression for quantitative phenotypes occasionally known variants are used as covariates in the regression_models to determine additional signals exist in the data beyond those already discovered as in recent_studies of type_diabetes we show that for standard casecontrol_studies neither one of these strategies testing snps marginally or standard conditioning on associated variants is optimally powered to discover new loci surprisingly standard conditioning will often dramatically decrease power for example in the welcome trust case control consortium wtccc type_diabetes t d dataset wtccc b conditioning on a known variant on chromosome decreases the one degree of freedom df statistic from a logistic_regression likelihood_ratio by an average of at independent known associated variants on entirely different chromosomes relative to the same test without conditioning on thethe theory presented in section above modeled casecontrol phenotypes under a liability threshold model and estimated the power of linear_regression with no covariates nocond lin linear_regression conditioned on known variants stdcond lin and our liability threshold model based ltscore under various ascertainment scenarios here we examine the relative_benefits of the three classes of statistical_tests nocond stdcond and ltscore over simulated_and for nocond and stdcond we conduct most of our analyses using the logistic_regression versions nocond log and stdcond log but we have verified that nocond lin and stdcond lin produce very similar results see below there are many equivalencies between the logit_model the liability threshold model and the multiplicative relative_risk model to be maximally conservative and to demonstrate that the results derived in methods section hold for different disease_models we simulate our case control phenotypes under a logit_model this prevents our method from having an unfair advantage due to testing the same model that generated the data as shown below similar_results when using linear instead of logistic_regression and the liability threshold model instead of the logit_model ltscore computes posterior mean of the residual of the liability using liability threshold model_parameters that account for disease_prevalence and study_design and then uses posterior mean as input to linear_regression see section the ltscore parameters are estimated from published disease_prevalence data this external_information unavailable to either nocond log or stdcond log is the basis of the improvement of ltscore we are interested in the effects of known associated snps on association tests for undiscovered snps that are in complete linkage equilibrium e g those on completely different chromosomes with the known associated snps in the population in both the simulated_and below we never condition on snps that are in ld with the candidate snp the derivations above assumed a liability threshold model of disease however both the stdcondlog and nocond log tests assume a logit_model of disease as they are applications of logistic_regression we compare the the performance of the methods by measuring the ratio of the average test_statistics produced by each method this has a natural interpretation of the increase in sample_size needed to obtain the equivalent power for example if ltscore gives increase in test_statistic over stdcondlog this corresponds to adding more individuals to a study analyzed with stdcond log to achieve the power of the original study analyzed by ltscore we have shown that the practice of standard conditioning on known associated variants does not account for study_design and disease_prevalence potentially leading to significant power_loss this power_loss is due to the induced correlation between associated variants in casecontrol_studies the phenomenon of higher odds_ratios in cases with fewer risk_alleles at other loci than in cases with more risk_alleles at other loci can be viewed as a gene_gene this is a statistical rather than biological interaction by properly modeling the ascertainment and prevalence while still leveraging known associated variants our ltscore statistic improves study power relative to nocondlog and stdcond log tests in casecontrol_studies of mid to low prevalence diseases this increase in power is a function of the total phenotypic_variance explained by known variants and disease_prevalence the datasets examined here had either a low prevalence or a small fraction of the variance explained and therefore we did not expect a large improvement however as more associated variants are discovered the performance of ltscore will increase giving rise to power gains as a function of covariate effect_size and disease_prevalence this approach can also be applied to clinical_covariates and in this case an average_power gain of was achieved unpublished_data we have verified that results similar to supplementaryare obtained when comparing genetic clinical_covariates to clinical_covariates only see supplementary however conditioning on clinical_covariates is a fundamentally different problem both because a different parameter_estimation method is needed and because with clinical_covariates it is often the case that samples are non randomly ascertained for covariate value as well as casecontrol status a recent t d meta_analysis uses the standard conditioning statistic and shows a significant gain in power their ratio of cases to controls is closer to a randomly ascertained study and in this case we expect stdcond log to outperform nocond log and increase power in addition to their beneficial study_design some of the conditioned variants are proximal to the new discoveries both of the elements serve to improve the power of standard conditioning also examine the potential benefits of genomewide conditioning in t d however we believe the use of our ltscore statistic on these data could improve the power further
