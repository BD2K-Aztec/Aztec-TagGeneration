graphlet based measures are suitable for biological_network comparison motivation large_amounts of biological_network data exist for many species analogous to sequence comparison network comparison aims to provide biological_insight graphlet based_methods are proving to be useful in this respect recently some doubt has arisen concerning the applicability of graphlet based measures to low edge density networksin particular that the methods are unstableand further that no existing network model matches the structure found in real biological_networks results we demonstrate that it is the model networks themselves that are unstable at low edge density and that graphlet based measures correctly reflect this instability furthermore while model network_topology is unstable at low edge density biological network_topology is stable in particular one must distinguish between average density and local density while model networks of low average edge densities also have low local edge density that is not the case with protein_protein ppi_networks real ppi_networks have low average edge density but high local edge densities and hence they and thus graphlet based measures are stable on these networks finally we use a recently devised non parametric statistical_test to demonstrate that ppi_networks of many species are well fit by several models not previously_tested in addition we model several viral ppi_networks for the first time and demonstrate an exceptionally good fit between the data and theoretical_models contact networks are used to represent relationships in molecular_biology such as those between genes in gene_regulatory and proteins in proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks a ppi_network models the physical bindings between types of proteins in a cell where a node represents a type of protein and an undirected edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding two proteins can physically bind to each other the network of all such interactions in a species has been dubbed the interactome and understanding its structure is an integral step towards understanding cellular_systems recent_advances in the experimental determination of ppi_networks such as yeast_two y h screening and mass_spectrometry ms of purified complexes have provided an abundance of network data as these ppi_networks are large and complex it is necessary to develop efficient and biologically_meaningful algorithms for their analysis because exactly solving many graph analysis problems is computationally_intractable heuristic and approximate_methods must be devised systematic measures of structure also called topology of large_networks based on graphlets small induced subgraphs of large_networks have been introduced one is based on comparing graphlet frequencies between two networks and is termed relative graphlet frequency rgf distance the other is based on comparing graphlet_degree distributions gdds between two networks and the agreement in gdds of two networks is measured both allow quantification of similarity between the topology of two data networks e g between two species or comparison of a data network with a theoretically derived model network fourteen ppi_networks of eukaryotic_organisms were compared with four different random_network models and the fit between the ppi and model networks has been assessed the use of graphlet based measures for network comparison has been questioned owing to the measures being unstable in regions of low edge density empirical distributions of these scores were calculated and a novel non parametric test for assessing_the of the fit between real ppi_networks and theoretical_models was introduced the study found that none of the ppi_networks of yeast and human that were considered were well fit by the three theoretical_models that were tested after a discussion of methods this article is designed to lead the reader through the following observations first that rgf distance and gdd agreement gdda are not unstable measures for low edge density networks but instead that they correctly detect the statistically high variance in network_structure that is present in low_density model networks second that this high variability described as instability by is present in low_density model networks but neither in real ppi_networks nor in the model networks needed to correctly represent them third that current ppi_networks are denser than those studied byand are well outside the highly_variable low_density region fourth that the highly_variable region shrinks with increasing network size and is of negligible to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com size for real_world networks finally we use the non parametric test proposed byto demonstrate that ppi_networks of many species are well fit by several existing network models
