sequence_analysis discriminative motif analysis of high_throughput dataset motivation high_throughput chip_seq studies typically identify thousands of peaks for a single transcription_factor tf it is common for traditional motif_discovery tools to predict motifs that are statistically_significant against a navenave background distribution but are of questionable biological_relevance results we describe a simple yet effective algorithm for discovering differential motifs between two sequence_datasets that is effective in eliminating systematic_biases and scalable to large_datasets tested on encode chip_seq our method identifies correct motifs in of the datasets with known motifs demonstrating improvement in both accuracy and efficiency compared with dreme another state of art discriminative motif_discovery tool more interestingly on the remaining more challenging datasets we identify common technical or biological_factors that compromise the motif search results and use advanced features of our tool to control for these factors we also present case studies demonstrating the ability of our method to detect single base_pair differences in dna specificity of two similar tfs lastly we demonstrate discovery of key tf motifs involved in tissue specification by examination of high_throughput dnase accessibility data availability the motifrg package is publically available via the bioconductor repository the emergence of high_throughput for genome_wide of transcription_factor tfbs has made precise categorization of their dna motifs possible harnessing the power of large_quantities of data generated by this technology presents many computational challenges motif_discovery is a classical bioinformatics problem and has been an active area of research for decades existing_tools can be roughly classified as profile_based such as meme or pattern based like consensus see for a review and performance study of popular motif_discovery tools most of these tools however do not easily scale to large_datasets users typically limit the motif search to top ranking peaks thus sacrifice the power of the data which may be critical for accurate modeling of the tfbs and for identification of cofactors large_amounts of data also increase the power to detect various non random signals many of which may not be directly related to the problem of interest the new challenge is to understand the nature of motif signals and determine the relevant ones we propose to test the motif enrichment in a foreground dataset against an explicitly stated background dataset rather against a non informative null_distribution the background dataset should be carefully_selected to represent the systematic_biases present in the foreground discriminative motif_discovery is not a new approach pioneering work includes but is not limited to dme dips and deme these methods find a discriminative position_weight pwm to optimize an objective_function which for the case of deme and dme is the likelihood of the data given the model and sequence class however the optimization procedures of many of these methods are computationally_expensive making them unsuitable for large_datasets recent works designed for high_throughput datasets use more simplified statistical_models for example dreme meme suite and oligo diff rsat suite use fishers_exact and peakregressor applies a linear_regression to fit peak scores by motif counts in this study we propose a new discriminative motif_discovery algorithm motifrg that distinguishes two sequence_datasets we measure the discriminative_power of a motif by a logistic regression_model which shows some similarity to dreme and peakregressor but offers a better combination of robustness and flexibility we also provide an effective and efficient iterative process for motif refinement and extension and apply a bootstrap robustness test to avoid over fitting in the optimization_process the logistic regression_framework offers direct to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com measurement of statistical_significance and we demonstrate by permutation_tests that the associated z statistics reflect the probability of occurrence by chance this framework also provides flexibility to handle existing bias between the two datasets and to weight the sequences according to their importance both important features when dealing with some challenging datasets see section for details the method is implemented in r r development core bioconductor core team and is publicly_available via the bioconductor repository we applied this method in a comprehensive motif study of encode chip_seq for tfbs under the default setting motifrg successfully discovered accurate motifs in of the datasets with known motifs demonstrating its flexibility in handling diverse applications in many cases biologically_plausible cofactor motifs are also discovered compared with dreme motifrg had comparable_performance at identifying the core motif and generally ran about faster its advantages over dreme in terms of both accuracy and efficiency are more obvious for longer motifs and motifs with degenerate flanking_sequences probably due to a more effective refinement procedure by exploring the cases where we fail to detect known motifs we identify several common factors likely to compromise the motif search results and propose strategies that exploit the flexibility of motifrg to deal with these challenges using one in depth case study we demonstrate the power of discriminative motif analysis for the study of dna binding_specificity of similar members of one protein_family we also show that this tool can be applied to dnasei accessibility datasets to identify tfbs that are enriched at cell_type accessible sites which may act as key_regulators of cell lineage_specific chromatin_remodeling our method and discriminative motif_discovery in general represents powerful_tools to exploit various types of high_throughput datasets to answer many fundamental biological_questions the main_challenge of traditional motif_discovery is to increase signal_to due to lack of power from small input datasets high_throughput datasets present different challenges besides scalability concerns they are likely to produce large_numbers of statistically_significant motifs due to the power of the large_sample many of which are hard to interpret to effectively use the motif prediction results to guide further study it is important to understand the nature of these motifs and why they are enriched it is well understood that genomes are far from random which presents complicated higher_order structure such as dinucleotide sequence_preference repetitive_sequences nucleosome_positioning signals and so forth genomic_sequences in promoters which usually show enrichment of tfbs also contain different characteristics from other parts of genome such as enrichment of cpg islands common motifs for housekeeping tfs and so forth these factors can all cause certain sequence_patterns to be enriched in a given dataset in addition many chip_seq and dnasei hypersensitivity studies suggest that tfs tend to colocalize on a common set of accessible regions it is unclear if these tfs collectively determine the accessibility of the given sites or some bind non specifically at the accessible sites discriminative motif analysis is a powerful_tool to address whether the predicted motifs are truly involved in the biological problem under study by use of a rigorous control_group a methodology frequently used in experimental_design the key to success for this method is proper choice of background which might not be clear until we have a better understanding of factors that affects binding of tfs by examination of a large set of chip_seq profiles we identified some common motifs for tfs in a certain category for example tfs that bind predominantly in promoter_regions are likely to be associated with ets sp and other gc_rich motifs and tfs with most of sites in distal_regions tend to have enrichment of ap sites to determine if the associated motifs are truly specific to the given tfs we can iteratively test for potential_biases as we find them each time making the background as similar to the foreground as possible except for the defined difference under study as accessible regions in the given cell_type can be viewed as the union of all tfbs that are associated with active_chromatin in that cell_type they present some generic features common to most tfbs and can serve as a good background for comparison with adjustment to other bias further downstream_analysis can be used to validate predicted motifs for example direct tfbs should contain a clear dnasei digital footprinting signature and be close to the centers of chip_seq we noticed that stronger peaks tend to be associated with stronger motifs as measured by the pwm scores particularlythe standard_deviation of motif scores for all cagctg extensions based on bootstraps decreases with the proportion of true foreground y axis the standard_deviation x axis the proportion of true foreground e when motif enrichment is low motif scores are more variable x axis all extensions of cagctg y axis motif scores the confidence_intervals are plotted based on bootstrapping mean and variance upper panel bootstrap iterations total_sample and of true foreground lower panel using bootstrap iterations total_sample and only of true foreground for tfs with long motifs which is consistent with the theory that pwm scores roughly reflect the dna protein binding_affinities in vitro in such cases including weaker peaks usually results in more permissive motifs lacking the full dna specificity for the strong peaks however recent work suggests that weak sites can be functionally_important e g prep regulates temporal expression of pax via a pair of low_affinity dna_binding during lens formation our previous work also suggests that although strong peaks are more likely to be associated with gene_regulation the peak strength is not deterministic of function several rank_based motif prediction_methods designed for protein binding microarrays used the binding_affinities measured by probe intensities our method provides support for sequence weighting with which the users have the flexibility to put more focus on a subset of sequences these methods including our own however still build a single pwm motif to represent all binding_sites whereas some weaker sites are functionally more important than others with similar pwm scores we think a mixture or higher_order model may be more appropriate a direction for our future_investigations one key feature of our method and other discriminative motif_discovery tools is the support for comparison of two similar profiles by comparison of neurod and myod two similar bhlh_proteins we have shown that although shared core eboxes are involved in activation of chromatin specific eboxes are more directly involved in activation of differentiation programs in neurogenesis and myogenesis respectively similar studies can be performed systematically to identify delicate specificity for members of other protein_families that share almost identical motifs such as the ets and foxo families such studies may shed more light of their functional_roles and evolution of protein_families in general we have also demonstrated its application to dnasei hypersensitivity data to identify key_regulators involved in cell_type chromatin reprogramming we can further zoom in to compare more similar samples such as two different differentiated epithelial_cells or before and after a certain treatment by applying this approach systematically we can gain deeper_understanding about cell_lineage restriction and differentiation_program
