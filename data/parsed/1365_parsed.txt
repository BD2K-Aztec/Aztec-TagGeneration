gene_expression detection of significantly differentially_methylated in targeted bisulfite sequencing_data bisulfite_sequencing is currently the gold_standard to obtain genome_wide profiles in eukaryotes in contrast to the rapid development of appropriate pre_processing and alignment software methods for analyzing the resulting methylation profiles are relatively limited so_far for instance an appropriate pipeline to detect dna_methylation differences between cancer and control samples is still required results we propose an algorithm that detects significantly differentially_methylated in data obtained by targeted bisulfite sequen_cing approaches such as reduced_representation in a first step this approach tests all target_regions for methylation differences by taking spatial dependence into account a false_discovery procedure controls the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected regions in a second step the significant target_regions are trimmed to the actually differentially_methylated this hierarchical procedure detects differentially_methylated with increased power compared with existing_methods availability r bioconductor_package biseq dna_methylation is an epigenetic_modification regulating gene_transcription and is known to direct development and differentiation a cg dinucleotide cpg_site is called methylated if a methyl_group is attached to the cytosine c dna treatment with sodium_bisulfite specifically introduces conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil then read as thymine by dna_polymerase whereas methylcytosine remains unmodified these changes are mapped by next_generation to save per sample costs bisulfite_sequencing bs can be combined with enrichment strategies to target bisulfite_sequencing to a specific fraction of the genome along with dna_fragment capture it is possible to use restriction_enzymes as for reduced_representation rrbs which measures genome_wide in cpg rich regions msp cleaves at ccgg digested fragments are size selected to obtain fragments with short_distance between msp sites bisulfite treated dna_fragments are then sequenced and mapped via conversion aware aligners such as bismark rrbsmap bs seeker or pass bs the aligners usually return a list of cpg_sites with the number of cytosines and thymines among all reads aligned to the cytosine in the genomic dna_sequence which is then used for subsequent analyses aberrant dna_methylation are a characteristic feature of cancer often studies focus on promoter_regions or gene_bodies ormore generallygenomic regions that are differentially_methylated between cancer and normal specimens in this context a differentially_methylated region dmr denotes a genomic_region of adjacent cpg_sites that are differentially_methylated because of lower_costs of rrbs or other targeted bisulfite sequencing_approaches increasingly larger number of samples are measured which enables a comparison of dna_methylation and the detection of dmrs between groups of samples in the past_years several software_tools for descriptive bs data analysis have been published methvisual is an r bioconductor_package for visualization and exploratory statistical_analysis of bs data biq analyzer ht allows a locus specific analysis and visualization saaprrbs provides methylation summary_statistics and annotation of cpg_sites nevertheless few tools to detect dmrs exist the most common approach is to perform fishers_exact cpg wise or region wise recently bsmooth was published a pipeline to detect differentially_methylated in wholegenome bs data bsmooth basically relies on smoothing the methylation_values sample wise and then testing for group differences via cpg wise t tests dmrs are defined as adjacent cpg_sites with absolute t statistics above a defined threshold to assess the goodness of the results a suitable error measure is needed for example it would be convenient to control the false_discovery fdr on genomic_regions i e the expected proportion of regions rejected erroneously out of all regions rejected testing_the that the regions are not differentially_methylated however the desire for a convenient analysis of bs data and the establishing of an error measure pose_challenges specific to the analysis of bs data first the coverage i e the number of reads spanning a cpg_site varies_widely between different cpg_sites and different samples as a consequence each sample has an individual profile of covered to whom correspondence should be addressed cpg_sites and missing_values occur frequently second the specific probability_distribution of methylation_levels requires specific statistical_models third the methylation of neighbored cpg_sites is spatially_correlated and hence are the cpg wise test_statistics and p values the first and to our knowledge only approach accounting for spatial dependence in multiple_hypothesis is methylkit an r package for the analysis of rrbs data and its variants methylkit models the methylation per cpg_site within a logistic_regression a sliding linear_model slim method is used to determine q values from p values to correct for multiple_hypothesis we propose biseq a dmr detecting approach that enables testing for dmrs within target_regions and controlling a given fdr this approach is tailored to data received by all kinds of targeted bisulfite sequencing_approaches the article is organized as follows in section we give a rough overview of the step_by approach the individual_steps are presented in detail in section in section we apply the approach to simulated_data and compare its results with those from bsmooth and methylkit furthermore we apply biseq to a published leukemia dataset in section we briefly discuss our results we proposed a dmr detection approach that tests regions for differential_methylation with subsequent localization of dmrs within rejected regions this hierarchical procedure is more powerful than bsmooth and methylkit power to detect differentially_methylated shown is the influence of the cpg_methylation difference and dmr fraction of the respective cpg clusters on the probability to detect a differentially_methylated cpg_site the higher the simulated methylation difference the higher was the probability to reject the cpg_site y axis the higher the fraction of differentially_methylated in cpg clusters the higher was the probability to reject the clusters and hence to reject the cpg sitesone strength of the proposed algorithm is that a region wise fdr can be controlled nevertheless we could ask whether smoothing of methylation data and focusing on regions is an appropriate strategy considering the fact that methylation of a single cpg_site can prevent transcription_factor binding to investigate whether focusing on region wise methylation changes is meaningful we analyzed the spatial clustering behavior of differentially_methylated in the leukemia dataset we tested cpg_sites for differential_methylation in leukemia compared with controls without smoothing beforehand this way we ensured that we did not add additional spatial_correlation we compared ripleys k functions for both tested cpg_sites and differentially_methylated and could show that the clustering of differentially_methylated is more pronounced than the clustering of tested cpg_sites which is due to the targeted_sequencing differentially_methylated tend to form_clusters of sizes up to bp see supplementary the fact that entire regions are particularly effected by differential_methylation in leukemia and probably in other cancer_types as well justifies smoothing and detection of differentially_methylated an advantage over other approaches is that the methylation_levels are modeled within a regression_model allowing adding further independent_variables and confounders to the model for instance boks et_al found associations of dna_methylation with gender and age thus it might be important to take these confounders into account neither bsmooth nor the methylkit package allows adding further variables by modeling the methylation_levels within a beta regression we make sure that basic_properties of methylation_levels are respected i e the distribution between and and a smaller variance near the boundaries another advantage of the beta regression is the option to consider higher variances in a group of samples commonly the cancer samples via a variable precision parameter a drawback is the long computing time most of the parameters that have to be chosen are related to cpg cluster detection and thus influence the extent of the genome that is to be analyzed basically the grade of the minimal spatial_density of covered cpg_sites that form cpg clusters together with the width of the smoothing window should be adjusted to the expected dmr lengths even if many cpg_sites are covered over a wide genomic_region for example in wholegenome bisulfite sequencing_data it is advisable not to choose too large cpg clusters with many cpg_sites when the expected dmr widths are much smaller as this would decrease the power markedly likewise a wide smoothing window results in a weaker sensitivity to small dmrs moreover the smoothing bandwidth should be adjusted to the choice of cpg clusters showed that the cluster testing procedure described earlier in the text controls the cluster wise wfdr under independence or prds assumption respectively the procedure ensures that the cluster test_statistics are gaussian and that the testing hypotheses are one sided finally to satisfy the prds property the cluster test_statistics have to be non negatively_correlated under the null_hypothesis we assume that this property is met in many cases for methylation data furthermore it is important to note that the locationwise fdr is controlled asymptotically only and dmr boundaries are slightly shifted by the smoothing step however we think that a targeted bisulfite_sequencing approach primarily requires an analysis of the target units e g cpg islands or gene_bodies rather than individual cpg_sites besides differential_methylation typically is reported in terms of regions this indicates a region wise testing approach in the first place followed by a cpg wise detection tolerating more errors this hierarchical testing procedure achieves a higher power than bsmooth and methylkit the approach is tailored to targeted bs data the direct use on whole_genome bs data would be feasible if the analysis was restricted on discrete genomic_regions e g on genes we think that the two stage testing procedure is applicable for other types of next_generation data as well the histone_modification h_k is known to occur in promoter_regions primarily thus promoters could be tested for differential histone_modification between groups of samples in a first step and in bins sub regions within rejected promoters in a second step this is a point for further research
