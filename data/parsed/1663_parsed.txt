evolutionary inaccuracy of pairwise structural_alignments motivation structural alignment_methods are widely used to generate gold_standard alignments for improving multiple_sequence and transferring functional_annotations as well as for assigning structural distances between proteins however the correctness of the alignments generated by these methods is difficult to assess objectively since little is known about the exact evolutionary_history of most proteins since homology is an equivalence relation an upper_bound on alignment_quality can be found by assessing the consistency of alignments measuring the consistency of current methods of structure alignment and determining the causes of inconsistencies can therefore provide information on the quality of current methods and suggest possibilities for further improvement results we analyze the self consistency of seven widely used structural alignment_methods sap tm_align fr tm_align mammoth dali ce and fatcat on a diverse non redundant set of domains from the scop database and demonstrate that even for relatively similar proteins the degree of inconsistency of the alignments on a residue_level is high we further show that levels of consistency vary substantially between methods with two methods sap and fr tm_align producing more consistent alignments than the rest inconsistency is found to be higher near gaps and for proteins of low structural_complexity as well as for helices the ability of the methods to identify good structural_alignments is also assessed using geometric measures for which fatcat flexible mode is found to be the best performer despite being highly inconsistent we conclude that there is substantial scope for improving the consistency of structural alignment_methods despite its apparent simplicity the problem of aligning pairs of protein_structures has attracted a significant level of research_effort methods vary in the details of their objective_function problem representation null_model of comparison statistics and approaches to searching alignment space to whom correspondence should be addressed reviewed in carugo common variations include the use of flexible alignment or using fragments and topological filters for initial alignments to improve quality and speed two previous benchmarks of pairwise structure alignment_methods have been published in the last decade these considered the degree to which the methods tested find a good solution as judged by geometric criteria and the agreement of the aligned residues with a set of manually_curated gold_standard alignments both studies are important_contributions but a recent study which covers current methods is lacking as is a study which considers both geometric performance and ability to find homologous relationships between positions simultaneously we would ideally like to assess the ability of these aligners to find homologous relationships as well as geometric similarities for a large number of proteins but this is problematic since for distantly_related proteins we rarely know how individual positions are related as an alternative to using gold_standards and limiting the size of the dataset we propose to make use of the fundamental property that homology is transitive if a and b are homologous b and c are homologous then a and c must also be homologous homology therefore establishes a set of equivalence_classes over the residues in sets of related protein_structures symmetry and self identity being obvious properties and the more closely a structural alignment_method approaches this situation the better its performance the exception to this occurs only if a set of residues are related by a star phylogenyfor example where a gene_duplication has resulted in duplicate internal_structures such as are found in repeat proteins in this study we use this idea to compare the most widelyused methods for pairwise_structural in addition to considering alignment_accuracy relative to other annotation sources dssp structural_classes and solvent accessibilities additionally followingwe consider the quality of the scores implemented by the methods with respect to external annotations scop folds go annotations and topological distances and several geometric scores seven methods were chosen the choice was based on their free availability for general academic use their importance for publicly_available resources or being widely used as judged bywe have assessed seven popular_methods for pairwise_structural using geometric measures and inconsistency as a proxy for homology and found a wide_range of independent variation on these measures some methods e g fatcat produce good
