structural_bioinformatics hitrace high_throughput robust analysis for capillary_electrophoresis motivation capillary_electrophoresis ce of nucleic_acids is a workhorse technology underlying high_throughput genome_analysis and large_scale chemical mapping for nucleic_acid structural inference despite the wide availability of ce based instruments there remain challenges in leveraging their full power for quantitative analysis of rna and dna_structure thermodynamics and kinetics in particular the slow_rate and poor automation of available analysis tools have bottlenecked a new generation of studies involving hundreds of ce profiles per experiment results we propose a computational_method called high_throughput robust analysis for capillary_electrophoresis hitrace to automate the key tasks in large_scale nucleic_acid ce analysis including the profile alignment that has heretofore been a rate_limiting in the highest throughput experiments we illustrate the application of hitrace on datasets representing different rnas chemical_modification strategies and up to single mutant variants the largest datasets each include bands by applying a series of robust dynamic_programming hitrace outperforms prior tools in terms of alignment and fitting quality as assessed by measures including the correlation between quantified band intensities between replicate datasets furthermore while the smallest of these datasets required h of manual intervention using prior approaches hitrace quantitation of even the largest datasets herein was achieved in min the hitrace method therefore resolves a critical barrier to the efficient and accurate analysis of nucleic_acid in experiments involving tens_of of electrophoretic bands availability hitrace is freely_available for download atcapillary electrophoresis ce is a widely used approach for biochemical analysis the rapid electrophoretic_separation of to whom correspondence should be addressed fluorescently_labeled nucleic_acid fragments inside electrolytefilled capillaries significantly_accelerated genome_sequencing a more recent powerful application of ce enables the high_throughput structure analysis of self assembling nucleic_acid containing systems as complex as viruses and ribosomes at single_nucleotide the ce profiles_obtained in this recent generation of structuremapping experiments present tens_of of individual electrophoretic bands quantifying these data gives detailed portraits of nucleic_acid folding thermodynamics and kinetics but requires significant informatics efforts basecalling software_packages can assign sequences to these bands in special four color experiments see e g but are not applicable to structure mapping experiments which require more robust sequence_annotation and quantitative fits of each profile to a sum of peak shapes such quantitative analysis is aided by the design of experiments so that the desired information appears as differences between corresponding bands across profiles see e g then sequence_annotation of one profile results in annotation of corresponding bands across the entire data for these datasets tools for alignment of features or rectification across different profiles resulted in improvements in quantification speed and accuracy but these tools remain poorly automated as the experimental steps of large_scale ce measurements continue to accelerate the bioinformatic task of profile alignment has become a rate_limiting in carrying out these information rich structural studies current approaches to aligning and fitting capillary profiles include capillary automated footprinting analysis cafa and shapefinder we have found these methods difficult to apply to large_scale titration or mutateand map datasets for instance cafa is focused more on peak fitting and has limited alignment capabilities the shapefinder alignment function can align spectrally separated products within a single capillary but not profiles across multiple capillaries with initially poor alignment use of these tools requires tedious manual intervention and risks bias or unnecessary errors from such manipulation analysis tools for alignment and peak fitting have also been proposed in other domains mass_spectrometry and slab_gel but empirically these approaches give unsatisfactory performance for ce data to address the limitations of existing_methods we have developed high_throughput robust analysis for capillary_electrophoresis hitrace to automate the alignment and quantification of nucleic_acid mapping profiles_obtained from hundreds of capillaries as depicted in the proposed method consists of four major_steps preprocessing_step a correlationoptimized linear alignment step b dynamic_programming based non linear adjustments step c sequence_annotation step d and peak fitting step e after describing the core algorithms that underlie the robust automation of each step we present quantitative comparisons illustrating the substantial boosts in both accuracy and speed of hitrace over previous_approaches with the proposed methodology the previously rate_limiting of quantifying highthroughput ce data is now faster than experimental data_acquisition times enabling the investigation of nucleic_acid at an unprecedented rate hitrace employs a series of automated techniques to control the high_level of variability in parameters of ce systems and to resolve a key alignment bottleneck of modern nucleic_acid mapping experiments several algorithmic advances are responsible for hitraces accuracy and speed including dynamic_programming strategies that have not been been previously_considered in the field quantitative comparisons on large experimental_datasets
