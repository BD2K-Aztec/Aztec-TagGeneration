inferring sequence_regions under functional_divergence in duplicate genes motivation a number of statistical phylogenetic_methods have been proposed to identify type i functional_divergence in duplicate genes by detecting heterogeneous substitution_rates in phylogenetic_trees a common disadvantage of the existing_methods is that autocorrelation of substitution_rates along sequences is not modeled this reduces the power of existing_methods to identify regions under functional_divergence results we design a phylogenetic hidden_markov to identify protein regions relevant to type i functional_divergence a c program hmmdiverge has been developed to estimate model_parameters and to identify regions under type i functional_divergence simulations_demonstrate that hmmdiverge can successfully_identify protein regions under type i functional_divergence unless the discrepancy of substitution_rates between subfamilies is very limited or the regions under functional_divergence are very short applying hmmdiverge to g protein subunits in animals we identify a candidate_region longer than amino_acids which overlaps with the helix and the loop in the gtpase domain with divergent rates of substitutions these sites are different from those reported by an existing program diverge interestingly previous_biochemical studies suggest the helix and the loop are important to the specificity of the receptorg protein interaction therefore the candidate_region reported by hmmdiverge highlights that the type i functional_divergence in g protein subunits may be relevant to the change of receptorg protein specificity after gene_duplication from these results we conclude that hmmdiverge is a useful tool to identify regions under type i functional_divergence after gene_duplication availability c source codes of hmmdiverge and simulation programs used in this study as well as example datasets are available atan important challenge in the post genomic era is the identification of biological_sequences that contribute to functional_divergence of to whom correspondence should be addressed duplicate genes after gene_duplication homologous regions e g protein motifs or protein_domains may evolve at different rates between two duplicates because of the discrepancy of functional constraints that results from functional_divergence therefore the difference of substitution_rates between two duplicate subfamilies can be used as a proxy of functional_divergence which is referred to as type i functional_divergence or rate shifting alternatively substitution_rates in both duplicate genes may increase immediately after gene_duplication due to relaxed functional constraints but decrease at a late_stage due to increased functional constraints the sequence_regions or sites that are conserved within subfamilies but diverged between them may be relevant to functional_divergence which is referred to as type_ii functional_divergence conservationshifting or constant but different a number of statistical_models have been proposed to detect protein regions or amino_acid relevant to functional_divergence based on the heterogeneity of substitution_rates in duplicate genes the idea of these existing_methods is to detect the discrepancy of substitution_rates using an extended phylogenetic model in which the substitution_rates could be different between different branches a common drawback of the existing_methods is that any autocorrelation of substitution_rates along sequences is not modeled most phylogenetic_methods assume that every site evolves independently however this simple assumption is frequently violated in a recent work performed a whole_genome level study on the correlated_evolution of nearby residues in drosophilid proteins a strong autocorrelation was found between non synonymous_substitutions but not between synonymous_substitutions which suggests autocorrelation at protein level in addition it has been found that positive_selection varies between protein secondary_structures therefore a number of neighboring pairs of sites may show correlated substitution patterns such as the correlated substitution_rates unfortunately most existing_methods for identifying functional_divergence do not model the autocorrelation of substitutions instead independence of substitution_rates across sites is assumed in most of the existing_methods these methodspage
