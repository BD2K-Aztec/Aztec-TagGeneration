systems_biology the signal within the noise efficient inference of stochastic gene_regulation models using fluorescence histograms and stochastic_simulations motivation in the noisy cellular_environment stochastic_fluctuations at the molecular level manifest as cellcell variability at the population level that is quantifiable using high_throughput single_cell measurements such variability is rich with information about the cells underlying gene_regulatory their architecture and the parameters of the biochemical_reactions at their core results we report a novel method called inference for networks of stochastic interactions among genes using high_throughput data insight for systematically combining high_throughput time course flow_cytometry measurements with computer generated stochastic_simulations of candidate_gene network models to infer the networks stochastic_model and all its parameters by exploiting the mathematical relationships between experimental and simulated population histograms insight achieves scalability efficiency and accuracy while entirely avoiding approximate stochastic_methods we demonstrate our method on a synthetic_gene in bacteria and show that a detailed mechanistic_model of this network can be estimated with high_accuracy and high_efficiency our method is completely general and can be used to infer models of signal activated gene_networks in any organism based solely on flow_cytometry data and stochastic_simulations gene_regulation has been long_recognized as an intrinsically stochastic_process the possibly low copy_numbers of the molecules involved together with their random motion inside the cell can cause genetically identical organisms to display different phenotypes based on variability alone ongoing progress in single cells measurement techniques is producing highthroughput datasets that allow for an increasingly accurate characterization of such variability stochastic computational_models of gene_regulation can be of great assistance in processing large_amounts of experimental_data and extracting information from it the framework of stochastic chemical kinetics has been successfully used to develop predictive_models of systems in which random fluctuations are important although models of this type cannot be solved directly except for small dimensional cases they can be simulated exactly for however long and however many times is necessary to obtain the desired statistical_information however stochastic_simulations are computationally_expensive therefore estimating distributions or computing summary_statistics to a high_accuracy can be prohibitive alternatively one can resort to more compact approximate descriptions of the stochastic models which are easier to simulate but introduce additional error and are not applicable in all cases computational_models have proven to be a valuable_tool in advancing the understanding of complex biological_phenomena and in assisting the design of synthetic gene_networks ideally models should be able to recapitulate the known experimental_observations on a process of interest and to generate new insights which are in turn testable in new experiments even when pathway structure inference is able to identify the key_players in the process under study and their interactions to build a complete model one critical challenge must be overcome the determination of the many unknown_parameters that will inevitably appear in it these are numbers such as production and degradation_rates binding_affinities and so forth which are difficult to measure directly usually the only available option is to measure other variables involved in the models such as abundances of proteins of interest and to use these measurements to infer the parameters indirectly using a dedicated computational procedure the problem of parameter_inference for stochastic gene network models has attracted much interest in recent_years and a number of solutions have been proposed in maximum_likelihood approaches one tries to select the parameter_values that maximize the probability that the model generates the observed experimental_data this has been achieved using approximations stochastic_simulations and by direct solution of the stochastic models maximum_likelihood to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com techniques have been demonstrated on biological examples albeit on relatively small dimensional models bayesian_methods represent another attractive option unlike the maximum_likelihood ones these algorithms can find many parameter_values that are compatible with the experimental_data thereby producing not only point_estimates but also confidence_intervals the issues related to computational_cost however become even more severe in this case because bayesian_methods operate by testing a large number of candidate parameter_values for each candidate many simulations are needed to determine_whether the model output is consistent with the data consequently the bayesian_framework has been mostly applied to approximate models simulation based_methods have also been proposed and applied with success in the present study we extend their applicability to higher dimensional stochastic chemical reaction_networks by exploiting the properties of flow_cytometry and other high_throughput datasets to significantly improve the computational_efficiency of the inference process
