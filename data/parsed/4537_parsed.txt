taxator tk precise taxonomic_assignment of metagenomes by fast approximation of evolutionary neighborhoods motivation metagenomics characterizes microbial_communities by random shotgun_sequencing of dna isolated directly from an environment of interest an essential step in computational meta genome_analysis is taxonomic sequence assignment which allows identifying the sequenced community_members and reconstructing taxonomic bins with sequence_data for the individual taxa for the massive datasets generated by next_generation this cannot be performed with de_novo phylogenetic_inference methods we describe an algorithm and the accompanying software taxator tk which performs taxonomic sequence assignment by fast approximate determination of evolutionary neighbors from sequence_similarities results taxator tk was precise in its taxonomic_assignment across all ranks and taxa for a range of evolutionary_distances and for short as well as for long_sequences in addition to the taxonomic_binning of metagenomes it is well suited for profiling microbial_communities from metagenome samples because it identifies bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic community_members without being affected by varying primer binding strengths as in marker gene_amplification or copy_number of marker_genes across different taxa taxator tk has an efficient parallelized implementation that allows the assignment of gb of sequence_data per day on a standard multi processor system with cpu cores and microbial refseq as the genomic reference data availability_and taxator tk source and binary program files are publicly_available atmetagenomics allows us to study microbial_communities from natural_environments without the need to obtain pure_cultures of the individual member species the shotgun_sequencing of microbial_community dna with current_techniques generates reads that range from less than to several thousand nucleotides dr ge and by computational_analyses of metagenome sequence samples we can estimate the abundances of different taxa for the sampled communities known as taxonomic_profiling characterize their functional and metabolic potential based on the predicted proteins and resolve the contributions of individual taxa to the latter by reconstructing bins of unassembled or assembled sequences that originate from the same taxon taxator tk is a taxonomic_assignment software_package which generates very precise taxonomic_assignments with few errors for metagenome shotgun sequences to provide a fair comparison we invested extensive effort into ensuring that we evaluated all methods under identical conditions with the same reference_sequences test datasets and background taxonomies using their recommended settings we evaluated taxator tk on s gene sequences on simulated short_reads with simulated assembled_contigs and with kb contig fragments from a real cow rumen metagenome for each simulated sample we evaluated a wide_range of evolutionary_distances between the query and reference_sequences using leave one taxon out cross_validation taxator tk was the most precise of all tested methods with the most realistic number of identified taxa overall this property was very pronounced for lower taxonomic ranks from species to family level however taxator tk assigned fewer data overall than other methods from species to family for the small assembled simmc dataset it assigned fewer data particularly in comparison to the composition based_classifier phylopythias when kb of data were provided for individual community_members to train species level models for the real cow rumen dataset taxator tk was the most consistent in terms of classifying multiple pieces of one contig our results consistently indicate that taxator tks strength is its high_precision of assignments which allows us to confidently assign a core of sample sequences and thereby to infer the taxonomic_composition of the community in comparison to assignments based on marker_genes it has the advantages that it makes assignments across all domains of life and that corresponding abundance estimates from shotgun sequences are less affected by copy_number of individual genes such shotgun estimates are also unaffected by pcr primer amplification biases unlike marker gene sequencing_techniques and do not require high_quality reference gene phylogenies for marker_genes we confirmed this by in depth analysis of six gb shotgun samples from the barley rhizosphere where we applied taxator tk to characterize the taxonomic_composition of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes which correlated with results from s rrna profiling and showed the most notable deviations for taxa known to be affected by primer biases or having multiple copies of the s rrna gene bulgarelli et_al unpublished_data to target draft_genome reconstructions the data assigned to individual taxonomic bins by taxator tk can be used as training data for complementary approaches such as composition based_methods or as independent information in combination with recently_proposed clustering_methods using the abundance of genes or contigs across multiple samples from a methodological point_of we have introduced a method for the fast approximation of the evolutionary neighborhood of a query_sequence with a run time that increases linearly with the number of homologs in de_novo phylogenetic_inference methods the run time increases at least log linearly with the number of homologs or they rely on time consuming optimizations of parameter rich phylogenetic_models which generates excessive computational requirements for the analysis of gb sized ngs samples our software provides an easy to use and scalable alternative to taxonomic_classification of marker_genes that is applicable to any nucleotide fragment unlike other similarity based taxonomic classifiers for shotgun data our algorithm handles different degrees of sequence_conservation without preset or user specified parameters such as alignment scores overall or per gene_family and without being restricted to the analysis of a number of high_quality homologs with a minimal length at the same time the inferred evolutionary neighborhood is extended by the identification of an outgroup leading to more precise taxonomic_assignments while regions without detectable taxonomic signal are instantly discarded we postprocess independent taxonomic_assignments of query segments to infer an assignment for the entire query and do this using a majority vote algorithm with a few robust default_parameters this computationally lightweight step can be quickly repeated with other values for the majority and minimum support parameters if required in addition to the algorithmic considerations and other run time optimizations we implemented query_sequence segmentation and program parallelization which allow large_scale data analysis with a taxator tkthroughput of several gbs per day on a standard multiprocessor system the programs scope is also not limited to the taxonomic_assignment of metagenomes it can be applied to any dna or rna_sequence for instance another successful in house application is the detection of contaminations in isolate sequencing_data furthermore the program taxator within taxator tk provides taxonomic information for individual query segments supplementary figs s and s which could be used to identify assembly errors or regions acquired by lateral_gene
