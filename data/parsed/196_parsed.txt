genetics_and a lasso multi marker mixed model for association_mapping with population_structure correction motivation exploring the genetic_basis of heritable traits remains one of the central challenges in biomedical_research in traits with simple mendelian architectures single polymorphic_loci explain a significant fraction of the phenotypic_variability however many traits of interest seem to be subject to multifactorial control by groups of genetic_loci accurate detection of such multivariate associations is non trivial and often compromised by limited statistical_power at the same time confounding influences such as population_structure cause spurious association_signals that result in false_positive results we propose linear_mixed lmm lasso a mixed model that allows for both multi_locus mapping and correction for confounding_effects our approach is simple and free of tuning parameters it effectively controls for population_structure and scales to genome_wide datasets lmm lasso simultaneously discovers likely causal_variants and allows for multi markerbased phenotype prediction from genotype we demonstrate the practical use of lmm lasso in genome_wide in arabidopsis_thaliana and linkage mapping in mouse where our method achieves significantly more accurate phenotype prediction for of the considered phenotypes at the same time our model dissects the phenotypic_variability into components that result from individual single nucleotide polymorph ism effects and population_structure enrichment of known candidate_genes suggests that the individual associations retrieved by lmm lasso are likely to be genuine although many quantitative_traits in humans plants and animals have been observed to be heritable a comprehensive understanding of the underlying genetic_architecture is still missing in some cases genome_wide and linkage mapping have already revealed individual causal_variants that control trait variability for example genetic_mapping yielded insights into the genetic_architecture of global level traits in plants and mouse as well as the risks for important human_diseases such as type_diabetes nevertheless the statistical_analysis of these genetic data has proven to be challenging not least because single genetic_variants rarely explain larger fractions of phenotype variability hence individual effect_sizes are small an inherent limitation of power to map weak effects is because of confounding relatedness between samples population_structure can induce false association patterns with large_numbers of loci being correlated with the phenotype to understand the true genetic_architecture of complex_traits it is necessary to address both of these challenges taking population_structure into account and joint modelling of true multifactorial associations if multiple_variants contribute to phenotype variation in an additive fashion simple methods that assess the significance of individual_loci independently are likely to fall short masking_effects between causal single_nucleotide snps can limit mapping power with relevant loci not reaching genome_wide significance_levels these shortcomings have been widely addressed in multivariate_regression explicitly modelling the additive_effects of multiple_snps the corresponding methods either fit sparse predictors of all genome_wide snps using a shrinkage prior or use stepwise forward selection applying a laplace prior leads to the lasso and related priors have also been considered with the same ultimate_goal to capture the genetic effects of groups of snps variance_component models have recently been proposed to quantify the heritable component of phenotype variation explainable by an excess of weak effects population_structure induces spurious correlations between genotype and phenotype complicating the genetic_analysis a major source of these effects can be understood as deviation from the idealized assumption that the samples in the study population are unrelated instead population_structure in the sample is difficult to avoid and even in a seemingly stratified sample the extent of hidden structure cannot be ignored models that account for the presence of such structure are routinely applied and have been shown to greatly reduce the impact of this confounding source of variability for instance eigenstrat builds on the idea of extracting the major axes of population_differentiation using a principal_component to whom correspondence should be addressed decomposition of the genotype data and subsequently including them into the model as additional covariates linear_mixed provide for more fine_grained control by modelling the contribution of population_structure as a random effect providing for an effective correction of family_structure and cryptic relatedness although both correction for population_structure and joint mapping of multiple weak effects have been addressed in isolation few existing_approaches are capable of addressing both aspects jointly in line with eigenstrat andadd principal_components to the model to correct for population_structure in parallel to our work segura et_al have proposed a related multi_locus mixed model approach however using stepwise forward selection instead of using the lasso here we propose a novel analysis approach that combines multivariate association analysis with accurate correction for population_structure our method allows for joint identification of sets of loci that individually have small effects and at the same time accounts for possible structure between samples this joint modelling explains larger fractions of the total phenotype variability while dissecting it in variance components specific to individual snp effects and population effects our approach bridges the advantages of linear_mixed with lasso_regression hence modelling complex genetic effects while controlling for relatedness in a comprehensive fashion the proposed linear_mixed lmm lasso is conceptually_simple computationally_efficient and scales to genome_wide settings experiments on semi_empirical data show that the rigorous combination of lasso and mixed modelling approaches yields greater_power to detect true causal_effects in a large range of settings in retrospective_analyses of studies from arabidopsis and mouse we show that through joint modelling of population_structure and individual snp effects lmm lasso results in superior models of the genotype to phenotype map these yield better quantitative predictions of phenotypes while selecting only a moderate number of snp with individual effects additional evidence of the effects uncovered by lmm lasso likely being real is given by an enrichment_analysis suggesting that the hits obtained are often in the vicinity of genes with known implication for the phenotype
