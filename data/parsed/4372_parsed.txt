sequence_analysis spliceman a computational web_server that predicts sequence_variations in pre_mrna it was previously demonstrated that splicing elements are positional dependent we exploited this relationship between location and function by comparing positional distributions between all possible hexamers around a database of human splice_sites the distance measure used in this study found point_mutations that produced higher distances disrupted splicing whereas point_mutations with smaller distances generally had no effect on splicing reasoning the idea that functional splicing elements have signature positional distributions around constitutively spliced exons we introduce splicemanan online tool that predicts how likely distant mutations around annotated splice_sites were to disrupt splicing spliceman takes a set of dna_sequences with point_mutations and returns a ranked_list to predict the effects of point_mutations on pre_mrna the current_implementation included the analyses of genomes human chimp rhesus mouse rat dog cat chicken guinea_pig frog and zebrafish pre_mrna is an important regulatory step in gene_expression pathway introns are removed and exons are joined to form mrna the splicing process is performed by the spliceosome a macromolecular ribonucleoprotein_complex that rivals the ribosome in size and complexity the intricate assembly of the spliceosome is guided by the consensus splice_site sequences i e branch point polypyrimidine_tract and splice_sites and a family of subsidiary elements known as intron and exon splicing enhancers and silencers estimates of the fraction of disease mutations that cause aberrant_splicing had been reported to range from to in a previous study we demonstrated that splicing elements had signature positional distributions around constitutively spliced exonsthey were abundant where they functioned positively and rare when they were inhibitory we captured these positional properties for hexamers with the l distance_metric section and used it to cluster positional distributions of all possible hexamers around human splice to whom correspondence should be addressed sites in addition to recognizing consensus splice_site sequences our method successfully identified various classes of intronic and exonic splicing enhancers and silencers experimental verifications of the computational results strongly indicated the power of this method to be predictive specifically we found point_mutations that produced higher l distances disrupted splicing in an in vivo minigene system whereas point_mutations with small distances generally had no affect on splicing to facilitate the analysis of splicing mutations we present splicemanan online tool that predicts how likely a genomic_variation is to disrupt splicing while the effect of mutations found in the consensus splice donor and acceptor_sites can often be predicted with high_accuracy spliceman also excludes splice_sites positions in order to predict distant splicing enhancers and silencers
