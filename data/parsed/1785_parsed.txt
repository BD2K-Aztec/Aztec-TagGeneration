structural_bioinformatics fast protein cluster parallel and optimized clustering of large_scale protein modeling data motivation fast protein cluster is a fast parallel and memory_efficient package used to cluster sets of protein models with up to models per set generated by the nutritious rice for the world project results fast protein cluster is an optimized and extensible toolkit that supports root_mean after optimal superposition rmsd and template modeling score tm_score as metrics rmsd calculations using a laptop cpu are faster than qcprot and faster than current graphics_processing gpu implementations new gpu code further increases the speed of rmsd and tm_score calculations fast protein cluster provides novel k means and hierarchical clustering_methods that are up to and faster respectively than clusco and identify significantly more accurate_models than spicker and clusco availability_and fast protein cluster is written in c using openmp for multi threading support custom streaming single instruction multiple data simd extensions and advanced vector extension intrinsics code accelerate cpu calculations and opencl kernels support amd and nvidia gpus fast protein cluster is available under the m i t license many protein_structure and protein_folding simulations generate a large ensemble of candidate structures using different starting conditions by analyzing an ensemble of predicted structures the overall consistency and accuracy of the final prediction can be increased more accurate_models are more structurally_similar to the correct structure and will thus tend to be similar to each other and can be identified by clustering thus finding models at the center of clusters is an effective method of identifying the best structures in an ensemble the nutritious rice for the world project http protinfo compbio washington edu rice an ibm world community grid project generated de_novo models of all modelable protein_sequences in the rice proteome more than sets of protein models were generated with up to models in a set the size and the number sets exceeded the capability of existing clustering software fast protein cluster was written to analyze this large dataset using a linux cluster consisting of cpu cores and five graphics_processing gpus the new software is able to cluster a set of protein models in h on a single workstation node and clustered all sets in six weeks the fast implementation also makes it possible to use new clustering strategies and we describe two methods that identify significantly_higher quality models than the widely used spicker and the recently_published clusco packages clusters generated by fast protein cluster were compared with the centroids from clusters generated by spicker and clusco the test_set consists of ensembles of size of models generated de_novo by i tasser and used originally to test spicker details of the algorithms implementations testing and additional benchmarks are provided in supplementary_material
