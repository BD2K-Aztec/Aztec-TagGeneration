systems_biology cysbml a cytoscape_plugin for sbml cysbml is a plugin designed to work with systems_biology sbml in cytoscape having the following features sbml import support of the sbml layout and qualitative model packages navigation in network layouts based on sbml structure access to miriam and sbo based annotations and sbml validation cysbml includes an importer for biomodels to load sbml from standard repositories availability_and freely_available purposes through the cytoscape_plugin manager or for download at http sourceforge net_projects cysbml the systems_biology sbml is a free and open interchange format for computer models of biological_processes which is currently supported by software_tools sbml is used to represent models for a wide_range of cell_biology including cell_signaling metabolism and gene_regulation sbml provides a common standard of interoperability and exchange allowing several researchers to work with diverse tools on building curation annotation simulation analysis and visualization of the same model standard repositories of sbml models such as biomodels have been established providing annotated models on a molecular level for a wide_range of biological_questions with access to their resources through web_services however preserving models without the semantic layer of information needed for an unambiguous_identification and interpretation of model components is meaningless to this end sbml can be annotated based on minimum information required for the annotation of models miriam and systems_biology ontology sbo lenov re a b a set of controlled_vocabularies in systems_biology cytoscape a widely used open_source platform for complex network_analysis and visualization currently provides only rudimentary sbml capabilities its application to sbml models is limited to a subset of sbml the sbml document structure is inaccessible for visualization validation of sbml files is not possible and neither the information from sbo or miriam annotation nor sbml packages for layout information or qualitative models are supported visualization of fluxes with fluxviz konigkonig and holzhutterholzhutter cysbml combines sbml the standard format of models of biological_processes with cytoscape one of the standard platforms for the visualization of biological_networks cytoscape has already been used in numerous applications for visualization and graphical network_analyses whereas the biomodels_database collects and annotates structural and mathematical_models in sbml format that provide insights into the dynamic_behavior of biological_networks cysbml makes it possible to combine these two important system biological resources in a convenient and easy to use way with special focus on the semantic layer defining the models this work opens_the for the development of further plugins facilitating the analysis of sbml models in cytoscape
