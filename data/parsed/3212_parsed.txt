data_and neggoa negative go annotations selection using ontology structure motivation predicting the biological_functions of proteins is one of the key_challenges in the post genomic era computational_models have demonstrated the utility of applying machine_learning to predict protein_function most prediction_methods explicitly require a set of negative examplesproteins that are known not carrying out a particular function however gene_ontology go almost always only provides the knowledge that proteins carry out a particular function and functional_annotations of proteins are incomplete go structurally organizes more than tens_of go terms and a protein is annotated with several or dozens of these terms for these reasons the negative_examples of a protein can greatly help distinguishing true_positive examples of the protein from such a large candidate go space results in this paper we present a novel approach_called neggoa to select negative_examples specifically neggoa takes_advantage of the ontology structure available annotations and potentiality of additional annotations of a protein to choose negative_examples of the protein we compare neggoa with other negative_examples selection algorithms and find that neggoa produces much fewer false_negatives than them we incorporate the selected negative_examples into an efficient function prediction model to predict the functions of proteins in yeast human mouse and fly neggoa also demonstrates improved accuracy than these comparing algorithms across various evaluation metrics in addition neggoa is less suffered from incomplete annotations of proteins than these comparing methods availability_and the matlab and r codes are available at https sites google com site guoxian neggoa gene_ontology consortium goc an international effort to provide controlled structured vocabularies for molecular_biology that serve as terminologies classifications and ontologies to further data_integration analysis and reasoning over the past_decade has been regularly updating the use of controlled_vocabularies to describe go terms and also the structure relationship among terms goc and partners also provide go annotations of gene_products i e proteins to describe their biological_functions from molecular to organism levels recent_advances in highthroughput techniques produced various proteomic_data and also accumulated some go annotations of these data yet the pace of annotating the biological_roles of these proteins by wet_lab is far lagging behind the influx of biological data on the other hand the knowledge of functional_roles of proteins can boost the pace of drug_development understanding the life process and many other potential applications therefore many groups have been applying machine_learning based_methods to take advantage of the available wealth of biological data to automatically predict protein_function and show the feasibility despite advances in computational function prediction few groups take into account the imbalanced nature of protein_function and the sparsity of go annotations this is because go mainly provides the association that a protein is annotated with a go term but rarely specifies which terms are not annotated to that protein the unspecified association between a protein and a term should not be simply treated as a negative examplethe protein is not annotated with that term this association may not be experimentally confirmed or appended into go database by go curators which arises due to lack of experimental resources biologists research_interests to date there are more than go terms each term corresponds to a distinct biological_function but a protein is often annotated with several or dozens of these terms for these reasons it is difficult to distinguish true_positive examples of a protein from such a large number of candidate terms many function prediction_algorithms ask for explicit positive_and examples to achieve discriminative predictions however go mainly provides the positive examples and rarely records the negative_examples of a protein some approaches directly utilize available positive annotations and ppi_networks or other data_sources i e amino_acid and domain families to rank relevant terms of proteins and predict the most relevant terms as positive annotations some positive unlabeled learning algorithms taking_advantage of positive and unlabeled data are introduced into protein_function for example took proteins annotated with the target term as labeled data while proteins annotated with other terms instead of the target term as unlabeled data this setting is motivated by the assumption that proteins currently not annotated with the target term might be annotated with the term as more evidences accumulated next they automatically selected negative_examples from the unlabeled data in the learning_process in this paper we introduce an approach_called neggoa to select negative_examples of proteins neggoa takes_advantage of a hierarchical semantic_similarity between go terms to exploit the go hierarchy to account for the evolvement of annotations it applies downward random_walks with restart on the hierarchy and on the empirical conditional_probability that two terms co annotated to a protein to model the missing annotations next it integrates the available annotations of a protein and potentiality of missing annotations to select negative_examples of the protein the empirical study on archived goa files of yeast human mouse and fly genomes shows the proposed neggoa makes much fewer false_negative predictions than recently_proposed and related approaches in addition by incorporating the negative_examples selected by neggoa or by these related approaches into swsn a gaussian random field based algorithm for label propagation with positive examples and selected negative_examples neggoa also achieves more accurate prediction than these approaches across various evaluation metrics
