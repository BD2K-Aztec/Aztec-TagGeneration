structural_bioinformatics pconsc combination of direct information methods and alignments improves contact_prediction recently several new contact prediction_methods have been published they use i large sets of multiple aligned sequences and ii assume that correlations between columns in these alignments can be the results of indirect interaction these methods are clearly superior to earlier methods when it comes to predicting contacts in proteins here we demonstrate that combining predictions from two prediction_methods psicov and plmdca and two alignment_methods hhblits and jackhmmer at four different e value cutoffs provides a relative_improvement of in comparison with the best single method exceeding correct predictions for one contact_prediction per residue availability the source_code for pconsc along with supplementaryprotein structure_prediction ab_initio is one of the longest standing challenges in structural_biology initial methods for prediction showed little success when tested blindly because of insurmountable dimensionality of the unrestrained search_space one approach to enhance the structure_prediction of a protein is to predict interacting residues for use as constraints during the folding_process however until recently the accuracy of contact predictors has been limited this was overcome by using a large number of sequences and applying a global model describing direct and indirect interactions it has been shown that this information is sufficient for structure predictions here we examine whether it is possible to combine alternative alignment and prediction_methods to improve the contact predictions further in conclusion the benchmark data show that pconsc a random_forest approach combining four jackhmmer alignments and four hhblits alignments at e value cut_offs of and each and both psicov and plmdca provides a relative_improvement of in prediction precision percentage_points in absolute terms for pconsc on average nearly three quarters of the top l predictions seem to be correct this result is robust and holds also for other definitions of true and false contacts e g c distances different distance cut_offs etc supplementary_material the question of feasibility of predicted contacts for structure modeling is out of the scope of this article as is the discussion on potential other causes of strong evolutionary couplings such as alternative conformers multimeric contacts and functional_implications it has not escaped our notice that the progress in the field of evolution based contact_prediction has been absolutely remarkable we have moved from being able to predict a handful of contacts per protein with a relatively low precision with mutualinformation methods to predicting hundreds with astounding accuracy
