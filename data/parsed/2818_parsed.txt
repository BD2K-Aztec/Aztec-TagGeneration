maxbin an automated binning algorithm to recover genomes from multiple metagenomic_datasets the recovery of genomes from metagenomic_datasets is a critical step to defining the functional_roles of the underlying uncultivated populations we previously_developed maxbin an automated binning approach for high_throughput recovery of microbial_genomes from metage nomes here we present an expanded binning algorithm maxbin which recovers genomes from co assembly of a collection of metagenomic_datasets tests on simulated_datasets revealed that maxbin is highly_accurate in recovering individual_genomes and the application of maxbin to several metagenomes from environmental_samples demonstrated that it could achieve two complementary goals recovering more bacterial_genomes compared to binning a single sample as well as comparing the microbial_community between different sampling environments availability_and maxbin is freely_available sourceforge net_projects maxbin under bsd_license recovering individual_genomes from metagenomic_samples remains a difficult_task since sequences of all microbial_populations are sampled simultaneously however it is a critical procedure to understand the functional potential of the uncultivated microbes in natural and engineered ecosystems binning is a process to classify unassembled reads or assembled_contigs into discrete clusters in which one bin represents one genome predominant binning approaches include clustering by nucleotide frequencies or sequence coverages automating the binning process provides a high_throughput method to recover microbial_genomes from metagenomes we previously_developed maxbin an automated binnning algorithm that classifies assembled genomic_sequences from metagenomic_datasets based on both tetranucleotide frequencies and sequence coverages maxbin automatically estimates the bin number from the target metagenome classifies the sequences into genome bins and measures the coverage levels for the binned genomes in the metagenome in total and draft_genomes were recovered from two cellulolytic bacterial consortia enriched from compost using maxbin demonstrating its utility in recovering the genomes of uncultivated microbes recovering genomes from multiple samples may improve the performance of binning algorithms a differential coverage binning approach was developed to use the coverage_information of the contigs from two metagenomic_samples to bin genomes by plotting them on a two_dimensional map binning tools that employ multiple samples also demonstrated better performances when v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com two or more samples are co assembled and binned here we describe maxbin the next generation of the maxbin algorithm that recovers genomes from co assembly of multiple metagenomic_samples by exploiting contig coverage levels across multiple metagenomic_datasets maxbin achieves better binning results than binning individual metagenomic_samples in comparison to other binning algorithms that utilize multiple metagenomic_datasets maxbin is highly_accurate in recovering genomes from simulated metagenomes the ability of maxbin to measure the coverage levels of the genome bins also allows comparisons of the genomeresolved microbial_community across multiple samples the performances of maxbin was compared to three other automated binning software groopm concoct and metabat using metagenomic_datasets simulated by metasim and assembled by megahit benchmarking the tools using different minimum contig length settings and bps revealed that maxbin performed relatively well in terms of f score which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall compared to other binning tools it was also ranked first in tests involving or more samples indicating its accuracy in classifying contigs into distinct genomes maxbin was also applied to two sets of real metagenomes one set consists of two cellulolytic consortia adapted from compost the other set contains ten human_microbiome hmp datasets binning the co assembly of the two compost metagenomes yielded bins surpassing the number of bins generated by binning the two metagenomes separately and bins bins produced by individual binning of the metagenomes are mostly present in the coassembly and more than half of the bins uniquely belong to the co assembled metagenome the co assembly of the ten hmp metagenomes sampled from five body sites was also binned using maxbin the co assembled metagenome yielded many more genome bins compared to individual binning of each metagenomic_dataset in average clustering the ten hmp samples based on the coverage levels of the genome bins suggested that similar body sites share similar microbial_community demonstrating how maxbin helps users compare microbial content among a number of distinct sampling environments
