stochdecomp matlab_package for noise decomposition in stochastic biochemical_systems motivation stochasticity is an indispensable aspect of biochemical_processes at the cellular_level studies on how the noise enters and propagates in biochemical_systems provided us with non trivial insights into the origins of stochasticity in total however they constitute a patchwork of different theoretical_analyses results here we present a flexible and widely_applicable noise decomposition tool that allows us to calculate contributions of individual reactions to the total variability of a systems output with the package it is therefore possible to quantify how the noise enters and propagates in biochemical_systems we also demonstrate and exemplify using the jak_stat signalling_pathway that the noise contributions resulting from individual reactions can be inferred from data experimental_data along with bayesian parameter_inference the method is based on the linear noise approximation which is assumed to provide a reasonable representation of analyzed systems availability_and http sourceforge net p stochde comp the question which molecular_species or parts of a network contribute most of the variability of a system or are responsible for most of the information_loss has attracted_much in recent_years numerous studies have analyzed noise in signalling_networks in detail and decomposed the noise into contributions attributable to fluctuations in messenger_rna and protein current software implementations offer a broad range of stochastic modeling_methods to analyze stochastic properties of biochemical dynamics these tools however focus only indirectly on origins and propagation of stochasticity to our knowledge a software_package to provide decomposition of noise into individual sources has been lacking recently we developed a flexible and simple method to analyze how the structure of biochemical_networks gives rise to noise in its outputs in principle this allows us to efficiently calculate the contribution each reaction makes to the variability in all concentrations for any network which can be modelled within the linear noise approximation lna framework origins of variability can be therefore assigned to individual reactions and arbitrarily defined network_components moreover if experimental_data are available and a posterior of model_parameters can be generated the contribution of individual reactions can be estimated from data along with the parameters later in the text we provide a general description of the package details are presented in the supplementary_information which includes theoretical_foundations of the method user_manual and examples in a comprehensive analysis of the jak_stat signalling_pathway we infer individual contributions from experimental_data published in
