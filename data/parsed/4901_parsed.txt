databases_and webprot eg e a collaborative web_based for editing biomedical_ontologies webprot eg e is an open_source web_application for editing owl ontologies it contains several features to aid collaboration including support for the discussion of issues change notification and revision based change tracking webprot eg e also features a simple user_interface which is geared towards editing the kinds of class descriptions and annotations that are prevalent throughout bio medical ontologies moreover it is possible to configure the user_interface using views that are optimized for editing open biomedical ontology obo class descriptions and metadata some of these views are shown in the supplementary_material and can be seen in webprot eg e itself by configuring the project as an obo project availability_and webprot eg e is freely_available for use on the web at http webprotege stanford edu it is implemented_in and javascript using the owl api and the google web toolkit all major browsers are supported for users who do not wish to host their ontologies on the stanford servers webprot eg e is available as a web app that can be run locally using a servlet container such as tomcat binaries source_code are available under an open_source atontologies are important artefacts in bioinformatics and life_sciences many biomedical_ontologies such as the ones made available in the bioportal the open biomedical ontology obo library and the ontobee platform are published and exchanged as owl ontology documents furthermore biomedical_ontologies are typically developed collaboratively by groups of experts who may receive incremental input from the end_user community however although there have been some domain specific wiki based tools for the collaborative editing of biomedical knowledge web_based support for community_based owl ontology development is severely lacking in this article we present webprot eg ea web_based for the collaborative development of owl ontologies although the latest_version of this tool supports the complete owl language the default configuration of its customizable user_interface ui is primarily geared towards lightweight ontology editing it is possible to configure the user_interface with owl specific views please see the webprot eg e user guide for more details http tinyurl com webprotege editing owl in particular webprot eg e provides out of the box views that support a fragment of the language that is useful for capturing biomedical knowledge and is traditionally catered for by tools such as oboedit moreover webprot eg e supplies user_interface views that are optimized for editing the rich obo term metadata and definitions that are commonly associated with biomedical_ontologies we believe that these obo tailored ui views along with collaborative development functionality make webprot eg e an attractive tool for the community_based development of biomedical_ontologies
