structural_genomics of histone tail recognition the structural_genomics of histone tail recognition web_server is an open_access resource that presents within mini articles all publicly_available experimental_structures of histone_tails in complex with human proteins each article is composed of interactive d slides that dissect the structural mechanism underlying the recognition of specific sequences and histone_marks a concise text html linked to interactive graphics guides the reader through the main features of the interaction this resource can be used to analyze and compare binding_modes across multiple histone recognition modules to evaluate the chemical tractability of binding_sites involved in epigenetic signaling and design small_molecule post_translational of histone proteins_regulate chromatin compaction mediate epigenetic_regulation of transcription and control cellular_differentiation in health and disease a variety of epigenetic_marks are deposited removed and sensed individually and in combinations by so_called writers erasers and readers of the histone code most posttranslational_modifications occur at lysine_residues on the n_terminal unstructured portion of histones the structural mechanisms_underlying specific recognition of histone tail sequences and post_translational are central to the emerging concept of chromatin as a complex signaling platform where diverse epigenetic_marks can make or break circuits in a synergistic or antagonistic manner additionally the binding_mode of individual histone tail side_chains to catalyticpage
