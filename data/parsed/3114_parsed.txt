sequence_analysis msaprobs multiple_sequence based on pair hidden_markov and partition_function posterior_probabilities motivation multiple_sequence is of central importance to bioinformatics and computational_biology although a large number of algorithms for computing a multiple_sequence have been designed the efficient computation of highly_accurate multiple_alignments is still a challenge results we present msaprobs a new and practical multiple_alignment algorithm for protein_sequences the design of msaprobs is based on a combination of pair hidden_markov and partition functions to calculate posterior_probabilities furthermore two critical bioinformatics techniques namely weighted probabilistic consistency transformation and weighted profileprofile alignment are incorporated to improve alignment_accuracy assessed using the popular benchmarks balibase prefab sabmark and oxbench msaprobs achieves statistically_significant accuracy improvements over the existing top performing aligners including clustalw mafft muscle probcons and probalign furthermore msaprobs is optimized for multi core cpus by employing a multi_threaded design leading to a competitive execution time compared to other aligners availability the source_code of msaprobs written in c is freely and publicly_available from http msaprobs sourceforge net multiple_sequence is of central importance to bioinformatics and computational_biology the approach for producing an optimal multiple_sequence is to simultaneously align multiple_sequences using dynamic_programming unfortunately this approach is impractical for alignments of more than a few sequences due to its high_computational therefore many heuristics have been proposed to compute nearly optimal alignments such as progressive alignment iterative alignment and alignment based on profile_hidden state of the art multiple sequence_alignment tend to share some common techniques to improve alignment_accuracy including combining iterative alignment with progressive alignment and introducing consistency based schemes these algorithms are typically assessed on publicly_available to whom correspondence should be addressed benchmark_data including balibase prefab sabmark van and oxbench currently the best performing multiple sequence_alignment based on these benchmark tests are t coffee mafft muscle probcons and probalign clustalw is historically one of the most popular multiple_sequence programs with more than citations in the isi_web complying with the typical progressive alignment pipeline t coffee introduced a consistency based objective_function coffee to progressive alignment by employing a primary library generated from pairwise global and local_alignments to form three way alignments mafft uses the fast_fourier method for rapid identification of homologous regions it then iteratively refines alignment results after performing an initial progressive alignment the accuracy of mafft is further improved by introducing a consistency approach incorporating pairwise information into the objective_function muscle works by iteratively refining alignment results with progressive alignment at the core adopting a log expectation scoring_scheme instead of the conventional weighted_sum of pairs scoring_systems probcons employs maximum expected_accuracy as an objective_function and introduces a probabilistic consistency approach based on pair hidden_markov pair hmm posterior_probabilities to form three way alignments probalign adopts a very similar strategy to probcons but employs a partition_function to calculate posterior_probabilities instead of using a pair hmm in this article we present msaprobs a new and practical multiple protein sequence_alignment algorithm designed by combining a pairhmm and a partition_function to calculate posterior_probabilities we further investigate two critical bioinformatics techniques namely weighted probabilistic consistency transformation and weighted profileprofile alignment to achieve high alignment_accuracy in addition msaprobs is optimized for modern multicore cpus by employing a multi_threaded design in order to reduce execution time assessed on the four popular benchmarks balibase prefab sabmark and oxbench msaprobs demonstrates significant alignment_accuracy improvements over several leading aligners clustalw mafft muscle probcons and probalign with competitive execution time since t coffee has been proven to be inferior to mafft muscle and probcons in these papers msaprobs we have decided not to include the comparison to it clustalw is compared because of its very fast speed see the results section
