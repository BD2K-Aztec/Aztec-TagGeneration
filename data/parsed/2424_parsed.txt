gene_expression individual_level analysis of differential_expression of genes and pathways for personalized_medicine motivation the differential_expression focusing on inter group comparison can capture only differentially_expressed de genes at the population level which may mask the heterogeneity of differential_expression in individuals thus to provide patient specific information for personalized_medicine it is necessary to conduct differential_expression at the individual_level results we proposed a method to detect de genes in individual disease samples by using the disrupted ordering in individual disease samples in both simulated_data and real paired cancer normal sample data this method showed excellent_performance it was found to be insensitive to experimental batch_effects and data normal ization the landscape of stable gene_pairs in a particular type of normal_tissue could be predetermined using previously accumulated data based on which dysregulated genes and pathways for any disease sample can be readily detected the usefulness of the rankcomp method in clinical_settings was exemplified by the identification and application of prognostic_markers for lung_cancer the differential_expression methods on intergroup comparison for identifying disease related genes can be classified into two broad categories the intensity based_methods such as t test sam and limma and the rank based_methods such as wilcoxon_signed wilcoxon_rank and rp of the rankbased methods there is a special_type of method using the foldchange ordering information such as rp rcos and fcros in general these methods first entail ranking fold_change values within each pairwise_comparison between two types of samples then calculate a fold_change rank ordering statistic for each gene the significance of the observed statistic could be determined by using a permutation_test e g rp or probability_distribution e g fcros the rank based_methods usually have some advantages in comparison with the intensity based_methods such as robustness against outlier values and favorable power efficiency in some cases however both the above_mentioned intensity based and rankbased methods are designed to detect the population level de genes and cannot provide patient specific differential_expression information taking the heterogeneous nature of disease into account several outlier_detection methods including copa os ort most and others are developed to detect genes that are dysregulated in subsets of disease samples however they are more sensitive to various technical_artifacts especially experimental batch_effects caused by differences in laboratory conditions reagent lots and personnel in general batch_effects can introduce serious problems in translating experimental_findings to clinical_settings for example because of this problem an optimized threshold value of the risk_score summarizing the expression levels of signature genes determined from a set of training samples cannot be directly applied to other samples usually in validation_studies data_normalization is required for independently extracted samples to make all data having nearly the same scale as the training samples however current normalization_methods that are used to adjust for systematic technical_artifacts are usually not able to remove batch_effects they may even distort biological_signals more fundamentally large interindividual_variation in gene_expression will exacerbate the problem of threshold setting for risk_stratification to tackle this difficult problem researchers have proposed to make use of the relative ordering information of gene_expression within each sample considering that the relative ordering of gene_expression within each sample would be rather robust against batch_effects and insensitive to data_normalization the relative ordering of gene_expression is overall stable in a particular type of normal_human but widely disturbed in diseased_tissue taking this into account a method of detecting to whom correspondence should be addressed de genes in individual disease samples is here proposed using both simulated_data and real paired cancernormal data this method was shown to have excellent_performance for individual_level analyses of dysregulated genes and pathways the use of this method in clinical_contexts was exemplified by the identification and application of prognostic_markers to risk_stratification of lung_cancer patients according to the dysregulation status of signature in each patient rather than a predefined risk threshold value the overall stable ordering of gene_expression in a normal_human may reflect the biological reality that the normal state should be robust against various perturbations during the transition from the normal state to a disease_state the ordering of gene_expression residing in a diseased_tissue may be subject to extensive changes which could be sufficient to reveal patient specific differential_expression information as demonstrated by the results based on both simulated_data and real paired cancernormal sample data one unique advantage of the present relative ordering based method is that it is insensitive to batch_effects and data_normalization and thus can directly use microarray_data from different data_sources in particular the landscape of stable gene_pairs in a particular type of normal_tissue can be pre determined using previously accumulated data of normal samples collected for the study of different disorders on the tissue and could become increasingly stable and reliable along with data accumulation of normal samples based on the landscape dysregulated genes and pathways for an individual disease sample of this tissue can be readily detected analysis of individualized de genes could have important_applications first it can be of value in the practice of personalized_medicine for prognostic risk_stratification the present method can directly stratify patients at the individual_level based on the dysregulation status of signature in each patient optimal risk threshold value that is determined from a set of training samples using a risk scoring_method usually needs to be redetermined in independent samples because of technical and biological_variations another possible application of the rankcomp method is in addressing the scarcity of normal tissue_samples which are often rare because of the invasive nature of sample_collection fortunately normal samples for a particular type of tissue generated in different laboratories for the study of different disorders are often collected in public_repositories using these normal samples this method can be used to predetermine the landscape of stable expression ordering of gene_pairs for that particular type of tissue then based on this landscape dysregulated genes and pathways for any disease sample of this tissue can be readily detected in this way the present method makes it possible to maximize the reuse of accumulated data for normal tissue_samples and facilitate the research of human disease nevertheless the present method also has several limitations first the rankcomp method may have insufficient power to detect genes whose differential_expression causes minor changes in the gene ranking profile fortunately even if a certain number of de genes go undetected in a given disease sample shifting the focus of the analysis from individual genes to pathways tends to produce relatively robust results despite insufficient power second the analysis presented here was performed only on microarray_data from the same platform because the ordering of gene_expression is sensitive to microarray_platforms to some degree one possible way of addressing this limitation is to filter out gene_pairs with unstable ordering in datasets produced by different platforms
