systems_biology ntfd a stand alone application for the non targeted detection of stable_isotope compounds in gc_ms data most current stable_isotope based methodologies are targeted and focus only on the well described aspects of metabolic_networks here we present ntfd non targeted tracer fate detection a software for the non targeted analysis of all detectable compounds derived from a stable_isotope tracer present in a gc_ms data_set in contrast to traditional metabolic_flux approaches ntfd does not depend on any a priori_knowledge or library information to obtain dynamic information on metabolic_pathway activity ntfd determines mass_isotopomer distributions for all detected and labeled compounds these data provide information on relative fluxes in a metabolic_network the graphical_user allows users to import gc_ms data in netcdf format and export all information into a tab separated format availability ntfd is c and qt based and it is freely_available under an open_source pre compiled packages for the installation on debian and redhat based linux distributions as well as windows operating_systems along with example data are provided for download at http ntfd mit edu with the advent of systems_biology scientists now have the ability to probe and quantify the transcriptome proteome and metabolome of virtually any organism including uniformly or singly labeled carbon nitrogen or sulfur tracers in the case of deuterium care must be taken as the deuterium effect may cause labeled and unlabeled compounds to elute at different retention_times from the gc to reduce experimental_noise both experiments should be performed_simultaneously and in replicates which also enables ntfd to provide confidence_intervals for each mass_isotopomer ntfd accepts mass_spectrometric in the common netcdf format which is supported by nearly all current gc_ms instruments as an export function
