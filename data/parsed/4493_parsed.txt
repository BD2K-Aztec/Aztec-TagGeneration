sequence_analysis svviz a read viewer for validating structural_variants visualizing read_alignments is the most effective way to validate candidate structural_variants svs with existing data we present svviz a sequencing read visualizer for svs that sorts and displays only reads relevant to a candidate sv svviz works by searching input bam s for potentially relevant reads realigning them against the inferred sequence of the putative variant allele as well as the reference allele and identifying reads that match one allele better than the other separate views of the two alleles are then displayed in a scrollable web_browser view enabling a more intuitive visualization of each allele compared with the single reference_genome based view common to most current read browsers the browser view facilitates examining the evidence for or against a putative variant estimating zygosity visualizing affected genomic_annotations and manual refinement of breakpoints svviz supports data from most modern sequencing_platforms availability_and svviz is implemented in python and freely_available from http svviz github io the human eye has an unparalleled ability to identify patterns from visual representations of data although the identification of mutations from high_throughput has been largely automated visual_inspection of putative variants using tools such as the integrative_genomics igv remains an important step in ensuring the quality and relevance of these variant_calls however existing read visualizing tools such as igv are largely constrained by a reference_genome centric display model hence point_mutations can be represented easily as mismatched bases within sequencing_data but more complex structural_variants svs including insertions deletions translocations and inversions are more difficult to parse visually against the linear reference genome_sequence newer tools are able to represent short indels within sequencing_data but do not help in representing larger svs support for svs can be displayed within igv by highlighting reads with certain characteristics including read_pairs mapping to distant regions of the genome or in unexpected orientations or truncated alignments however it is difficult to identify from these highlighted discordantly mapping reads whether they all agree with a putative variant and if so which variant furthermore igv relies on the quality and completeness of the alignments provided in input bam_files which are produced en_masse against a huge reference_genome and hence may not optimally represent read support for a given variant finally most existing viewers a notable_exception being targetseqview show all read data in the vicinity of a putative sv making_it to discriminate reads supporting the sv reads supporting the reference allele and reads that are not relevant to an sv to overcome_these we present svviz a read visualizer for svs that sorts and displays only reads relevant to thepublished by oxford university press this work is written by us government employees and is in the public_domain in the us current sv as with igv svviz only visualizes variants and does not identify them svviz runs locally on a standard os x or linux desktop machine and requires as input read data a reference_genome and svs the flexible_approach employed by svviz means it can display arbitrary sv types such as translocations deletions and insertions inversions and mobile element insertions visualizations are rendered in scalable_vector svg an open web standard graphics format and shown in a locally hosted interactive web_browser viewer or exported in publication ready form svviz supports read data in bam format from any sequencing_platform including short_read illumina single and paired_end as well as mate_pair or longer read pacific_biosciences oxford nanopore or illuminas synthetic long_reads sequencing_technologies in batch mode multiple svs can be provided as input in the standard variant_call vcf producing summary_statistics and pdf or svg visualizations for hundreds_or of svs with a single command annotations such as gene models or repeats can be shown relative to each allele the genome in a bottle consortium has recently begun sequencing an ashkenazi_jewish trio from the personal genome_project with a number of high_throughput providing a rich resource for identifying and validating variants using orthogonal experimental methods svs were called from complete genomics data for mother father and son separately from these variant_calls we randomly chose an kb inversion on chromosome to visualize and validate using long mate_pair illumina data the visual representation is split into two sections the top section shows reads supporting the alternate inversion allele while the bottom section shows those supporting the reference allele each read is shown only once relative to its assigned allele for the alternate allele mate_pair reads tile across the breakpoints in both parents while no reads were found in the son all three individuals show ample coverage of the reference allele breakpoints the number of reads assigned by svviz to each allele suggests the son is homozygous reference and both parents are heterozygous for the inversion supplementaryshows the same data represented in igv with likely non reference reads sonreads supporting the
