data_and icma an integrated cardiac modeling and analysis platform icma a software framework to create d finite_element of the left_ventricle from cardiac_ultrasound or magnetic_resonance mri data has been made available as an open source_code the framework is hardware vendor independent and uses speckle_tracking endocardial border detection on ultrasound mri imaging data in the form of dicom standard american_heart segment based strain analysis can be performed using a browser_based interface the speckle_tracking border detection and model_fitting methods are implemented in c using open_source tools they are wrapped as web_services and orchestrated via a jboss based application server availability_and the source_code for icma is freely_available under mpl or gpl or lgpl license at https github com abi software laboratory icma and a standalone virtual_machine at http goo gl m ljkh for download cardiac echocardiography is a widely used modality to assess wall_motion due to its non invasiveness and comparatively lower setup costs most ultrasound vendors provide proprietary software to analyze the echocardiogram for instance ges echopac and phillipss qlab the software enables cardiologists to determine clinically relevant_parameters such as ejection_fraction regional wall strain etc however these software components are expensive tied to the vendor hardware and not open_source clinical reports generated by the software vary across vendors for the same patient data and therefore there is a lack of standardization across the vendors this makes_it to perform multisite population_based studies where data are collected from hardware developed by a multitude of vendors we developed a model guided speckle_tracking method that tracks left_ventricular in cardiac ultrasound_images the motion data are then used to fit a finite_element fem to reconstruct the ventricular geometry motion_information from one or more ultrasound views can be combined to improve the reconstructed geometry these modules are independent of each other and wall_motion data gathered from other modalities like mri can also be used diagnostic parameters such as regional strain ejectionfraction etc are determined from the model that represents the ventricular geometry using a browser_based graphical_user with a workflow similar to existing software the user can guide the geometry reconstruction_process by choosing the images to be used providing landmarks at the beginning and end r wave frames the framework v c the author published_by
