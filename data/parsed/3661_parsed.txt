data_and predicting the probability of h_k occupation at a base_pair from the genome sequence_context motivation histone_modifications regulate chromatin_structure and gene_expression although nucleosome formation is known to be affected by primary dna sequence_composition no sequence signature has been identified for histone_modifications it is known that dense h_k nucleosome sites are accompanied by a low_density of other nucleosomes and are associated with gene activation this observation suggests a different sequence_composition of h_k from other nucleosomes approach to understand the relationship between genome_sequence and chromatin_structure we studied dna_sequences at his tone modification_sites in various human cell_types we found sequence_specificity for h_k but not for other histone_modifications using the sequence specificities of h and h_k nucleo somes we developed a model that computes the probability of h_k occupation at each base_pair from the genome sequence_context results a comparison of our predictions with experimental_data suggests a high performance of our method revealing a strong association between h_k and specific genomic_dna context the high_probability of h_k occupation occurs at transcription start and termination sites exon boundaries and binding_sites of transcription regulators involved in chromatin_modification activities including his tone acetylases and enhancer and insulator associated factors thus the human_genome contains signatures for chromatin_modifications essential for gene_regulation and development our method may be applied to find new sequence_elements functioning by chro matin modulation chromatin_remodeling mediated by histone_modifications is an important mechanism for specific gene_expression however the relationship between genome_sequence and chromatin_remodeling is not well understood although dna_sequence preferences for nucleosome formation have been known since the mid s the role of histonedna interaction in nucleosome formation is subjected to debate the interplay between transcription_factors tfs and adenosine_triphosphate dependent chromatin modulating factors in regulating histone_modifications implies that histone_modifications do not follow the sequence preferences of the general h nucleosomes or the other nucleosomes that are not trimethylated at h k indeed the h_k nucleosome is preferentially enriched in the genomic_regions showing a low_density of other nucleosomes and marks an open chromatin region the advance of dna_sequencing with immunoprecipitated dna_segment associated with specific histone_modifications allows us to examine the dna_sequence compositions specific to histone_modifications in an unbiased way therefore we extracted dna_sequences of nucleosomes carrying individual histone_modifications from chip_seq and identified the features of sequences bound to histone_modifications in chip_seq using the identified sequence specificities of h_k and h nucleosomes we developed a model to compute the probabilities of h_k and h nucleosome occupation from the genome sequence_context h_k chip_seq in various human cells indicate that the loci predicted by our model to have a high_probability of the h_k sequence signature are preferentially occupied by h_k nucleosome our study provides a method for investigating the dna sequence_features of chromatin_structure furthermore our analyses show that the human_genome contains signals for chromatin_remodeling at epigenetic regulatory_elements the different sequence preferences of h_k and h nucleosomes imply distinct mechanisms in their arrangement on the genome although the h nucleosome is mainly distributed by the bending property of dna_sequences the h_k nucleosome is regulated by protein factors recognizing specific sequence compositions such as non methylated cg rich_sequence signatures the sequence specific protein factors interact with histone methylase complexes specific to h_k such as setd in mouse insertion of non methylated cpg rich sequences leads to a high_density of h_k occupation for example cfp specifically_binds to non methylated cpg rich sequences and recruits the setd complex in mouse and human prdm a meiosis specific h_k histone_methyltransferase recognizes the target_sites by the sequence_specificity and deposits h_k nucleosomes at meiosis recombination_hotspots therefore the sequence_context showing high_probability of h_k occupation at important regulatory_elements across the genome may attract chromatin modifying_factors we found consistent and distinct sequence_specificity only for h_k but not for other histone_modifications it is possible that other histone_modifications are associated with some sequence specificities that cannot be detected by the mer sequence preferences another possibility is that sequence_independent epigenetic_factors regulate other histone_modifications indeed recentlyshowed that long_non guide the h_k enrichment although the sequence_specificity of the non_coding has not yet been identified previously yuan et_al also used hmm to estimate nucleosome occupation probabilities from microarray_data of nuclease treated dna their hidden state was the occupation of nucleosome and the observations were microarray cy intensities their emission probabilities were cy intensities compared with the input dna signal cy they characterized nucleosome location based on the consecutive eight probe intensities on the other hand our purpose is to compute the occupation probabilities of different types of nucleosomes from the genomic_sequence alone we first showed that the distinctive sequence specificities of h_k and h nucleosomes are consistent among different cell_types we then used the observed sequence specificities of h and h_k to predict their occupation probabilities at each mappable base_pair from the genomic_sequence alone in our hmm_model the hidden state is the occupation of h_k or h nucleosome at a base_pair and the observed state is the genome_sequence the emission probabilities in our model are sequence specificities of h_k or h the predicted probabilities of h_k occupation are consistent with experimental_data from various human cell_types although chip_seq contain noise the probability of h_k occupying a genome region can be estimated from the sequence_reads as long as the number of reads is large enough for the statistics to be meaningful our model for predicting an h_k nucleosome map from the human_genome is similar to segal et_al s model in that we assume that nucleosome formation in a genome is a dynamic process and we calculate the nucleosome occupation probability at a locus considering all possible nucleosomes that can potentially cover the site and their forward and backward configurations in a genome however our model differs from theirs in at least three aspects first our model incorporates the specific modification status of each nucleosome and distinguishes between h and h_k occupations on the other hand segal et_al and other studies did not distinguish between h and h_k nucleosomes but considered general nucleosomes i e micrococal nuclease sensitive regions second we compute the sequence compositions of dna_segments in h nucleosomes and in h_k nucleosomes separately whereas segal et_al computed the composition in extracted dna_segments in all forms of nucleosomes after treatment of micrococcal_nuclease third we aim to infer the probabilistic occupation level of the h_k nucleosome based on the genome sequence_context whereas segal et_al computed the probabilistic positioning of a base_pair within bp nucleosomal dnas our model is based on the chip_seq chip_seq enables us to infer the probable coverage of a locus but not exact positions within nucleosomes therefore our model can only estimate the probabilistic occupation levels of h_k and h nucleosomes based on the whole_genome sequence_context in conclusion our results underscore a relationship between genome_sequence and chromatin_remodeling in addition sequence_independent epigenetic_regulation of nucleosomes also contributes to chromatin_modifications our analyses of the h_k sequence signature will be a valuable starting_point for future_studies of the genome_structure ultimately the computational_approach may help identify epigenetic and genetic_factors that regulate the chromatin_structure
