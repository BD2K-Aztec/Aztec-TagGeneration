systems_biology cellaging a tool to study segregation and partitioning in division in cell_lineages of escherichia_coli motivation cell_division in escherichia_coli is morphologically symmetric however as unwanted protein_aggregates are segregated to the cell poles and after divisions accumulate at older poles generate asymmetries in sister cells vitality novel single_molecule detection techniques allow observing aging related processes in vivo over multiple_generations informing on the underlying_mechanisms results cellaging is a tool to automatically extract information on polar segregation and partitioning in division of aggregates in e coli and on cellular vitality from time lapse parallel brightfield and fluor escence microscopy_images it performs cell segmentation alignment of brightfield and fluorescence_images lineage construction and pole age determination and it computes aging related features we exemplify its use by analyzing spatial_distributions of fluorescent protein_aggregates from images of cells across generations availability cellaging instructions and an example are available atthe division process of escherichia_coli is morphologically symmetric in favorable environments the process can be sustained indefinitely however to be sustainable e coli needs to deal with the accumulation of unwanted substances and degradation of internal_structures recent_evidence in growing populations of isogenic cells there is a continuous emergence of functional asymmetries in the vitality of sister cells which are associated to the accumulation of unwanted protein_aggregates at the cell poles namely e coli appears to use a bet hedging strategy during cell_division in that the daughter_cell inheriting the older pole of mother cell and the unwanted aggregates within exhibits slower growth and division rates as well as an increased incidence of death a recent study observed this process one event at a time showing that aggregates of rna_molecules tagged with ms green_fluorescent produced in the midcell region are quickly transported to the poles where they remain thereafter also the choice of pole was biased in that on average more aggregates moved toward the older pole little is known about the mechanisms_underlying the process of segregation and partitioning in division of unwanted aggregates in it was hypothesized that the limited diffusion of the aggregates along with cell_division and nucleoid occlusion may suffice to explain the observations other studies suggest that active transport_mechanisms may be involved to study these processes and underlying sources one needs to observe them in vivo using single_molecule visualization_techniques in growing isogenic cell_populations over several generations information_extraction from time lapse microscope images of growing cell_populations is fastidious and technically_difficult it requires large_data involves multiple_steps such as cell segmentation and tracking and requires identifying e g cell_lineages also it is necessary to extract spatiotemporal distributions of fluorescent_proteins and quantify their partitioning in divisions there are tools available to perform some of these steps e g of cell segmentation however some steps e g cell_tracking remain problematic also no tool performs all the steps needed to from the images outputting information on segregation to the cell poles and partitioning on unwanted aggregates in cell_division we present cellaging a tool that performs segmentation of e coli cells in brightfield images aligns the segmentation_results with fluorescence_images of the same cells and establishes temporal relationships between the cells additionally cellaging outputs both aging related statistics of choice and the information on the temporal evolution of the fluorescence in each cell at the pixel level in the established hierarchy of cells the program is operated via a graphical_user aside from studies of cellular_aging it allows studying the in vivo dynamics of the spatial distribution and the partitioning in division of any fluorescence tagged intracellular elements an example application is provided in supplement along with a detailed_description of the methods used by cellaging segmentation is seeded by gradient path labeling and it relies on classifiers for merging and discarding segments the classifiers were constructed using the classification and regression trees algorithm and they were trained by an expert inter frame information is used to enhance the quality of the segmentation after the automated_segmentation the results can be manually corrected as a side note we observed that cellaging because of thorough training and given consistency between images from multiple time series consistently outperformed currently available state of the art tools for the set of images that we produced in laboratory cellaging then automatically aligns the fluorescence_images with the segmentation_results then it finds cell_divisions and establishes the correspondence of the same cells between consecutive frames supplementary_material we observed that the number of errors in this step is negligible in the images used in our case study the result can be visualized by a graphical tool from which features can be selected and exported there are three categories of features see manual features relative to time series of individual cells include their area total fluorescence_intensity bias in intensity of old and new poles and the distribution of fluorescence along the major_axis of the cell these features are extracted as a function of time features relative to cell_division include the area and the total fluorescence of the mother cell when last observed its division time and the bias in daughter_cell areas or intensities after their appearance features relative to cell_populations include mean cell area and mean fluorescence_intensity during their lifetime the bias in fluorescence_intensity in the frame where the cells were first or last observed and the division time of each cell from the exported results one can either extract the full distribution of values or calculate statistics such as mean and standard_deviation the set of features calculated is intended to suffice to study segregation and partitioning in division of unwanted protein_aggregates and consequence aging however to ensure applicability of cellaging for other aims one can extract the information on the temporal evolution of each cell at a pixel level along with the information on the relationship between the cells and on the orientation of the poles of cells born during the measurement period in supplement we exemplify the usage of cellaging exemplified in by analyzing images of e coli k strain sx cells harboring the tsr venus gene under the control of lac_promoter a gift from sunny xie harvard university usa the supplement also features a performance analysis of the segmentation a description of the alignment of brightfield and confocal_images and a description of the construction of lineages finally we describe the strain induction of the target_gene and microscopy imaging example of cellaging in use images upper left are provided to cellaging bottom left which analyze the time series bottom right exported results such as spatial distribution of fluorescence inside the cell can be computed plotted using e g microsoft_excel upper right
