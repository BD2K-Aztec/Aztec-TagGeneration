genome_analysis comparative assembly hubs web accessible browsers for comparative_genomics motivation researchers now have access to large volumes of genome_sequences for comparative_analysis some generated by the plethora of public sequencing_projects and increasingly from individual efforts it is not possible or necessarily desirable that the public genome_browsers attempt to curate all these data instead a wealth of powerful_tools is emerging to empower users to create their own visualizations and browsers results we introduce a pipeline to easily generate collections of web accessible ucsc genome_browsers interrelated by an alignment it is intended to democratize our comparative_genomic browser resources serving the broad and growing community of evolutionary genomicists and facilitating easy public sharing via the internet using the alignment all annotations and the alignment itself can be efficiently viewed with reference to any genome in the collection symmetrically a new intelligently scaled alignment display makes it simple to view all changes between the genomes at all levels of resolution from substitutions to complex structural_rearrangements including duplications to demonstrate this work we create a comparative assembly hub containing escherichia_coli and shigella genomes and show examples that highlight their unique biology availability_and the source_code is available as open_source at https github com glennhickey progressivecactus the e coli and shigella genome hub is now a public hub listed on the ucsc browser public hubs web_page visualization is key to understanding functional and comparative genomic_information genome_browsers are therefore critical to the study of biology providing accessible resources for displaying annotations and alignments the ucsc_genome is one of the most popular but creating a reference genome_browser for a new genome within it previously required significant resources as it was necessary to create a mirror site to host the new reference browser separately or to work with the staff of the genome_browser to create a new reference browser within their main site assembly hubs which build on the successful track hub model make it easy to generate an individual ucsc browser simply by hosting the data in the form of flat files on any publicly addressable url this avoids users having to install and configure the substantial browser code base on their machines and by using user hosting makes updating straightforward however with access to low_cost sequencing_technology and the wealth of genomes already available users increasingly want to be able to create not only a single custom browser but also sets of genome_browsers this work is intended to meet that growing need it extends assembly hubs to allow users to quickly create comparative assembly hubs a framework of multiple genome_browsers and annotations interrelated by an alignment as part of this development we introduce a series of novel features intended to improve visualization exploration and community sharing of novel comparative_genomics data displaying multiple_genome is extremely_challenging owing to both the high_dimensionality and volume of the underlying data there are currently three main ways to visualize multiple_genome dot plots e g dagchainer vistadot circle plots e g circos genomering and linear row oriented representations e g vista jalview igv each of these visualization methods has benefits and weaknesses dots plots having two dimensions provide equivalently powerful representations of two genomes in one graphic however they are pairwise and therefore unsuitable for the display of multiple_genome circular genome plots are typically less visually cluttered than linear representations for viewing genomic_rearrangements but are less useful for the display of global multiple_sequence as might be shown at the gene or base level linear representations have the advantage that they fit neatly with the genome_browser displays and tracks and are flexible in that they work reasonably at multiple levels of resolution here we introduce a new linear displaythe snake track that to our knowledge is the first linear representation to to whom correspondence should be addressed we first describe the software pipeline for building comparative assembly hubs before describing them by example using an alignment of e coli and shigella genomes
