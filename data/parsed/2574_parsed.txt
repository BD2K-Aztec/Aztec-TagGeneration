genome_analysis isaac ultra_fast whole_genome secondary analysis on illumina sequencing_platforms an ultrafast dna_sequence aligner isaac genome alignment software that takes_advantage of high memory hardware gb and variant caller isaac variant caller have been developed we demonstrate that our combined pipeline isaac is four to five times_faster than bwa gatk on equivalent hardware with comparable accuracy as measured by trio conflict rates and sensitivity we further show that isaac is effective in the detection of disease_causing and can easily economically be run on commodity hardware availability isaac has an open_source and can be obtained at https motivated by a growing need for faster turnaround times for whole_genome wgs_data analysis we present here a novel alignment and variant_calling pipeline that is able to rapidly align wgs_data and deliver high_quality variant_calls on a single server node the aligner isaac genome alignment software is designed to align next_generation data with low_error single or paired ends speed improvements come from the fact that the isaac aligner has been designed to take full advantage of all the computational power available on a single server node as a result the isaac aligner scales well over a broad range of hardware architectures and alignment performance improves with hardware capabilities i e clock speed number of cores io bandwidth and memory the typical endto end time to align a human dataset from bcl or fastq_files to a sorted and duplicate marked bam_file is h on an amazon high memory quadruple extra large instance and can be as fast as h on an optimized high end server see_supplementary for specs beyond speed and scalability the isaac aligner also delivers ease of use flexibility and robustness the creation of sorted duplicate marked bam_files from bcl or fastq_files is done in a single operation alleviating the need to rewrite large bam_files multiple times in a typical workflow additional command_line options are available to the expert user to finely control the algorithms inputs outputs and computational performance supplementary section s describes the details of the isaac aligner algorithm and its implementation the isaac variant caller calls snps and small_indels using a bayesian_framework to compute probabilities over diploid genotype states the isaac variant caller uses an internal read realignment routine to improve variant call accuracy near indels and includes a site_specific error dependency term supplementary section s provides a detailed explanation of the isaac variant caller algorithm and implementation the isaac variant caller is designed to efficiently genotype and provide output for all variant and non variant genomic_loci as genome vcf files gvcf manuscript in preparation https sites google com site gvcftools a convention for efficiently representing whole_genome output in vcf format http www genomes org node to demonstrate the performance of the isaac aligner and variant caller pipeline isaac we compare the quality of the variant_calls and the time to answer of this pipeline with the community standard combination of burrowswheeler alignment bwa and the genome_analysis tool kit gatk we also demonstrate that isaac can successfully detect a clinically deleterious variant in a neonatal sample
