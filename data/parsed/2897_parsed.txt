metacluster a two round binning approach for metagenomic_data for low_abundance species in a noisy sample motivation metagenomic binning remains an important topic in metagenomic_analysis existing unsupervised binning methods for next_generation ngs_reads do not perform well on i samples with low_abundance species or ii samples even with high_abundance when there are many extremely low_abundance species these two problems are common for real metagenomic_datasets binning methods that can solve these problems are desirable results we proposed a two round binning method metacluster that aims at identifying both low_abundance and high_abundance species in the presence of a large amount of noise due to many extremely low_abundance species in summary metacluster uses a filtering strategy to remove noise from the extremely low_abundance species it separate reads of high_abundance species from those of low_abundance species in two different rounds to overcome the issue of low coverage for low_abundance species multiple w values are used to group reads with overlapping w mers whereas reads from high_abundance species are grouped with high_confidence based on a large w and then binning expands to low_abundance species using a relaxed shorter w compared to the recent tools toss and metacluster metacluster can find more species especially those with low_abundance of say to and can achieve better sensitivity_and using less memory and running time availability http i cs hku hk alse metacluster contact chin cs hku hkmetagenomics is the study of genomes of multiple species from environmental_samples such as soil sea_water and the human_gut successful metagenomic_projects provide deeper insight into the microbial world for example the diversity of microbes in the human_gut has been found to be related to common diseases such as inflammatory_bowel ibd and gastrointestinal disturbance high_throughput next_generation ngs techniques can sequence_reads short dna_fragments from a sample containing genomes of multiple species an important step in metagenomic_analysis is grouping reads from similar species together which is known as binning existing binning algorithms fall into two main categories supervised methods and unsupervised methods supervised methods align_reads to known genomes and group reads aligned to similar genomes to whom correspondence should be addressed together since up to of bacteria found in environmental_samples are unknown or cannot be cultured and separated in laboratories most reads cannot be aligned and binned instead of aligning_reads to known genomes directly some semi_supervised methods use taxonomic markers e g reca rpob and s rrna to classify reads into different groups however the precision of these methods may be low because species may contain multiple_markers and different species may share markers moreover since only a small part of the genome or reads contains these taxonomic markers most of the reads cannot be binned by these methods when the corresponding genomes are unknown unsupervised methods usually bin reads based on three observations a the k_mer frequency from reads of a genome is usually linearly_proportional to that of the genomes abundance b sufficiently_long w mers are usually unique in each genome and c the short q mer frequency distributions or q mer distributions in short of individual sufficiently long_reads sampled from the same genome or similar genomes are similar abundancebin groups reads based on observation a but fails when the species in the sample have similar abundance toss bins reads based on observations a and b and since toss relies on abundancebin to handle genomes with different abundances it carries all the shortcomings of abundancebin metacluster has three phases phase groups reads together based on observation b phase derives the q mer distribution of each group and phase merges the groups of reads based on observation c by the well known k_means approach metacluster handles high_abundance species with different abundances in phase by having similar numbers of groups for each species high_abundance species will have more reads in their groups metacluster works reasonably well for those species whose abundance sequencing_depth of at least even in a sample with species for easy discussion we classify the abundances into three categories i high_abundance at least ii low_abundance to and iii extremely low_abundance at most there are at least two problems that metacluster fails to address i interference from extremely low_abundance species metacluster does not perform well even for high_abundance species when there are many extremely low_abundance species in the sample shows an example of species in a sample with only five extremely low_abundance species for which metacluster is not able to bin any of the low_abundance species in fact none of the existing binning tools can handle these two problems which are common in real_datasets for example in samples from real applications there are usually many reads can be of the total reads sampled from extremely low_abundance genomes and there is usually a portion of low_abundance species that may be significant to the biological system e g an ideal binning solution should be able to identify all species regardless of their abundance however it is very difficult to bin extremely lowabundance species and we leave it as an open_problem to identify all these extremely low_abundance species in this article we aim at identifying low_abundance species in addition to indentifying highabundance species when there is interference from the extremely low_abundance species we first discuss why the aforementioned two problems are difficult to solve we evaluate the performance of metacluster on simulated_data metacluster abundancebin and toss the software_tool of toss was obtained through a private communication with the authors of the article are the latest unsupervised binning tools for ngs_reads however toss and abundancebin are very slow toss based on output of abundancebin cannot finish any of the datasets in a week abundancebin can only finish the smallest dataset with million_reads from species but the result is not satisfactory and all the reads grouped together even though the species are of uneven abundance since the performance of toss relies on abundancebin results it is likely that toss may not perform well for species with similar abundance as metacluster outperforms abundancebin and toss in many situations we mainly compare the performances of metacluster and metacluster all experiments were performed on a unix machine with cpu of intel_xeon x ghz metagenomics binning remains a crucial step in metagenomics analysis existing unsupervised binning algorithms fail to bin reads from low_abundance species or cannot bin reads from highabundance species when there are many reads from extremely low_abundance species in this article we introduce metacluster that overcomes these two problems by binning the reads in two rounds with a filtering step to remove noise from extremely lowabundance species metacluster outperforms existing binning algorithms for both simulated and real_biological
