structural_bioinformatics rasp rapid modeling of protein side chain conformations motivation modeling of side chain conformations constitutes an indispensable effort in protein_structure modeling proteinprotein_docking and protein design thanks to an intensive attention to this field many of the existing programs can achieve reasonably good and comparable prediction_accuracy moreover in our previous work on cis rr we argued that the prediction with few atomic_clashes can complement the current existing_methods for subsequent analysis and refinement of protein_structures however these recent efforts to enhance the quality of predicted side_chains have been accompanied by a significant increase of computational_cost results in this study by mainly focusing on improving the speed of side chain conformation prediction we present a rapid side chain predictor called rasp to achieve a much faster speed with a comparable accuracy to the best existing_methods we not only employ the clash elimination strategy of cis rr but also carefully optimize energy_terms and integrate different search algorithms in comprehensive benchmark testings rasp is over one order of magnitude faster times over cis rr than the recently_developed while achieving comparable or even better accuracy availability rasp is available to non commercial users at our websiteprotein side chain conformation prediction or side chain packing is a crucial step in both protein design and protein_structure modeling as such during the last two decades many efforts have been dedicated to the prediction of protein side chain conformations leading to the development of many side chain packing programs in general these side chain packing programs formulate the side chain conformation prediction_problem as a combinatorial search problem based on discrete side to whom correspondence should be addressed chain conformations called rotamers the problem usually involves three key_elements summarized as follows i a rotamer library of discrete side chain conformations although some approaches attempted to model the continuous side chain conformations most of the current methods rely on discrete rotamers which can significantly reduce computational expense ii an energy function for rotamer selection a number of energy_functions for side chain packing have been proposed ranging from simple van_de waals potential to more complicated potentials by incorporating hydrogen_bonding term solvation term and statistical orientation term to improve_the iii a search algorithm the use of rotamer library leads to the formulation of the side chain packing problem as a combinatorial problem which finds the best solution from all the possible combinations constrained by side chain rotamers many search algorithms have been proposed to solve the combinatorial problem including dead_end elimination dee simulated_annealing monte_carlo a integer_programming self consistent mean field and graph_theory based_approach the combining of these search algorithms is critical in side chain prediction for example to achieve a fast speed scwrl and scatd combine dee branch and bound and tree decomposition search as summarized above the appropriate consideration of the above three elements is critical in developing rotamer based side chain packing programs thanks to the intensive previous_efforts the prediction of side chain conformations has become more and more accurate however the improvement of accuracy usually comes with the increase of computational time for example although the recently_developed side chain packing program scrwl from dunbracks laboratory and the program cis rr developed in our laboratory have an improvement of in accuracy over scrwl their speed is over times slower than scrwl indicating the challenge in achieving both high_accuracy and high_speed in the prediction of protein side chain conformations in this study by carefully considering the key_elements summarizedpage determination of side chain conformations on a fixed protein_backbone plays an important role in protein_structure protein design and molecular_docking in hitherto many methods have been developed to predict protein side chain conformations although the prediction has become more and more accurate the gradual improvement of accuracy usually comes with the dramatic_increase of computational_cost in this study in order to improve speed without at expense of prediction_accuracy we have developed a more powerful program called rasp the tests showed that rasp achieves high_prediction comparable to the best existing_methods but is much faster the good performance of rasp lies in its elegant integration of the strategies used in the existing_approaches which is contributed by three critical_points discussed as follows one is the design of energy function to achieve both high_accuracy and high_speed previous_studies have indicated that van_der potential alone is able to achieve a high_accuracy in prediction of side chain conformations suggesting the dominant role it plays in side chain packing although the incorporation of other energy_terms could improve the accuracy of side chain packing the consideration of complicated energy_terms would aggravate the computational expenses therefore in developing an effective energy function for side chain packing all the individual energy_terms were carefully implemented for fast speed and high_accuracy to calculate van_der potential the hydrogen_atoms were not represented explicitly and their effects through parameterization could be captured in the heavy_atoms that are linked to hydrogen_atoms supplementary as shown in supplementary table s among the heavy_atoms of the same type the ones with more hydrogen links have longer van_de waals radii for simplicity and fast computation the effect of dihedral cc ss is omitted in the disulfide term and the hydrogen_bonding term only depends on the orientation between the hydrogen donor and hydrogen acceptor the careful_consideration of these energy_terms led us to develop an effective energy function for side chain packing as demonstrated by our testing described above rasp is not only much faster than cis rr but also is slightly better than cis rr with improvement in both and accuracy supplementary table s and s the second is the use of clash detection guided rotamer relaxation after side chain packing process further elimination of the atomic_clashes in protein_structures with modeled side_chains can lead to more harmonic structures our recently_developed cis rr coupled side chain packing process with the elimination of atomic_clashes by using clash detection guided iterative search in rotamer relaxation although in cis rr both the accuracy of side chain packing and removal of atomic_clashes can be achieved it is time consuming in rasp we uncoupled the side chain packing process and atomic clash elimination process the rotamer relaxation was performed on the side_chains that are involved in atomic_clashes by doing this we found that rotamer relaxation_process in rasp can effectivelyeliminate the atomic_clashes without incurring the computation time significantly supplementary moreover the elimination of atomic_clashes has led to a slight_increase of prediction_accuracy the scwrl test_set was used for the evaluation total time for the prediction is evaluated clashes are those residue pairs whose distance is the summation of their van_de waals radii dihedrals within bullet are considered correct the third is the implementation of effective search algorithms to achieve a fast and convergent search we designed a combinatorial search_strategy involving graph_theory based_approach which decomposed the graph of contact residue pairs to bi connected components see section for a bi connected component of n residues its time complexity is o m n m is the average rotamer number in a residue for an exhaustive_search like branchand terminate approach while for monte_carlo search the time complexity is o mn therefore in design of search algorithms we used mc search instead of the exhaustive branch and terminate search for a large bi connected component with over residues indeed we found use of mc search can significantly reduce the computation time for large proteins supplementarycompares the performance of rasp using mc or not on scwrl test_set as can be seen from supplementary table s although the improvement by adding mc is general to nearly all proteins it varies_significantly for different proteins especially for those proteins that tend to form highly_connected graphs often occurring in large proteins of over residues mc contributes significantly to the speed improvement taken together rasp not only combines the advantages of the existing programs in both prediction_accuracy and clash elimination but also achieves a much faster speed we believe rasp would be a very useful tool for fast side chain modeling that can complement the current existing_methods in a wide_range
