systems_biology optimal_design of stimulus experiments for robust discrimination of biochemical_reaction motivation biochemical_reaction in the form of coupled ordinary_differential odes provide a powerful modeling tool for understanding the dynamics of biochemical_processes during the early_phase of modeling scientists have to deal with a large_pool of competing nonlinear models at this point discrimination experiments can be designed and conducted to obtain optimal data for selecting the most plausible model since biological ode_models have widely_distributed parameters due to e g biologic variability or experimental variations model responses become distributed therefore a robust optimal_experimental oed for model discrimination can be used to discriminate models based on their response probability_distribution functions pdfs results in this work we present an optimal_control based_methodology for designing optimal stimulus experiments aimed at robust model discrimination for estimating the time varying model response pdf which results from the nonlinear propagation of the parameter pdf under the ode dynamics we suggest using the sigma point approach using the model overlap expected likelihood as a robust discrimination criterion to measure dissimilarities between expected model response pdfs we benchmark the proposed nonlinear design approach against linearization with respect to prediction_accuracy and design quality for two nonlinear biological reaction_networks as shown the sigma point outperforms the linearization approach in the case of widely_distributed parameter_sets and or existing multiple steady_states since the sigma point approach scales linearly with the number of model parameter it can be applied to large systems for robust experimental planning availability an implementation of the method in matlab ampl is available atmathematical models of complex biological_processes provide the basis for systems understanding they are of vital importance for generating predictions of systems behavior based on hypothesized mechanisms in the case of limited experimental access to biological_systems models can help to find missing links and provide a tool to aggregate existing knowledge and data in this work we focus on mathematical_models in the form of coupled ordinary_differential odes which are being used to describe dynamics of biochemical_reaction e g signal_transduction metabolic or genetic_regulation on a deterministic semi mechanistic_basis here scientists are often facing limited or even contradicting knowledge about the underlying_mechanisms confined experimental possibilities large biological_variability as well as measurement noise this leads to largely distributed model parameter_sets which in combination with several plausible alternative model structures renders model based prediction highly uncertain therefore model based experimental_design e g optimal stimulus or additional experimental readout selection is used to generate experiments that yield optimal experimental_data to i reduce the spread in the model_parameters optimal parameter identification and or ii reduce the pool of plausible models optimal model discrimination much work on optimal experimental stimulus design oesd for biological_systems focuses on information maximization with respect to parameter identification here for a given pool of plausible ode_models oesd is used to find experimental_conditions that reduce the parameter uncertainties and thus model response variabilities the methods used to quantify parameter uncertainties and model response variabilities include linearization sigma points profile likelihood and markov_chain mcmc an oesd aiming at model discrimination for biological_systems has been addressed by few authors although measurement noise has been included a rigorous consideration of model response variabilities due to distributed parameters has been missing so_far for chemical reaction_kinetics and biotechnology there exists some work on designing dynamic stimuli for the purpose of model discrimination as has been illustrated the consideration of model response variabilities strongly improves the designed experiments and experimental data_quality therefore linearization of the systems parameter mapping has been used however by using the

systems having widely_distributed parameters an experimental_design aimed at model discrimination is typically generated at a point where existing data do not provide further discriminative information for a pool of competing validated and identifiable models with these models robust experimental_designs can be generated which presumably yield data with optimal discrimination information since predictions with ode_models depend on the model_parameters identifiability is important as it ensures the existence of a unique_solution to the parameter_estimation problem and consequently unique model_predictions a non identifiable model would yield non unique model_predictions under altered experimental_design conditions as there exists a set of several solutions to the parameter_estimation problem robustness of the experimental_design is achieved by considering i pure uncertainty about the model itself ii distributed model_predictions that arise from distributed model_parameters and iii design variabilities e g variations of the applied stimulus during the conduction of the experiment in this work part ii of design robustification for nonlinear models is considered focusing on computational efficient and accurate estimation of the nonlinear propagated parameter probability_distribution pdf in an optimal_control framework we suggest using the sigma point method as an alternative to the classical linearization approach therefore both approaches are presented applied and compared in the light of oesd for robust model discrimination assuming perfect experimental conduction in the following section we describe the essential parts of our design approach including i ode modeling of biological reaction_networks with and extended interpretation of distributed determinism ii the model overlap as a pdfbased discrimination criterion iii linearization and sigma point methods and iv two numerical approaches to solve optimal_control problems then using two numerical_examples we formulate the optimization_problem and benchmark the linearization approach against the sigma point approach section biological_variability in combination with experimental measurement noise results into widely_distributed response signals which is one of the main challenges when modeling biological system deterministically with nonlinear odes the parameter set needs to be extended to a parameter distribution in this way natural variability in the dynamic parameters as well as measurement noise can be readily accounted for however an exact quantification is computationally_expensive and infeasible in an
