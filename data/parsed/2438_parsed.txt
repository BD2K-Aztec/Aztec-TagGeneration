inference with viral_quasispecies diversity indices clonal and ngs approaches given the inherent dynamics of a viral_quasispecies we are often interested in the comparison of diversity indices of sequential samples of a patient or in the comparison of diversity indices of virus in groups of patients in a treated versus control design it is then important to make sure that the diversity measures from each sample may be compared with no bias and within a consistent statistical_framework in the present report we review some indices often used as measures for viral_quasispecies complexity and provide means for statistical_inference applying procedures taken from the ecology field in particular we examine the shannon entropy and the mutation_frequency and we discuss the appropriateness of different normalization_methods of the shannon entropy found in the literature by taking amplicons ultra deep pyrosequencing udps raw_data as a surrogate of a real hepatitis_c viral_population we study through in silico sampling the statistical_properties of these indices under two methods of viral qua sispecies sampling classical cloning followed by sanger_sequencing ccss and next_generation ngs such as udps we propose solutions specific to each of the two sampling methods ccss and ngsto guarantee statistically conforming conclusions as free of bias as possible rna_viruses show a high replication error_rate due to the lack of proofreading mechanisms and it is estimated that for viruses with typically high replicative loads every possible point_mutation and many double_mutations are generated with each viral_replication cycle and may be present within the population at any time in the case of hepatitis_c hcv the viral loaddefined as the number of viral_particles per milliliter of serum in acutely or chronically_infected patientsmay reach in immunocompetent patients which roughly means a population of circulating particles of at any given time this population is highly_dynamic with a viral half_life of a few hours and with the production and clearance of genomes per day in a patient given this inherent dynamics we are often interested in the comparison of diversity indices of sequential samples of a patient or among groups of patients these comparisons may be informative of the patient evolution or the appropriateness of a given treatment supplementary_material next_generation methods ngs will likely be increasingly adopted in clinical_diagnostics in the next years improvements in costs protocols and coverage are closing the gap between what was feasible in research and diagnostics the first diagnostics likely to be moved to ngs will be those currently based on classical molecular_cloning and sanger_sequencing ccss because it is labor_intensive and has limited sensitivity in this work we use in silico sampling from viral reference distributions to study the statistical_properties of diversity indices aimed at quantifying rna_virus quasispecies complexity estimates of the species_richness and other diversity indices as defined in ecology supplementary_material are challenging when populations are complex in genomic composition as is the case with viral_quasispecies the approaches in the ecology domain are extensive and still active and can be useful for the analysis of viral_quasispecies although the quasispecies definition as a dynamic distributions of non identical but closely_related mutant and recombinant viral_genomes subjected to a continuous_process of genetic_variation competition and selection and which act as a unit of selection conveys an intuitive image of complexity no comprehensive and universally admitted to whom correspondence should be addressed index of quasispecies complexity exists in a large population in equilibrium or with small_perturbations the genome frequencies are related with their relative fitness there are a number of useful indices and variables but none of them fully captures that intuitive image viral_quasispecies complexity may be viewed as a multivariate feature where the number of haplotypes of polymorphic_sites and their relative_frequencies are its dimensions each of these indices and variables are difficult to estimate given the expected diversity of a quasiespecies from available data and the limited sample_size amenable to analysis the primary indices measure the extend of the viral_quasispecies complexity by the number of haplotypes polymorphic_sites and number of different mutations these may be considered as richness indices other indices such as the shannon entropy s or the simpson index measure the diversity or the evenness when normalized to maximum diversity sn while others such as the mutation_frequency mf or the nucleotide_diversity pi measure the intrapopulation heterogeneity that is how different are the members of the population among them s and sn or the simpson index are not sensitive to the number of mutations the simpson index has been less used with viral_quasispecies as it provides a more stable although less sensitive measure of diversity by downweighting the rare haplotypes mf measures the heterogeneity with respect to the most represented dominant sequence or the consensus_sequence of the population pi gives the global_population heterogeneity taking_into the average number of mutations between each pair of individuals in the viral_population each of these variables describes a different part of the mutation space occupied by a quasispecies and they all provide relevant_information regarding mutation barriers to antiviral_treatment resistance we studied by in silico sampling the distribution and properties of three of the most common variables used to quantify the viral_quasispecies complexity in the literature the diversity through s and sn and the heterogeneity through mf the quasispecies richness by the number of estimated haplotypes in the population is also studied because of its implications on sn and mf we propose methods for inference for each sampling schemeccss and ngswith these complexity indices quasispecies dynamics represents an important challenge for the control of infectious_diseases associated with rna_viruses and some dna_viruses in particular we are interested in improved molecular diagnosis of b and c hepatitis viruses which are responsible for million cases of chronic_infections worldwide as strongly evidenced by recent_reports viral_quasispecies complexity measured by diversity indices has clear clinical_relevance in the course and prognosis of these diseases moreover the adequate diagnosis of quasispecies complexity has direct implications for antiviral treatment_failure because of its reflection in genetic barriers to resistance because of these reasons it is paramount to establish a standard method of measuring and comparing diversity indices with statistic grounds and fitted to the expected degrees of viral_quasispecies complexity we argue that the virus field would benefit of implementing solutions already established in ecology to compare diversity indices useful connections between ecology and viral_quasispecies have been previously_established self organization of subpopulations from a viral_quasispecies that exhibited competition colonization dynamics was approached by applying ecological_models of biodiversity in spatially structured habitats the study revealed that host cell_killing by viruses can be modulated by a trade_off between competition and colonization and suggested a model of virus virulence based on intramutant spectrum interactions also niche theory of competition communities and the replicator mutator equation were combined to show that a typical quasispecies profile required both competition and cooperation among variants by a review of methods used in ecology that could be approached to describe rna viral_quasispecies and thanks to deep coverage amplicon udps data which has been used as source of in silico sampling we have studied the behavior and statistical_properties of s sn and mf under the sampling schemes of ccss and ngs by ccss we may sample any virion with equal chance but their estimated frequency will never be lower than n the granularity or resolution of the device where n is the number of clones in the experiment that is when using clones no observed haplotype will have an estimated frequency in the population this granularity together with the high_diversity of rna_viruses causes a systematic_bias in the estimation of s and sn on the other hand mf does not suffer of estimation bias another consideration for the ccss method is that we lack any means to control whether any of the observed clones are artifactual or of low_abundance in a recently_published study we compared experimentally a patient sample of hbv sequenced in replicates by udps two flx one flx and one junior in the forward and reverse and by sequences obtained by ccss among the singleton haplotypes by ccss were also identified by udps in of the udps replicates and could not be identified in any of the replicates with quality filtered reads covering the full amplicon as an example filtering at the high_complexity reference_population a of the reads is removed supplementary which means that in ccss experiments on this kind of viral_populations roughly one outunder the assumption that all observed clones are true members of the population we observed by this sampling scheme that s and sn are biased and that the bias is sample_size dependent we also observed that s shows a better behavior to analytical bias correction than sn and that mf is an unbiased estimator a less biased comparison of s or sn values between samples requires of intra sample normalization composed of terms of correction supplementary equations sii and siii when the sample_sizes are unbalanced the normalization requires a rarefaction of the big sample to the small_sample as well on the other hand ngs methods are highly_sensitive and reproducible but they are limited by the technical noise_level by discarding observed haplotypes our diversity estimates are biased with respect to the true population values we may nevertheless consider the haplotypes below the frequency in our example as spurious or of low biological relevancy at the sampling time point in this case we used the diversity values of the filtered population as gold_standard being the best we can achieve by ngs we observed a sample_size dependent bias on s sn and mf the minimum differential bias is provided by rarefaction for s and sn for mf fringe trimming provides an unbiased comparison when the samples to be compared are not very unbalanced and the abundance filter is above noise_level fringe trimming could give good results for s sn and mf the in silico sampling and simulation allowed us to assess the validity of the estimate and tests used in ecology when dealing with viral_quasispecies with s sn and mf and permitted to identify the key_points for less biased comparisons of complexity indices under the same sampling scheme in this work we have empirically studied the statistical_properties of s sn and mf while observing the quasispecies viral complexity either by ccss or by ngs and through this we assessed the means for less biased comparisons of complexity indices these methods could allow us to statistically conclude whether a viral_quasispecies is expanding or contracting in diversity independently of the size of the samples being compared in the supplementary_material we give the formulation and in
