gell a generalized likelihood library for phylogenetic_models phylogenetic_models are an important tool in molecular_evolution allowing us to study the pattern and rate of sequence change the recent influx of new sequence_data in the biosciences means that to address evolutionary questions we need a means for rapid and easy model development and implementation here we present gell a java_library that lets users use text to quickly and efficiently define novel forms of discrete data and create new substitution models that describe how those data change on a phylogeny gell allows users to define general substitution models and data_structures in a way that is not possible in other existing libraries including mixture_models and non reversible models classes are provided for calculating likelihoods optimizing model_parameters and branch_lengths ancestral reconstruction and sequence simulation many studies in molecular_evolution use phylogenetic substitution models to infer patterns of change between homologous characters using maximum_likelihood ml these models allow us to infer many valuable quantities such as how the rate evolution varies among sites or the selective_pressures acting on codons the growing availability of genome_sequences has led to new forms of data such as gene content and the presence_or of promoters e g encode and their study requires statistically_rigorous inferential tools nearly all phylogenetic substitution models are continuous_time chains with discrete and finite_state spaces which require the same underlying computational machinery general phylogenetic libraries such as beast pll and bio take advantage of these similarities and allow programmers to build phylogenetic_models and are often the basis of existing packages here we present gell a generalised likelihood library which provides non expert users a text interface to define data and models allowing users to create data_structures and models parameterizations that reflect the properties of their data to aid in characterization of these models gell also allows users to perform ml inference simulate data and perform ancestral reconstruction
