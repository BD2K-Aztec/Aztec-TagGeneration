data_and surpriseme an integrated tool for network community_structure characterization using surprise maximization detecting communities and densely_connected groups may contribute to unravel the underlying relationships among the units present in diverse biological_networks e g interactomes coexpression_networks ecological networks we recently showed that communities can be precisely characterized by maximizing surprise a global network parameter here we present surpriseme a tool that integrates the outputs of seven of the best algorithms available to estimate the maximum surprise value surpriseme also generates distance_matrices that allow visualizing the relationships among the solutions generated by the algorithms we show that the communities present in small_and networks with up to nodes can be easily characterized on standard pc computers these analyses take less than an hour also four of the algorithms may rapidly analyze networks with up to nodes given enough memory resources because of its performance and simplicity surpriseme is a reference tool for community_structure characterization availability_and surpriseme is implemented in perl and c c it compiles and runs on any unix based operating system including linux and mac os x using standard libraries the source_code is freely and publicly_available under the gpl license atcomplex networks are extensively used for representing interactions among elements of a system this approach is particularly useful in biology analyzing networks provides relevant_information in fields such as genetics ecology neuroscience systems_biology barabasi or proteomics among others an interesting property of these networks is the fact that related units of the network tend to create tightly knit groups usually known as communities by unraveling the close_relationships among certain units community_structure characterization improves our understanding of the system as a whole recently many strategies have been devised to detect the optimal division of a network into communities however none of them alone is able to achieve high_quality solutions in all kinds of networks aldecoa and marnmarn a b in recent works we demonstrated that surprise s is an effective measure to evaluate the quality of a partition of a network into communities aldecoa and marnmarn a b given such a partition s calculates the unlikeliness of finding the observed number of intra community links in a totally random_network according to a cumulative hypergeometric_distribution here f is the maximum possible number of links of the network n is the actual number of links m is the maximum possible number of intra community links and p is the actual number of links within communities in several complex benchmarks composed of networks with very different structures it was shown that the partition of maximum s corresponds to the real community_structure with a minimal null degree of error b we also showed that s outperforms modularity q the most commonly used criterion to define communities in all benchmarks although a simple_algorithm to maximize s has not yet been devised we found that choosing among the output of seven high_quality algorithms the one that provided the maximum s value solved the structure of all networks tested these algorithms are called cpm infomap rb rn rnsc scluster aldecoa and marnmarn and uvcluster the particular performances of each algorithm are detailed in aldecoa and marnmarn a b here we present surpriseme a tool integrating those seven algorithms surpriseme accelerates the research process by simply accepting a network as input internally running all the algorithms and outputting their solutions and their surprise values surpriseme also calculates distances among the solutions provided by the algorithms allowing understanding of how congruent they are names of two connected nodes separated by a tab or space character from this text_file the software automatically generates the required input_formats and runs the algorithms either all or a subset chosen by the user finally the algorithm that generates the maximum s value is established for infomap rn and rnsc the unique partitions generated are evaluated while for rb cpm uvcluster and scluster which provide several alternative partitions the ones with the highest s value are considered surpriseme also compares the solutions of each algorithm using either the variation of information vi or the nmi value where nmi stands for normalized_mutual in both cases the greater the value the more two partitions are different see aldecoa and marnmarn a b the program also estimates the distances to two additional solutions called one all units of the network are in one community and singles each node belongs to a different community the distances to these two solutions provide further clues of the behavior of the algorithms aldecoa and marnmarn b all distances are saved into two distance_matrix files for vi and for nmi that can be directly imported into mega a popular free software that allows easily visualizing the hierarchical relationships among the different solutions see aldecoa and marnmarn b
