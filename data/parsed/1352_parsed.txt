detecting independent and recurrent copy_number using interval graphs motivation somatic copy_number scnas are frequent in cancer_genomes but many of these are random passenger events a common strategy to distinguish functional aberrations from passengers is to identify those aberrations that are recurrent across multiple samples however the extensive variability in the length and position of scnas makes the problem of identifying recurrent aberrations notoriously_difficult results we introduce a combinatorial_approach to the problem of identifying independent and recurrent scnas focusing on the key challenging of separating the overlaps in aberrations across individuals into independent events we derive independent and recurrent scnas as maximal cliques in an interval graph constructed from overlaps between aberrations we efficiently enumerate all such cliques and derive a dynamic_programming to find an optimal selection of non overlapping cliques resulting in a very fast algorithm which we call raig recurrent aberrations from interval graphs we show that raig outperforms other methods on simulated_data and also performs well on data from three cancer_types from the cancer_genome tcga in contrast to existing_approaches that employ various heuristics to select independent aberrations raig optimizes a well defined objective_function we show that this allows raig to identify rare aberrations that are likely functional but are obscured by overlaps with larger passenger aberrations copy_number cnas are gains_and of large segments of the genomeranging in size from a few kilobases to whole chromosomes somatic cnas scnas that occur during the lifetime of an individual are a major contributor to cancer development particularly for solid_tumors cancer_genome research in the last decade technologies with increasing resolution have been introduced to measure cnas cytogenetic techniques such as comparative_genomic were replaced by higher_resolution array_comparative acgh and snp_genotyping and most recently these are being supplanted by high_throughput the latter identify cnas as deviations from the expected number of reads aligned to an interval of the reference_genome and depending on the sequencing_depth and technology can measure cnas to single_nucleotide in parallel with the technological_developments numerous computational_methods have been developed to identify cnas in single samples a key challenge in applying these technologies to cancer_genomes is that most scnas measured in tumor_samples are random passenger events that do not contribute to the cancer phenotype a common strategy to distinguish functional driver aberrations from such random passenger events is to identify recurrent aberrations shared by multiple samples however this is a notoriously_difficult problem because scnas vary_widely in length and position across different samples for example a tumor_suppressor might be deleted by a small focal aberration in one sample while in another sample the same gene is deleted by a whole chromosome loss the varying_size and starting ending positions of aberrations across samples create a complex pattern of overlapping aberrations this makes_it to determine which gene or genomic locus if any is the target of the aberration a necessary prerequisite for any statistical_test of recurrence early methods for finding recurrent scnas used the straightforward approach of finding the minimum common region of aberrations across samples subsequently numerous methods with more complex models were introduced while these methods differ in important_details they all use variations of two basic steps i compute a score at each genomic locus typically a probe in microarray_datasets indicating the recurrence ii examine correlations between recurrences scores of nearby loci to separate the true target_region from other close high_scoring regions in addition some approaches also compute the statistical_significance of the resulting predictions using either a fixed distribution or a permutation_test that preserves the lengths of scnas a major_challenge in detecting recurrent scnas is that closely located driver aberrations lead to correlations between the recurrence scores for example shows scnas in samples the number of samples with an aberration at each locus gives a recurrence score across the genome however these peaks are correlated e g the fifth peak results largely from intervals shared with the fourth and third peaks methods that predict recurrent scnas must address the problem of how to separate peaks or high_scoring regions into independent copy_number events one of the most widely used methods gistic introduced a greedy procedure that removes the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com aberrations contributing to the highest peak and then rescores the remaining scnas continuing this iterative procedure until no more significant peaks are found while gistic has been very successful in identifying recurrent scnas the greedy nature of the peel off procedure reduces the sensitivity to discover real secondary driver events if they are close to another primary driver event jistic and gistic proposed alternative peel off procedures with better performance gistic uses an arbitrated peel off procedure that rescores secondary peaks by assigning weights to intervals in proportion to the number of peaks in which they contribute while this approach considers the correlations between high_scoring peaks these correlations are considered in an iterative manner there is no attempt to globally maximize an objective_function we observed that the peel off procedure could fail to detect high_scoring recurrent regions that were composed of numerous intervals that are shared with other recurrent regions e g peak in the continued development of peel off procedures emphasizes the difficulty in identifying recurrent scnas particularly secondary aberrations that are nested within larger aberrations indeed the overlap between the predictions from different methods is generally fairly small moreover the peel off procedures implemented in gistic gistic jistic and related methods were originally developed for microarray_data and rely on markers probes to define either boundaries or weights of peaks this complicates the application of these approaches to high_throughput sequencing_datasets at the same time existing_methods for identifying scnas do not address the challenges of rare scnas that may not be statistically_significant on their own recent cancer_genome studies have shown that a relatively small number of genes are mutated at high_frequency in a cohort of cancer patients with many genes_mutated at lower_frequencies this long tail phenomenon implies that rare_mutations aberrations cannot be discarded and require further scrutiny a promising approach to address this long tail is to analyze combinations of mutations aberrations in various signaling and regulatory_pathways while rare somatic_mutations may be directly incorporated in pathway analyses there is no corresponding approach to identify rare scnas most approaches focus on the problem of identifying scnas that are individually significant to address the limitations of current approaches in detecting rare and secondary aberrations we were motivated to develop a new approach that identifies both recurrent and independent scnas by optimizing a score that considers the composition and the correlation between all scnas on a chromosome across a set of samples we introduce raig recurrent aberrations from interval graphs an algorithm to detect independent and recurrent scnas by selecting an optimal subset of maximal cliques in an interval graph in contrast to existing_approaches that deconvolve the recurrence score raig analyzes the combinatorial structure of the underlying intervals and thus explicitly_models the dependencies between the values of the recurrence score raig uses a dynamic_programming to optimize a rigorous objective_function for the selection of recurrent aberrations moreover raig is very efficient as maximal cliques in an interval graph can be efficiently enumerated we show that our raig algorithm performs very well on both simulated_data and data from several cancer_types from the cancer_genome tcga in particular raig has higher sensitivity in detecting rare scnas and secondary aberrations that are missed by iterative peel off procedures while also retaining high_specificity raig is simple and fast and readily adaptable for high_throughput sequencing_data we introduce raig an algorithm to find independent and recurrent scnas we demonstrate that raig performs well compared with the existing_methods on synthetic and real_datasets on simulated_datasets raig achieved the highest precision and recall and also made smaller more focused predictions on real_datasets raig predicted independent and recurrent scnas in a significantly_smaller fraction of the genome than the widely used gistic algorithm and the gaia algorithm overall the overlap between different methods is modest demonstrating the difficulty in identifying recurrent scnas raig showed the highest enrichment of known cancer_genes from the cancer gene census suggesting that raig has high_specificity while it is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of each method on real_data we found that a number of the genes that were unique to raig are known cancer_genes finally the efficient clique enumeration and optimization steps make raig perform more than thousand times_faster than other methods although total running_times are influenced by the type of nature of the statistical_test that is performed supplementary table s at the same time raig does miss some scnas that likely contain important cancer_genes in examining these cases we found that the majority had relatively few boundary endpoints that surround the maximal clique containing these genes however the amplitude of the scnas in these samples was very high one example is fgfr in brca where the average frequency and amplitude are and respectively we found that other intervals with lower amplitude obscure the high amplitude intervals containing fgfr gistic use copy_number amplitude in addition to number of samples for its recurrence score further improvements to raig may be obtained by running with higher amplitude thresholds or by incorporating amplitude into the objective_function optimized by raig e g by creating a weighted score for intervals according to their amplitude to test the former hypotheses we ran raig on the brca dataset using only intervals whose amplitude was raig returned a region on p containing fgfr and two other genes since raig considers all possible partitions of the data it is able to detect rare scnas and secondary events that are obscured by complex overlapping rearrangements and missed by iterative peel off procedures used in all existing_methods although such rare aberrations are not statistically_significant on their own one of the outcomes from recent cancer sequencing studies is the demonstration of extensive mutational heterogeneity in cancer with driver_mutations distributed over a large_number thus obtaining a comprehensive view of the mutations that drive cancer requires the analysis of combinations of rare and common mutations in pathways and interaction networks
