structural_bioinformatics alignment of distantly_related protein_structures algorithm bound and implications to homology_modeling motivation building an accurate alignment of a large set of distantly_related protein_structures is still very challenging results this article_presents a novel method dcomb that can generate a multiple structure alignment msa with not only as many conserved cores as possible but also high_quality pairwise_alignments dcomb is unique in that it makes use of both local and global structure environments combined by a statistical_learning method to accurately identify highly_similar fragment blocks hsfbs among all proteins to be aligned by extending the alignments of these hsfbs dcomb can quickly generate an accurate msa without using progressive alignment dcomb significantly excels others in aligning distantly_related proteins dcomb can also generate correct alignments for functionally_similar regions among proteins of very different structures while many other msa tools fail dcomb is useful for many real_world applications in particular it enables us to find out that there is still large improvement room for multiple template homology_modeling while several other msa tools fail to do so availability dcomb is available atmultiple protein alignment has been extensively used for classification analysis of evolutionary_relationship motif_detection and structure function prediction when proteins are distantly_related sequence methods usually fail to yield accurate alignment in contrast structure methods which exploit geometrical information may still work well as more protein_structures are experimentally solved multiple structure alignment msa is becoming more useful and important however developing computational_methods for accurate msa especially of a large set of distantly_related protein_structures is still regarded as an open challenge an msa method consists of two critical_components a scoring_function measuring to whom correspondence should be addressed of the quality of an msa and an algorithm searching for the msa optimizing the score many msa algorithms have been developed such as mammoth matt multiprot mustang posa and salign these methods can be broadly divided_into two groups horizontal first or vertical first the former progressively merges pairwise_alignments into an msa which may be suboptimal since pairwise_alignment errors carry over to the final_result the vertical first methods identify some similar fragment blocks sfb among proteins and then extend the sfb alignments to msas the number of sfbs could grow_exponentially with respect to the number of proteins so these methods may have to examine a large number of sfbs not to miss the best msa which is usually computationally_expensive as such the challenge facing a vertical first method is to identify only those sfbs which are very likely contained in the best msa this article_presents dcomb a novel vertical first method for msa dcomb distinguishes itself from others in its search algorithm and scoring_function dcomb makes use of both local and global structure environments combined by a novel machine_learning to accurately identify highly_similar fragment blocks hsfbs which are very likely contained in the best msa dcomb searches for the best msa starting from the alignment of an hsfb local structure environment is used to describe the structural difference between two short segments centered on two residues global structure environment is used to measure the similarity of two substructures centered at the two residues both features are combined by a probabilistic_graphical conditional_random crf to determine if two residues shall be aligned or not existing_methods e g blomaps employ only local structure environment and sometimes fail to detect good hsfbs they usually have to examine a large number of not so conserved fragment blocks in order to find the best msa in contrast dcomb can generate accurate msas from only very few hsfbs and thus improve accuracy without too much computational time many methods do not explicitly take into consideration the quality of pairwise_alignments in building an msa so it may not necessarily contain high_quality pairwise_alignments dcomb aims to generate an msa with not only as many conserved cores as possible but also accurate pairwise_alignments a core is a fully aligned column without any gaps consisting of one residue from each input protein dcomb achieves this by employing a novel scoring_function core lentmscore for msa where
