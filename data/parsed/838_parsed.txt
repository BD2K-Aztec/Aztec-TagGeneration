gene_expression cafe an r package for the detection of gross chromosomal_abnormalities from gene_expression microarray_data the current methods available to detect chromosomal_abnormalities from dna microarray_expression are cumbersome and inflexible cafe has been developed to alleviate these issues it is implemented as an r package that analyzes affymetrix cel files and comes with flexible plotting functions easing visualization of chromo somal abnormalities availability_and cafe is available from https bit bucket org cob icw z cafe as both source and compiled packages for linux and windows it is released under the gpl version license cafe will also be freely_available from bioconductor gross chromosomal_abnormalities are a hallmark of cancers and are frequently acquired by cultured_cells as an adaptation to cell culture_conditions recently it has been recognized that induced_pluripotent often feature gross chromosomal duplications or deletions various methods exist to detect chromosomal gains or losses traditional karyotyping relies on careful examination of giemsa stained metaphase_chromosomes newer techniques like spectral_karyotyping have increased ease of analysis but nevertheless feature low_resolution for high_throughput and high_resolution analysis of gross chromosomal_abnormalities array_based a cgh is often used this a cgh approach is based on the detection of a quantitative difference of dna_content whole_genome and snp based sequencing_approaches have also been developed although not initially_developed for this purpose it is possible to use gene_expression microarray_data for the detection of copy_number abnormalities this approach is not based on the measurements of dna_content but rather on mrna_expression levels a protocol to use expression microarrays to karyotype samples was recently_published by benvenisty and coworkers but requires the manual use of different tools here we present cafechromosomal aberration finder in expression dataas an r package for the detection of gross chromosomal gains_and from expression microarrays with a resolution up to cytoband level cafe follows the expression based karyotyping workflow e karyotyping and greatly_simplifies and speeds up the detection analysis of chromosomal_aberrations from expression dna_microarrays
