systems_biology flowdensity reproducing manual gating of flow_cytometry data by automated density based cell_population identification flowdensity facilitates reproducible high_throughput analysis of flow_cytometry data by automating a predefined manual gating approach the algorithm is based on a sequential bivariate gating approach that generates a set of predefined cell_populations it chooses the best cutoff for individual_markers using characteristics of the density_distribution the supplementary_material is linked to the online version of the manuscript availability_and r source_code freely_available through bioconductorflow cytometry fcm is the predominant technique used to identify and quantify the widest variety of cell_types however it is widely_recognized that fcm data analysis primarily in the identification of clusters of homogenous cells in high dimensional_space has become a rate_limiting in application of the technology researchers currently use a manually intensive and subjective process of serial inspection of one or two characteristics dimensions at a time a process termed gating there is widespread demand for the development of software_tools as the ability to organize analyze and exchange fcm data is lagging far behind the ability to run samples to the detriment of health research o one reason that end_users are still relying on manual_analysis is the absence of a systematic way to formulate and transfer their expert_knowledge to automated software in order to provide satisfactory_results on hard to gate cell_populations although unsupervised clustering_algorithms have been developed for fcm data they often fail to replicate a human_experts gating results due to their generalized global approach and often return as a result of a number of clusters that cannot be interpreted readily without more sophisticated cluster matching methods supervised approaches have also focused on setting global parameters that are difficult to appropriately set for all clusters and requiring tuning of parameters that are not linked to researchers biological understanding of the data to address_these we developed flowdensity an automated gating approach that emulates an experts sequential d gating strategy to identify predefined cell_populations using a sequential bivariate gating algorithm the innovation of our approach is to use customized threshold calculations for different cell_subsets based on expert_knowledge of hierarchical gating order and d density estimation using this approach cell_populations can be defined once using a gating strategy as a guide which also enables clusters to be easily compared across samples
