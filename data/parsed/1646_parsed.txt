databases_and eurocarbdb ccrc a eurocarbdb node for storing glycomics standard data motivation in the field of glycomics research several different techniques are used for structure_elucidation although multiple techniques are often used to increase confidence in structure assignments most glycomics databases allow storing of only a single type of experimental_data in addition the methods used to prepare a sample for analysis is seldom recorded making it harder to reproduce the analytical data and results results we have extended the freely_available eurocarbdb framework to allow the submission of experimental_data and the reporting of several orthogonal experimental_datasets the features aim to increase the understandability and reproducibility of the reported data availability_and the installation with the glycan standards is available atin the past two and a half decades several databases for storing glycan_structures and associated meta_information e g biological source species and publications have been developed among them the carbbank database was the first large publicly_available database of glycan_structures although no experimental_data were stored in this database the experimental_techniques used for the identification of glycan_structures were recorded after the funding for carbbank was discontinued several independent new databases were created often by importing most or all of the carbbank data and sometimes adding experimental_data for example glycosciences de l and the bacterial carbohydrate structure database contain nuclear_magnetic nmr_data that have been extracted from the literature for different glycan_structures the consortium for functional glycomics cfg created its own set of databases to store the data generated by the consortium including mass_spectrometry ms profiling data and glycan array data revealing the binding of glycans to various biomolecules following a similar goal glycobase developed by the nibrt group stores the high_performance hplc data generated by that group all of these specialized databases have been implemented for use by a specific research group or consortium and do not allow submission of diverse types of experimental_data by outsiders in under the direction of claus wilhelm von der lieth the eurocarbdb von der project was started the aim of the project was the establishment of a publicly_available database framework for the creation of a network of homogeneous databases allowing research groups worldwide to upload annotated glycan_structures and data obtained by ms nmr and hplc experiments the basic idea was to enable each research group to create and populate their own database while facilitating the sharing and exchange of information among databases the long_term goal was that by providing a free and easy to use framework the heterogeneous landscape of glycan databases developed before could be systematically replaced by a set of homogeneous databases that contains experimental_data with annotated glycan_structures by the end of the project in the source_code of the database prototype that had been installed at the european_bioinformatics ebi was released this code has been subsequently used as the basis for several database projects including the unicarb db project and the unicarbkb databases although storing experimental_data along with the glycan_structures biological annotation and their literature references was a fundamental goal of the eurocarbdb project approaches to storing techniques for sample_preparation and methods of experimental analysis had not been developed here we describe the application of different experimental_techniques to establish the structures of several glycan standards provided by the cfg and the setup of a eurocarbdb node providing public access to the produced data we also introduce a novel way to represent the experimental_data and meta_data within a eurocarbdb node in the original implementation of eurocarbdb each unique_structure was linked with a set of experiments however the information required to determine_whether the separate experiments in a set were to whom correspondence should be addressed performed using exactly the same sample or performed using different samples that happened to contain the same structure was unavailable this critical information is required to evaluate the experimental_data and assess the reliability of the resulting structural annotation confidence in a structural annotation is greater when it is based on the application of varied orthogonal methods to the same sample rather than on the analysis of several similar samples which may contain different contaminants in this paper we introduce a novel way to represent the experimental_data within a eurocarbdb database the modified database allows the data obtained by different analytical_methods using a single sample to be combined into an experiment thereby increasing confidence in structural annotations inferred by combining the orthogonal data these modifications increase the efficacy of eurocarbdb for scientists using diverse techniques to assign glycan_structures the design of the experiments described in the section is shown inthese web_pages contain step_by descriptions of the experimental_procedures including the necessary materials and instrumentation in addition to the web_page references for each protocol a list of protocol parameters can be stored to capture variations of each standard procedure described in the web_pages for example the incubation time temperature or ph of a chemical_reaction may vary from one experiment to another these specific protocol parameter_values together with the complete but more general description in the web_pages fully describe the experimental methods used to obtain each dataset the availability of this detailed information increases the analysts capacity to understand evaluate and reproduce the experimental_results to minimize the work necessary to create an experiment and upload experimental_data we created several template mechanisms for the creation of an experiment first the user creates a protocol by providing its name description web_page and a list of parameters with their units of measurement more details can be found in part i of the supplementary_material specific values for these parameters are assigned later the example shown as scheme inand as screenshot inn glycan mass_spectrometer analysis includes four protocols in the second step the user creates specific implementations of these protocols called protocol variants which encapsulate explicit values for each parameter for more details see the supplementary_material part ii in mass_spectrometer analysis na and mass_spectrometer analysis li are two protocol variants of the protocol mass_spectrometer analysis specifying li and na respectively as values for the protocol parameter adduct the advantage of these templates is that creating a new variation of a protocol does not require the user to reenter all the information rather a protocol variant is created as a specific instance of the more general protocol and distinguished by explicit protocol parameters values the instantiated protocol variants are placed in a user_defined sequence called an experimental template which fully describes a specific series of tasks used to prepare and analyze a sample each actual use of the experiment template to analyze a specific sample is documented by instantiating a new experiment the data produced by an experiment are thus associated with the metadata specified by the above procedure facilitating the upload and archival of the annotated data each new experiment is created with a few button clicks which retrieve and integrate all the relevant_information about the experiment and its protocols including protocol parameter_values then it is easy to associate the specific dataset or datasets that were generated the design of an experiment is a multistep_process it starts by defining protocols which are general but detailed_descriptions of laboratory tasks including lists of any parameters that may vary protocol variants are then instantiated in the context of an experiment template which specifies a linear or branched sequence of protocol variants in thearrows leading from protocol variants to protocols represent instantiation these steps involve the explicit specification of protocol parameter_values an experiment template thus defined can then be instantiated as an actual experiment arrows from experiment to experiment template represent instantiation each experiment encapsulates all of the ms hplc and or nmr_data acquired during a discrete analysis of a specific sample along with the metadata describing how these data were obtained design of the n glycan experiment each native glycan sample was divided_into two aliquots one was analyzed by nmr without modification and the other was permethylated and analyzed as the na adduct by tandem_ms by the experiment with a well defined sequence of parameterized protocols the concept of an experiment allows users to upload different kinds of evidence experimental_data used to assign a structure to the analyzed glycan different types of evidence for glycan samples include quantification data ms data hplc data and nmr_data shows a screenshot of the web_interface after uploading the experimental_data generated by analysis of the n glycan cfg standard the experiment itself diagrammed in consists of tasks displayed as a hierarchical tree in the lower part of the image these include the protocols used to prepare and analyze the sample together with the experimental_data and the annotation data which can be retrieved by the user expanding this tree representation provides an increasingly detailed view of the results of executing each protocol ultimately showing the dataset produced by the final analytical protocol e g a file containing mass_spectral and the annotation file for that data shows an example protocol with its name the description the link to the web_page and the parameters with their values the eurocarbdb database framework is an extremely useful resource for scientists seeking to create their own database to store analytical glycomics data we have extended the original eurocarbdb code to collect and associate the different types of analytical data obtained by analyzing single samples adding confidence to the structural annotations deduced from that data the enhanced code simplifies the generation storage and retrieval of complete descriptions of the experiment process facilitating the interpretation and reproduction of the experiment we have installed a eurocarbdb node with these enhancements on our server and populated this node with carefully annotated experimental_data generated using several standard glycans provided by the cfg this database and its contents are freely_available glycomics ccrc uga edu eurocarb in addition we encourage users to download this easy to use database so they can organize and archive their own glycomics datasets and associate them with metadata describing the procedures they use to generate that data the eurocarbdb source_code is available at https code google com p ucdb the fundamental utility of the tools described here lies in their capacity to dramatically_increase the public availability of well documented glycoanalytic data use of these tools will allow researchers around the globe to download and examine experimental_datasets and structural annotations created by other scientists rigorously evaluate those datasets and faithfully reproduce the experimental_protocols that were originally used to generate them to the best of our knowledge no other publicly_available database offers this kind of representation and this level of detail to make this representation more informative we also link each protocol to a web_page glycopod or our wiki where the creator of the protocol can provide a more detailed_description of the experimental methods used these wiki pages can be accessed via a hyperlink in the details section of the experimental tree
