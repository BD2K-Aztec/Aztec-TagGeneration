structural_bioinformatics finding stable local optimal rna_secondary motivation many rnas such as riboswitches can fold into multiple alternate structures and perform different biological_functions these biologically functional structures usually have low free_energies in their local energy_landscapes and are very stable such that they cannot easily jump out of the current states and fold into other stable conformations the conformational_space of feasible rna_secondary is prohibitively large and accurate prediction of functional structure conformations is challenging because the stability of an rna_secondary is determined predominantly by energetically_favorable helical regions stacks we propose to use configurations of putative stacks to represent rna_secondary by considering a reduced conformational_space of local optimal stack configurations instead of all feasible rna_structures we first present an algorithm for enumerating all possible local optimal stack configurations in addition we present a fast heuristic_algorithm for approximating energy_barriers encountered during folding pathways between each pair of local optimal stack configurations and finding all the stable local optimal structures results benchmark tests have been conducted on several rna riboswitches whose alternate secondary_structures have been experimentally_verified the benchmark results show that our method can successfully predict the native on and off secondary_structures and better rank them compared with other state of art approaches rna_molecules play_important in many biological_activities the structures of rnas are key to understanding their functionalities the native secondary_structures of rna_molecules are usually the minimum_free mfe structures however many regulatory_rnas may form multiple alternate metastable structures each of which performs a different function for example the cis regulatory_rnas called as riboswitches are widely present at the non coding_regions of mrnas in bacteria and regulate both transcriptional and translational expression of their cognate to whom correspondence should be addressed metabolic genes and thus comprise a metabolite sensing system riboswitches can selectively bind with small metabolites and form alternative structure conformations in order to exert control over translation_initiation or formation of a transcription terminator or an anti terminator helix and thus turn off or on the gene_transcription alternate structure conformations of rna riboswitches can be experimentally_verified using in line probing x_ray or nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy however these methods are usually time consuming and expensive computational_approaches for accurately predicting alternate conformations are in need the alternate functional structures are usually also energetically favored and are stable in their local energy_landscapes the conformational_transitions between any pair of alternate structures may involve high energy_barriers such that rnas can easily become kinetically trapped by these structures accurate_predictions of alternate structures of an rna_molecule should be conducted by exploiting the energy_landscape and the folding dynamics of the rna in combination with the binding of the target metabolites the ideal approach is to construct an exact energy_landscape on all possible suboptimal secondary_structures then analyze every possible local optimal structures as well as all possible folding pathways in the landscape and finally determine the most significant structures in the following we will briefly_review existing_methods for enumerating suboptimal structures and predicting alternate structures for rna_molecules devised the first algorithm mfold for predicting the mfe structure and multiple suboptimal structures for a given sequence it generates for each admissible base_pair the energetically best structure containing that base_pair for a sequence of length n mfold produces at most n n suboptimal structures which are a very small fraction of all the candidate suboptimal structures and may miss some of the functional structures in addition mfold uses a filter_based on the base_pair metric to remove structures that are similar to one another the filter is based on base_pair difference while it might be better to infer stability of structures in the context of energy_landscape and remove unstable structures proposed the first exact solution rnasubopt for predicting all possible suboptimal structures between the mfe and an arbitrary upper_limit using a mathematical_model proposed bybased on the turner energy_model devised mc fold a similar solution to the same problem that takes_into both non canonical base_pairings and pseudoknotted structures in addition presented barriers an algorithm for constructing the exact energy_landscape on all possiblein this article we designed an approach rnaslopt for predicting stable local optimal stack configurations of an rna_molecule we first predict all possible local optimal stack configurations that are significantly different from one another with each stack configuration representing a set of similar rna_secondary we are able to greatly reduce the size of the conformational_space considered and make applications on longer_sequences with a higher energy_range possible in addition we also employ a fast heuristic to compute pairwise energy_barriers among lopt stack configurations finally we filter out unstable structures based on their pairwise energy_barriers obtain stable structures and rank them either according to their free_energies or their minimal associated energy_barriers rnaslopt can produce interesting stable local optimal stack configurations for an rna and can be used to predict alternate structure conformations for riboswitches we benchmarked rnaslopt on seven riboswitches and the results show that rnaslopt is able to successfully predict both native on and off
