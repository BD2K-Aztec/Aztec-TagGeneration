genome_analysis nestly a framework for running software with nested parameter choices and aggregating results the execution of a software application or pipeline using various combinations of parameters and inputs is a common task in bioinformatics in the absence of a specialized tool to organize streamline and formalize this process scientists must write frequently complex scripts to perform these tasks we present nestly a python_package to facilitate running tools with nested combinations of parameters and inputs nestly provides three components first a module to build nested directory structures corresponding to choices of parameters second the nestrun script to run a given command using each set of parameter choices third the nestagg script to aggregate results of the individual runs into a csv file as well as support for more complex aggregation we also include a module for easily specifying nested dependencies for the scons build tool enabling incremental builds availability source documentation and tutorial examples are available at http github com fhcrc nestly nestly can be installed from the python_package index via pip it is open_source mit_license many types of bioinformatics analyses involve running software or pipelines with a combination of a number of different parameters and inputs for example one may want to use an established algorithm such as blast with many combinations of different parameters or benchmark the accuracy and speed of a new algorithm for all possible settings for a number of parameters while a number of tools are available for streamlining bioinformatics_pipelines kosterkoster and these tools emphasize running a dataset through a workflow with a static parameter regime the task of running software with a variety of settings typically involves enumeration of parameters execution of a command for each combination and aggregation of results despite the ubiquity of this sort of task in bioinformatics we are only aware of software_packages that address it for specific bioinformatics problems the most common solution is to write a custom script to perform the tasks which presents difficulties isolating execution running commands in parallel and merging results with associated parameters can be non trivial managing these tasks in one off code creates additional work for researchers introduces potential for error and hinders reproducibility we have designed a python software_package nestly the purpose of which is to streamline and automate these operations nestly is a simple yet powerful framework for running software with combinatorial choices of parameters and aggregating results of those runs it has complete documentation and a suite of examples
