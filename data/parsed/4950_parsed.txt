structural_bioinformatics zdock server interactive docking prediction of protein protein_complexes and symmetric multimers proteinprotein_interactions are essential to cellular and immune_function and in many cases because of the absence of an experimentally_determined structure of the complex these interactions must be modeled to obtain an understanding of their molecular basis we present a user_friendly protein_docking server based on the rigid_body docking programs zdock and m zdock to predict structures of proteinprotein_complexes and symmetric multimers with a goal of providing an accessible and intuitive_interface we provide options for users to guide the scoring and the selection of output models in addition to dynamic visualization of input structures and output docking models this server enables the research_community to easily and quickly produce structural_models of proteinprotein_complexes and symmetric multimers for their own analysis proteinprotein_interactions are responsible for a wide_range of key_biological such as cell_signaling enzyme inhibition and immune_recognition a high_resolution structure of a protein complex provides the atomic details of the interaction and enables rational_design of therapeutic_molecules that inhibit or improve binding although many structures of protein_complexes have been determined by x_ray many have not been characterized experimentally due in part to cost and experimental limitations this has led to the development of proteinprotein_docking algorithms of which the top performing methods often produce models with atomic_level accuracy these approaches are distinct from those developed for proteinsmall molecule docking which are often used to dock ligands or sets thereof for virtual_screening to a known binding_pocket to facilitate proteinprotein_docking prediction web_based servers have been developed for rigid_body docking flexible docking and refinement clustering and symmetric multimer docking schneidman the rigid_body proteinprotein_docking program zdock was developed in our laboratory years_ago it uses the fast_fourier algorithm to enable an efficient global docking search on a d grid and utilizes a combination of shape_complementarity electrostatics and statistical potential terms for scoring zdock achieves high predictive_accuracy on proteinprotein_docking benchmarks with success in the top predictions for rigid_body cases in the most recent benchmark version and consistent success acceptable or better predictions for of the last submitted targets in the international proteinprotein_docking experiment critical assessment of predicted interactions capri to provide the research_community with a simple interface to predict structures of protein_complexes using zdock we developed the zdock server since its initial_implementation the zdock server has undergone_major changes to improve its docking performance functionality and user_interface the improvements were motivated by valuable user suggestions as well as our own initiatives and algorithm development these include upgrading the docking algorithm from zdock to zdock resulting in greater_accuracy and highly_efficient searching a portal for running the program m zdock to predict the structures of symmetric multimers was recently added also various aspects of the user_interface have been improved integrating viewing of structures and descriptions during submission and analysis of results
