structural_bioinformatics small_molecule starting points learned from protein_protein inhibitor structure motivation proteinprotein_interactions ppis are a promising but challenging target for pharmaceutical intervention one approach for addressing these difficult targets is the rational_design of small_molecule that mimic the chemical_and of small_clusters of key_residues at the proteinprotein interface the identification of appropriate clusters of interface residues provides starting points for inhibitor design and supports an overall assessment of the susceptibility of ppis to small_molecule inhibition results we extract small_molecule starting points smisps from protein ligand and proteinprotein_complexes in the protein_data pdb these smisps are used to train two distinct classifiers a support_vector and an easy to interpret exhaustive rule classifier both classifiers achieve better than leave one complex out cross_validation accuracy and correctly predict smisps of known ppi inhibitors not in the training_set a pdb wide analysis suggests that nearly half of all ppis may be susceptible to small_molecule inhibition proteinprotein_interactions ppis play_a in nearly every biological_function and are a promising new class of biological targets_for ppis present a number of unique challenges compared to targets that have historically dominated pharmaceutical efforts such as enzymes g_protein and ionchannels unlike these targets which have evolved to bind small_molecules ppis have no convenient natural substrate to serve as a starting_point for small_molecule design however alanine_scanning mutagenesis reveals that most of the energy of a ppi is contributed by just a few hot_spot a small cluster of co located interface residues that includes at least one hot_spot provides a starting_point for the rational_design of small_molecule indeed the chemical mimicry of small_clusters of key_residues typically deeply buried anchor residues has produced to whom correspondence should be addressed inhibitors for several ppi targets the importance of hot_spot and the difficulty in performing alanine_scanning mutagenesis has led to the development of several computational_methods for predicting hot_spots energybased methods attempt to directly compute the energetic contributions of residues solvent_accessible sasa and sequence_conservation have also been used to predict hot_spots however the most successful computational_methods use some combination of these and other features and achieve accuracies of often a consensus scoring mechanism is derived using machine_learning such as decision_trees or support_vector although ad_hoc consensus schemes are effective as well in order to enhance specificity and affinity additional interactions beyond those present in a single individual hot_spot residue are needed nearby residues that do not meet the criteria of a hot_spot may also play an important if not essential role in the interaction additionally these residues may describe extra pockets or energetics essential for small_molecule binding or specificity although identifying a minimum set of stereochemical properties consistent with a small_molecule binding_site is challenging the increasing number of ligandprotein and proteinprotein structures in the protein_data pdb provides a foundation to explore this important problem with respect to ppis in fact a systematic analysis of such structures reveals that residues that participate in both ligand and protein binding have distinctly different characteristics from other interface residues this important insight suggests that it may be possible to automatically identify those interface residues that are most susceptible to small_molecule intervention in this work we describe a novel structural bioinformatics_approach that identifies and ranks those clusters of interface residues in a ppi that are most suitable as starting points for rational smallmolecule design we refer to these clusters as small_molecule starting points smisps a smisp is larger than a hot_spot but substantially smaller than the entire collection of interface residues a smisp cluster may include both those residues critical to the proteinprotein_interaction and those with features important for binding_specificity all within a volume accessible to a small_molecule page we analyze the information_theoretic properties of our cluster features to highlight the most useful features for classification we show that we can recover known ppi inhibitor sites and assess the general accessibility of ppis to small_molecule ppis are an emerging class of biological_targets that have been poorly addressed by high_throughput the steadily_increasing amount of ppi structural_information makes structure based rational_design one attractive alternative the interactions of the complex itself provide a natural starting_point as long as the most favorable interactions can be effectively identified previous work has largely focused on identifying individual hotspots i e single residues that contribute a significant portion of the free_energy of the complex we have built upon this previous work to address the problem of finding an entire set of residues that as a unit identify a binding_site that is susceptible to small_molecule inhibition our automated structural_bioinformatics method learns both scoring svm based and filtering rule based_classifiers for identifying these sites a novel aspect of our method is that we use the structure of ppi complexes and known binders at the ppi interface to create our training_set smisps are identified purely from the steric overlap of small_molecule binders and the ppi structure this results in a less quantitative assessment of training examples compared to using alanine_scanning results however our structure based_approach has several advantages the existence of a high_affinity ligand at the protein interface is more relevant to our goal of identifying small_molecule starting points alanine_scanning may identify hot_spots for reasons that are not relevant to inhibition such as the residues contribution to protein_stability additionally the g does not include any backbone contributions which may be important for small_molecule design our structure based method naturally identifies groups of co located residues smisps as opposed to single potentially isolated hot_spot finally our method benefits from the rapidly increasing number of available protein_structures exemplified by the pdb we use a standard svm classifier for ranking smisps but also find that simple thresholding rules provide an easily_interpretable alternative classifier with accuracy similar to more sophisticated techniques unlike previous work that relied on a subjective_evaluation of histograms to set rule thresholds our exhaustive rule classifier uses information_theoretic techniques to automatically identify the optimal classification rules from the training_set our approach correctly_predicts the binding_sites and to a lesser extent the interactions of several known ppi inhibitors perhaps more interestingly the application of our classifiers to a non redundant subset of the pdb containing more than complexes reveals that nearly half the complexes contain at least one chain that has a similar distribution of predicted smisps as complexes with known inhibitors this suggests that ppis may be substantially more susceptible to small_molecule inhibition than indicated by the current distribution of pharmaceutical targets the historical bias against ppi targets present in existing compound libraries makes structurebased rational_design a logical paradigm for developing ppi inhibitors the smisps identified using our approach and available from http pocketquery csb pitt edu provide an immediate computational hypothesis to initiate such efforts which have the potential to ultimately culminate in the design of novel therapeutics
