structural_bioinformatics bcov a method for predicting b sheet topology using sparse inverse covariance estimation and integer_programming motivation prediction of protein residue_contacts even at the coarse grain level can help in finding solutions to the protein_structure prediction_problem unlike a helices that are locally stabilized b sheets result from pairwise hydrogen_bonding of two or more disjoint regions of the protein_backbone the problem of predicting contacts among b strands in proteins has been addressed by several supervised computational_approaches recently prediction of residue_contacts based on correlated_mutations has been greatly_improved and finally allows the prediction of d structures of the proteins results in this article we describe bcov which is the first unsuper vised method to predict the b sheet topology starting from the protein_sequence and its secondary_structure bcov takes_advantage of the sparse inverse covariance estimation to define b strand partner scores then an optimization based on integer_programming is carried_out to predict the b sheet connectivity when tested on the prediction of b strand pairing bcov scores with average values of matthews correlation_coefficient mcc and f equal to and respectively on a non redundant dataset of protein_chains known with atomic_resolution our approach well compares with the state of the art methods trained so_far for this specific task availability_and the method is freely_available under general_public at http biocomp unibo it savojard bcov bcov tar gz the new dataset betasheet can be down loaded atb sheets are widespread motifs of local structure found in over of the protein_structures presently available in the protein_data http www rcsb org pdb home home do b sheets are generated by the pairing of two or more b strands held together by characteristic_patterns of hydrogen_bonds running in a parallel or antiparallel fashion prediction of the b sheet topology from the covalent structure of the protein is useful for predicting its tertiary_structure for designing new proteins and for understanding folding pathways the first method to predict b strand pairing was based on a statistical potential approach prediction of b residue_contacts was addressed byusing an elaborate method based on neural_networks steward and thornton adopted an information_theoretic approach to predict b residue pairwise interaction cheng andpioneered the idea of predicting b sheet topologies when the protein secondary_structure is known and set the standard for this type of task their method betapro is based on a d recursive neural_network trained to predict pairing probabilities of interstrand b residue pairs then an algorithm finds alignments between all pairs of b strands and a weighted graph_matching algorithm predicts the b sheet topologies introduced an alternative approach based on markov logic networks mlns this approach exploits b sheet structural constraints defined as logical formulas whose weights can be learned from examples the prediction of b residue_contacts was also applied to the problem of predicting the d structure of proteins using integer linear optimization combined betapro outputs with a bayesian_approach and tested it on subsets of the cheng and baldi benchmark set recently a new method to predict protein b sheet contacts using a maximum_entropy based correlated mutation measure cmm has been introduced and compared with the state of the art methods cmm achieves performances similar to betapro and mlns in recent_years the main breakthroughs in residue_contact have concerned improvements in the exploitation of information from multiple_sequence msa the degree of coevolution of pair of sites in the msa can be used to infer the closeness of the corresponding residues in the d structure different approaches have been described to elucidate the coevolution of columns in an msa including standard correlated_mutations analysis and information_theoretic measures recently some powerful_methods based on the extraction of direct coupling information from msas have been introduced to predict protein contacts both in globular and membrane_proteins these new contact prediction_methods are not only improved with respect the previous_approaches but also finally allow to predict d structures of the proteins for review see dein this article we describe bcov a new approach for b sheet topology prediction based on sparse inverse covariance estimation and integer_programming bcov is the first unsupervised method that addresses this task we use the residue contact propensities provided by the protein sparse inverse covariance psicov method to compute the scores of the b strand pairings we selected psicov because it is freely_available and does not require proprietary software to run then we apply an integer_programming optimization to assign the bsheet topology bcov well compares with the performances of the state of the art algorithms betapro cmms and mlns that integrate supervised techniques to address the same task
