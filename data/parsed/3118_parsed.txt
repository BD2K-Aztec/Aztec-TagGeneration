msidv a versatile_tool to visualize biological_indices from mass_spectrometry data mass_spectrometry msi visualizes the simultaneous lateral distribution of multiple compounds on sample_surface however it is still difficult to visualize biological_indices such as energy_charge index from multiple compounds because of the lack of publicly_available tools here we present msidv a visualization_tool for biological_indices calculated from mass_spectrometry data which can effectively scan a series of mass_spectra and process calculate and visualize user_defined index measures accurately with a number of signal_processing features availability_and msidv is implemented in python and is freely_available on the web at https sourceforge net_projects msidv mass_spectrometry msi is a label_free method to acquire spatially_resolved multiple molecular distribution by acquiring mass_spectra across the surface of a sample typically matrix_assisted maldi and desorption electrospray_ionization technology are applied to ionize various endogenous compounds for msi this technique has been used for a variety of samples ranging from brain_tissues to bacterial colonies it has enormous_potential in biological studies including pathological analysis and biomarker_development since msi features huge and complex structure of mass_spectrum data it is important to develop dedicated analytical software_tools most of the current visualization_tools for msi data were designed to visualize a single_molecule of interest based on its m z value however in many biological studies biological_indices derived from the measures of multiple molecules are frequently used to assess the biological state for example energy_charge which is an index of metabolic_energy available from adenylate can be defined as to indicate the energy_status in cells adenylate_kinase mass action ratio which is defined as is also an important measure used to assess the kinase_activity in a model an increase of glomerular atp amp and atp_adp can be seen in the diabetic_kidney oxidative_stress can be measured by deriving index defined as the ratio of glutathione in reduced and oxidized forms the visualization of such biological_indices based on msi data can be quite informative for assessing the physiological_status but the lack of publicly_available dedicated tools in this area has made it difficult to use msi data for such applications here we present msidv a flexible tool to visualize biological_indices using msi data unlike conventional msi visualization_tools users can specify multiple m z values of interest and flexibly set calculation formulae to derive index values additional signal_processing methods can be selected to improve the accuracy of index calculations and the quality of the visualization msidv runs locally on standard windows workstations with the python environment and related libraries mation in the x y direction of the sample_surface second the binary file of the imzml is scanned for the intensity values at user_defined m z locations based on the offset and length information users can set up to six m z values for the peaks of interest together with window_size the intensity value for the peak of interest is acquired as the mean median highest or integral of the intensity values within the user_defined m z range for instance for m z as the peak of interest m z as the window_size and mean chosen as the output intensity value the mean of the intensity values in the range between m z and is taken as the intensity value of the peak of interest median and highest_intensity values within a m z range are particularly useful to acquire accurate images in case there is a shift in the mass calibration over time because of long acquisition times index values are calculated using the acquired intensity values and a user_defined formula configured by editing a template as shown below c i o c i o c i o c i o c i o c i where i are intensity values of the peaks of interest and c are userdefined coefficient values operator types o can be chosen from addition subtraction multiplication and division elements of the formula can be omitted to express a simple calculation visualization of the calculated index is achieved by allocating index values to a two_dimensional matrix based on the spatial_information acquired from the xml metafile in the imzml file to enhance the quality of index visualization intensity and index values are processed further in the following ways index values often artificially take extreme_values because the intensity value of one of the elements in a formula is unusually_low or zero because of the low quality of the mass_spectrum in such cases the pixel becomes a hot_spot in the visualization because the index value is extremely_high thereby disrupting the dynamic range of the visualization image to avoid this lower and upper threshold_values can be set to cut_off outlier intensity or index values so that only reasonable values that fall between the thresholds are used for index visualization alternatively a contrast stretching method can be applied where the index value distribution is rescaled to include all values that fall within user_defined percentiles further histogram equalization can be applied where index values are rescaled so they are equally_distributed on the histogram the detail of histogram equalization is described in the supplemental information these processing algorithms effectively enhance the contrast of the index image users can choose the signal_processing method from among these options or they can choose to apply both methods in a series msidv generates the visualized index data as an image file tif file it also provides raw_data in the form of a two_dimensional data matrix in csv format
