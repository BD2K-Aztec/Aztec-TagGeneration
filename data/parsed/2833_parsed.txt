mdweb and mdmoby an integrated web_based for molecular_dynamics simulations mdweb and mdmoby constitute a web_based to help access to molecular_dynamics md in the standard and high_throughput regime the platform provides tools to prepare systems from pdb structures mimicking the procedures followed by human_experts it provides inputs and can send simulations for three of the most popular md packages amber namd and gromacs tools for analysis of trajectories either provided by the user or retrieved from our model database http mmb pcb ub es model are also incorporated the platform has two ways of access a set of web_services based on the biomoby framework mdmoby programmatically accessible and a web_portal mdweb availability http mmb irbbarcelona org mdweb additional information and methodology details can be found at the web sitemolecular dynamics md has experienced a long evolution since its origins being now a mature technique that allows to obtain accurate pictures of the dynamics of proteins and nucleic_acids unfortunately the practical use of md is limited by three factors i force_fields uncertainties ii the need of large computational_resources and iii the high_level expertise needed to use efficiently the technique indeed setting up a system for simulation requires a large series of operations and a number of decisions that demand a significant degree of expertise and large_amounts of human time in most cases similar to that of computing the trajectory the end result is that newcomers to the field face a stiff learning_curve these problems reach a maximum in highthroughput projects van to whom correspondence should be addressed der where thousands of trajectories need to be launched and supercomputer resources are required we present here a tool designed to help nave users to completely prepare systems for simulation and that allows expert users to use md in the high_throughput regime the tool is presented in two different versions a web_services oriented software platform mdmoby and a web_portal mdweb the technology has been adapted to be accessed as web_services following biomoby www biomoby org mdmoby can be run with usual web_services clients and also programmatically through suitable apis http inb bsc es in turn the web_portal mdweb provides a friendly environment to setup new systems run test simulations and perform analysis within a guided interface setup files can be prepared at present time for amber namd and gromacs and analyses can be carried_out from trajectories written in the most usual formats additionally the platform is interfaced to our flexibility analysis software flexserv so providing coarsegrained simulation and advanced analysis tools and also with our model database
