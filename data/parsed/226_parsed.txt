genome_analysis a low polynomial algorithm for assembling clusters_of from intergenomic symmetric best matches motivation identifying orthologous_genes in multiple_genomes is a fundamental task in comparative_genomics construction of intergenomic symmetrical best matches symbets and joining them into clusters is a popular method of ortholog definition embodied in several software programs despite their wide use the computational_complexity of these programs has not been thoroughly examined results in this work we show that in the standard approach of iteration through all triangles of symbets the memory scales with at least the number of these triangles o g where g number of genomes and construction time scales with the iteration through each pair i e o g we propose the edgesearch algorithm that iterates over edges in the symbet graph rather than triangles of symbets and as a result has a worst_case complexity of only o g log g several optimizations reduce the run time even further in realistically sparse graphs in two real_world datasets of genomes from bacteriophages pogs and mollicutes mogs an implementation of the edgesearch algorithm runs about an order of magnitude faster than the original algorithm and scales much better with increasing number of genomes with only minor differences in the final results and up to times_faster than the popular orthomcl program with a overlap between the identified groups of orthologs availability_and c source_code freely availableclassification of genes and their products into families of homologs is a key_component of any study in comparative_genomics the central problem here is to define orthologous relationships between genes in two or more species orthologs i e homologous_genes related by speciation tend to retain the same function after divergence from their common_ancestor to whom correspondence should be addressed whereas paralogs i e homologous_genes related by duplication within a lineage typically differentiate to perform distinct functions paralogs are subdivided into in paralogs which have diverged after a reference speciation event often the last speciation event in the minimal clade that includes the two compared lineages and out paralogs that diverged before this event although in some cases the paralogy status is difficult to resolve in practice e g in the event of differential paralog loss in all examined species because of the complex_interplay of speciation and duplication of genes a family of in paralogs in one lineage can be orthologous to a single gene in another lineage so the problem of identification of orthologs has been redefined to the identification of orthologous_groups i e orthologs as well as their lineage_specific duplications the clusters_of cogs resource was devised for this purpose soon after the representatives of all three domains of life bacteria archaea and eukarya were sampled by complete genome_sequencing many methods of ortholog inference have been proposed reviewed in and their comparative performance has been reviewed these methods belong to the two major classes of approaches those that first identify all homologs in a set of species and then attempt to distinguish between orthologs and paralogs by analyzing the distribution of the genes from different species across the tips of the tree these approaches typically include comparison with another tree representing the consensus view of the evolution of those species and those that do not reconstruct the trees explicitly but instead use a heuristic to compile the pairs of genes each in a different genome that are each others best scoring matches symbets for symmetric best hits also sometimes called bbh or rbh for bidirectional or reciprocal best hits in their respective genomes examples of automated implementations of the former approach include the publicly_available algorithms ensemblcompara synergy rio orthostrapper and the databases of orthologous protein_families hobacgen hovergen and hogenome whereas examples of the latter include orthomcl eggnog inparanoid and multiparanoid msoar and multimsoar homologene roundup and oma still other methods exist that do not fall neatly into either category such as that described in which uses topological distance in a species_tree as a factor in a linkage equation to find dense clusters in a multipartite graph whose edges are not restricted to symbets the tree based_approaches are often considered superior to the pair linking methods because the former utilize explicit algorithms to identify duplication and speciation_events on the gene protein_family tree whereas pair linking methods use the symmetricbest match relationship as a surrogate criterion of orthology an additional objection to using blast score for defining symbets is that it might not be a good estimate of the true evolutionary distance between two homologous_sequences leading to errors in evolutionary inference studies of this problem that we are aware of mostly showcase the examples where the bias leading to errors indeed exists e g but there is no evidence to show that the blast score is a poor statistical predictor of orthology at the genome_scale on the contrary the comparisons of tree based and pair linking methods of ortholog definition show that the two classes of methods tend to produce similar lists of orthologs with the differences mostly due to the sensitivity of the homology_search and to differential treatment of in paralogous relationships and the related problem of optimal splitting of large_clusters of paralogs given the generally good correspondence shown by the best methods in the two classes of approaches and because pair linking algorithms are faster and easier to automate than tree based_methods which moreover have the potential to succumb to errors of their own that are intrinsic to construction of phylogenetic_trees especially at large evolutionary_distances many practical efforts of genome_scale ortholog identification rely on pair linking methods however despite the prevalence of these approaches in comparative_genomics there has been little examination of their computational_complexity and scalability in this study we analyze the process of the triangle merging step of cog construction from a graph_theoretical viewpoint to gain a better understanding of its limitations and propose a new algorithm that has the complexity of o g log g where g is the number of genomes which compares_favorably with the high polynomial o g of the more traditional approaches
