the mrna landscape at yeast translation_initiation sites although translation_initiation has been well studied many questions remain in elucidating its mechanisms an ongoing challenge is to understand how ribosomes choose a translation_initiation tis to gain new insights we analyzed large sets of tiss with the aim of identifying common characteristics that are potentially of functional_importance nucleotide sequence_context has previously been demonstrated to play_an in the ribosomes selection of a tis and mrna secondary_structure is also emerging as a contributing_factor here we analyze mrna secondary_structure using the folding predictions of the rnafold algorithm we present a method for analyzing these results using a rank ordering approach to assess the overall degree of predicted_secondary in a given region of mrna in addition we used a modified_version of the algorithm that makes use of only a subset of the standard versions output to incorporate base_pairing polarity constraints suggested by the ribosome scanning process these methods were employed to study the tiss of genes in saccharomyces_cerevisiae trends in base_composition and base_pairing probabilities suggest that efficient translation_initiation and high protein expression are aided by reduced secondary_structure upstream and downstream of the tis however the downstream reduction is not observed for sets of tiss with nucleotide_sequence contexts unfavorable for translation_initiation consistent with previous suggestions that secondary_structure downstream of the ribosome can facilitate tis recognition in the scanning model of translation_initiation a small_ribosomal binds at the m g cap of an mrna_transcript and scans in the direction until it reaches the first aug codon in an appropriate sequence_context the small_subunit then assembles with the large_ribosomal and initiates translation of the open_reading terminating upon reaching the first in frame stop_codon however some instances of non standard translational events such as leaky scanning leaky initiation alternative translation_initiation and initiation at non canonical to whom correspondence should be addressed i e non aug start_codons fall outside the original model the recognition initiation event depends partially on the nucleotide sequence_context flanking the initiation_codon it has been noted previously that positions and relative to the initiation_codon provide particularly strong cues information based measures of context based on sequence_conservation surrounding aligned tiss suggest that other nucleotide positions also contribute to recognition the translation relative individual information trii score supplementary_material m weir and m rice submitted for publication is a convenient and sensitive measure of sequence_conservation in sets of aligned sequences the trii score of each sequence is the same as its individual information but incorporates background nucleotide frequencies by taking_into the relative_frequencies of all four nucleotides at each position in an alignment of high_confidence functional start sites trii scores quantify an individual sequences conformance to characteristic nucleotide preferences in the vicinity of the tis it has been shown that mrna secondary_structure can influence scanning and translating ribosomes in various viruses escherichia_coli and saccharomyces_cerevisiae pseudoknot secondary_structures have been associated with frameshifting of translating ribosomes and stop_codon readthrough secondary_structure including pseudoknots can also influence the selection of a translation_initiation tis examples_include functioning of viral internal_ribosome ires and modulation through riboswitches characterized in prokaryotes it is speculated that future_studies may uncover analogous riboswitch regulation in eukaryotes moreover a hairpin positioned downstream of a tis can increase the probability of initiation when the initiation_codon is in an otherwise unfavorable nucleotide sequence_context it has been proposed that the effect of this hairpin is to slow the scanning ribosomal subunit increasing the interaction between the initiation_codon and the ribosomal machinery conversely a sufficiently stable hairpin upstream of a tis can completely_abolish initiation at that site perhaps by interfering with the small_ribosomal before it reaches the tis to evaluate further these roles of rna_secondary in tis recognition we applied the rna_folding algorithm rnafold to subsets of mrnas selected based on trii scores proteome scale protein expression studies and ribosome_profiling studies predicted rna_structures of tiss with high trii scores trii high were compared with those of tiss with low trii scores trii low similarly we compared rna_structures for tiss with higher and lower ribosome density ribosome high and ribosome low respectively and genes with higher and lower protein expression the trends revealed by these comparisons suggest how rna_secondary can influence both positively and negatively the functioning of the translation_machinery
