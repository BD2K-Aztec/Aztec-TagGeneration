sequence_analysis structural_variation analysis with strobe reads motivation structural_variation including deletions duplications and rearrangements of dna_sequence are an important contributor to genome_variation in many organisms in human many structural_variants are found in complex and highly repetitive_regions of the genome making their identification difficult a new sequencing_technology called strobe sequencing generates strobe reads containing multiple subreads from a single contiguous fragment of dna strobe reads thus generalize the concept of paired_reads or mate_pairs that have been routinely used for structural variant detection strobe sequencing holds_promise for unraveling complex variants that have been difficult to characterize with current_sequencing results we introduce an algorithm for identification of structural_variants using strobe sequencing_data we consider strobe reads from a test genome that have multiple possible alignments to a reference_genome due to sequencing_errors and or repetitive_sequences in the reference we formulate the combinatorial_optimization of finding the minimum number of structural_variants in the test genome that are consistent with these alignments we solve this problem using an integer_linear using simulated strobe sequencing_data we show that our algorithm has better sensitivity_and than paired_read approaches for structural_variation identification identifying the dna_sequence differences that distinguish individuals is a major_challenge in genetics recent wholegenome sequencing and microarray measurements have shown that copy_number insertions duplications and deletions and balanced rearrangements such as inversions and translocations are common in most organisms including human mouse fly and yeast these larger differences in dna_sequences are commonly referred to as structural_variants the database of genomic_variants currently winter lists nearly copy_number and nearly inversion variants in the human_genome although some of these variants are redundant and or erroneous it is clear that structural_variation is an important component of human genome_variation in fact there are more total base_pairs in human_genome affected by structural_variants than single_nucleotide snp both common and inherited structural_variants and de_novo structural_variants have recently been linked to a number of human_diseases moreover somatic structural_variants are common in cancer_genomes and lead to altered regulation of oncogenes_and and the creation of novel fusion_genes much of the recent excitement surrounding structural_variation stems from better measurement technologies in particular end sequence profiling also known as paired read_mapping has been used to identify structural_variants in both normal and cancer_genomes in paired read_mapping dna_fragments from a test genome are sequenced from both ends and these sequences reads are mapped to a reference_genome paired_reads or mate_pairs with discordant alignments identify inversions translocations transpositions insertions deletions and other rearrangements that distinguish the test genome from the reference_genome a number of methods have been introduced to identify structural_variants from paired_read sequencing_data structural_variants vary_widely in size and complexity and are more difficult to characterize than snps many are associated with repeated_sequences in the genome complicating their detection and characterization in extreme cases the variants themselves have highly repetitive or complex organization relative to the reference_genome for example different lists of variants have been identified in the same individual using older clone based sequencing and various nextgeneration sequencing_platforms characterizing these complex variants requires longer_reads longer fragments or both pacific_biosciences recently demonstrated strobe sequencing_technology a strobe read or strobe consists of multiple subreads from a single contiguous fragment of dna these subreads are separated by a number of dark nucleotides called advances whose identity is unknown a strobe with two subreads is analogous to a paired_read while strobes with more than two subreads provide_additional for structural variant detection thus far pacific_biosciences has demonstrated strobe reads with lengths up to kb with a strobe read is a sequence of subreads and advances when aligned to a reference_genome pairs of adjacent subreads can either be labeled as concordant or discordant according to a derived minimum and maximum allowed length of an advance strobe sequencing provides reads from long contiguous fragments of dna with low input dna requirements a feature missing from current short insert sequencing_technologies however a consideration with strobe reads are the per base error_rates while the capabilities of the pacific_biosciences commercial machine expected later in are not yet known we conservatively assume that this error_rate will be higher than existing nextgeneration_sequencing thus realizing the advantages of strobe reads for structural_variation detection demands new algorithms that utilize information from multiple subreads while allowing higher single base error_rates we introduce an algorithm to identify and characterize complex structural_variants with strobe reads by considering multiple possible alignments for each subread we formulate the combinatorial_optimization of selecting an alignment for each subread of every strobe read so that the total number of structural_variants in the test genome is minimized this generalizes a formulation that has proved successful for paired_read analysis we show how to reduce the problem to an optimization_problem on directed_graphs and derive an integer_linear ilp for the problem we apply our method to simulated strobe read sequencing_data we find that strobe reads outperform paired_reads for structural_variation detection in particular at a fixed sensitivity level strobe reads have nearly double the specificity of paired_reads we applied our algorithm to simulated strobe sequencing_data from pacific_biosciences the pacific_biosciences simulator models the errors in their single_molecule sequencing_technology specifically the simulator models the higher rate of insertions_and using a roughly_equivalent ratio of each relative to miscall errors in subreads that is typically seen in their data we analyze two datasets structural_variants identified in the venter whole genome_assembly structural_variants vary_widely in size and complexity and thus are generally more difficult to characterize than snps sensitive and specific detection of structural_variation in human_genomes from next_generation data remains a challenge this is due to both technological limitations in read_length error_rates and insert_sizes and biological_factors structural_variants in human are i enriched for repetitive_sequences near their breakpoints ii may overlap or have complex architectures and iii recurrent but not identical variants may exist at the same locus we have shown that strobe reads have advantages in sensitivity_and over paired_reads for structural variant detection since a single strobe can resolve multiple breakpoints inference of duplications and rearrangements become more direct the method handles both intra chromosomal section and interchromosomal section events making it suitable for genomewide analyses while we have examined deletions inversions and translocations in simulated strobe read data explicitly testing the detection_power of insertions using strobe reads remains future work an interesting question is whether strobe reads will detect more complex variants that are beyond the abilities of current_sequencing we showed a preliminary comparison of simulated strobe sequencing versus simulated short_read short insert sequencing although this comparison demonstrates an advantage for strobes a more rigorous assessment with real sequencing_data is required to obtain a definite comparison of these technologies an inherent limitation in any approach is the accuracy of the underlying alignments most second_generation produce short_reads with increasing error_rates near the end of the reads and few insertions the pacific_biosciences technology differs in that it has predominantly long_reads uniform error over the entire read and an insertion_deletion heavy error_model for these reasons different alignment approaches have been suggested that use k_mer seeding followed by alignment extension in our study mappings were ranked using a naive smithwaterman score assuming uniform quality of all sequenced bases as mapping and scoring for single_molecule sequencing_technologies mature the proposed ilp can be changed to use more sophisticated scoring_functions increasing sensitivity by ensuring true alignments are included and specificity by reducing spurious alignments current and new technologies are continually increasing the read_length or subread length in the case of strobe reads longer subreads imply a higher frequency of split_reads subreads which span a breakpoint such events can be readily incorporated into the ilp by converting subreads with non overlapping mappings relative to the subread into psuedo strobe reads leading to paths of variable_length from source to sink for a given strobe read the advance in this case becomes the distance between the end of the first alignment and the start of second alignment on the subread this allows the method to be used as a generic framework for evaluating genome_wide structural_variation given any form of sequencing_data the suggested model is designed to handle germ_line mutations in scenarios with heterogeneous data or when somatic_mutations are abundant such as in cancer the assumptions in our model could be limiting for example the notion of minimizing breakpoints and clustering breakpoint junctions may be incorrect in areas of elevated chromosome_instability each individual cancer cell may undergo different mutations leading to slightly or greatly different breakpoint boundaries additionally breakpoint clustering is significantly more challenging as some genomic_aberrations may only be present in a small fraction of cells integrating copy_number information on a per breakpoint basis could provide added power in detecting these lower frequency events
