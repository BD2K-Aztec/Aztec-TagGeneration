structural_bioinformatics unialign protein_structure meets evolution motivation during the evolution functional sites on the surface of the protein as well as the hydro phobic core maintaining the structural_integrity are well conserved however available protein_structure alignment_methods align protein_structures based solely on the d geometric similarity limiting their ability to detect functionally_relevant correspondences between the residues of the proteins especially for distantly_related homologous_proteins results in this article we propose a new protein pairwise structure alignment algorithm unialign that incorporates additional evolutionary_information captured in the form of sequence_similarity sequence_profiles and residue conservation we define a per residue score uniscore as a weighted_sum of these and other features and develop an iterative_optimization procedure to search for an alignment with the best overall uniscore our extensive experiments on cdd homstrad and balibase benchmark_datasets show that unialign outperforms commonly used structure alignment_methods we further demonstrate unialigns ability to develop family specific models to drastically improve the quality of the alignments availability_and unialign is available as a web_service at http sacan biomed protein_structure can reveal distant evolutionary_relationships between proteins that sequence_alignment alone is incapable to capture and thus plays_an in understanding protein_function supposing the evolutionary continuity of structure and function identification of structure similarities could elucidate the possible function of newly_discovered proteins structure alignment identifies functionally equivalent residues in proteins and is often used as the gold_standard for improving multiple_sequence despite the importance of the problem and the recent_advances in the field there is yet no widely_accepted for structural_alignment large_scale comparisons of existing_methods have concluded that there is no single best method that works well for all proteins various pairwise protein_structure programs have been developed differing in their representation of protein_structure the scoring_function used to evaluate the goodness of an alignment and the optimization_algorithm used to search for the best alignment with respective to the scoring_function generally there are two different strategies to generate a structural_alignment directly searching for the optimal alignment by piecing together small aligned substructures e g dalilite and ce and iteratively optimizing a rough initial alignment using cycles of geometric superposition and residue pair collection steps e g tmalign and deepalign the scoring_function is used to evaluate how good an alignment is and recognize the optimal alignment among all the candidates common scoring_functions utilize the root_mean distance rmsd between the aligned residues taking_into the length of the proteins traditionally protein_structure has been described as a geometric optimization_problem prudently optimizing the geometric superposition of proteins this limits the usefulness of the resulting alignments requiring researchers to seek additional validation from the amino_acid types or catalytic_activity of the aligned residues this is evident from the presence of alternative alignments that are equally good in terms of the quality of their geometric superposition but that vary_widely in terms of their accuracy in identifying functionally and evolutionarily equivalent residues for example it is possible to achieve a good geometric superposition of immunoglobulin despite misaligning a conserved disulfide_bridge furthermore pure geometric information based structure alignment programs are found highly_sensitive to conformational changes it has been suggested that structural_alignment can benefit from the evolutionary_information provided by the alignment of homologous_proteins this is not surprising since information extracted from homologous_proteins represent general_features of the protein_family and allow the identification of similarity to a remote sequence or family even when the similarity to each individual aligned sequence is not significant in recent_years researchers have begun to integrate sequence_similarity information into the scoring_function for example formatt incorporates amino_acid matrices derived from evolutionarily_related protein pairs when constructing the alignment deepalign incorporates the blosum mutation matrix a local substructure mutation matrix and hydrogen_bonding similarity into its scoring_function while these methods utilize the amino_acid as described by the blosum substitution matrix they do not utilize evolutionary_information available from the history of the proteins being aligned it is well established that evolutionary profiles have a dominant advantage over sequence_based alignments and provide greater_accuracy in fold_recognition and protein classification tasks motivated by this we introduce uniscore a new similarity_score for structure alignment which integrates evolutionary_information in the form of sequence and conservation profiles as well as amino_acid secondary_structure and geometric similarity_measures using this new similarity_score we implement unialign a new protein pairwise structure alignment algorithm which focuses on identifying not only structurally equivalent but also evolutionarily favorable residue alignments we demonstrate that compared to other methods the alignments generated by unialign are in better agreement with hand curated reference alignments furthermore for difficult cases when unialign and other methods_fail to generate good alignments we propose familyspecific alignment models to drastically improve the alignments in this study we have introduced unialign a new structural alignment_method that integrates different sources of information in order to achieve a more accurate alignment compared to classical_methods that utilize only the geometry of the proteins and the recently_developed that incorporate sequence_information unialign produces alignments that are in better agreement with expert curated datasets unialign is robust with respect to the sequence_homology or the geometric similarity levels of the proteins being aligned furthermore adjustment of unialigns parameters allows for development of family specific models that highlight the features most relevant to the proteins in that family the increased accuracy achieved by unialign is at the cost of increased demands in computing time for an average sized pair of proteins it can take up to min to calculate a structure alignment with most of this time spent on the homology_search to construct a multiple_sequence the running_times can be significantly_reduced by caching and re using the evolutionary_information calculated for each protein in their alignments with different proteins a detailed running time analysis is provided in the supplemental data we expect a number of downstream applications to benefit from the additional accuracy provided by unialign ability to develop family specific alignment models will find use in structure classification_problem integration of evolutionary_information is likely to improve the protein_protein prediction protocols that rely on structural_alignment note for each protein pair better of the two alignments is shown in bold unialign
