databases_and the ensembl rest api ensembl data for any language motivation we present a web_service to access ensembl data using representational state transfer rest the ensembl rest server enables the easy retrieval of a wide_range of ensembl data by most programming_languages using standard formats such as json and fasta while minimizing client work we also introduce bindings to the popular ensembl variant effect predictor tool permitting large_scale programmatic variant analysis independent of any specific programming_language availability_and the ensembl rest api can be accessed at http rest ensembl org and source_code is freely_available under an apache license fromensembl data are accessible in a variety of ways including our genome_browser biomart data_mining tool the bioconductor r package or viewers such as dalliance direct programmatic_access has historically required a native client interacting with the database in its own programming_language this solution required the reimplementation of functionality across multiple languages which was costly to maintain and partly led to our focus only on a perl api for ensembl third_party ensembl api bindings do exist but may struggle to keep pace with new developments resulting in possible outof date implementations remote procedure calling and web_services are a widely_accepted solution to provide a single programming interface to multiple languages soap is one such popular technology but is burdened with significant setup and processing overhead for the client newer web_services are based on the representational state transfer rest pattern rest encourages the reuse of http technology to send and receive data in the same way a web_browser requests and receives a web_page via uniform resource locators urls rest imposes no format restrictions on the returned data the distributed annotation system is an attempt to design a generic rest system for a biological data but necessitated custom client libraries coupled with an xml format seen as verbose and inflexible we present a set of rest bindings to access ensembl data and tools exposing these data in simple formats that are well understood by a large proportion of programming_languages the ensembl rest api can be used to query the ensembl data resources and tools from a variety of programming_languages and enables flexible programmatic_access previously only supported by our perl api the reduced setup costs for a client means that users can interact with the latest ensembl data without the need to follow our regular api releases supporting post requests for vep enables the annotation of large_scale variation datasets without the need to download or host the vep code or cache files http has also proven a more robust data protocol when compared with mysql improving user experience for worldwide users a number of native third_party apis have been developed to help access the rest api in languages such as python r and javascript which demonstrates the usefulness of our rest api to these increasingly popular bioinformatics languages javascript applications such as wasabi http wasabiapp org import ensembl gene_trees and genome multiple_sequence via rest creating a seamless link between tool and data rnacentral displays non coding_gene models alongside ensembl annotation in genoverse http genoverse org a html genome_browser using data from our rest api rest has shown itself to be a sustainable model for the distribution of genomic_data to multiple programming_languages we plan to expand the coverage of ensembl data and tools hosted in it we also plan to provide more formats from the service such as vcf output from our vep endpoint we will continue to work with tool developers to ensure the service is suitable for their purposes benchmarks are averaged over three runs with a single perl program with nine concurrent connections
