ecplot an online tool for making standardized plots from large_datasets for bioinformatics publications motivation and results we have implemented ecplot an online tool for plotting charts from large_datasets this tool supports a variety of chart types commonly used in bioinformatics publications in our benchmarking it was able to create a box and whisker plot with about data_points and mb total file size within several seconds the design of the tool makes common formatting operations easy to perform it also allows more complex operations to be achieved by advanced xml extensible markup_language and programming options data and formatting styles are stored in separate files such that style templates can be made and applied to new data_sets the text_based file_formats based on xml facilitate efficient manipulation of formatting styles for a large number of data series these file_formats also provide a means to reproduce published figures from raw_data which complement parallel efforts in making the data and software involved in published analysis results accessible we demonstrate this idea by using ecplot to replicate some complex figures from a previous publication availability_and ecplot and its source_code under mit_license are available at https yiplab bioinformatics_research usually involves large_scale datasets charts are commonly used to provide a succinct summarization of complex patterns in the data there are many tools available for chart plotting some commercial products include matlab microsoft_excel and prism other tools include google chart tools gnuplot and r these tools vary substantially in terms of the level of programming_skills required cost and platform specificity although some of them provide graphical_user some others require mandatory programming knowledge from users the costs of these tools range from free of charge to hundreds of us dollars per license some of the tools can only be run on specific operating_systems oss while others have versions for more oss or can be run on any platform through a web_interface for bioinformatics publications there are some specific requirements on chart plotting software the software should be able to create plots from large_amounts of data within a short period ideally without strong requirements on the computing_power of users machines the software should allow users to easily format a large number of data series with exact style specifications in particular having long lists of formatting options distributed across many different sections of the user_interface and asking users to repeat long_sequences of mouse clicks at precise locations for every data series should both be avoided the software should facilitate seamless re application of a given formatting style to another dataset as it is common to have multiple main or supplementary figures of the same type for different sets of data we have designed and developed a software_tool ecplot which fulfills all these requirements it is a free online tool that can be accessed using any contemporary web_browsers it targets both users with and without programming experience the most computationally_intensive plotting operations are all performed at the server side which avoids the need for powerful client machines
