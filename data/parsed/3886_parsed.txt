sequence_analysis rare_variant discovery and calling by sequencing pooled_samples with overlaps motivation for many complex_traits diseases it is believed that rare_variants account for some of the missing_heritability that cannot be explained by common_variants sequencing a large number of samples through dna pooling is a cost_effective strategy to discover rare_variants and to investigate their associations with phenotypes overlapping pool designs provide further benefit because such approaches can potentially identify variant carriers which is important for downstream applications of association analysis of rare_variants however existing algorithms for analysing sequence_data from overlapping pools are limited results we propose a complete data analysis framework for overlapping pool designs with novelties in all three major_steps variant pool and variant locus identification variant allele frequency_estimation and variant sample decoding the framework can be used in combination with any design matrix we have investigated its performance based on two different overlapping designs and have compared it with three state of the art methods by simulating targeted_sequencing and by pooling real sequence_data results on both datasets show that our algorithm has made significant improvements over existing ones in conclusion successful discovery of rare_variants and identification of variant carriers using overlapping pool strategies critically depend on many steps from generation of design matrixes to decoding algorithms the proposed_framework in combination with the design matrixes generated based on the chinese remainder theorem achieves best overall results availability source_code of the program termed vip for variant identification by pooling is available at http cbc case edu vip in the past_few genome_wide have successfully identified many genetic_variants associated with complex human_diseases and traits however many of those variants identified by genome_wide can explain only a small proportion of inherited risk one possible explanation is that genetic_variants with low minor_allele mafs and rare_variants contribute a substantial fraction of the missing_heritability although common genetic_variations such as single_nucleotide snps have been well studied and characterized through international collaborative_effort e g the hapmap project investigation of low mafs or rare snps is much harder first of all large_sample are required to discover and type rare snps furthermore before a rare snp has been discovered array based_technologies cannot be used to type individual genotypes from samples only very recently with the development of next_generation the international community has been able to systematically survey variants with low mafs using large number of population samples through collaborations results from the genomes_project about variant locations types and allele_frequencies lay a solid foundation in studying relationships of genotypes and phenotypes however the cost for a project at this scale e g sequencing samples with deep coverage is still prohibitively high for most individual investigators even though sequencing_costs have been continuously decreasing on the other hand for casecontrol based studies on complex_diseases thousands of samples are normally required for each study to achieve a reasonable power an effective strategy to reduce the overall cost is to pool dna_sequences from different individuals together and then to sequence the pooled_dna with high coverage it not only capitalizes on the continually decreasing sequencing_costs per se but also can effectively reduce the costs associated with dna preparations and target capturing for targeted sequencing_projects the cost for target capturing is proportional to the number of samples i e number of individuals without pooling versus number of pools with pooling and remains_stable over the years pooling strategies can save tremendously on sample preparations furthermore for targeted sequencing_projects depending on the size of targeted_regions and coverage researchers may not be able to fully take advantage of instruments capacity if sequencing one individual at a time even with multiplexing using barcodes inspired by this strategy both wet_lab using pooling and methodologies serving pooling have emerged recently among them syzygy to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com has been used in several real sequencing_projects that used the pooling strategy however the main limitation of the naive pooling strategy is its inability to detect variant carriers which is of high importance for disease_association of rare_variants multiplexing using barcodes can partially solve the problem but the cost is still high because of limited barcoding capacity each run and per sample cost for dna preparation and target capturing a promising alternative so_called overlapped pooling designs has been proposed by several groups the basic idea is rooted in combinatorial designs by allocating individuals into a small number but different pools it is possible to identify samples that carry variants based on their pool signatures overlapped pooling designs represent a very important and economically_feasible approach to discover rare snps and to identify rare mutant carriers by doing so one can avoid the two step approach where rare_variant loci are first discovered by sequencing and then genotyped using customized arrays however the studies of such an important strategy have been limited so_far there are mainly two existing algorithms dna sudoku and the logarithm design the latter is termed overlap log in this study dna sudoku allocates samples to pools i e to construct a design matrix based on the chinese remainder theorem crt and identifies variant carriers with the help of combinatorial group testing theory however dna sudoku has several limitations first it assumes that all variant loci are known as a prior therefore cannot be used in detecting novel rare_variants second its snp_calling algorithm which is based on the ratio of counts of variant alleles and reference alleles does not take sequencing_errors into consideration which can significantly affect calling results for rare_variants finally it does not provide variant allele_frequency vaf estimation which is commonly used in testing associations for casecontrol_studies the overlap log constructs its design matrix based on the binary representation of integers sample identification numbers although such a design is optimal in terms of the number of pools required it cannot effectively_identify variant carriers mainly because it allocates too many individuals in each pool to address_these we propose a complete data analysis framework for overlapping pool designs which consists of several steps the framework termed vip for variant identification by pooling is very flexible and can be combined with any pool design approaches and sequence mapping alignment tools our major_contributions include algorithms for variant pool and variant locus identification vaf estimation and decoding of variant samples to identify variants in pooled_samples we propose a log likelihood_ratio statistic to estimate the variant allele ratio var in each pool theoretical_analysis further reveals the relationship between the statistical_power of the test to detect_variants of certain frequencies and sequencing_coverage i e read_depth and error_rate variant loci can then be declared based on variant pool identification the vaf of each variant locus can consequentially be estimated based on a weighted_average of the estimated var of all pools finally a set of algorithms are proposed to identify variant carriers to evaluate the effectiveness of vip we have performed extensive experiments by simulating a targeted_sequencing project with different number of samples and different design strategies and different per sample sequence_coverage in comparison with the two existing_approaches i e dna sudoku and overlap log vip has made significant improvements in all steps for example for variant pool and variant locus identification f scores the harmonic mean of precision and recall have been increased from to for various datasets in particular vip sudoku vip in combination with sudoku design matrixes achieves best overall results to further evaluate the performance of vip under more realistic settings we have created another dataset by pooling the real sequence_data from the genome_project using the sudoku design and compared its performance with another newer algorithm syzygy syzygy was recently_developed for the non overlapping pool design and has been used in real sequencing_projects it can detect variant pools loci and estimate allele_frequencies among other functionalities however syzygy was not designed for overlapping pool strategies and it cannot directly decode variant carriers to apply syzygy on this new dataset we have combined syzygy with some of the strategies in vip for allele frequency_estimation from overlapped pools and variant carrier decoding the modified program termed vip syzygy was then compared with vip on this dataset results show that vip has better performance than vip syzygy in all tasks performed including variant pool variant locus detection allele frequency_estimation and variant carrier identification
