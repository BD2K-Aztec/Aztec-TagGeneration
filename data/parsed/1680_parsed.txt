exims an improved data analysis_pipeline based on a new peak_picking method for exploring imaging mass_spectrometry data downloaded from motivation matrix_assisted imaging mass_spectrometry maldi_ims in omics data_acquisition generates detailed information about the spatial distribution of molecules in a given biological_sample various data_processing methods have been developed for exploring the resultant high volume data however most of these methods process data in the spectral domain and do not make the most of the important spatial_information available through this technology therefore we propose a novel streamlined data analysis_pipeline specifically developed for maldi_ims data utilizing significant spatial_information for identifying hidden significant molecular distribution_patterns in these complex datasets methods the proposed unsupervised algorithm uses sliding_window normalization swn and a new spatial distribution based peak_picking method developed based on gray_level gco matrices followed by clustering of biomolecules we also use gist descriptors and an improved version of gco matrices to extract features from molecular images and minimum medoid distance to automatically estimate the number of possible groups results we evaluated our algorithm using a new maldi_ims metabolomics dataset of a plant eucalypt leaf the algorithm revealed hidden significant molecular distribution_patterns in the dataset which the current component analysis and segmentation map based_approaches failed to extract we further demonstrate the performance of our peak_picking method over other traditional approaches by using a publicly_available maldi_ims proteomics dataset of a rat_brain although swn did not show any significant_improvement as compared with using no normalization the visual_assessment showed an improvement as compared to using the median normalization availability_and the source_code and sample data are freely_available exims sourceforge net matrix_assisted imaging mass_spectrometry maldi_ims has gained popularity in omic sciences because of its ability to produce detailed spatial_information of molecules in a given biological_sample by using a section of a tissue ims can visualize a wide_variety of biomolecules such as proteins lipids and metabolites although this technique has been well established in proteomics the scope of the biological_questions that can be addressed through this technology is still limited mainly due to the shortage of streamlined data analysis_pipelines illustrates the typical maldi_ims data_acquisition workflow in general maldi_ims experiments are performed by thaw mounting a frozen tissue_section onto maldi target a matrix is applied that promotes molecular desorption and ionization and a spectrum is acquired at each of the defined pixels that is for each spatial coordinate of the optical image a mass_spectrum is obtained which represents the intensities of ionizable molecules with various mass charge m z values therefore a maldi_ims dataset can be considered as a collection of spectra moreover by plotting the intensity values corresponding to one particular m z value the intensity image represents the spatial distribution of the corresponding molecule s therefore a maldi_ims dataset can also be considered as a collection of intensity images biologists are mainly interested in identifying molecules that are differentially distributed show different abundances in diverse anatomical_regions thus providing valuable information about the living organism under study usually the maldi_ims datasets are complex and extremely_large in size for example the eucalypt leaf maldi fourier_transform imaging mass_spectrometer fticr ims data_set which is explained later in the sub section includes pixels spectra each of which has peaks resulting in a data_set that is gb therefore it is difficult and time consuming to manually extract meaningful_information from these datasets currently some visualization software_packages like biomap fleximaging imagequest datacube explorer hdi highdefinition maldi_ms imaging metabolite imager msireader scils lab and tissueview have been mainly used on continuous type data_sets where the set of m z values is the same for all spectra however some of them do not support visualization of processed type datasets where the set of m z values is different from one spectrum to another not only these software_packages but also there are many other published supervised and unsupervised methods which have not been implemented as software_tools mainly two unsupervised_learning approaches namely component analysis and spatial segmentation have been utilized for untargeted analysis of maldi_ims data several component analysis methods such as principal_component pca non_negative maximum autocorrelation factorization and probabilistic latent semantic analysis have been used to uncover the variation present in maldi_ims data among these methods pca is the most widely_applied algorithm which represents spatial_patterns of molecules existing in the imaging dataset in terms of a set of score images even though the mass_spectra do not contain negative intensity values pca score images can contain negative_values which make the interpretation a challenge a further difficulty is presented when attempting to determine co localized ion images for each identified pattern the most commonly used unsupervised data_mining approach in maldi_ims is spatial segmentation in this method the imaging dataset is represented as a segmentation map created by grouping spectra based on their similarity highlighting chemically equivalent regions of the tissue since the segmentation map is created solely based on mass_spectral intensities without considering their spatial relationships it does not capture the underlying spatial_structure carried_out de_noising of the individual intensity images before clustering spectra in order to improve the segmentation map however not all of the spatial relationships between spectra can be extracted through de_noising alone hierarchical clustering_algorithm has been extensively used for clustering mass_spectra however it performs poorly when dealing with large and noisy imaging datasets the main weakness of the above unsupervised_learning approaches is that they mainly process the dataset in the spectral domain and do not make the most of the important spatial_information available through this ims technology recently a spatial distribution based peak_picking method and a clustering approach have been introduced and they have_shown therefore it is essential to develop a streamlined data analysis_pipeline specifically for ims data utilizing the important spatial_information available through this ims technology in this paper we propose a new data analysis_pipeline for revealing hidden significant molecular distribution_patterns in maldi_ims data the proposed algorithm consists of five consecutive main steps where the first step involves spectra preprocessing then sliding_window normalization swn is used to normalize the spectra and limit the influence of high_intensity peaks third image de_noising and contrast_enhancement are used to improve the visualization of intensity images fourth peak_picking is performed by processing the individual intensity images we introduce a new peak_picking method based on an improved version of gray_level gco matrix it should be noted that in this context peak_picking denotes the process of identifying molecules with structured spatial_distributions which is different to the standard process of finding peaks in a mass_spectrum finally intensity images are clustered using the fuzzy_c clustering_algorithm prior to clustering gist descriptors and the improved version of gco matrices are used to extract features from individual intensity images and the number of clusters is automatically estimated using minimum medoid distance the primary difference between the proposed workflow and the existing spatial segmentation based_methods is that after spectra normalization the dataset is considered as a collection of intensity images and the subsequent steps are applied on individual images in order to incorporate the significant spatial_information such as pixel positions and the details of the neighbourhood pixels we used a maldi_ims metabolomics dataset of a eucalypt leaf in order to assess the complete pipeline and a publicly_available proteomics dataset of a rat_brain to assess our peak_picking method the important_steps in the proposed data analysis_pipeline are discussed in detail along with the results under sections we use the data_sets described in section to further describe the pipeline and to evaluate the performance
