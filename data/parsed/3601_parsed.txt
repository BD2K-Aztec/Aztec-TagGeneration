data_and ponderosa an automated d noesy peak_picking program enables automated protein structure_determination ponderosa peak_picking of noe data enabled by restriction of shift assignments accepts input information consisting of a protein_sequence backbone and sidechain nmr resonance_assignments and d noesy c edited and or n edited spectra and returns assignments of noesy crosspeaks distance and angle constraints and a reliable nmr_structure represented by a family of conformers ponderosa incorporates and integrates external software_packages talos stride and cyana to carry out different steps in the structure_determination ponderosa implements internal functions that identify and validate noesy peak assignments and assess the quality of the calculated three_dimensional structure of the protein the robustness of the analysis results from ponderosas hierarchical processing_steps that involve iterative interaction among the internal and external modules ponderosa supports a variety of input_formats sparky assignment table shifts and spectrum file_formats ucsf xeasy proton file_format prot and nmr star format star to demonstrate the utility of ponderosa we used the package to determine d structures of two proteins human ubiquitin and escherichia_coli iron_sulfur scaffold_protein variant iscu d a the automatically generated structural constraints and ensembles of conformers were as good as or better than those determined previously by much less automated means availability the program in the form of binary code along with tutorials and reference manuals is available ata major_challenge of structural_biology is to close the gap between known sequences of proteins in genbank and their d structures in pdb automation now plays_a in speeding up the determination of protein_structures by x_ray however the determination of protein_structures by nmr_spectroscopy includes a larger number of steps that present greater challenges for automation the steps basically arepage
