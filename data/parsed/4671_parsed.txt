timex a waiting_time model for mutually_exclusive cancer alterations motivation despite recent_technological in genomic sciences our understanding of cancer_progression and its driving genetic_alterations remains incomplete results we introduce timex a generative probabilistic_model for detecting patterns of various degrees of mutual_exclusivity across genetic_alterations which can indicate pathways involved in cancer_progression timex explicitly accounts for the temporal interplay between the waiting_times to alterations and the observation time in simulation_studies we show that our model outperforms previous methods for detecting mutual_exclusivity on large_scale biological_datasets timex identifies gene groups with strong functional biological_relevance while also proposing new candidates for biological_validation timex possesses several advantages over previous methods including a novel generative probabilistic_model of tumorigenesis direct estimation of the probability of mutual_exclusivity interaction computational_efficiency and high_sensitivity in detecting gene groups involving low_frequency alterations availability_and timex is available as a bioconductor r package at www bsse ethz ch cbg software timex despite recent_technological in genomic sciences our understanding of cancer_progression still faces fundamental challenges to this end new ways of interpreting the increasing amount of generated data are devised aiming at finding biologically_relevant patterns an important example is the separation of genes into drivers which have a selective_advantage and significantly contribute to tumor_progression and passengers which are selectively neutral and can hitchhike along with fitter clones even if intuitive and routinely used identifying drivers as recurrently altered genes only explains tumorigenesis in a fraction of patients alternatively the functional role of drivers can be assessed in the context of groups of genes all possessing the same important function commonly known as pathways once one of the group members is altered the tumor gains a significant selective_advantage the alteration of additional group members does not further increase the selective_advantage of the tumor rendering clones with a single alteration likely the most frequent in this case the group of genes displays a mutually_exclusive alteration pattern current approaches for detecting mutual_exclusivity are either de_novo or based on biological interaction networks while highly informative the current biological_knowledge is incomplete such that limiting the search_space to known biological_interactions significantly_reduces the detection_power straightforward pairwise statistical_tests assessing whether the number of observed double_mutants is lower than expected by chance have also been employed followed by identifying groups as maximal cliques v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com the dendrix tool performs a markov_chain for group structure search followed by a permutation_test for finding sets of genes with both high coverage and high exclusivity its limitation of finding the single main pathway per dataset was addressed by multidendrix a follow_up tool which simultaneously identifies multiple driver pathways via an integer_linear approach propose muex a statistical_model for mutual_exclusivity where however the group members are required to have similar alteration frequencies finally jerbyemploy a data_driven approach for identifying genomewide synthetic_lethality interactions in cancer which lead to mutual_exclusivity all existing_approaches ignore the fact that the mutually_exclusive patterns occur over time during disease_progression here we introduce timex a generative probabilistic_model for the de_novo detection of mutual_exclusivity patterns of various degrees across carcinogenic alterations we regard tumorigenesis as a dynamic process and base our model on the temporal interplay between the waiting_times to alterations characteristic for every gene and alteration type and the observation time under the assumption of rarity of events over short time intervals timex models the alteration process for each gene as a poisson_process the waiting_times are therefore modeled as exponentially_distributed variables with specific rates which correspond to the rates of evolution for each alteration in our modeling framework the temporal_dynamics of each alteration process progresses from the onset of cancer corresponding to the first alteration related to the growth of a malignant_tumor until the observation time corresponding to the time of tumor_biopsy the observation time is regarded as a system failure time and is exponentially_distributed with an unknown rate a perfectly mutually_exclusive group is defined as a collection of genes in which for every tumor sample at most one gene is altered conversely we assume that in a group showing no mutual_exclusivity each gene is altered conditionally independent given the observation time in a realistic biological setting however additional alterations may still provide a small selective_advantage to the tumor rather than none at all which may lead to the fixation of a clone with more than one alteration in a group of genes otherwise perfectly mutually_exclusive thus biologically groups of genes display a continuous range of mutual_exclusivity degrees timex quantifies these degrees exactly and assesses their significance using a likelihood_ratio our procedure for efficient_search of mutually_exclusive patterns in large_datasets consists of three steps we first estimate mutual_exclusivity between all possible gene_pairs in the dataset second we select as candidates the gene groups in which the significance and degree of mutual_exclusivity between each pair of members are high third the candidate groups are statistically tested for mutual_exclusivity in simulation_studies we show that timex outperforms the permutation_based method previously_introduced byand the muex model furthermore we apply our procedure to four large tcga studies two glioblastoma datasets ovarian cancer_genome research and breast provisional cancer datasets on these datasets we show that timex identifies gene groups with stronger functional biological_relevance than two previous methods namely muex and multidendrix while also proposing many new candidates for biological_validation timex does not impose any temporal assumptions on the set of biological_samples it is applied on and these samples are considered to be independent without requiring any previous biological_knowledge our procedure identifies mutually_exclusive gene groups of any size and statistically tests and ranks them by their degree of mutual_exclusivity it possesses several advantages over previous methods including the probabilistic modeling of tumorigenesis as a dynamic process the novel and intuitive quantification of the degree of mutual_exclusivity as a probability high computational_efficiency on large_datasets as well as high_sensitivity in detecting low frequently altered genes
