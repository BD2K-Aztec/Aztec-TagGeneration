data_and ligdig a web_server for querying ligand protein interactions ligdig is a web_server designed to answer_questions that previously required several independent queries to diverse data_sources it also performs basic manipulations and analyses of the structures of proteinligand complexes the ligdig webserver is modular in design and consists of seven tools which can be used separately or via linking the output from one tool to the next in order to answer more complex questions currently the tools allow a user to i perform a free_text compound search ii search for suitable ligands particularly inhibitors of a protein and query their interaction_network iii search for the likely function of a ligand iv perform a batch search for compound identifiers v find structures of proteinligand complexes vi compare three_dimensional structures of ligand_binding and vii prepare coordinate files of protein_ligand for further calculations availability_and ligdig makes use of freely_available databases including chembl pubchem and sabio rk and software programs including cytoscape js pdb pqr probis and fconv ligdig can be used by non experts in bio and chemoinformatics ligdig is available at http mcm h its org there has been growing discussion of the data deluge and the perceived problems surrounding it namely how to store process and visualize data and how to combine multiple heterogeneous_data for many working in the cross_disciplinary environment of systems_biology research the challenge of combining these data_sources can be great but the rewards of doing so can be even greater one of the hurdles facing researchers is the wide_variety of data_sources available therefore computational_tools to assist in the analysis of this data are essential tools to assist the modeling of biochemical_networks such as sycamore or metnetmaker can simplify the construction of metabolic_models although most require knowledge of database_identifiers for the biological_entities of interest such tools show the utility of integrating data from several sources and simplifying the handling of multiple database_identifiers ligdig uses the strategy of accessing multiple data_sources and assisting the user to interpret results that might not be possible by visiting a single data source alone additionally ligdig assists users in performing basic manipulations of protein_structures that can help researchers to gain new insights into their system of interest
