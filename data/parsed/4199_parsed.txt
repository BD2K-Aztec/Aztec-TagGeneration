sequence_analysis seqpig simple and scalable scripting for large sequencing data_sets in hadoop hadoop mapreduce based_approaches have become increasingly popular due to their scalability in processing large sequencing_datasets however as these methods typically require in depth expertise in hadoop and java they are still out of reach of many bioinformaticians to solve this problem we have created seqpig a library and a collection of tools to manipulate analyze and query sequencing_datasets in a scalable and simple manner seqpigscripts use the hadoop based distributed scripting engine apache pig which automatically parallelizes and distributes data_processing tasks we demonstrate seqpigs scalability over many computing nodes and illustrate its use with example scripts availability_and available under the open_source mit_license at http sourceforge net_projects seqpig novel computational_approaches are required to cope with the increasing data_volumes of large_scale sequencing_projects as the growth in processing power and storage access speed is unable to keep pace with them several innovative tools and technologies have been proposed to tackle these challenges some are based on mapreduce which is a distributed computing paradigm that is based on the idea of splitting input_data into chunks which can be processed largely independently via a map function subresults can later be merged after grouping related subresults by a reduce function mapreduce permits automatic parallelization and scalable data distribution across many computers the most popular implementation available as open_source is apache hadoop which also comes with its own distributed file system the validity of hadoop as a data_processing platform is demonstrated by the level of adoption in major data intensive companies e g twitter facebook and amazon motivated by the potential scalability and throughput offered by hadoop there are an increasing number of hadoop based tools for processing sequencing_data ranging from quality_control and alignment to snp_calling variant annotation o and structural variant detection including general_purpose workflow management schonherr note the recent_publication of independent and complimentary work in although hadoop does simplify writing scalable distributed software it does not make it trivial such a task still requires specialized skills and a significant amount of work particularly if the solution involves sequences of mapreduce jobs this effort can be reduced significantly by using high_level tools such as apache pig which implements an sql like scripting language that is automatically translated into a sequence of mapreduce jobs given its flexibility and simplicity for developing data_processing pipelines it is not surprising that a large fraction of computing jobs in contemporary hadoop deployments originate from apache pig or similar high_level tools seqpig brings the benefits of apache pig to sequencing_data analysis it allows users to integrate their own analysis components with existing mapreduce programs to create full ngs pipelines based on hadoop
