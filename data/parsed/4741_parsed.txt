systems_biology tres predicts transcription control in embryonic_stem unraveling transcriptional circuits controlling embryonic stem_cell and fate has great_potential for improving our understanding of normal development as well as disease to facilitate this we have developed a novel web_tool called tres that predicts the likely upstream_regulators for a given gene_list this is achieved by integrating transcription_factor tf binding_events from chip sequencing and chip on chip datasets in murine and human embry onic stem es_cells with over mammalian tf sequence_motifs using tf perturbation gene_sets as well as co expression clusters in es_cells we validate the utility of this approach availability_and tres is freely_available www embryonic_stem es_cells have limitless self_renewal capability and the ability to differentiate into multiple cell_types this makes them a good model system to enhance our understanding of normal development and also for potential clinical_applications they facilitate in vitro studies of early developmental_events as well as differentiation into crucial cell_types such as hematopoietic or neuronal_cells most importantly they have proven to be a highly_valuable resource in regenerative_medicine where es_cells show great_potential in tissue_repair following disease or injury these therapeutic_applications have strengthened the push toward understanding how stem_cells are programmed during self_renewal and differentiation transcription_factors tfs are key_players in driving cellular programming many tfs have been identified with crucial roles in es cell_biology and their genome_wide putative targets have been mapped using chip sequencing or chip on chip technology moreover it is also now feasible to obtain binding sequence preferences for hundreds of mammalian tfs to use the complementary information from both these resources to aid novel hypotheses generation we have developed a web_tool called transcription_regulation in embryonic_stem or tres for short to link gene_sets to likely upstream_regulators in es_cells shows a screenshot of the web_tool where users can paste a query gene_list human or mouse or upload it from a file the gene_list is interrogated against four databases and enrichment is calculated using the optimized methods for each database see_supplementary for details the output is displayed as a ranked_list of tfs generated using rank_aggregation of results from four databases as well as four tables each listing significantly associated tfs the source database the gene overlap and corrected p values sorted from lowest to highest within each database the results can also be emailed to the user when the calculation is finished the enrichment calculation protocols for the four databases are as follows supplementary_material for full details
