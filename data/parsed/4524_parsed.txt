tally a scoring tool for boundary determination between repetitive and non repetitive protein_sequences motivation tandem_repeats trs are abundant in proteins having a variety of fundamental functions in many cases evolution has blurred their repetitive patterns this leads to the problem of distinguishing between sequences that contain highly imperfect trs and the sequences without trs the d structure of proteins can be used as a benchmarking criterion for tr detection in sequences because the vast_majority of proteins having trs in sequences are built of repetitive d structural blocks according to our benchmark none of the existing scoring_methods are able to clearly distinguish based on the sequence_analysis between structures with and without d trs results we developed a scoring tool called tally which is based on a machine_learning approach tally is able to achieve a better separation between sequences with structural trs and sequences of aperiodic structures than existing scoring procedures it performs at a level of sensitivity while achieving a high_specificity of and an area under_the of tally can be used to select a set of structurally and functionally meaningful trs from all trs detected in proteomes the generated dataset is available for benchmarking purposes availability_and source_code is available upon request tool and dataset can be accessed through our website http today the growth of the protein sequence_data significantly exceeds the capacity to analyze this data many proteins contain periodic sequences representing arrays of repeats that are directly adjacent to each other so_called tandem_repeats trs trs occur in at least of all proteins moreover they are found in every third human protein highly_divergent they range from a single amino_acid repetition to repeated domains of more than residues numerous studies demonstrated the fundamental functional_importance of such trs and their involvement in human_diseases thus tr regions are abundant in proteomes and are related to major health_threats in modern_society along this line understanding of their sequencestructurefunction relationship and evolutionary_mechanisms is a promising path in the identification of targets for new medicines and vaccines over the course of evolution perfect trs tend to degenerate as a result of mutations substitutions and deletions therefore the main_problem is to distinguish between sequences that contain a survey of these methods shows that no best approach to score putative trs in sequences exists that covers the whole range of repeats this evokes the necessity to integrate several algorithms into a pipeline within this pipeline it is also instrumental to have a universal score to determine the boundary between repetitive and non repetitive protein_sequences as at present each of these computational programs use their own measure for example most algorithms consider multiple_sequence msa of repeats as a collection of columns such scores compute an intermediate score over each column and obtain the global_score by averaging the intermediates psim considers the frequency of the most common element in a column sdiff counts the number of mutations observed in a column shannon entropy s accounts for the frequencies of each amino_acids in a column other metrics include evolutionary_information such as p value phylo several scores are embedded into their original tr predictors such as trust pftools or hhrepid none of these methods apart from hhrepid use information about d protein_structure to set the boundary between repetitive and non repetitive protein_sequences the tr scoring_functions can be tested on the structural definition of trs for the tr sequences that fold into a stable d structure one can define the criteria for true trs as an existence of repetitive blocks in structure indeed the d structure of the folded trs does not allow mutations that destabilize the structure it is important to mention that such trs correspond to repetitive structural blocks sometimes but less frequently functional constraints also play a role in the maintenance of repetitive sequence_patterns during evolution thus tr scoring_functions can be tested against a dataset of the true trs found both in sequence and in structure tr ss and false trs only found in sequence but not in the structure tr sns recently given this structural definition of trs we demonstrated that none of the existing scoring metrics described above were able to accurately distinguish between tr ss and tr sns here we present a new method called tally for scoring trs based on a robust machine_learning ml approach trained on an annotated tr ss and tr sns datasets to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to benchmark scoring_systems that aim to find a proper boundary between tr ss and trsns ml features includes some of the previously used scoring metrics and several other characteristics generating an optimal scoring combination our approach performs significantly better than existing_approaches over the complete range of trs
