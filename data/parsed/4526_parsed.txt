bioimage_informatics tango a generic tool for high_throughput d image_analysis for studying nuclear organization motivation the cell_nucleus is a highly_organized cellular organelle that contains the genetic_material the study of nuclear architecture has become an important field of cellular_biology extracting quantitative data from d fluorescence_imaging helps understand the functions of different nuclear compartments however such approaches are limited by the requirement for processing and analyzing_large sets of images results here we describe tools for analysis of nuclear genome_organization tango an image_analysis tool dedicated to the study of nuclear architecture tango is a coherent framework allowing biologists to perform the complete analysis process of d fluores cence images by combining two environments imagej http imagej nih gov ij for image_processing and quantitative analysis and r http cran r project org for statistical processing of measurement results it includes an intuitive_user providing the means to precisely build a segmentation procedure and setup analyses without possessing programming_skills tango is a versatile_tool able to process large sets of images allowing quantitative study of nuclear organization availability tango is composed of two programs i an imagej plug in and ii a package rtango for r they are both free_and available http biophysique mnhn fr tango for linux microsoft windows and macintosh osx distribution is under the gpl v licence the nucleus is a heterogeneous and compartmentalized organelle the spatial localization of genes and nuclear compartments within the nucleus affects cellular_functions such as regulation of gene_expression dna_replication and repair the underlying_mechanisms are still a matter of extensive investigation nuclear organization can be studied using several imaging_techniques for example immunocytochemistry and fluorescence_in fish allow the selective fluorescent_labeling of protein enriched compartments and chromosomal domains respectively though recent microscopes facilitate the acquisition of large sets of d images the automatic processing and analysis of those images remains a difficult_task several software programs have already been developed cellprofiler which is one of the most popular only performs d analysis fishfinder and nemo perform d analysis but have limited image_processing and analysis capabilities to overcome_these we have developed tools for analysis of nuclear genome_organization tango an image_analysis framework which permits biologists to perform the complete analysis process of d fluorescence_images image_processing quantitative analysis and statistical processing a potential application is the study of radial position variations of various structures such as genes or centromeres with respect to the nuclear_membrane or to nucleoli throughout the cell_cycle tango is a versatile software which owing to a large collection of d processing operations and measurements as well as a convenient data visualization and analysis system allows biologists to obtain quantitative information regarding the organization of the nucleus we have successfully detected and analyzed various types of fish e g bac probes or chromosome_territories and immunocytochemistry e g centromeres or nucleoli signals tango is integrated into imagej and r both of which are modular open_source widely used in the scientific_community allowing one to benefit from the rich potential of the two environments when using tango supplementary b the data browsing tab of the user_interface provides access to the different levels of objects a nuclei b structures contained in the selected nuclei in the present case centromeres and nucleoli c segmented objects contained in the selected structures different visualizations of a nucleus d d e overlay contours of selected objects in c can be interactively displayed on e which is useful to assess quality of segmentation
