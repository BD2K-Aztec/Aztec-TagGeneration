genetics_and estimation of pleiotropy between complex_diseases using single_nucleotide derived genomic relationships and restricted_maximum genetic_correlations are the genome_wide aggregate effects of causal_variants affecting multiple_traits traditionally genetic_correlations between complex_traits are estimated from pedigree studies but such estimates can be confounded by shared environmental_factors moreover for diseases low prevalence_rates imply that even if the true genetic_correlation between disorders was high co aggre gation of disorders in families might not occur or could not be distinguished from chance we have developed and implemented statistical_methods based on linear_mixed to obtain unbiased_estimates of the genetic_correlation between pairs of quantitative_traits or pairs of binary_traits of complex_diseases using population_based casecontrol_studies with genome_wide single nucleotide polymorph ism data the method is validated in a simulation_study and applied to estimate genetic_correlation between various diseases from wellcome_trust data in a series of bivariate_analyses we estimate a significant positive genetic_correlation between risk of type_diabetes and hypertension of se p availability our methods appropriate for both quantitative and binary_traits are implemented in the freely_available software gctarecently we have developed new methods to estimate the proportion of variation in quantitative_traits or in liability to disease that is associated with singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps the methods use very distant relationships between individuals so that estimates are unlikely to be confounded with shared family_environment effects the methodology can be extended to estimation of the genetic covariance and hence genetic_correlation between different disorders that is tagged by snps to provide estimates of genome_wide pleiotropy evidence for a genetic_correlation between disorders estimated directly by interrogation of the genome could have an important impact on the design of future genetic and functional studies for medical nosology and may provide new insights for novel treatments across disorders the aim of this study is to estimate genome_wide pleiotropy using genome_wide gwas casecontrol data for different diseases or disorders for binary disease traits we derive valid statistical_approaches to obtain unbiased_estimates of comorbidity interpretable on the scale of liability to disease we develop computationally_efficient algorithms for estimation the method is applied to estimate the genetic_correlation between hypertension ht and type_diabetes t d bipolar_disorder bd and rheumatoid_arthritis ra bd and t d or ht and ra from wellcome_trust wtccc gwas data where a is the genomic similarity relationship matrix based on snp information and i is an identity matrix g e and g g which are genetic_variance residual variance and covariance between g and g lee and van dershowed that the method of average information ai matrices derived directly from the v is much more efficient computationally than the original ai algorithms following equation in lee and van_der the ai matrix for the bivariate model can be derived as to whom correspondence should be addressed correlation on the scale of liability is approximately the same as that on the observed risk scalefor disease traits when the y phenotype vectors contain only for cases and for controls a liability threshold model can be written to link unobserved continuous liability to the observed discrete scale of disease where l is a vector of liability phenotypes which are distributed as n in the population g is a vector of random additive_genetic on the liability scale which are distributed n g and e is a vector of random residuals on the liability scale distributed with n e the probit link function links liability to the probability of y and g on the scale of liability can be approximated by a linear function of g on the observed scale using this linear approximation the correlation between two diseases is the same on both the observed and liability scale when samples are ascertained typical in casecontrol_studies the genetic value on the observed scale can be defined with an ascertainment correcting factor as where g cc is genetic values on the observed scale in a casecontrol study c is a constant k is the disease_prevalence in the population p is the proportion of the sample that are cases and z is the height of the standard normal probability_density that truncates the proportion k from equation the covariance between genetic values on the observed scale with ascertained samples can be written asfrom equation it is clear that that even when samples are ascertained the correlation is the same on both observed and liability scales because an approximate linear relationship exists between the genetic values on the different scales
