genetics_and fast spatial ancestry via flexible allele_frequency surfaces motivation unique modeling and computational challenges arise in locating the geographic_origin of individuals based on their genetic_backgrounds single_nucleotide snps vary_widely in informativeness allele_frequencies change non linearly with geography and reliable localization requires evidence to be integrated across a multitude of snps these problems become even more acute for individuals of mixed ancestry it is hardly surprising that matching genetic_models to computational constraints has limited the development of methods for estimating geographic origins we attack these related problems by borrowing ideas from image_processing and optimization theory our proposed model divides the region of interest into pixels and operates snp by snp we estimate allele_frequencies across the landscape by maximizing a product of binomial likelihoods penalized by nearest_neighbor interactions penalization smooths allele_frequency estimates and promotes estimation at pixels with no data maximization is accomplished by a minorizemaximize mm algorithm once allele_frequency surfaces are available one can apply bayes rule to compute the posterior_probability that each pixel is the pixel of origin of a given person placement of admixed individuals on the landscape is more complicated and requires estimation of the fractional contribution of each pixel to a persons genome this estimation problem also succumbs to a penalized mm algorithm results we applied the model to the population reference_sample popres data the model gives better localization for both unmixed and admixed individuals than existing_methods despite using just a small fraction of the available snps computing times are comparable with the best competing software the pertinence of the first law of geographyeverything is related to everything else but near things are more related than distant things has long been obvious to population geneticists for example in the s and kolmogorov derived and solved a partial_differential describing the spatial spread of an advantageous allele subsequent generations of ecologists and evolutionary_biologists have studied the correlations between geography and population_structure from many different perspectives during the past_decade in particular geneticists have discovered how to localize the origin of individuals human and otherwise based on their genetic_backgrounds such localization is called spatial assignment in an application of principal_component pca were able to match the first two principal_components of the genotype matrix of the population reference_sample popres dataset to the map of europe pca based estimation of geographic origins was accurate to within a few hundred kilometers though this level of resolution is impressive it is natural to wonder if a modelbased method for spatial assignment could perform better and whether inferences could be reliably made for admixed individuals this promptedto introduce spatial_structure analysis spa which in fact produces more accurate spatial assignments than pca in estimating allelic_frequency surfaces for each surveyed single_nucleotide snp spa depends on a simple gradient function describing how allele_frequencies vary with location in practice allele_frequency surfaces can be bumpy without a dominant cline the current article relaxes this restriction and gives more accurate reconstructions motivated by advances in image_reconstruction we have presented a probability model for the estimation of complex allele_frequency surfaces our model captures not only linear clines but also multiple local peaks on a landscape allele_frequency estimates represent a compromise between locally sampled genotypes and smoothness the degree of smoothness is determined empirically by cross_validation spatial assignment exploits the allele_frequency surfaces of the most informative snps to no ones surprise the ancestry informative snps drive projection in ranking snps our homogeneity lrt statistic outperforms the information criterion of which assumes equal sample_sizes at the sampled sites in practice the combination of a good model with just of the available snps give better geographic localization on the popres data than competing_models pca scat and spa with all of the snps our computing times are vastly superior to scat and competitive with pca and spa we have also proposed a model for spatial assignment of admixed individuals our model assigns an admixture coefficient to each pixel to avoid over parameterization we impose a penalty that enforces parsimony and focuses attention on those pixels with the greatest explanatory_power estimation of both allele_frequency surfaces and admixture coefficients benefits from the mm principle the mm algorithms generated are simple to code and automatically enjoy the ascent property convergence can be slow but standard extrapolation techniques accelerate convergence dramatically on the negative side of the balance sheet our software origen requires more storage per snp than spa which characterizes an allele_frequency surface by just three parameters the accuracy of origen is also limited by the number of pixels for the popres dataset we enclosed europe in a square with pixels on a side smaller pixels make little discernible difference in resolution at the expense of considerably more computation the heatmaps of posterior_probabilities and admixture coefficients afforded by the pixels are a decided plus the ability to exclude infeasible pixels over oceans is another advantage note spas localizations can fall outside the mapped region the localization of origen and scat must fall within the mapped region be taken as geographically localized finally our snp selection criterion is probably better suited to identifying ancestry informative snps than abstract information criterion readers will doubtless think of many other ways of improving the current model for example a reviewer suggested that it might be useful to incorporate standard_errors of allele_frequency estimates into localization heatmaps our preliminary testing of this plausible idea finds no improvement probably because localization averages across so many snps science like product_design is usually an iterative process of successive refinement admixed surfaces longitude latitude admixture coefficients for four simulated europeans with grandparents from locations highlighted in lighter colors the
