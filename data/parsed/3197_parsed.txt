sequence_analysis narwhal a primary analysis_pipeline for ngs_data the narwhal software pipeline has been developed to automate the primary analysis of illumina sequencing_data this pipeline combines a new and flexible de multiplexing tool with open_source aligners and automated quality_assessment the entire pipeline can be run using only one simple sample sheet for diverse sequencing_applications narwhal creates a sample oriented data_structure and outperforms existing_tools in speed massive_parallel has reduced the costs of dna_sequencing to a fraction of that of traditional_sanger by performing many immobilized reactions in parallel at the introduction of this technology in reactions could be performed in parallel per run now with the introduction of the latest generation of sequencing equipment over million dna_fragments are sequenced per sample such a large number of sequences is not necessary for many applications and are therefore better distributed over multiple samples in multiplexing individual dna_fragments are associated to unique dna_sequences barcodes these barcodes allow individual_reads to be assigned to a single sample by multiplexing many samples in a single sequencing run the costs of functional sequencing_experiments are lowered dramatically as a result the price of rnaseq is now similar to that of expression microarrays and the expectation is that the price of sequencing and thus rnaseq will lower even further due to these developments the number of individual samples is expected to increase greatly as many researchers do not have access to an extensive itinfrastructure most sequencing centers perform a basic primary analysis of the produced data and align the sequences to a reference with the increase in the number of samples and the amount of data the standard_software casava http www illumina com has difficulty coping both in terms of sample tracking and in terms_of the publically available aligners bowtie and bwa are able to align sequencing_data more efficiently than the eland aligner of to whom correspondence should be addressed casava these open_source aligners are implemented as stand alone command_line with many settings influencing their results to run these manually for large_numbers of samples with differing applications and thus settings can become quite laborious and error_prone in order to automatically process samples sequenced using the illumina sequencers we have developed the narwhal software pipeline this pipeline combines a new and flexible de multiplexing tool with open_source aligners and automated quality_assessment the narwhal sequence analysis_pipeline allows for the automated processing and analysis of different and multiplexed datasets obtained from illumina sequencers narwhal allows easy alignment of individual samples to the reference_genome of choice using predefined alignment profiles the output_files from narwhal are in the typical standard formats used in the field of sequencing fastq sam and bam and can be easily loaded into downstream_analysis software by taking these tools and pipelines into account with specific profiles narwhal provides a coherent data analysis workflow with minimal hands on time a reduced chance of human_error and faster analysis
