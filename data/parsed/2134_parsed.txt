group and sparse group partial least square approaches applied in genomics context motivation the association between two blocks of omics_data brings challenging issues in computational_biology due to their size and complexity here we focus on a class of multivariate_statistical called partial least square pls sparse version of pls spls operates integration of two datasets while simultaneously selecting the contributing variables however these methods do not take into account the important structural or group effects due to the relationship between markers among biological_pathways hence considering the predefined groups of markers e g genesets this could improve the relevance and the efficacy of the pls approach results we propose two pls extensions called group pls gpls and sparse gpls sgpls our algorithm enables to study the relationship between two different types of omics_data e g snp and gene_expression or between an omics dataset and multivariate phenotypes e g cytokine_secretion we demonstrate the good performance of gpls and sgpls compared with the spls in the context of grouped data then these methods are compared through an hiv therapeutic_vaccine trial our approaches provide parsimonious models to reveal the relationship between gene abundance and the immunological_response to the vaccine availability_and the approach is implemented in a comprehensive r package called sgpls available on the cran recent_advances in high_throughput omics_technologies enable quantitative_measurements of expression or abundance of biological_molecules of a whole biological system various popular omics platforms in systems_biology include transcriptomics proteomics cytomics and metabolomics the integration of multi_layer information is required to fully unravel the complexities of a biological system as each functional level is hypothesized to be related to each other furthermore multi_layer information is increasingly available such as in standard clinical_trials as an example the evaluation of vaccines in phase i ii trials incorporates various measurements of the cell_counts tens of population of interest of the cell functionality by many ways including the production of cytokines intra_and and of the gene_expression the integration of omics_data is a challenging_task first the high_dimensionality of the data i e the large number of measured biological_entities tens_of makes it very difficult toobtain a good overview or understanding of the system under study the noisy characteristics of such high_throughput data require a filtering process to be able to identify a clear signal second because of experimental or financial_constraints the small number of samples or patients typically makes the statistical_inference difficult and argue for using the maximum amount of available information third the integration of heterogeneous data also represents an analytical and numerical challenge to try to find common patterns in data from different origins in recent_years several statistical integrative approaches have been proposed in the literature to combine two blocks of omics_data often in an unsupervised framework these approaches aim at selecting correlated biological_entities from two datasets or more this abundant literature clearly illustrates that the integrative_analysis of two datasets poses_significant statistical challenges to deal with the high_dimensionality of the data in particular sparse partial_least splss using a l penalty has been developed for that purpose with spls it has been demonstrated that the integrative_analysis of large_scale omics_datasets could generate new knowledge not accessible by the analysis of a single data type alone moreover the biological_relevance of the approach has been demonstrated in recent_studies however group structures often existing within such data have not yet been accounted for in these analyses for example genes within the same pathway have similar functions and act together in regulating a biological system these genes can add up to have a larger effect and therefore can be detected as a group i e at a pathway or gene_set level this has been increasingly used thank to geneset enrichment_analysis approaches considering a group of features instead of individual_features has been found to be effective for biomarker identification proposed group_lasso for group variables selection extended it to logistic_regression modified group_lasso to solve the non orthonormal matrices problem although group_lasso penalty can increase the power for variable_selection it requires a strong group sparsity and cannot yield sparsity within a group proposed a supervised group_lasso which selects both significant gene_clusters and significant genes within clusters for logistic binary_classification and cox survival analysis proposed a sparse group_lasso penalty by combining an l penalty with group_lasso to yield sparsity at both the group and individual feature level applied it to genomic feature identification developed a sparse group subgroup lasso to accommodate selecting important groups subgroups and individual predictors in a regression context with a multivariate response variable have recently_proposed a multivariate sparse group_lasso also some work has been reported to incorporate group effect into a conventional canonical_correlation cca model studied structure based cca and proposed treebased and network based cca chen and liu incorporated group effect into an association study of nutrient_intake with human_gut both papers show an improvement when incorporating group effect however a priori_knowledge of group structure is needed and only the group effect of one type of data is discussed more recently developed a more general group sparse cca method which have been illustrated on genomics datasets human gliomas data and nci_data proposed a general penalized matrix decomposition pmd approach which include sparse principal_components and cca sparsity have been realized by introducing different penalties forms such as l penalty or fused_lasso penalty to get smooth results in the context of ordered features based on generalized least square matrix decomposition allen et_al develop fast computational algorithms for generalized principal_component pca and sparse pca in the same idea a regularized pls rpls approach is proposed byto take into account the correlations between adjacent variables however none of the pmd and rpls approaches have introduced group and sparse group_lasso penalty here we develop in a more general framework a group pls gpls method and a sparse gpls sgpls method see also l fstedt et_al both methods focus on sub matrices decomposition taking_into the group structures they could be used in regression mode or in canonical mode the gpls model aims at performing selection at group level while sgpls enables selection at both group and single_feature levels both irrelevant groups of features and individual_features in the remaining groups will be simultaneously discarded with sgpls our article is organized as follows the model and algorithm for group and sgpls are described in section after introducing the main steps of spls we also present our extension in a context of pls discriminant_analysis the performances of our approaches are compared with spls via a simulation_study in section this section also contains an illustration of our method with an hiv_vaccine study the results are compared with the one obtained by applying the multivariate sparse group_lasso recently_proposed by the selection process of the genes according to the mean square error of prediction criteria for each method is shown in supplementary figures s s supplementaryshows the cumulative percentage of variation of the responses variables explained by the components according to the method with three components more than of the variance could be explained the sgpls methods selected slightly more genes than the spls respectively and genes selected but sgpls selected fewer modules than the spls respectively and groups of genes selected of note all the groups of genes selected by the sgpls were included in those selected by the spls method sgpls selected slightly more modules than gpls more in common however gpls led to more genes selected than sgpls supplementarydisplays venn diagrams of the selected sets by the three methods both at the gene and module levels therefore in this context of hierarchical data sgpls ends up being more parsimonious than spls in term of modules and than gpls in term of genes by taking the most predictive genes within a selected module see supplementary such results are consistent with those of the simulation_study the selection of the most predictive genes inside a module improves the prediction capacity and does not avoid any interpretation of the biological_significance of the remaining genes inside a module based on the biological_knowledge available for this module interestingly the modules commonly selected by the three approaches were the most biologically_relevant ones such as the modules associated to inflammation m m m m m and cellular_responses m cytotoxic nk_cell on t cells a significant number of additional modules have been selected by spls but not by the other methods although some are biologically sound e g m erythrocytes many were not annotated or are unrelated to the immune system making the hypothesis of false signals likely regarding the modules differentially selected by sgpls and gpls three modules were selected by gpls but not by sgpls m plasma cells and undetermined modules and whereas seven modules were selected by sgpls and not by gpls m and m cell_cycle m t cell m and m inflammation m and m undetermined clearly the selection by sgpls sounds more biologically_relevant as m is known to be associated to the other t cell module m that was selected by both methods see www biir net public wikis module annotation v trial modules this is the same for the inflammatory modules m and m that are known to be related in regards of the module m plasma cells we have already notice that its selection was not robust in bootstrap analyses performed with spls data not shown therefore in this application the sgpls approach led to a parsimonious selection of modules and genes that sound very relevant biologically and is in agreement with the simulation_results an illustration of the results is shown through the correlation_matrix in supplementaryaccording to the genes selected in common by the three methods genes and modules negatively or positively associated to the immune_response appeared very clearly as expected inflammatory modules were negatively_correlated to the immune_response whereas modules related to the cellular_immune m m were positively correlated to the immune_response stability of the module selection has been assessed for spls gpls and sgpls see supplementary in the spirit of meinshausen and b hlmann and l it highlights the insights gained from incorporating the grouping structure into the analysis comforting the above biological conclusions also it reveals the instability of the selection of the module by spls and gpls module that was not selected by sgpls furthermore we compared the proposed novel approach with the multivariate lasso implemented in glmnet r package and a multivariate sparse group_lasso proposed by the two alternative_approaches selected less modules and genes but the modules selected were most often the same across the different methods see supplementary_materials section s
