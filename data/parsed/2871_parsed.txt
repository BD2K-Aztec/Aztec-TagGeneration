sequence_analysis meqa a pipeline for medip_seq data quality_assessment and analysis motivation we present a pipeline for the pre_processing quality_assessment read_distribution and methylation estimation for methylated_dna immunoprecipitation medip sequence_datasets this is the first medip_seq specific analytic pipeline that starts at the output of the sequencers this pipeline will reduce the data analysis load on staff and allows the easy and straightforward analysis of sequencing_data for dna_methylation the pipeline integrates customized scripting and several existing_tools which can deal with both paired and single_end data availability the package and extensive documentation and comparison to public data is available atmethylated dna immunoprecipitation medip enables the rapid identification of genomic_regions containing methylated_cytosines medip in combination with hybridization to high_resolution tiling microarrays or high_throughput hts techniques is a useful method for the identification of methylated cpg rich sequences recently several benchmark publications reported on the use of medip_seq for genome_wide analysis and compared it to several others methods for example whole_genome bs_seq and methyl binding_protein based enrichment of methylated sequences mbd seq though medip is not substitute for bs_seq to obtain a methylome at single_nucleotide the generation of genome_wide data derived from medip_seq provides a major tool for epigenetic_studies in health and disease further medip is specific for methylated_cytosines and results are not confounded by the presence of hydroxymethylated cytosines unlike bisulfite based_methods the main challenges resulting from the rapidly_advancing technology_development in dna_methylation analysis is now the computational_analysis of the genome_wide sequencing_data to whom correspondence should be addressed two methods batman and medips have been developed for medip_seq data analysis however both of them do not include quality_control of sequencing_data or the read_mapping these methods require therefore considerable effort to prepare the data and run several other sequencing and quality_control packages separately increasing analysis time and potentially introducing processing errors to fill the gap between experimental throughput and processing_speed we developed the meqa pipeline for pre_processing data quality_assessment and distribution of sequences reads and estimation of dna methylation_levels of medip_seq datasets the pipeline will also generate files for the ucsc browser the pipeline presented here runs on the unix linux platform and was written in the popular bioinformatics languages shell script python and r it can be run locally on a single linux unix or mac server we have tested this pipeline on our cluster with qsub and bsub commands with excellent_performance on a dell cpus each ghz and gb_memory computer server it takes h to run the entire pipeline for a mouse genome_wide estimate that contained million bp length single_end when several lanes are combined which would provide a similar sequencing_depth as hiseq data it will take h we recommend running this pipeline on a computer with at least gb_memory the meqa pipeline consists of two parts the first one provides the general quality_control of the sequence_reads and the second assesses the quality of the dna_methylation analysis experiment and provides comprehensive analysis the first part could in principle also be applied to other sequence_data e g for quality_assessment of rna_seq the meqa package allows users to obtain methylation estimates from raw sequence files with a single python function call the main advantage of meqa is its ease of use and its availability as open_source as all programs added to the pipeline are open_source programs widely used file_formats are used for each step of the pipeline e g fastq sam bam and bed files each step of the pipeline can be replaced without compromising the workflow allowing users to update components replace some packages and to extend and customize the pipeline for their needs this pipeline permits to estimate methylation_levels in differentially_methylated and genes using medips further functional analysis such as go enrichment and kegg_pathway analysis for differentially_methylated genes can be performed using additional bioconductor_packages
