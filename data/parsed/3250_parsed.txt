new quality measure for snp_array based cnv_detection motivation only a few large systematic studies have evaluated the impact of copy_number cnvs on common diseases several million individuals have been genotyped on single nucleotide variation arrays which could be used for genome_wide cnvs association studies however cnv_calls remain prone to false_positives and only empirical filtering strategies exist in the literature to overcome this issue we defined a new quality_score qs estimating the probability of a cnv called by penncnv to be confirmed by other software results out of sample comparison showed that the correlation between the consensus cnv status and the qs is twice as high as it is for any previously_proposed cnv filters roc_curves displayed an auc higher than and simulations showed an increase up to in statistical_power when using qs in comparison to other filtering strategies superior_performance was confirmed also for alternative consensus cnv definition and through improving known cnv trait associations availability_and http goo gl t yufmgenetic variations range from single_nucleotide snps to large chromosomal rearrangement aneuploidy within this spectrum deleted inserted and duplicated stretches of nucleotides longer than kb sometimes bp with the use of deep coverage nextgeneration_sequencing are referred to as copy_number cnvs cnvs have been found genome_wide in both disease and healthy_populations their function has been widely_studied in the context of the rare diseasesrare variant paradigm or as motor of evolution association with complex_traits such as bmi has been shown in the case of the p rearrangement but also with cognitive_functions in several general_population cohorts decode and estonia most successful cnv association studies are based on candidate_gene approaches andunlike snpstheir genome_wide impact has not yet been fully elucidated consequently large genome_wide cnv studies would be instrumental to decipher the impact of genetic rearrangements underlying complex_traits and disease_susceptibility initially extremely_large copy_number megabases were detected using karyotyping then fluorescence_in increased the resolution enabling the detection of sub microscopic events nowadays cnvs can be detected using different molecular technologies and methods ngs_technologies allow sequencing millions of reads in parallel and new methods for structural_variants analysis have been developed including paired_end read_depth analysis split_read strategies and sequence_assembly comparisons the other main methods to detect_cnvs are based on micro array technologies either comparative_genome cgh arrays or snp_genotyping we focused on cnv_detection based on snp_genotyping as millions of individuals have already been genotyped on snp_arrays and many of these samples were used in meta_analysis of genome_wide gwas thus a wealth of unexploited information remains available in these cohorts and could be re analyzed for genome_wide cnvs association the flip side of using genotyping_arrays is the lower reliability of the cnv_detection as these platforms were not initially designed to detect such genomic_events however more recent ones can contain cnv probes despite this limitation several algorithms have been developed for cnv_detection at each probe a relative copy_number ratio can be obtained by combining the intensities of the two alleles and normalizing this quantity with respect to a reference log r ratio lrr deviation from the copy_number ratio baseline will correspond to either a loss or gain several publicly_available software improve copy_number calls by exploiting the ratio of allelic intensities normalized measure of the signal_intensity ratio of the b and a allelesb allele frequencybaf in this article we focus on the penncnv software currently the most widely used software for illumina chips penncnv citationsquantisnp citations this software based on a hidden_markov hmm is extensively used for cnv_detection on snp its speed is a key_advantage as number of available samples increase at an unprecedented scale nevertheless cnv_detection remains prone to false_positives which adds noise when such calls are used for trait association there is a need to develop a new quality_score qs for cnvs detected by penncnv prior to performing cnv based association studies our contribution can be viewed as a post_processing step of penncnv calls whereby various cnv metrics are combined to estimate the probability of a called cnv to be a likely consensus call this probability could then be used as copy_number dosage for trait associations we chose to improve cnv_detection in a way that is directly applicable for large meta_analytic gwas where analysts preferably want to run only a single and fast cnv_calling pipeline and provide association summary_statistics from various platforms our qs has been built in order to estimate the probability of a cnv to be a consensus call based on the fact that consensus cnv is defined as the overlap of cnv_calls from three distinct software applied to illumina genotyping_arrays we have demonstrated through roc correlation and power analyses that our qs can better recover consensus cnvs than other cnv quality_metrics naturally many other consensus definitions could be used for example cnvs called by only one other software may not necessarily be false and hence could have been classified as neither false nor true calls this definition of consensus however did not change the conclusions supplementary figs s s using trio data we have also explored a definition where cnv_calls confirmed in at least one of the parents are deemed as consensus cnvs notably our qs recovered these consensus calls significantly better than other quality_measures and filters finally we demonstrated the advantage of the qs through re discovering the known p cnv bmi associations in the uk biobank here again association p values for the qs were fold smaller than those of any other cnv quality metric we thus recommend the use of this metric as a probabilistic cnv dosage for cnv association studies this metric has been used to search association between cnv load and cognitive phenotypes in unselected populations our cnv_calls reliably led to stronger association results and retrieved the same cnv frequencies as in the discovery_cohort where some cnvs have been manually confirmed it would have been possible to define the consensus as the overlap between cnv_calls from multiple genotyping technologies e g genotyping_arrays array_cgh acgh or whole_genome wgs applied for the same study participants unfortunately even though acgh is widely used for cnvs detection in clinical_settings there is no gold standard_software for genome_wide cnv_calling in large population samples similarly algorithms calling cnvs from wgs are in early_stages another problem is data availability there are over hundred fold more population_based samples available with genotyping chip data than those with acgh or wgs an additional problem for wgs is that the coverage is usually below which insufficient for reliable cnv_calling http www haplotype reference consortium org in the future when such data become available on larger scale one can apply our approach to other consensus cnv definitions over the past_years many gwas based on illumina snp_array have been performed for different traits all these data could be reanalyzed to perform cnv association studies using our qs as cnv allele dosage for associations just like the currently used imputed genotype dosages this would allow a better filtering and would increase_statistical especially for rare deletions as it has been demonstrated in the results such rare_variants cnv phenotype association simulation based on deletions detected in the hypergenes geneva samples associations were done with different quality_metrics such as the qs the confidence_score the classical filters a b c d and e as defined the method section and the raw cnv_calls cnvs were classified according to their precision and frequency the frequency range for this boxplot is between and while the precision range is between and this plot shows the statistical_power as a function of the effect_size for the different quality_metrics n corresponds to the number of unique probes being in the precision and cnv frequency window have to be meta_analyzed in a way such that the imputation quality is taken into account in the meta_analysis as shown in our simulations the power advantage offered by the qs may not be remarkable for individual cohorts but much more so in the context of meta_analysis facilitating the collection of large samples although larger and larger association studies of common rare single_nucleotide reveal increasing proportions of the missing_heritability rare cnvs are relatively neglected apart from a few successful examples therefore as a future work we will apply this quality measure in the context of large meta_analytic cnv association studies on anthropometric traits in particular for bmi the heritability of which is estimated to be but common_variants seem to account for to this purpose we wrapped up the qs calculation in a pipeline designed to run cnv trait associations this pipeline has been tested with analysts on samples and is available online http goo gl t yufm
