sequence_analysis quikr a method for rapid reconstruction of bacterial_communities via compressive_sensing motivation many metagenomic_studies compare hundreds to thousands of environmental and health related samples by extracting and sequencing their s rrna amplicons and measuring their similarity using beta diversity metrics however one of the first stepsto classify the operational_taxonomic within the samplecan be a com putationally time consuming task because most methods rely on computing the taxonomic_assignment of each individual read out of tens to hundreds of thousands of reads results we introduce quikr a quadratic k merbased iterative reconstruction method which computes a vector of taxonomic_assignments and their proportions in the sample using an optimization_technique motivated from the mathematical theory of compressive_sensing on both simulated and actual biological data we demonstrate that quikr typically has less error and is typically orders_of than the most commonly used taxonomic_assignment technique the ribosomal database projects navenave bayesian_classifier furthermore the technique is shown to be unaffected by the presence of chimeras thereby allowing for the circumvention of the time intensive step of chimera filtering availability the quikr computational package in matlab octave python and c for the linux and mac platforms is available at http sourceforge net_projects quikr reconstructing the taxonomic_composition of a bacterial_community taken from an environmental sample be it a humanassociated ocean or soil_sample is critical for understanding the role that such a community might play in affecting change in that environment a popular reconstruction approach is to use s rrna amplicon_sequencing like roches technology to produce many moderate length_bp reads of specific variable_regions of the s rrna gene and then individually classify these reads using a custom database with blast or in a bayesian_framework like the ribosomal database projects rdp navenave bayesian_classifier nbc rdps nbc is widely used owing to its speed but it can still take several days to assign millions of reads on a desktop computer thereby alienating users who do not have access to large computer clusters we introduce a method that enables desktop analysis we take a novel approach by reconstructing all taxonomic concentrations of a bacterial_community simultaneously as opposed to read byread classification this allows for orders_of decrease in execution time while maintaining comparable and often better reconstruction fidelity this method based on ideas from compressive_sensing was inspired by and tangentially related to wherein sparsity promoting algorithms were used to analyze mixtures of dye terminator reads resulting from sanger_sequencing here however we take a k merbased approach that is designed for high_throughput this is similar in spirit to the k_mer based_approach in but herein we use a distribution estimation procedure based on compressive_sensing put briefly our method measures the frequency of k_mers for a fixed k in a database of s rrna_genes for known bacteria calculates the frequency of k_mers in the given sample and then reconstructs the concentrations of the bacteria in the sample by solving an underdetermined system of linear equations under a sparsity assumption to solve this system we employ matlabs matlab iterative implementation of typical nonnegative least_squares and hence we refer to this method as quikr quadratic iterative k merbased reconstruction we point out that quikr has not yet been optimized for performance but still demonstrates orders_of speed improvement over rdps nbc quikr represents a new paradigm in algorithms for bacterial_community reconstruction by leveraging ideas from compressive_sensing an entire_sample can be analyzed quickly and accurately depending on how it is trained quikr can be used as either an extremely rapid almost constant time high_level community profiling tool or else using a larger training database a fast extremely accurate technique besides improvements in speed other advantages include the ability to use massive training databases like d large that would be much too large for standard techniques like rdps nbc furthermore quikr is unaffected by the presence of chimeras so the time consuming chimeraremoval step in standard analytic pipelines can be completely circumvented
