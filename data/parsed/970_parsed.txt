databases_and chromohub v cancer_genomics cancer_genomics data produced by next_generation support the notion that epigenetic_mechanisms play_a in cancer we have previously_developed chromohub an open_access online interface where users can map chemical structural and biological data from public_repositories on phylogenetic_trees of protein_families involved in chromatin mediated_signaling here we describe a cancer_genomics interface that was recently added to chromohub the frequency of mutation amplification and change in expression of chromatin factors across large cohorts of cancer patients is regularly extracted from the cancer_genome and the international cancer genome consortium and can now be mapped on phylogenetic_trees of epigenetic protein_families explorators of chro matin signaling can now easily navigate the cancer_genomics landscape of writers readers and erasers of histone_marks chromatin_remodeling histones and their chaperones availability_and http www thesgc org chromo hub chromohub is an online interface that allows the epigenetics research_community to project biological structural and chemical data on phylogenetic_trees of protein_families involved in chromatin mediated_signaling the interface is a useful hub for cell biologists to find chemical_inhibitors targeting their proteins of interest medicinal chemists to inspect the structural coverage of specific binding_sites or structural biologists to visualize the disease association of phylogenetic neighbors to the construct they crystallized we previously described how protein_families were assembled phylogenetic_trees generated and biological structural and chemical data extracted from public_repositories and mapped on the trees we have now added to chromohub a large section entirely focused on genomic_data from cancer patients extracted from the cancer_genome tcga and the international cancer genome consortium icgc recent landmark next_generation campaigns of large cancer patient_cohorts have revealed recurrent alterations of genes involved in epigenetic_mechanisms these results support the notion that chromatin mediated_signaling may be central to cancer_initiation the data associated with most of these and other unbiased cancer genomic projects were deposited into tcga and the icgc repositories and made publicly_accessible to the scientific_community chromohub users can now map cancer_genomics data on phylogenetic_trees of protein_families involved in epigenetic_mechanisms rather than listing gene specific links to existing cancer_genomics portals chromohub provides integrated data focused on chromatin signaling users can visualize on phylogenetic_trees of protein_families involved in epigenetic_mechanisms the percent of tumor_samples across large patient_cohorts where a gene is mutated compared with a non tumor sample from the same patient highly mutated genomes can be excluded from the analysis by setting a threshold for the maximum number of genes_mutated in a sample the output is grouped by cancer type as of october cancer_types are represented by cohorts of patients high or low copy_number as well as heterozygous and homozygous_deletions corresponding to gistic values of and respectively can also be plotted on phylogenetic_trees statistically_relevant data patients are available for nine cancer_types unlike mutation data copy_numbers are compared with those in the reference human_genome in addition to chromosomal_aberrations changes in transcription profiles are also available mrna_levels are compared between tumor and non tumor_samples from the same patient and tissue this provides a birds eye view of genes that are overexpressed or repressed in specific cancer_types for any protein_family related to epigenetic_mechanisms orthogonal data types can be projected on a tree simultaneously for instance combining mrna_expression and mutation data users can rapidly see that the histone_methyltransferase mll is mutated in of and repressed in of of breast_cancer samples suggesting that this gene acts as a tumor_suppressor change in expression of a given gene is generally not driving cancer_initiation or progression but simply a passenger event unless it is directly caused by a chromosomal amplification or deletion to identify candidate driver events affecting chromatin factors chromohub allows users to automatically highlight genes where overexpression correlates with copy_number using this approach one can rapidly see that among genes containing a tudor domain which bind methylated lysines and arginines fxr is overexpressed and amplified in of lung_squamous patients funding the sgc is a registered charity that receives funds from abbvie boehringer
