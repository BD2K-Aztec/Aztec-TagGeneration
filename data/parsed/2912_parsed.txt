systems_biology metannogen annotation of biological reaction_networks motivation semantic annotations of the biochemical entities constituting a biological reaction_network are indispensable to create biologically_meaningful networks they further heighten efficient exchange reuse and merging of existing_models which concern present day systems_biology research more often two types of tools for the reconstruction of biological_networks currently exist i several sophisticated programs support graphical network editing and visualization ii data management systems permit reconstruction and curation of huge networks in a team of scientists including data_integration annotation and cross_referencing we seeked ways to combine the advantages of both approaches results metannogen which was previously_developed for network_reconstruction has been considerably improved from now on metannogen provides sbml import and annotation of networks created elsewhere this permits users of other network_reconstruction platforms or modeling software to annotate their networks using metannogens advanced information management we implemented word autocompletion multipattern highlighting spell check brace expansion and publication management and improved annotation cross_referencing and team work requirements unspecific enzymes and transporters acting on a spectrum of different substrates are efficiently handled the network can be exported in sbml format where the annotations are embedded in line with the miriam standard for more comfort the first version of metannogen was used exclusively to reconstruct metabolic_networks as in the case of whole cell model hepatonet the program to whom correspondence should be addressed features of this early version are comparable to other programs like the recently_published metnetmaker or memosys however limitations became apparent with respect to information management exchange of networks and representation of unspecific transport_processes in eukaryotic_cells which forced us to substantially_improve metannogen from all currently available tools for network_reconstruction such as biologicalnetworks celldesigner cytoscape metnetmaker memosys meta all ondex semanticsbml sycamore vanted probably metannogen represents unspecific enzymes and transmembrane transport carriers most efficiently therefore it is suitable for compartmentalized metabolic_models of eukaryotic_cells where many carriers transport not just one but several different substrates to our knowledge it provides the most advanced management for information attached to individual reactions to use it modellers do not need to take metannogen as the primary network_reconstruction tool but can annotate biological_networks created in any other program that provides sbml export importing networks the metannogen demo session which can be web started on the download page automatically contains the following three large_scale metabolic_networks kegg recon and ehmn in addition any other network given in sbml can be imported either from a local file or from online_resources metannogen provides direct access to the models stored in the biomodels_database and jws online by model id all networks and their annotations can be viewed using browsable graphical trees kegg provides pathway maps and images of metabolite structures cross_references between different networks to cross reference equivalent reactions from different networks metannogen defines two reactions as identical if they have identical metabolites in the left and right side of the biochemical equation irrespectively of the order however different identifier systems hinder automated workflows here metannogen works with dictionaries to synchronize different metabolite identifier vocabularies and to interchange compounds assumed to be different due to ph_dependent protonation e g carbon_dioxide versus hydrogen carbonate or due to different ontology levels e g d glucose versus d glucose
