p sams a web_site for plant artificial microrna and synthetic trans_acting small_interfering design the plant small_rna maker site p sams is a web_tool for the simple and automated design of artificial mirnas amirnas and synthetic transacting small_interfering syn tasirnas for efficient and specific targeted gene_silencing in plants p sams includes two applications p sams amirna designer and p sams syn tasirna designer the navigation through both applications is wizard assisted and the job runtime is relatively short both applications output the sequence of designed small_rna s and the sequence of the two oligonucleotides required for cloning into b c compatible vectors availability_and the p sams website is available atartificial mirnas amirnas and synthetic trans_acting small_interfering syn tasirnas are two classes of designed small_rnas used to silence plant transcripts with high sequence complementarity amirna and syn tasirna differ in their biogenesis but are functionally_similar methods to computationally design plant small_rnas are based on several criteria including the requirement for a high degree of small_rna target_rna base_pairing we recently reported efficient molecular methods to generate amirna and syn tasirna constructs by ligation of synthesized dsdna oligonucleotides that include the amirna or syn tasirna sequence into b c expression_vectors b c amirna vectors were tested in both monocots and eudicots and express a single amirna that targets one or multiple sequence related transcripts b c syn tasirna vectors express several syn tasirnas targeting_sequence unrelated transcripts in arabidopsis and closely_related p sams is a wizard assisted web_tool for the simple and automated design of plant amirnas and syn tasirnas p sams includes two applications p sams amirna designer and p sams syn tasirna designer both applications output a list of recommended amirna or syn tasirna and the sequence of the two oligonucleotides required for cloning into compatible b c vectors
