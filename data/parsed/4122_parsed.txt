sequence_analysis sbars fast creation of dotplots for dna_sequences on different scales using ga gc_content structural analysis of long dna_fragments including chromosomes and whole genomes is one of the main challenges in modern bioinformatics here we propose an original approach based on spectral_methods and its implementation called sbars spectral based_approach for repeats search the main idea of our approach is that repeated dna structures are recognized not within the nucleotide_sequence directly but within the function derived from this sequence this allows us to investigate nucleotide_sequences on different scales and decrease time complexity for dotplot creation down to n availability_and pre compiled versions for windows and linux and documentation are available atthe vast_majority of approaches used to analyze nucleotide_and are based on algorithms working with text strings until recently such methods were justified because the length of processed genetic text was relatively short the evolution of sequencing_techniques however has resulted in dramatically_increased datasets providing nucleotide_sequences that are comparable with whole_genome in size algorithmic correction of point_mutations is computationally_intensive and timeconsuming at the same time it is reasonable to assume that a number of mutations are unintentionally incorporated into comparisons of large fragments of dna bp resulting in significant decrease in efficiency of the text based_algorithms to bypass the problems of the text based_algorithms a number of effective spectral algorithms based on fourier_transform were developed which are used to search for minisatellites spectral repeat finder srf and owmsa multiple_alignments mafft etc despite a high performance these tools are focused on finding short repeats and have a number of limitations for the analysis of long_sequences and searching for extended homologous fragments in the present article we propose an original method for finding different types of long repeats in genome_scale dna_sequences we also offer a possible solution for the problem of dotplot creation whose time complexity can be reduced to n sbars is a fast and efficient tool for identifying dispersed direct inverted and tandem dna_repeats the program is not aimed at the comparison of individual nucleotides the main idea of this approach is to quickly identify the similarity of individual fragments within the query_sequences disregarding single nucleotide insertions_or the current version of the program efficiently identifies repeated_sequences and can be developed for the analysis of long insertions_or because of chromosome_rearrangements in similar sequences the underlying spectral algorithm demonstrated good scalability on multicore processors note selfplots of sequences with different lengths have been calculated on a ghz amd phenom quad core machine using gepard and sbars the resulting dotplots and the corresponding parameters are presented in the supplementary_material
