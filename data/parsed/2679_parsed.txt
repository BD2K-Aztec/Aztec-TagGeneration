lbibcell a cell based simulation environment for morphogenetic problems motivation the simulation of morphogenetic problems requires the simultaneous and coupled simulation of signalling and tissue dynamics a cellular resolution of the tissue domain is important to adequately describe the impact of cell based events such as cell_division cellcell interactions and spatially_restricted signalling events a tightly_coupled cell based mechano regulatory simulation tool is therefore required results we developed an open_source framework for morphogenetic problems the environment offers core functionalities for the tissue and signalling models in addition the software offers great flexibility to add custom extensions and biologically_motivated processes cells are represented as highly_resolved massless elastic polygons the viscous properties of the tissue are modelled by a newtonian_fluid the immersed boundary method is used to model the interaction between the viscous and elastic_properties of the cells thus extending on the ibcell model the fluid and signalling processes are solved using the lattice_boltzmann as application examples we simulate signalling dependent tissue dynamics availability_and the documentation and source_code are available on http tana kas bitbucket org lbibcell index htmlduring morphogenesis tissue grows and self organizes into complex functional_units such as organs the process is tightly_controlled both by signalling and by mechanical interactions long_range signalling interactions in the tissues can be mediated by diffusible substances called morphogens and by long_range cell processes the dynamics of the diffusible factors can typically be well described by systems of continuous reactionadvection diffusion partial_differential pdes the appropriate tissue representation depends on the relevant time scale for a homogeneous isotropic embryonic_tissue experiments show that the tissue is well approximated by a viscous_fluid on long time scales equilibration after min to several hours and by an elastic material on short time scales seconds to minutes however biological_control typically happens on a shorter time scale and many cellular_processes such as cell_migration and adhesion cell_polarity directed division monolayer structures and differentiation cannot be cast into a continuous formulation in a straight_forward way a number of cell based simulation techniques at different scales and different level of detail have been developed to study these processes here we discuss main representatives for each category the cellular potts model introduced by is solved on a lattice with each lattice point holding a generalized spin value denoting cell_identity similar to the ising_model hamiltonian energy_functions are formulated and minimized using a metropolis algorithm it has been applied to a multitude of problems and is implemented in the software compucell d however the correspondence between the biological problem and the hamiltonian the temperature and the time step is not always straightforward the subcellular element model divides cells into subcellular elements which are represented by computational particles the elements interact via interacting potentials which are subject to modelling the motion of the elements is governed by overdamped langevin dynamics such that the method is mesh free the framework was first introduced by newman and later applied by this approach allows for detailed biophysical modelling both in d and d the spheroid model developed byassumes that cells in unstructured cell_populations are similar to colloidal_particles the cells are modelled as point particles hosting interaction potentials their motions consist of a random and a directed movement neighbouring cells form adhesive bonds which are represented using models borrowed from contact mechanics such as e g the johnsonkendallroberts model many cellular_processes such as cell_shape change division death lysis cellcell interaction and migration have been successfully translated into the spheroid model intra_and diffusion has not yet been introduced and implemented the spheroid model extends efficiently to d and it has been implemented in the open_source framework cellsys the vertex model uses polygons or polyhedra in d to represent cells in densely_packed tissues e g in drosophila wing_disc epithelia for each vertex forces are computedeither via a potential or directly the vertices are moved subsequently according to overdamped equations of motion or via a monte_carlo algorithm the model is implemented in the opensource software chaste the viscoelastic cell model also called ibcell models presented inuses the immersed boundary ib method to represent individually deformable cells as immersed elastic bodies the cytoplasm and the extracellular_matrix and fluid are represented by a viscous incompressible fluid in this framework a vast amount of biological_processes such as cell_growth cell_division apoptosis and polarization has been realized the model was applied to study tumour and epithelial dynamics due to the high_level of detail the viscoelastic cell model is computationally_expensive and has not yet been implemented in d the software framework virtualleaf with explicit cell resolution available in d has been introduced in although the cell representation is similar to vertex cell models the dynamics is realized by minimizing a hamiltonian using a monte_carlo algorithm the model assumes rigid cell_walls which is appropriate for plant morphogenesis for many morphogenetic phenomena which arise from a tight interaction between the biomolecular signalling and the tissue physics an explicit computational representation of the cell shapes is required here we present a flexible software framework based on the ibcell model which as a novelty permits to tightly couple biomolecular signalling models to a cell resolved physical tissue model the core components and the general approach of the model are described in the second section in the third section the software and the main functionalities are described in detail application examples are given in the fourth chapter to demonstrate the frameworks capabilities we developed an extendible and open_source cell based simulation environment which is tailored to study morphogenetic problems the novel framework permits the coupled simulation of a physically motivated viscoelastic cell model with regulatory signalling models processes such as viscous dissipation elasticity advection diffusion local_reactions local mass sources and sinks cell_division and cell_differentiation are implemented by applying our framework to turing signalling_systems we show that the signalling_systems may behave differently on dynamic tissues than on simple continuous tissue representations we therefore advocate to test continuous morphogenetic signalling models on dynamically growing cellular domains the presented framework permits to study a variety of mechanoregulatory mechanisms by making the cell_division orientation dependent on signalling cues the effect on the macroscopic tissue geometry may be studied cell_migration can be modelled by introducing gradient dependent forces on specific_cell cell_sorting may be achieved by specifying multiple cell_types with differential cellcell junction strengths the framework is specifically_designed to study the mutual effects of signalling and biophysical cell properties the viscoelastic cell model represents cell shapes at high_resolution and is thus unlike the vertex model not restricted to densely_packed tissues furthermore hydrodynamic interaction membrane tension and hydrostatic_pressure are integral components of the model the fact that a velocity_field is available on the entire domain is a critical advantage to account for advection of the signalling components thus allowing for a spatial description of intracellular_concentrations the model is however not easily extendable to the third dimension because a meshing of the surface will be required the algorithmic and computational_complexity are expected to be significant and subject to future work the presented framework is however ideal to study intrinsically d morphogenetic problems such as apical_surface dynamics of epithelia as studied previously also byand ishihara and sugimura in d
