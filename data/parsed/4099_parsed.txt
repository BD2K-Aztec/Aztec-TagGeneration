rxnsim a tool to compare biochemical_reactions quantitative assessment of chemical_reaction similarity aids database_searches classification of reactions and identification of candidate enzymes most methods evaluate reaction similarity based on chemical transformation patterns we describe a tool rxnsim which computes reaction similarity based on the molecular_signatures of participating molecules the tool is able to compare reactions based on similarities of substrates and products in addition to their transformation it allows masking of user_defined chemical moieties for weighted similarity computations availability_and rxnsim is implemented in r and is freely_available from the comprehensive_r cran http cran r project org_web rxnsim reaction similarity is used to classify biochemical_reactions assess enzyme similarity o plan molecular syntheses search reaction databases and annotate new function to enzymes these methods were developed analogous to molecular similarity wherein presence of key molecular_signatures is encoded as bits in a feature_vector and compared to compute similarity for reaction similarity signatures of transformation pattern are encoded into a reaction fingerprint or feature_vector and used to compute similarity chemaxon docs daylight theory manual present approaches evaluate reaction similarity by comparing transformation patterns comparison with respect to substrates requires_additional assessment rxnsim evaluates reaction similarity by comparing molecular_signatures of individual_molecules involved in the reactions molecular_signatures implicitly encode transformation patterns accuracy of such approaches is limited by presence of large chemical moieties such as atp to overcome this rxnsim provides methods to mask user_defined moieties for weighted similarity computations
