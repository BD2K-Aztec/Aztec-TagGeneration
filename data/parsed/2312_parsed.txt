identifying associations between amino_acid changes and meta_information in alignments motivation we present a method that identifies associations between amino_acid changes in potentially significant sites in an alignment taking_into several amino_acid with phenotypic_data through the phylogenetic mixed model the latter accounts for the dependency of the observations organisms it is known from previous_studies that the pathogenic aspect of many organisms may be associated with a single or just few changes in amino_acids which have a strong structural and or functional impact on the protein discovering these sites is a big step toward understanding pathogenicity our method is able to discover such sites in proteins responsible for the pathogenic character of a group of bacteria results we use our method to predict potentially significant sites in the rpos protein from a set of bacteria several sites with significant differences in biological relevant regions were found availability our tool is publicly_available on the cran network at http cran r project org next_generation has dramatically_increased the amount of biological data available this technology has made sequencing cheaper and faster while stimulating the development of several methodologies the number of sequenced_genomes has increased dramatically over the past_few reaching sequenced_genomes at the time of writing genome_project database at the ncbi in bacteria several strains are sequenced from different organisms with the number of available genomes steadily_increasing at this time strains corresponding to species are being sequenced http www ncbi nlm nih gov genomes lproks cgi last accessed date april the multitude of genomes gives the possibility to identify orthologous_groups of proteins among many closely_related strains for very similar strains thousands of these orthologous_groups may exist implying a dimension expansion of problems involving alignments indeed aligning thousands of proteins from hundreds to whom correspondence should be addressed of strains exploring the alignments and identifying interesting sites is a daunting task when dealing with very large_alignments the overview is easily lost this leads to the idea of establishing a more automated way of finding significant positions in the alignments that are sites in the protein in which amino_acid changes could alter the function in general multiple_sequence identify regions of similarity that may result from functional structural or evolutionary_relationships between the sequences and frequently a mixture of them if two sequences in an alignment share a common_ancestor mismatches can be interpreted as point_mutations and gaps as insertions_or introduced in one or both lineages since they diverged from that ancestor hence behind a multiple_sequence of orthologs lies a phylogeny when analyzing alignments in order to perform association studies with some metainformation such as specific phenotypic_data one should therefore consider the phylogenetic_relationship between the organisms the method presented here identifies associations between amino_acid changes in interesting positions in an alignment taking_into several amino_acid with some metainformation e g phenotypic_data the proposed method has general applicability to other organisms different amino_acid different metadata as a motivating example we applied it to a set of bacterial_strains belonging to several genera genera species with the aim of finding amino_acid changes that might be correlated with the pathogenicity of the bacteria the pathogenicity character is mainly determined by the presence of specific genes such as toxins often referred to as virulence_genes however several studies have shown that the pathogenicity character of different bacterial_strains is determined by changes in amino_acids causing changes in protein_structure and hence function thus the pathogenicity character can also be conferred by specific genetic_variations having an effect on protein_function and not solely by the presence_or of virulence_factor genes as previously assumed we have assembled a screening method that identifies significant sites in an alignment which might confer the pathogenicity character to some bacteria through the application of linear_mixed on different amino_acid in each of those columns amino_acid can be grouped according to many different characteristics such as size polarity alpha_helix or beta_sheet propensity substitutions severely changing the value of some key_properties e g from polar to non polar tend to have a stronger_effect on the tertiary_structure and probably on the function of the protein page in a first step we explored the ability of the three fast scanning methods with two aims i as fast alternatives to the pmm and ii as fast initial filtering of columns to further apply the pmm we defined s t j as the gold_standard for this reason our method was applied to the columns in the alignment of rpos that remained after removing columns that were totally conserved or that contained gaps subsequently we calculated the s t score for each column unexpectedly anova and cer performed extremely bad the rank correlation between s t j and cer was p while between anova median and s t it was p on the other hand the simple entropy approach displayed a rank correlation of p however despite the reasonable correlation value only of the columns can be safely ignored based on the entropy value in the light of these results it is clear that none of the previous fast methods reasonably predict the pmm results and therefore cannot be used in the initial screening procedure given this situation we continued the analysis with the columns in the alignment however as these methods are based on completely different assumptions and even theoretical_foundations it could be interesting to keep them at hand to compare predictions a cutoff corresponding to the percentile of s t was chosen in order to keep the most significant columns for further analysis which led to remaining columns shows those significant positions and the respective scores for each property as well as thes t score furthermore we predicted the secondary_structure of rpos using the psipred server applied to the rpos protein from escherichia_coli as model for each of the significant columns in we denoted whether it lies within an alpha_helix or coil region in addition the amino_acids enriched difference in the general frequency at each position in pathogens and nonpathogens are shown in order to assess the significance of the s t scores bootstrapping was performed permuting the properties in each bootstrap it can easily be appreciated that the distribution of bootstraps for intermediate or high scores are similar a different approach to find interesting sites come from the effect_sizes shows the l values per position smoothed considering the neighbor positions with a dema function double exponential moving average that is for each position we consider the whole region n the adjacent neighbors at each side and average the l values weighted by a double exponential according to the distance we permuted the positions and calculated the dema for each position taking only the maximum into account before permuting positions again three different peaks were observed over the percentile of the bootstrap corresponding to sites and shows for each of these peaks the difference of the effect_size pathogennon pathogen of each property in order to investigate the contribution of each of see_supplementary for a complete list of effect_sizes cumulative effect_sizes were calculated in order to observe overall tendencies along the alignment shows the cumulative_sum of the effect_size in each of the five properties along the positions in the alignment the cumulative effect_sizes were calculated based only on the significant positions were the distribution of the effect_sizes random meaning that no tendency in pathogens or nonpathogens would be detectable a line oscillating around zero should be observed similar to the dotted one finally in our example an alignment with species relevant columns and properties took h for running iterations in a macbook pro with intel core i processor ghz and gb of ram while the three approaches we assayed for quick page and three arbitrarily chosen positions with insignificant scores to the right of the dashed_line the triangles and rhomboids are the actual s t scores while triangles significant scores lie above the bootstrap distribution rhomboids insignificant scores are falling into the distribution range this is in agreement with our assessment of significance based on s t the empirical distribution of s t is plotted as a rotated density plot on the right i e the the y axis represents the scores values while the x axis represents their abundance selection of significant columns failed to select good candidates which precludes their usage in the filtering step a two stages approach of the pmm can be used with straightforward results the rank correlation between the final s t and estimates_obtained at and iterations was always data not shown the number of columns to include from a first quick run to retain the final to top values was below the double for and iterations this suggest a first run with iterations selecting a number of top ranking columns that double the desired final proportion of sites of interest and doing the final run only for this set in the present work we have shown how linear_mixed may serve to pinpoint interesting residues in protein_alignments associated with meta_information labels our method is closely connected to the pmm albeit cast within a bayesian_framework as previous work has put forward linear_mixed are extremely flexible being particularly well suited to account for non independence of observations especially when dealing with closely_related taxa we applied the pmm using five amino_acid descriptors of our own choice it is worth mentioning that while arbitrary our selection is based on sensible physicochemical assumptions under which their mutation is expected to impact a functional protein the pmm was performed over the whole set of relevant columns as a first step we created a summary_statistic s t that allows assessing a sites significance the right we show the distribution of the maximum_values obtained by each bootstrap in a violin plot basically a box plot that also shows the probability density the white circle indicates the median the central black_box and lines extending from it indicate the interquartile_range iqr and the iqr respectively a kernel estimate of the probability density is plotted as a blue area to the left and right of the box plot the marked peaks are all well above the percentile and two of them even greater than the bootstrap maximum with all properties being jointly considered several studies divided the sigma_factors and the rpos protein into four regions with different roles the highest s t score observed inwas which corresponds to a residue in region ofin the reference e coli rpos protein this region is involved in recognition of the promoter elements subregions and other interesting residues in region are and with scores of and respectively while columns and are predicted to lie in alpha_helix secondary_structures column belongs to a coil region following the s t scores region harbors most residue changes associated with pathogenicity it is noteworthy that leucine is among the residues enriched at these positions in non pathogenic_organisms in pathogenic valine is enriched for columns and while both residues valine and leucine are aliphatic they show strong differences in frequencies at alpha_helix and betasheet structures additionally position in the alignment with score corresponding to subregion is very interesting recognition of the promoter element is mediated by a helixturn helix unit in this subregion and amino_acids from this region may also provide a contact point for some activator proteins s t scores near are good even though no statistical_significance value is attached to them moreover by ordering the scores increasingly one can rank the columns from less to more interesting analyzing only the most interesting of them in our example the values_calculated were almost all significant even using the correction for the effective number of samples in mcmc runs and correcting for multiple testing data not shown this problem probably associated with the very relaxed null_hypothesis tested makes this statistical_approach impractical however techniques such as bootstrapping can be used as a proxy for the significance score when we performed bootstraps for the sites with highest s t values the distributions of values obtained in the bootstrapping process were well below the real scores on the other hand when we performed the bootstrap for columns with low to intermediate scores the real values fell inside the bootstrap distribution pointing to the expected non significance furthermore for medium to very high s t values the bootstrap distributions were strikingly similar which in principle allows a significant reduction in the number of columns to consider for the bootstrap process statistical_significance of the observed fixed_effects is fundamental to avoid spurious correlations however the real biological_significance of the observed changes is probably more associated to the effect_size that is the relative difference in each of the considered properties while correlation between s t and effect_sizes were reasonably high and significant for all considered properties ras mut kd alpha and beta an alternative view could emerge if candidate selection is based on effect_sizes for this reason we calculated the l norm for each column in the alignment using the standardized effect_sizes three peaks were significant as shown in corresponding to positions and the change in ras in region is noteworthy and the change in all properties for column is of particular interest residues at position in the alignment showed an increase in ras together with a decrease of hydropathy in pathogenic_organisms while the effect_sizes of known reported cases are bigger than that observed in our case e g it is worth mentioning that we are detecting weaker signals present in a large number of organisms spread across very distant phylogenetic_groups hence smaller effect_sizes are in fact expected the ras and mutability are consistently larger in pathogenic_organisms as compared with their non pathogenic counterpart furthermore given the observed pattern we analyzed the mean ras per organism with a linear_mixed and found a significant_difference between pathogens and non pathogens mean difference confidence_interval data not shown additionally for pathogens high mutability may constitute a selective_advantage e g to cope with a changing host_environment the behavior of other properties is more erratic with increases and decreases alternating across the protein_sequence several points in our approach are worthy of discussion first the amino_acid are usually limited to possible values in general they are measured in a continuous scale but the limited set of values few amino_acids are in each site in the alignment suggests that a categorical representation is an interesting alternative however even with discrete data the simple linear_mixed performs almost equivalent to more complex models based on generalized mixed model theory with the enormous advantage of the simplicity for interpretation second while we focused our analysis on the fixed_effects essentially the difference in the properties between pathogens and non pathogens the random_effects and particularly additive_effects carry very important information regarding tendencies along the phylogenetic structure third phylogenetic heritability h is a key_component in the pmm heritability usually defined as the proportion of phenotypic_variance attributable to additive_effects indicates the importance of the phylogenetic_information with regard to the estimation process values of h near indicate that characteristics are highly dependent on the phylogenetic structure while values near indicate independence of the phylogeny in our case the first quartile of h was for all properties pointing toward the general importance of taking_into phylogenies in the linear_model fourth the computational performance of our method is adequate for medium_size problems and a two stage approach of the pmm can be used to reduce the computational_burden moreover our approach is trivially parallelizable both in properties page we present a method based on pmm and amino_acid characteristics that helps finding interesting columns in a protein sequence_alignment which might be responsible for a structural_change in a protein possibly affecting its function we presented an example of this method through an alignment of bacterial rpos sequences using five amino_acid in order to distinguish which columns could be associated with the pathogenic character of some strains our method is extremely flexible and can be applied to all kinds of labels univariate or multivariate and even taking account of several effects together although we mainly explored the fixed_effects a lot of additional possibilities can be exploited from random_effects in the present work we presented one variant of all these possibilities and implemented it as an r package
