genome_analysis inferring statin induced gene regulatory_relationships in primary_human motivation statins are the most widely used cholesterol_lowering drugs the primary target of statins is hmg_coa a key enzyme in cholesterol_synthesis however statins elicit pleitropic responses including beneficial as well as adverse_effects in the liver or other organs today the regulatory_mechanisms that cause these pleiotropic_effects are not sufficiently understood results in this work genome_wide rna expression changes in primary_human of six individuals were measured at up to six time points upon atorvastatin_treatment a computational_analysis workflow was applied to reconstruct regulatory_mechanisms based on these drugresponse data and available knowledge about transcription_factor tf binding_specificities and proteindrug interactions several previously_unknown tfs were predicted to be involved in atorvastatin responsive gene_expression the novel relationships of nuclear_receptors nr c and ppara on cyp a were successfully validated in wet_lab statins are widely used cholesterol_lowering drugs that inhibit hmg_coa a key enzyme in cholesterol_synthesis clinical_trials however indicate that statins additionally cause cholesterol independent or pleiotropic_effects these pleitropic effects may either be beneficial e g decrease of oxidative_stress and inflammation or toxic e g statininduced liver_injury currently the specific regulatory_mechanisms that cause these adverse_effects are not sufficiently understood transcriptional_regulators including statinresponsive transcription_factors tfs and regulatory co factors are suspected to be involved in these mechanisms to whom correspondence should be addressed genome_wide mrna expression_profiling techniques are widely used tools to monitor large_scale regulatory_effects in response to drug_treatments for this purpose gene_expression are first clustered into sets of co expressed genes which are assumed to be co regulated putative tfs are then inferred by mapping position frequency matrices pfms which are widely used models for tf_binding to the promoter_sequences of putative target_genes according to the futility theorem however the grand majority of predicted transcription_factor tfbss is nonfunctional which is partly due to the degeneracy of tfbss and the low_specificity of pfms one common approach to overcome this problem and increase the specificity of tfbs detection is to search for common combinations of tfbss in sets of co expressed genes referred to as cis_regulatory module crm detection crm detection methods rely on the assumption that co regulated_genes are controlled by specific combinations of tfs which bind in physical proximity to each other the specificity of crm detection can be further increased by taking additional sources of evidence into account such as correlations between regulators and putative target_genes on the gene expression_level in this work a multiobjective crm detection approach was used to infer new statin induced gene regulatory_relationships based on microarray measurements transcription_factor and proteindrug interaction data
