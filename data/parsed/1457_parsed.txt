structural_bioinformatics dockstar a novel ilp based integrative_method for structural_modeling of multimolecular protein_complexes motivation atomic_resolution modeling of large multimolecular assemblies is a key task in structural cell_biology experimental_techniques can provide atomic_resolution structures of single proteins and small complexes or low_resolution data of large multimolecular complexes results we present a novel integrative computational_modeling method which integrates both low and high_resolution experimental_data the algorithm accepts as input atomic_resolution structures of the individual subunits obtained from x_ray nmr or homology_modeling and interaction data between the subunits obtained from mass_spectrometry the optimal assembly of the individual subunits is formulated as an integer_linear task the method was tested on several representative complexes both in the bound and unbound cases it placed correctly most of the subunits of multimolecular complexes of up to subunits and significantly outper formed the combdock and haddock multimolecular docking methods availability_and http bioinfo d cs tau ac il dockstar contact many cellular_processes are performed by multimolecular protein_complexes a cell consists of hundreds of different functional complexes such as the rna exosome the proteasome and the nuclear_pore detailed structural_characterization of such complexes is a primary goal of structural_biology however structural_characterization of large complexes by high_resolution experimental_techniques such as x_ray or nmr_spectroscopy is challenging whereas electron_microscopy or mass_spectrometry ms produce low_resolution data it is becoming clear that integration of data derived from a variety of bio physical techniques at multiple levels of resolution is essential for the structural analysis of large complexes in the last couple of decades significant progress has been achieved in computational_modeling of binary proteinprotein_complexes as has been showcased in the capri critical assessment of prediction of interactions challenge however only a handful of methods has been developed for the modeling of multimolecular complexes the better performing ones have been limited to symmetric homo oligomers for the non symmetric case we have previously_developed combdock which formulates the multimolecular complex detection_task as a search for an optimally scoring spanning tree of the complex subunit_interactions graph the optimization is done by a branch and bound technique the multimolecular version of haddock is driven by experimental and bioinformatics data but limits the number of subunits to six apparently due to computational_complexity constraints multi lzerd builds the multimolecular assembly applying a stochastic_search driven by a genetic_algorithm construct the multimolecular complex iteratively where at each iteration the subassembly is grown by one subunit model the complexes at a coarse_grained resolution where proteins are represented by single spheres experimental ms based data is translated into spatial restraints and integrated into the scoring_function using the imp platform the generation of candidate models is done by an exhaustive monte_carlo search of the conformational_space the large multimolecular assembly task can be divided_into two subtasks a detection of the protein_protein graph between the individual subunits b detection of a globally consistent pose of the subunits so that there are no steric clashes between them and the binding_energy of the whole complex is optimized low_resolution experimental_data obtained from ms is especially suitable to assist in subtask a in particular native ms of intact protein_complexes and their subcomplexes can determine the stoichiometry of the complex subunits and deduce the interaction graph of the multimolecular complex chemical_cross combined with ms xl ms provides distance constraints between surface_residues both on the same and on neighboring subunits thus providing information both for the detection of the interaction graph as well as constraints on the relative spatial poses of neighboring subunits such constraints have been successfully exploited in the modeling of the s proteasome the proteasome lid the tric cct chaperonin the rna_polymerase iitfiif complex and more here we introduce dockstar a novel protein assembly modeling algorithm which integrates ms based data we assume knowledge of the subunit interaction graph subtask a and focus on a global solution to the d puzzle assembly task our algorithm performs a search for assemblies optimizing satisfaction of cross_linking restraints as well as a knowledge based interaction potential between neighboring subunits the optimization is performed by formulating the task as an integer_linear ilp thus not depending neither on greedy type iterative algorithms which tend to miss solutions with low scoring intermediates nor on time consuming monte_carlo type search this enables efficient handling of relatively large assemblies to validate this method dockstar was tested on a set of examples where both high_resolution structures of the full complex and cross_linking data between neighboring subunits was available the modeling was performed both in bound and unbound scenarios and compared with the state of the art haddock and combdock multimolecular assembly algorithms dockstar proved to be significantly more time efficient than the other methods while exhibiting better performance dockstar is a multimolecular docking method which integrates experimental cross_links and graph topology data the method was tested on a diverse dataset which included bound and unbound examples different numbers of complex subunits from to and diverse additional experimental_data see summary of results in the method was compared with the state of the art combdock and haddock multimolecular docking methods all running_times were measured on a core xeon ghz server below we present in detail the results for several large complexes additional data including figures can be found in the supplementary_materials
