data_and plant photosynthesis phenomics data quality_control motivation plant phenomics the collection of large_scale plant phenotype data is growing_exponentially the resources have become essential component of modern plant science such complex datasets are critical for understanding the mechanisms_governing energy_intake and storage in plants and this is essential for improving crop_productivity however a major_issue facing these efforts is the determination of the quality of phenotypic_data automated methods are needed to identify and characterize alterations caused by system errors all of which are difficult to remove in the data_collection step and distinguish them from more interesting cases of altered biological_responses results as a step towards solving this problem we have developed a coarse to refined model called dynamic filter to identify abnormalities in plant photosynthesis phenotype data by comparing light responses of photosynthesis using a simplified kinetic_model of photosynthesis dynamic filter employs an expectation_maximization process to adjust the kinetic_model in coarse and refined regions to identify both abnormalities and biological outliers the experimental_results show that our algorithm can effectively_identify most of the abnormalities in both real and synthetic datasets plants capture sunlight to fix co into energy rich molecules thus supplying our ecosystem with o and essentially all of its biological energy including of our food recent work has focused on improving the efficiency of photosynthesis to meet our growing needs for food and fuel to develop efficiencyboosting mechanisms that reduce energy losses or enhance co delivery to cells during photosynthesis advanced technologies in high_throughput plant photosynthetic phenotyping and phenoinformatics have been developed these technologies have allowed plant photosynthesis phenotypic_variability to be characterized and to be related to putative biological_functions leading to a better understanding of the underlying_mechanisms that control photosynthetic properties under various environmental_conditions plant phenomics is a first class asset for understanding the mechanisms_regulating energy_intake in plants plant phenotyping systems monitor photosynthetic performance for many plants both continuously and simultaneously phenomics datasets are large and continue to grow as we increase duration of sampling and resolution yet despite the size and richness of the data small_clusters of erroneous values which give the appearanceof real differences in biological_responses can skew the analysis towards an invalid interpretation there are several ways in which a measurement can be in error errors originating from instrumentation malfunctions biased values from miscalibrated sensors and inevitable errors of precision all these issues compromise the downstream data analysis tasks given the value of clean data for any operation the ability to improve data_quality is a key requirement for effective knowledge mining from large_scale phenotype data in this article we focus on data abnormalities detection which is a type of measurement errorto demonstrate how clean phenotype data can be obtained similar to sensor data abnormalities in plant phenotype data deviate significantly from expected patterns and are visible outliers in the whole dataset the majority of abnormalities in plant phenotyping originate from instrumentation malfunctions e g loss of sensor synchronization during measurement or non biological statistical outliers caused by data_collection limitations e g deterioration of signal_to for a sample as it progresses through the experiment data abnormalities are often viewed as outliers in the whole dataset recent work has shown the effectiveness of applying data_mining especially outlier_detection for the purpose of data_cleaning making it possible to automate the cleansing process for a variety of domains in these methods by detecting the minorities of values that do not conform to the general_characteristics of a given data_collection outliers are identified and are considered violations of association_rules or other patterns in the data however the existing_models are not suitable for phenotype data_cleaning these methods while applied to phenotype data may remove outliers including both measurement errors and true_biological discoveries since true_biological discoveries to some extent are outliers as well furthermore detecting abnormalities from long time series phenotype data requires handling a high temporal dimension which increases the model_complexity to identify and remove abnormalities in phenotype data and to minimize the deletion of biological discoveries we have developed a coarse to refined residual analysis algorithm called dynamic filter dynamic filter has three key_steps i identify abnormal candidates at the coarse level ii refine abnormality identification in a projected feature_space and iii iteratively identify abnormalities at the refined level dynamic filter can speed up the data preparation process and make it more effective such improvements will minimize time consuming and labour_intensive data preparation and increase the significance and confidence in biological discoveries in summary our model has the following advantages bullet to our knowledge dynamic filter is the first work to integrate biological constraints with time series phenotype data for data_cleaning bullet our model can identify both abnormalities and biological discoveries bullet dynamic filter outperforms the existing solutions by optimizing the fitness between phenotype data and biological constraints with an aim towards identifying targets for improving energy yield advanced technologies in high_throughput plant photosynthetic phenotyping have been developed these systems can be used to quantify photosynthetic behaviour in genetically_diverse populations and to draw relationships among genotype phenotype and biological_function leading to a better understanding of the underlying_mechanisms that control the photosynthetic properties under various environmental_conditions as a consequence of the long time high_throughput plant phenotyping the scale of plant phenomics data grows exponentially however the quality of phenotype data may be skewed by sources of noise that are difficult to remove in the data_collection step the purpose of plant phenotyping is to discover phenotype values that are significantly different from a reference but phenotype values leading to biological discoveries may be obscured by abnormal values caused by errors during detection to ensure high data_quality effective data_cleaning should be considered a primary task however since advanced data_cleaning algorithms are primarily based on indiscriminate outlier_detection they may remove both abnormalities and biological discoveries not separable in the data distribution we have developed a new coarse to refined model called dynamic filter to effectively_identify both abnormalities and biological discoveries by adopting a widely used photosynthetic model specifically dynamic filter is a residual analysis approach by dynamically tracing statistical distributions of all samples rather than individuals and incorporating em for performance optimization in refined checking regions we note that certain events such as transient changes in growth environment could introduce signals similar to growth lighting malfunction which could be wrongly labelled as abnormalities by dynamic filter therefore instead of automatically deleting all the predicted abnormalities we send all of them to domain_experts for confirmation meanwhile all raw_data are kept for any rollback operation experimental_results show that our model is significantly better than the existing data_cleaning tools on both real phenomics data and synthetic data dynamic filter may have a wide impact because of the rapid increase of large_scale phenotyping technologies it should be noted that although we used a photosynthesis specificplant photosynthesis phenomics data_quality controlcurve the model itself is independent of actual biological constraints in principle our approach can be used to clean data for any number of phenotypes as long as suitable theoretical curves can be derived for their behaviour implementation for new use cases would involve substituting the appropriate theoretical curve into the program calculating the residuals of fits to the datasets and optimizing the fitting procedure as described in
