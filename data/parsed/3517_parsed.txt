data_and pgs a tool for association study of high_dimensional microrna expression data with repeated_measures motivation micrornas mirnas are short single_stranded non coding molecules that usually function as negative_regulators to silence or suppress gene_expression owning to the dynamic nature of mirna and reduced microarray and sequencing_costs a growing number of researchers are now measuring high_dimensional mirna_expression data using repeated or multiple_measures in which each individual has more than one sample collected and measured over time however the commonly used univariate association testing or the site by site sbs testing may underutilize the longitudinal feature of the data leading to underpowered results and less biologically_meaningful results we propose a penalized regression_model incorporating grid_search method pgs for analyzing associations of high_dimensional mirna_expression data with repeated_measures the development of this analytical framework was motivated by a real_world mirna dataset comparisons between pgs and the sbs testing revealed that pgs provided smaller phenotype prediction_errors and higher enrichment of phenotype related biological_pathways than the sbs testing our extensive simulations showed that pgs provided more accurate estimates and higher sensitivity than the sbs testing with comparable specificities availability_and r source_code for pgs algorithm implementation example and simulation_study are available for down load at https github com feizhe pgs micrornas mirnas are short single_stranded rnas of nearly nt in length that are transcribed from dna but not translated into proteins most mirnas inhibit the translation of proteins destabilize their target messenger_rnas mrnas and control many cellular_mechanisms dynamically even small changes in mirna_expression levels may have profound consequences for the expression levels of target_genes the dynamic nature of mirnas distinguishes it from genetics therefore owing also to the reduced microarray and sequencing_experiments cost a growing number of researchers are conducting investigations that measure high_dimensional mirna_expression data using repeated or multiple_measures in which each individual has more than one sample collected and measured over time repeated or multiple_measures data allow the researcher to exclude mirna_expression variation between individuals depending on the outcomes and pinpoint the causal_role of mirna expressions such as longitudinal study_design the popular site by site sbs testing using generalized estimation equation gee or linear_mixed lmm represents a feasible approach to accommodate the presence of high_dimensional mirna_expression data measured at different time points sbs testing is a type of analysis that performs univariate tests of associations for each of the biomarker sites followed by multipletesting adjustments for example the bonferronis p value correction or the false_discovery fdr q value however this approach is particularly problematic in high_dimensional mirna_expression data because it ignores the underlying dependent structure between mirnas in addition not like genetics mirna expressions are modifiable by environmental_factors including diet air_pollution and other external exposures hence for better delineation of the direct effects of mirnas adjusting for these environment factors in models are recommended but issues such as overfitting collinearity and obscuring biomarkers with small effect_sizes are usually encountered in typical regression approaches e g gee and lmm therefore computationally_feasible methods are required to tackle these problems ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as to whom correspondence should be addressed we propose to apply a variable_selection method with specific application in high_dimensional mirna_expression data with repeated or multiple_measures wang et_al proposed a novel penalized gee pgee method to select variables when the number of covariates is moderate in a repeated or multiple_measures setting pgee is able to account for both within subject correlation and dependencies between different biomarkers however pgee typically fails in the presence of high_dimensional biomarkers i e when the number of biomarkers is larger than the sample_size to tackle this issue we develop a prescreening based pgee with grid_search pgs method our method consists of an iterative two step approach step uses the screening method to downsize the biomarkers whereas step feeds the survived biomarkers to the pgee we repeat these two steps in a grid_search and perform k fold crossvalidation to determine tuning parameters we test our methods in a mirna_profiling dataset generated from our beijing truck driver air_pollution study btdas in btdas we measured air_pollution and health_outcomes including lung functions twice with weeks apart we also collected_blood twice for biomarker measurements including mirna_profiling based on repeated_measures mirna collected in btdas we apply pgs to model the lung_function levels measured by forced_expiratory in one second fev with the goal of detecting lung_function related_mirnas and uncovering regulatory_pathways we also compare pgs with gee lmm sbs testing in terms of prediction_error of lung_function levels and enrichment of lung_function related biological_pathways in addition a simulation_study is conducted to examine the extensions of pgs in this study we proposed and applied pgs method to handle high_dimensional mirna_expression data with repeated_measures we compared performances of the pgs and the traditional sbs testing pgs performed consistently better than gee lmm sbs testing in terms of higher phenotype prediction_performance higher enrichment of phenotype related biological_pathway more accurate estimates and higher sensitivity one of the regularity conditions for pgee algorithm is that p o n which requires the number of predictors p in model should be comparable with the sample_size n to ensure the tuning penalty parameter yields an overall effect_size estimation that best fits the data and avoid exceeded number of input biomarkers p m for pgee algorithm we incorporated the grid_search method a fold_cross was implemented to determine the best pgee selection results in terms of the smallest prediction_error among the parameter searching grid p m though pgs has a relatively high computational intensity the most common and systematic way as we have done in current study is through the cross_validation which is well documented in other established penalized models lasso and elastic_net pgs is a data_driven and self training analytical framework that can achieve maximum data utilization while constraining model_complexity simultaneously one key merit of pgs is its capacity to handle a multitude of biomarkers at the same time and select the influential ones using sbs testing we only found few significant results after having corrected for a high number of multiple testing while using pgs we identified a set of influential and meaningful mirnas without encountering multiple testing issues which offers a novel perspective in analyzing high_dimensional with repeated_measures another distinct advantage of pgs is that it considers all informative biomarkers as a whole instead of treating them individually using the sbs testing although some mirnas successfully pass the multiple testing it is possible that meaningful biological_events might not even be detected because of the correlations and interactions among mirnas however note mean estimates were calculated from the simulation runs respectively number of selections were the number of times each true effect selected by models out of the runs sensitivity_and for each method were the average for all runs rmse is root_mean between mean estimates and true effects which describes mean accuracy of the model estimates note mean prediction_errors were computed by fold_cross errors from repeats the influential mirnas selected by lmm based pgs were used to calculate the prediction_errors p values were calculated by paired_t between the lowest prediction_errors from gee lmm using top mirnas and the prediction_errors from pgs using the selected influential mirnas enrichment score of seven laboratory proven kegg signaling_pathways related to lung_function pgs selection results were from lmm based pgs the effects of these biomarkers could be significant when modeled together pgs is able to capture these complex features across all input biomarkers and detect influential ones that sbs testing would potentially ignore it is worth noting that pgs does not provide exact p values as the estimates do not follow normal distribution under the null_hypotheses therefore the criterion for determining influential biomarker in pgs is not based on p value but on the threshold for coefficient estimates of biomarkers influential biomarkers are selected when the estimates are greater than the threshold as suggested in wangs paper the default threshold is which is also proved to be a practical and robust threshold in our simulation_study in terms of sensitivity_and to ensure that the threshold of works uniformly for any dataset it is required to standardize each of the biomarkers with mean of zero and standard_deviation of one as a typical procedure before running penalize model robust selection of biomarkers by pgs relies on the setting of grid boundary and grid resolution too large would shrink all estimates to zero whereas too small would not shrink the estimates at all our numerical experience in similar settings suggests that a range of from to should cover the optimal for most of the cases within this range an increment of in provides a proper grid resolution to capture subtle effect changes of on biomarker selection results without much extra computational_burden on the other hand a too large p m might defy the application of pgs whereas a too small p m might underexploit the data an optimal p m could be found around the sample_size as is the case in our mirna study example where the optimal p m besides an increment of or in p m provides a sufficient resolution for capturing the effects of increasing p m on biomarker selection for all practical usage the initiation of vector can be varied from to and the initiation of p m can be a vector with a few numbers varied around the sample_size minus the number of confounders in our case it is it is not necessary to initiate a full vector of p m as it adds redundant parameter pairs to the grid extension of boundary and or p m boundary will be considered only when the optimal and or p m hit the initial boundaries in this article we used different elaborate ranges but all were within the range for better results representations and higher grid resolution i e smaller increment of for more reliable method evaluations in simulation_studies insensitive to mis specification of the covariance_structure is a feature that distinguishes gee from lmm inheriting this feature from gee pgs is able to estimate the correlation_matrix regardless of whether the structure is specified based on the estimation one could either use lmm based pgs with a solid guess of the covariance_structure or use gee based pgs if there is no good choice of the structure prescreening step prioritizes potentially influential biomarkers which facilitates pgs to handle the situation in which the number of biomarkers is considerably larger than the sample_size gee and lmm are two handy approaches for prescreening however the potential limitation of prescreening is that mirnas with small but true non zero effects may be excluded during the prescreening step nevertheless with a given sample_size the grid_search method in pgs ensures that pgee can include as many biomarkers as possible the performance of pgs is comparable with the approaches being benchmarked i e sbs gee lmm however pgs is more suitable for high_dimensional mirna_expression data with repeated_measures in that by exploiting underlying dependent structures it relies on variable_selection in the context of a multiple_regression which circumvents multiple testing issues pgs is also applicable to other longitudinally collected high_dimensional quantitative data such as epigenomics mrna transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics etc the growing number of studies conducting high_dimensional profiling dataset using different platforms requires a more comprehensive evaluation of pgs in various study settings
