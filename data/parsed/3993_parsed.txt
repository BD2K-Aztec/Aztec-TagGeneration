revealing differences in gene network_inference on the network level by ensemble methods motivation the inference of regulatory_networks from large_scale expression data holds_great because of the potentially causal interpretation of these networks however due to the difficulty to establish reliable_methods based on observational_data there is so_far only incomplete knowledge about possibilities and limitations of such inference methods in this context results in this article we conduct a statistical_analysis investigating differences and similarities of four network_inference aracne clr mrnet and rn with respect to local network based measures we employ ensemble methods allowing to assess the inferability down to the level of individual edges our analysis reveals the bias of these inference methods with respect to the inference of various network_components and hence provides guidance in the interpretation of inferred regulatory_networks from expression data further as application we predict the total number of regulatory_interactions in human b cells and hypothesize about the role of myc and its targets regarding molecular information_processing the orchestral behavior of genes is coordinated by different types of gene_networks e g the transcriptional_regulatory signaling or protein network and interactions among them as these networks represent biochemical_interactions among gene_products they form causal instead of merely association networks for this reason the reconstruction of gene_networks from experimental_data on a genomic_scale is considered as one of the most important goals in systems_biology a reflection of this importance can be seen in the establishment of the dream dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods project and its conference series that is devoted to all aspects of this endeavor providing a forum for the community if expression data from dna microarray_experiments are used the inferred networks are called gene_regulatory grns because a large portion of estimated interactions may come from to whom correspondence should be addressed transcription_regulation directly but not only emmert in general grn_inference grni is important for a better understanding of normal cell_physiology and for the explanation of pathological phenotypes the difficulty of the problem stems from the fact that expression data are noisy sample_size is small relative to the number of covariates and the type of data is frequently limited to observational_data only e g because of ethical reasons recently several mutual_information mi based_methods for the inference of genome_scale regulatory_networks have been suggested to approach this problem four of these methods are aracne clr mrnet and relevance networks rn these methods have been investigated using global performance_measures such as the f score or area under the receiver_operator auroc further such studies are frequently based on an individual dataset rather than an ensemble of datasets drawn under the same condition in this article we analyze network_inference statistically employing local network based measures to assess their performance as proposed in emmert in combination with ensemble data this introduces a graph_theoretical perspective on the problem that allows to study arbitrary network_components instead of the entire network only in this article we compared four different network_inference algorithmsaracne clr mrnet and rnwith respect to their performance for this comparison we used several local page despite the wealth of literature already existing studying network_inference our study is the first comparing such algorithms with respect to local network based measures in combination with ensemble methods by emphasizing network based and ensemble we want to point out first measures should be problem specific in contrast to general measures such as the f score allowing to gain domain specific insights in the underlying problem second the overall problem of network_inference should be put in the context of statistical_inference to gain reliable information about the performance and especially errors of such methods under well defined conditions
