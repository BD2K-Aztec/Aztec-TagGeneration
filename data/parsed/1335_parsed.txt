design of shortest double_stranded dna_sequences covering all k_mers with applications to protein binding microarrays and synthetic enhancers motivation novel technologies can generate large sets of short double_stranded dna_sequences that can be used to measure their regulatory_effects microarrays can measure in vitro the binding intensity of a protein to thousands of probes synthetic enhancer sequences inserted into an organisms genome allow us to measure in vivo the effect of such sequences on the phenotype in both applications by using sequence probes that cover all k_mers a comprehensive picture of the effect of all possible short_sequences on gene_regulation is obtained the value of k that can be used in practice is however severely limited by cost and space considerations a key challenge is therefore to cover all k_mers with a minimal number of probes the standard way to do this uses the de_bruijn sequence of length k however as probes are double_stranded when a k_mer is included in a probe its reverse complement k_mer is accounted for as well results here we show how to efficiently create a shortest possible sequence with the property that it contains each k_mer or its reverse complement but not necessarily both the length of the resulting sequence approaches half that of the de_bruijn sequence as k increases resulting in a more efficient array which allows covering more longer_sequences alternatively additional sequences with redundant k_mers of interest can be added availability the software is freely_available from our website_http acgt cs tau ac il shortcake gene_regulation is a central_focus of biological_research the main factors that regulate_gene are transcription_factors tfs these proteins bind to short dna_sequences either in promoters or enhancers and by that encourage or impede gene_transcription tfs bind to different dna_sequences with different affinity and specificity understanding tf binding_specificity and its effect on gene_expression and the final phenotype is a fundamental goal in the study of gene_regulation recent technologies measure the binding intensity of a tf to many dna_sequences e g protein binding microarray pbm and mitomi these technologies synthesize a large set of dna_sequences and measure the binding intensity of the tf to each of those sequences some technologies use random dna_sequences others use sequences that cover all possible dna k_mers as they provide a complete picture of the binding spectrum a similar approach was also used to test binding in vivo a recent study used synthesized enhancer oligomers designed to cover all mers to test their effect on limb formation in zebrafish de_bruijn sequences are the most compact sequences that cover all k_mers the length of a de_bruijn sequence of order k over alphabet jaej is jaej k where the dna alphabet is ae fa c g tg because of the exponential dependency on k and small space on the experimental device these technologies are limited to a small value of k the most popular technology pbm was used in hundreds of experiments to date using arrays with k to create p long probe_sequences the sequence is split into intervals of length p with k overlap p is used in pbms despite the universal and high_throughput nature of these technologies the data produced are still limited for many tfs binding depends on dna positions usually with six to eight core positions and additional side positions that have a significant contribution a recent study from the taipale laboratory using htselex showed that many tfs have longer motifs that are not covered well by an all mer array the rankmotif algorithm for pbm data also generates motifs of length in most cases covering all k_mers for a greater value of k will lead to improved understanding of tf_binding as the probes are double_stranded dna_segments one can save by using the reverse complementarity of dna whenever a k_mer is included its reverse complement is included as well and there is no need to cover it again this brings up the following question a sequence s is called a reverse complementary complete_sequence of order k rc complete_sequence for short if for each k_mer either the k_mer or its reverse complement are included in s can we construct an optimal minimum_length rc complete_sequence theoretically if for each k_mer t the sequence s includes either t or its reverse complement but not both one could save a factor of nearly compared with the length of a de_bruijn sequence ministeris and eisen andproposed the use of regular de_bruijn sequences for designing probes for pbms philippakis et_al used linear feedback shift registers to generate a de_bruijn sequence with good coverage of gapped k_mers this approach was used for constructing two microarrays that are in use today with k the idea of exploiting reverse complementarity was raised by who sketched an

commintseris and eisen does not provide an optimal_solution for even values of k in the context of sequence_assembly solved the problem of constructing a minimum_length sequence that covers a given set of k_mers using reverse complementarity although their algorithm can be applied to solve the problem raised in this study they do not address it directly when applied to our problem their algorithm requires ok log jaejjaej k time as we shall see our algorithm is much faster in this study we address the problem of constructing an optimal rc complete_sequence we first give a lower_bound for the length of such a sequence we prove that for odd k there exists a sequence that achieves the lower_bound and show how to construct it in time complexity that is linear in the output sequence_length for odd k the algorithm constructs two tours that are reverse complementary to each other and together cover all edges of the de_bruijn and is identical to then we show how to adjust the algorithm to handle the case of even k achieving a saving factor approaching as k increases we give two solutions a simple near optimal one requiring linear time and a more complex okjaej k logjaej time solution that guarantees optimality of the resulting sequence in particular this implies that the lower_bound is not tight for even k we implemented the algorithm and we demonstrate the saving it achieves the produced sequences are nearly half the length compared with a regular de_bruijn sequence the article is organized as follows we first provide formal definitions and preliminaries we then present a lower_bound for the length of an optimal sequence_based on k_mer counts then we present an algorithm that works in linear time on the de_bruijn and prove that it solves the problem for odd k we conclude by describing the two possible solutions for even k and report on experimental_results with all the algorithms a lower_bound for the length of an rc complete_sequence first we derive a lower_bound for the length of an rc complete_sequence from k_mer counts proposition denote by n k the length of an optimal rc complete_sequence of order k if k is even proof we consider separately the cases of odd and even k for odd k there are no palindromes as the middle position in a k_mer differs from its reverse complement each k_mer must be represented in the sequence by itself or its reverse complement i
