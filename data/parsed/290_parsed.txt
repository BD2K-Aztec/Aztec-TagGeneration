analyzing synergistic and non synergistic_interactions in signalling_pathways using boolean nested effect models_motivation understanding the structure and interplay of cellular signalling_pathways is one of the great challenges in molecular_biology boolean_networks can infer signalling_networks from observations of protein activation in situations where it is difficult to assess protein activation directly nested effect models are an alternative they derive the network_structure indirectly from downstream_effects of pathway perturbations to date nested effect models cannot resolve signalling details like the formation of signalling complexes or the activation of proteins by multiple alternative input signals here we introduce boolean nested effect models b nem b nems combine the use of downstream_effects with the higher_resolution of signalling_pathway structures in boolean_networks results we show that b nems accurately_reconstruct signal flows in simulated_data using b nem we then resolve bcr signalling via pi k and tak kinases in bl lymphoma_cell cells process input signals to output signals using a network of cellular signalling_pathways for example a small_molecule binds a membrane_receptor the signal is brought into the cell via structural_modification of the receptor a set of kinases and other signalling_molecules propagate the signal through the cytosol this involves both activation and repression of proteins often complexes of multiple proteins must form before a signal propagates some of the molecules are also part of different pathways linking multiple pathways together eventually the signal enters the nucleus where transcription_factors and chromatin_remodelling enzymes become activated finally the combination of activated transcription_factors and regulatory co factors leads to the transcription of a large set of genes changing the phenotype of the cell understanding the structure and the interplay of pathways is crucial both for understanding the cellular_mechanism and for designing novel therapies that target specific pathways inferring networks from molecular_profiles is a well developed field in bioinformatics transcriptional data can be generated more easily compared with protein activation data consequently many algorithms were developed that focus on the reconstruction of regulatory_networks for example gaussian graphical_models sch fer and bayesian_networks the pc algorithm or the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular_networks all these methods use observational gene_expression data to construct regulatory_networks based on different association scores between genes it is no problem to quantify the expression of any gene using standard methods like qpcr microarrays or rnaseq observing signalling_networks is more complicated protein activation can operate on the levels of protein expression cellular protein_localization or protein_modifications like phosphorylation ubiquitination etc although there are assays to assess activation on any of these levels those assays are more elaborate more expensive and less generic moreover for every protein a priori information on which type of modification mediates signal_transduction is necessary molecular_biologists have been inferring pathways without formal computations for many years typically functional interventional data are used pathways are perturbed by activation or inhibition of genes and the consequences of the interventions are observed organized and interpreted also a range of algorithms have been described that formalize these types of arguments and make them accessible to bigger and more complex pathway_models use flow_cytometry data from perturbation experiments to infer protein signalling_pathways with a bayesian_network approach they test for conditional_independence between proteins states using protein inhibition experiments and direct measurement of these states introduced nested effects models nems nems infer non transcriptional signalling_pathways by transcriptional downstream_effects of pathway perturbation a pathway is activated in a set of cellular assays where specific pathway_components are silenced the silencing of a specific component blocks the flow of information in a specific branch of the pathway as a consequence genes that normally change expression in response to the stimulus no longer react in inhibition assays nems infer the pathway structure from the nesting of these sets if the effected genes of perturbing gene b are a noisy subset of the effected genes of gene a then a is upstream of b this concept has been extended to time series data evolving networks and network_inference with hidden confounders to date nems can infer the upstream downstream relations of genes in a pathway they can distinguish activation from repression and they can resolve the flow of information however they cannot model the role of complex formation in signalling_pathways if a protein x is activated by a complex all members of the complex must be present and in the correct activation state the proteins in the complex operate concertedly and are linked to x by an and gate in another scenario x can be activated independently by several proteins in this case the proteins are linked by an or gate boolean_networks model logical gates they have been used to simulate signalling_pathways and to reconstruct them from interventional data allowing for logical gates lead to identifiability problems of network_structures to resolve these ambiguities prior_knowledge on the pathway structures is used saezdescribe an algorithm called cellnetoptimizer to construct signalling_pathways from directly observed activation states of proteins in the boolean_network framework they combine prior_knowledge networks pkns with protein_phosphorylation data from interventional assays here we describe boolean nested effect models b nem this method combines advantages from boolean_network and nested effect models like boolean_networks b nems distinguish between the alternative and cooperative activation of a protein and like normal nems b nems do not need direct observations of protein activity moreover b nems can use data from assays where several pathway genes are perturbed simultaneously in the following we will describe the model formalism and define a pathway score together with a genetic_algorithm to search for high_scoring networks we will then validate our algorithm on simulated_data and use it to analyze b cell receptor bcr signalling in lymphoma cells we have introduced b nem a novel method to infer signalling network_structures b nem extends the framework of standard nems standard models infer upstream downstream relations of signalling genes b nems in addition resolve the boolean logic of signal propagation they distinguishing between the independent activation of a protein by multiple upstream proteins and the joint activation by a complex formed from the upstream proteins moreover b nems distinguish between activating and inhibiting interactions due to identifiability problems associated with the estimation of boolean_networks b nem modelling must build on strong prior assumptions on the network_structure networks cannot be constructed from scratch but unknown features of existing networks can be resolved we demonstrated this idea by resolving the role of pi k and tak as mediators of bcr signalling in our cancer derived_cell signalling was perturbed such cancer derived changes in signalling_mechanisms can be further characterized in a comparative b nem analysis of signalling in primary healthy cells and tumor_derived b nem exploits combinatorial perturbations of multiple genes because it is in general not feasible to perform all possible combinations a subset needs to be chosen we suggest an iterative procedure first a b nem is learned from single gene perturbations in case high_scoring networks are incoherent with respect to an important pathway feature one can simulate combinatorial perturbation data from these high_scoring networks aiming at identifying those combinations that resolve the incoherence in simulations we showed that b nems identify the correct score equivalence class of a signalling_pathway with high_accuracy identifying the correct signalling topology is harder the most critical step here is the use of prior_knowledge we implement prior_knowledge by excluding hyper edges a full bayesian_framework allows using softer priors that specify prior distributions on the full space of network_topologies however for large_networks these are not practical with b nem because a reduction of the search_space is needed for computational reasons the a priori restriction of the search_space is needed for at least three independent reasons first the search_space needs to be reduced in order to achieve practical running_times of the algorithm second together with the regularizing penalty for overly complex_networks the pkn is used to limit over fitting third pkns limit network ambiguities due to score equivalence of multiple_networks fortunately these goals are not opposing the stronger the prior assumptions the faster the algorithm the less over fitting we have and the fewer the ambiguities due to score equivalence on the other side incorrect a priori assumptions can be disastrous as well they lead to biased and underfitted network models therefore one must find a good balance between belief in prior_knowledge from literature and the data
