unsupervised detection of genes of influence in lung_cancer using biological_networks motivation lung_cancer is often discovered long after its onset making identifying genes important in its initiation and progression a challenge by the time the tumors are discovered we only observe the final sum of changes of the few genes that initiated cancer and thousands of genes that they have influenced gene interactions and heterogeneity of samples make it difficult to identify genes consistent between different cohorts using gene and geneproduct interaction networks we propose a principled approach to identify a small subset of genes whose network neighbors exhibit consistently_high expression change in cancerous_tissue versus normal regardless of their own expression we hypothesize that these genes can shed light on the larger scale perturbations in the overall landscape of expression levels results we benchmark our method on simulated_data and show that we can recover a true gene_list in noisy measurement data we then apply our method to four non_small and two pancreatic_cancer cohorts finding several genes that are consistent within all cohorts of the same cancer type conclusion our model is flexible robust and identifies gene_sets that are more consistent across cohorts than several other approaches additionally our method can be applied on a per patient basis not requiring large cohorts of patients to find genes of influence our approach is generally_applicable to gene_expression studies where the goal is to identify a small set of influential genes that may in turn explain the much larger set of genome_wide expression changes availability the code is available atthe reality of cancer diagnosis is harsh despite continued advances in surgical pharmacological and radiological treatments mortality to whom correspondence should be addressed remains high with lung_cancer as the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in the united_states one of the primary challenges of lung_cancer is the detection of small earlystage tumors most cancers are identified and the tumor is excised for molecular analysis at a late_stage by then we are only able to observe the final sum of changes to cell structure and function reflected in differential_expression of a few genes that initiated cancer and thousands of genes affected through gene interactions because of the cascading effect it is difficult to identify genes that are directly responsible for tumorigenesis from gene_expression data alone recently a large number of studies have investigated the use of known genegene relationships such as physical_interaction of their proteins to characterize cancer_genes and to identify more robust signatures of diseases_including for instance it has been shown that genes whose expression has changed are more likely to be surrounded by genes whose expression has also changed initial attempts have relied on pre defined pathways or gene_sets limiting these analyses to well studied genes or known pathway memberships a more natural approach is to study the change in expression of a gene directly in the context of the interaction_network of gene_products for instance by identifying active subnetworks that are predictive of the disease development of accurate_models for identifying important genes in cancer still face a number of key_challenges first many methods depend on the knowledge of seed genes known to be involved in a particular disease e g navlakha and kingsford second the procedure for estimating parameters in these models sometimes combine ad_hoc heuristics with underdetermined systems of equations which may not be robust to expression or network noise third most methods require availability of a sufficiently_large number of samples in order to reach conclusions about important genes in this article we start to address these challenges within a framework for detecting genes of influence given a set of gene_expression from tumor and healthy samples and a network of genegene_interactions our method does not require seed genes does not have to simultaneously infer the network circumventing the second challenge outlined above and can be applied on theto illustrate our methodology we first study a simulated scenario we impute influential genes in a real interaction_network as described in section and then recover them with our two proposed models we then apply our method to four lung_cancer datasets using the same interaction_network since in the real_data scenario we do not have the information about which genes have most profound effect on their neighbors we evaluate our performance in an unbiased way by examining consistency of the found genes among the four independent lung_cancer datasets
