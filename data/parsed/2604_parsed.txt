systems_biology jepetto a cytoscape_plugin for gene_set and topological_analysis based on interaction networks jepetto java enrichment of pathways extended to topology is a cytoscape x plugin performing integrative human gene_set it identifies functional_associations between genes and known cellular_pathways and processes using protein_interaction and topological_analysis the plugin integrates_information from three separate web_servers we published_previously specializing in enrichment_analysis pathways expansion and topological matching this integration substantially simplifies the analysis of user gene_sets and the interpretation of the results we demonstrate the utility of the jepetto plugin on a set of misregulated genes associated with alzheimers_disease availability source_code are freely_available for down load at http apps cytoscape org apps jepetto implemented_in and multi_platform installable directly via cytoscape_plugin manager released under the gnu general public licence the integration of heterogeneous data derived from functional_genomics experiments is an essential step in providing insights into biological_systems behaviour especially disease related processes nowadays this integration is becoming easier thanks to extendable network_analysis platforms such as cytoscape although several existing cytoscape plugins do functional analysis not many go beyond performing a term based search or link ontology in contrast jepetto integrates gene_sets with pathways and the molecular_interaction they are embedded in it uses information from three different web_servers to perform network enrichment pathways expansion and topological_analysis
