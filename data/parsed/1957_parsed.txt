genome_analysis geneclusterviz a tool for conserved gene_cluster visualization exploration and analysis motivation gene_clusters are arrangements of functionally_related on a chromosome in bacteria it is expected that evolutionary pressures would conserve these arrangements due to the functional advantages they provide visualization of conserved gene_clusters across multiple_genomes provides key insights into their evolutionary_histories therefore a software_tool that enables visualization and functional_analyses of gene_clusters would be a great asset to the biological research_community results we have developed geneclusterviz a java_based tool that allows for the visualization exploration and downstream_analyses of conserved gene_clusters across multiple_genomes geneclusterviz combines an easy to use exploration interface for gene_clusters with a host of other analysis features such as multiple_sequence phylogenetic_analyses and integration with the kegg_pathway availability recent_advances in sequencing_technology and ortholog detection methods have given rise to several methods for the detection of gene_clusters conserved across two or more genomes however gene_cluster information obtained from these programs has been very difficult to analyze for bench scientists due to the lack of a more intuitive analysis tool the visualization of gene_clusters in multiple_genomes with respect to their spatial and functional features is a fundamental problem in this area there are currently several visualization_tools that have been developed for a variety of applications in comparative_genomics to whom correspondence should be addressed a subset of these have been designed for the visualization of gene_clusters however these tools are limited in different ways in some cases only paired genome visualization is supported even in multi genome visualization scalability is a challenge and thus limits the utility of web_based tools moreover web_based tools rely on server hosted data and cannot utilize data provided by users this is true even in the case of absynte a tool that was recently_developed specifically for the task of visualizing bacterial and archaeal clusters standalone applications overcome these drawbacks but involve cumbersome installation procedures or database setups that demand programming_skills beyond that of most end_users finally existing gene_cluster visualization_tools are limited in their support for further downstream_analyses we have implemented geneclusterviz a robust and dynamic standalone tool that provides a global and local view of gene_clusters moreover with a host of flexible sequence and function analysis features we believe geneclusterviz can be a very useful tool in comparative_genomics geneclusterviz serves not only as a user_friendly for the visualization of gene_clusters across multiple_genomes but also as a workspace for extensive research on these clusters it tackles the non trivial task of providing access and information about multiple conserved clusters across multiple_genomes there are several applications that geneclusterviz can be used for including phylogenetic_studies pathway studies and gene function assignment thus it is expected to help bench scientists in understanding the functional relationship between genes in conserved clusters across the evolutionary spectrum of genomes
