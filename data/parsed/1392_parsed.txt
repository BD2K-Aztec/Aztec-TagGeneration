dingo differential_network in genomics motivation cancer_progression and development are initiated by aberrations in various molecular_networks through coordinated changes across multiple genes and pathways it is important to understand how these networks change under different stress_conditions and or patient specific groups to infer differential_patterns of activation and inhibition existing_methods are limited to correlation networks that are independently estimated from separate group specific data and without due consideration of relationships that are conserved across multiple groups method we propose a pathway based differential_network in genomics dingo model for estimating group specific networks and making inference on the differential_networks dingo jointly estimates the group specific conditional dependencies by decomposing them into global and group specific components the delineation of these components allows for a more refined picture of the major_driver and passenger events in the elucidation of cancer_progression and development results simulation_studies demonstrate that dingo provides more accurate group specific conditional dependencies than achieved by using separate estimation approaches we apply dingo to key_signaling in glioblastoma to build differential_networks for long_term survivors and short_term survivors in the cancer_genome the hub_genes found by mrna_expression dna_copy methylation and microrna expression reveal several important roles in glio blastoma progression complex biological_processes such as the development and progression of cancer often involve the interaction of genomic and epigenetic_factors with environmental_factors research has shown that genes can promote or inhibit tumor development within coordinating modules such as functional or cell signaling_pathways these genes and their corresponding pathways form networks that regulate various cellular_functions thus the construction and exploration of the topology of such networks and their constituents is of great interest for developing and understanding the biological_mechanisms behind disease development and progression it is well established that sub networks within functional regulatory_networks of genes and their products undergo changes in response to different conditions such as cellular_dna or environmental_stress analytic approaches for evaluating the regulation of such networks have sought to determine how specific genes and pathways operate in the promotion or inhibition of human disease for example a hub gene within a regulatory_network is a gene that acts to influence the activity of a large_number or transcription_factors thus it is of interest to analyze the activity or expression of a hub gene during different stages of disease while differential_gene analysis evaluates the changes in the expression of the hub gene under different conditions or states the incorporation of a network_structure extends the differential_gene analysis to differential_network which is one of the primary_aims of this article displays an example of the differential_network of data from two groups e g of patients that represent two different disease_states each letter vertex represents a gene or any of its products e g expression methylation copy_number or transcription_factor and each line edge represents the co expression in the network in the group specific networks left panels the edge colors and widths represent the signs and strengths of co expression quantities a differential network between group and group right panel is constructed by edge wise subtraction of the co expression quantities in the group specific networks in the differential network the edge colors represent the signs of the differences and the edge widths are proportional to the strengths of the differences this approach to network_analysis allows us to discover some less obvious network relations that are not identified in the group specific networks at the same time it will allow us to discard the relations that do not differentiate one disease_state of interest from another e g group from group in most of the methods for differential_network rely on different correlation based metrics to measure the strength of association between pairs of vertices in a network broadly there are three main approaches for comparing group specific networks in differential_network the first approach obtains sparse groupspecific networks and compares the network_topologies such as degrees of vertices or modularities between groups the second approach handles weighted group specific networks and uses some functions of the edge specific weight differences as the edge_weights to construct differential_networks instead of relying on edge wise co expression differences the last approach focuses more on finding gene_sets and identifying which correlation patterns differ between groups this approach formulates summary measures that represent co expressions within a set of genes and compares the quantities between groups although the above approaches have been useful in addressing important biological_questions the existing_methods for analyzing differential_networks are limited to correlation networks i e two genes at a time also the group specific correlations are estimated separately using observations within each group in this article we obtain more refined undirected relations than those based on correlation networks by estimating conditional dependencies between two genes after removing the effects of all other genes this results in the construction of an undirected graph of conditional dependencies that is sparser than a correlation network more importantly the separate estimations are performed without due consideration of the global relationships that are preserved for all groups i e are invariant to group specifications for example in our motivating example we consider gene_regulatory constructed using different modalities of genomic_data mrna_expression dna_copy methylation status and microrna expression we are interested in determining how the network_connectivity changes for patients with glioblastoma who experience different survival_times long_term and short_term survival_times our hypothesis is that some conditional dependencies are shared across the groups and can be thought of as passenger events and other conditional dependencies are unique to the groups and thus can be driver events that change with cancer_progression the delineation of these components allows for a more refined picture of the major events driver and or passenger in the elucidation of cancer_progression and development to this end we propose a differential_network in genomics dingo framework wherein we decompose the conditional dependencies among the genes variables into a global component and a local group specific component and jointly estimate the group specific conditional dependencies after adjusting for the global conditional dependencies with the dingo model the dimension of the parameters is greatly_reduced compared with that in separate estimations in addition we provide techniques for conducting rigorous statistical_inference on the differential_networks based on bootstrap procedures for assessing the differences in the group specific conditional dependencies this article is organized as follows in section we introduce the dingo model and the estimation_approach for calculating the group specific networks and bootstrap thresholding to determine the significant differential edges in section we apply our method to data obtained from the cancer_genome tcga glioblastoma study we estimate differential_networks for genes in glioblastoma cell signaling_pathways comparing data from long_term survivors ltss and short_term survivors stss using data from multiple_platforms in section we evaluate the dingo method and compare it with other estimation approaches via simulations under different settings we provide a summary and discussion in section in the supplementary_materials we present the technical_details additional results from the application of dingo to tcga glioblastoma data and additional simulation_results we propose a joint modeling_approach dingo for estimating differential_networks in various genomic_data in the presence of group information dingo estimates separate conditional dependencies for each group and allows for global dependencies thus it borrows strength more efficiently between groups we applied our dingo method to tcga glioblastoma data from four platforms mrna_expression dna_copy methylation and microrna expression and we found hub_genes based on the differential_networks many of which were in the regulatory_network related to the c_myc gene that contributes to the regulation of gbm proliferation and shorter_survival in gbm patients while pathways used in our analysis section have been implicated in gbm in prior studies the exact nature of the pathway_components has not been studied with respect to differential_patterns of activation_inactivation related to the patient prognostic_groups our re analysis focuses on the exact pathway breakages using data from multiple_platforms which sheds a completely different light on the various biological_processes involved in gbm progression the established pathways include up to genes supplementary for and genes steps and of dingo take around s and min respectively which makes it feasible to conduct pathway based differential_network a more detailed discussion of the computation time is provided in supplementary section s although our dingo method was applied to a two group setting the model can be generalized to incorporate multiple categories such as multiple_stages of disease and multiple subtypes as well as continuous covariates such as age and time for three groups with an intercept term we can apply x t x t and x t for group group and group respectively in the equation we can also add age as a continuous covariate by defining the covariate vectors x age i t for i in ltss and x age i t for i in stss this would require additional generalizations of our estimation and computational algorithms tasks that we leave for future consideration
