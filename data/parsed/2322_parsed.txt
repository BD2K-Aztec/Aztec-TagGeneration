identifying disease sensitive and quantitative_trait relevant biomarkers from multidimensional heterogeneous imaging_genetics data via sparse multimodal multitask_learning motivation recent_advances in brain_imaging and high_throughput techniques enable new approaches to study the influence of genetic and anatomical_variations on brain functions and disorders traditional association studies typically perform independent and pairwise analysis among neuroimaging measures cognitive_scores and disease status and ignore the important underlying interacting relationships between these units results to overcome_this in this article we propose a new sparse multimodal multitask_learning method to reveal complex relationships from gene to brain to symptom our main contributions are threefold i introducing combined structured sparsity regularizations into multimodal multitask_learning to integrate multidimensional heterogeneous imaging_genetics data and identify multimodal biomarkers ii utilizing a joint classification and regression learning model to identify disease sensitive and cognition relevant biomarkers iii deriving a new efficient optimization_algorithm to solve our non smooth objective_function and providing rigorous theoretical_analysis on the global optimum convergency using the imaging_genetics data from the alzheimers_disease neuroimaging initiative database the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by clearly improved_performance on predicting both cognitive_scores and disease status the identified multimodal biomarkers could predict not only disease status but also cognitive_function to help elucidate the biological_pathway from gene to brain structure and function and to cognition and disease recent_advances in acquiring multimodal brain_imaging and genome wide_array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic_variation on brain structure and function research in this emerging field known as imaging_genetics holds_great for a system biology of the brain to better understand complex neurobiological systems from genetic_determinants to cellular_processes to the complex_interplay of brain structure function behavior and cognition analysis of these multimodal datasets will facilitate early_diagnosis deepen mechanistic_understanding and improved treatment of brain_disorders machine_learning have been widely_employed to predict alzheimers_disease ad status using imaging_genetics measures since ad is a neurodegenerative_disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive_functions regression_models have also been investigated to predict clinical scores from structural such as magnetic_resonance mri and or molecular such as fluorodeoxyglucose_positron fdg_pet neuroimaging data for example performed stepwise_regression in a pairwise fashion to relate each of mri and fdg_pet measures of eight candidate_regions to each of four reys auditory verbal_learning test ravlt memory scores this univariate approach however did not consider either interrelated structures within imaging data or those within cognitive data using relevance vector regression jointly analyzed the voxelbased morphometry vbm features extracted from the entire_brain to predict each selected clinical_score while the investigations of different clinical scores are independent from each other one goal of imaging_genetics is to identify genetic risk_factors and or imaging biomarkers via intermediate quantitative_traits qts e g cognitive memory scores used in this article on the chain from gene to brain to symptom thus both disease classification and qt prediction are important machine_learning tasks prior imaging_genetics research typically employs a two step procedure for identifying risk_factors and biomarkers one first determines disease_relevant qts and then detects the biomarkers associated with these qts since a qt could be related to many genetic or imaging markers on different pathways that are not all disease specific e g qt and gene in an ideal scenario would be to discover only those markers associated with both qt and disease status for a better understanding of the underlying biological_pathway specific to the disease on the other hand identifying genetic and phenotypic biomarkers from large_scale multidimensional heterogeneous data is an important biomedical and biological research_topic unlike simple feature_selection working on a single data source multimodal learning describes the setting of learning from data where observations are represented by multiple types of feature_sets many multimodal methods have been developed for classification and clustering purposes such as co training a simplified schematic example of two pathways from gene to qts to phenotypic endpoints the red one is disease_relevant while the blue one yields only normal variation traditional two stage imaging genetic strategy identifies qt and qt first and then genes our new method will identify only disease relevant_genes i e gene and gene and gene would not be identified because it cannot be used to classify disease and multiview clustering however they typically assume that the multimodal feature_sets are conditionally independent which does not hold in many real_world applications such as imaging_genetics considering different representations give rise to different kernel functions several multiple_kernel mkl approaches have been recently studied and employed to integrate heterogeneous data and select multitype features however such models train a single weight for all features from the same modality i e all features from the same data source are weighted equally when they are combined with the features from other sources this limitation often yields inadequate performance to address the above challenges we propose a new sparse multimodal multitask_learning algorithm that integrates heterogeneous genetic and phenotypic_data effectively and efficiently to identify disease sensitive and cognition relevant biomarkers from multiple data_sources different to lasso group_lasso and other related methods that mainly find the biomarkers correlated to each individual qt memory score we consider predicting each memory score as a regression task and select biomarkers that tend to play_an in influencing multiple tasks a joint classification and regression multitask_learning model is utilized to select the biomarkers correlated to memory scores and disease categories simultaneously sparsity regularizations have recently been widely investigated and applied to multitask_learning models sparse representations are typically achieved by imposing non smooth norms as regularizers in the optimization_problems from the view of sparsity organization we have two types i the flat sparsity is often achieved by norm or norm regularizer or trace norm in matrix tensor completion optimization techniques_include lars linear gradient search proximal methods ii the structured sparsity is usually obtained through different sparse regularizers such as norm norm norm also denoted as norm norm in different papers and group norm which can be solved by methods in we propose a new combined structured sparse the proposed sparse multimodal multitask feature_selection method will identify_biomarkers from multimodal heterogeneous data resources the identified biomarkers could predict not only disease status but also cognitive_functions to help researchers better understand the underlying mechanism from gene to brain structure and function and to cognition and disease regularization to integrate features from different modalities and to learn a weight for each feature leading to a more flexible scheme for feature_selection in data_integration which is illustrated in in our combined structured sparse regularization the group norm regularization blue circles in learns the feature global importance i e the modal wise feature importance of every data modality on each class task and the norm regularization red circles in explores the feature local importance i e the importance of each feature for multiple_classes tasks the proposed method is applied to identify ad sensitive biomarkers associated with the cognitive_scores by integrating heterogeneous genetic and phenotypic_data as shown in our empirical results yield clearly improved_performance on predicting both cognitive_scores and disease status
