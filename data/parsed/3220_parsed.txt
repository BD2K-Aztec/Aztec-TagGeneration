systems_biology netcoffee a fast and accurate global_alignment approach to identify functionally conserved proteins in multiple_networks motivation owing to recent advancements in high_throughput proteinprotein_interaction of more and more species become available in public_databases the question of how to identify functionally conserved proteins across species attracts a lot of attention in computational_biology network alignments provide a systematic way to solve this problem however most existing alignment tools encounter limitations in tackling this problem therefore the demand for faster and more efficient alignment tools is growing results we present a fast and accurate algorithm netcoffee which allows to find a global_alignment of multiple proteinprotein_interaction netcoffee searches for a global_alignment by maximizing a target function using simulated_annealing on a set of weighted bipartite graphs that are constructed using a triplet approach similar to t coffee to assess its performance netcoffee was applied to four real_datasets our results suggest that netcoffee remedies several limitations of previous_algorithms outperforms all existing alignment tools in terms of speed and nevertheless identifies biologically_meaningful alignments discovering functionally conserved proteins across different species is a fundamental task in comparative systems_biology with the development of highthroughput technologies such as mass_spectrometry microarrays yeast_two assays and next_generation a tremendous amount of genomic proteomics and protein interaction data has been generated and became available in public_databases this comprehensive experimental_data provide a basis for analyses that aim at discovering conservation of protein_function among different species i e functional orthologs fo orthologs are genes proteins of different species that have descended from the same gene in a common_ancestor the fo are orthologs whose functions are conserved in different species it is often assumed that two proteins with similar sequences or similar structure have similar functions and conversely that functionally_related proteins have similar sequences based on this assumption a number of approaches that use sequence_similarity have been developed e g reciprocal best blast hits rbh for predicting fo this resulted in several orthologs databases such as the clusters_of inparanoid o and orthodb however high_sequence does not necessarily indicate functional_conservation because functional sites of proteins are usually only one or several small parts of the whole sequence two proteins can have a highly_significant overall similarity even though all functional sites are completely different to overcome this problem network_alignment approaches have been proposed that supplement sequence based_algorithms with information from proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks network_alignment approaches can be generally classified into pairwise or multiple and into local or global approaches pairwise approaches align two networks and multiple approaches three and more networks local_alignment approaches detect conserved subnetworks of two pairwise local_alignment or more multiple local_alignment networks these conserved subnetworks are usually independent high_scoring local_regions of the compared networks each implying a putative_functional module such as a protein complex or a metabolic_pathway global_alignment approaches determine an overall alignment between the input networks the resulting alignments can be used to transfer annotation from characterized to uncharacterized_proteins typically pairwise global alignment_algorithms attempt to provide only a one to one node mapping between proteins of compared networks whereas multiple global alignment_algorithms attempt to provide a many to many node mapping a many to many node mapping allows to find a set of functionally_similar proteins that have descended from the same protein in a common_ancestor based on four types of evolutionary_events protein deletion protein duplication protein mutation and paralog mutation for more information on the difference between local and global_alignment see the supplementary_material to whom correspondence should be addressed many pairwise local and pairwise global_alignment tools have been developed in the last decade among pairwise local_alignment tools are pathblast mawish networkblast netaligner pinalog and sipinal a review by sharan et_al extensively discusses some of these methods well known pairwise global_alignment tools are isorank piswap mi_graal natalie and ghost with the increasing availability of ppi_networks the demand for local and global_alignment tools of multiple_networks has risen several multiple_alignment tools have been developed most notably the multiple global_alignment tools graemlin isorank n and smetana and the multiple local alignment_tool networkblast m however these tools have some limitations graemlin requires a training_dataset of known alignments to learn its many network dependent parameters and a phylogenetic_tree which means it can not be applied to species without known alignments or without a phylogenetic_tree networkblast m does not work on networks containing protein nodes with large vertex degree such as the yeast network in our test datasets both isorank n and smetana need a lot of computing time for aligning six or more species thus there is a demand for tools that can deal with many networks in a more efficient way as a remedy for these limitations we present a fast and accurate tool netcoffee which addresses the problem of global_alignment of multiple_networks the algorithm implemented in netcoffee has four main steps i building the ppi_networks and a library of bipartite graphs ii assigning an integrated weight to each edge in the bipartite graphs using a triplet extension approach similar to t coffee iii building a search_space that consists of candidate edges protein pairs and iv simulated_annealing sa with a large number of iterations of a metropolis scheme to maximize a scoring_function for global alignments we ran netcoffee on four datasets consisting of up to six ppi_networks our results show that netcoffee overcomes the limitations of existing algorithms outperforms all existing alignment tools in terms of speed and nevertheless identifies a biologically_meaningful alignment we have proposed a fast and accurate algorithm for global_alignment of multiple_networks it overcomes several limitations of existing_tools by aligning multiple_networks without additional consistency comparison on dataset between netcoffee gray boxes and isorank n white boxes box plots for the semantic_similarity bpscore mfscore and rfunsim of match sets conserved by i f g species with respect to the parameter the horizontal axis training data finding a global_alignment of six species within several minutes and scaling to networks with tens_of of proteins and interactions further it is the first alignment_tool that can run with multiple cores in parallel we rigorously combine protein_sequence and network_topology similarity into a suitable scoring_scheme for multiple_networks adapting a successful technique from multiple_sequence this allows us to model the problem as a combinatorial_optimization which we solve with sa on ppi_networks of five eukaryotic_species such as human mouse fruit_fly nematode and yeast our implementation netcoffee successfully finds a global_alignment covering of the proteins and of the match sets are qualified we compared netcoffee with four existing_tools three of which fail to run on at least one of the three test datasets in our benchmark the results indicate that netcoffee outperforms the state of the art algorithm isorank n in terms of coverage and consistency and at the same time is orders_of compared with networkblast m graemlin and smetana netcoffee not only overcomes their limitations but also retains the quality of alignments in terms of both coverage and consistency this suggests that netcoffee provides substantial improvements to global_network and that the research_community working on function_annotation and phylogenetic_analysis can benefit from it further its application is not restricted to ppi_networks it could also be extended to other types of complex_networks such as scientific collaboration networks scn and world_wide networks wwwn
