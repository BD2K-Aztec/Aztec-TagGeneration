characteristics of pyrosequencing_data enabling realistic simulation with flowsim motivation the commercial launch of pyrosequencing in was a milestone in genome_sequencing in terms of performance and cost throughout the three available releases average read_lengths have increased to base_pairs and are thus approaching read_lengths obtained from traditional_sanger study_design of sequencing_projects would benefit from being able to simulate experiments results we explore raw_data to investigate its characteristics and derive empirical distributions for the flow values generated by pyrosequencing based on our findings we implement flowsim a simulator that generates realistic pyrosequencing data_files of arbitrary size from a given set of input dna_sequences we finally use our simulator to examine the impact of sequence_lengths on the results of concrete whole genome_assemblies and we suggest its use in planning of sequencing_projects benchmarking of assembly methods and other fields during the last few years novel sequencing_technologies have been introduced the platforms that are currently commercially_available are marketed by roche illumina solexa genome_analyzer and applied_biosystems solid and they give new challenges for bioinformatics due to data_volumes short_read and difference in errors and quality compared to traditional_sanger so_far most bioinformatics_methods available have been developed for sanger sequencing_data in this article we characterize the data produced by the system and in particular by its latest_version named gs flx titanium referred to as titanium in the rest of the article we analyze titanium data_sets from genomes for which the sequence has been determined specifically we map each titanium read to the reference and derive empirical distributions for the flowgram data obtained see below this provides an improved basis for analysis and algorithm design e g for base_calling and alignment in this article we present a simulator that generates realistic flowgram data for any chosen dna_sequence the article is structured as follows in the rest of section we briefly_summarize pyrosequencing specialized methods for analyzing pyrosequencing_data operating in flowspace see to whom correspondence should be addressed section and simulations section follows the results obtained from characterizing pyrosequencing_data at the flow level and in section we present the flowsim simulator and some results obtained from comparing simulated_and sets finally in section a discussion is given this study aims to sketch the opportunities that arise from analyzing pyrosequencing raw_data culminating in the use of empirical distributions the empirical distributions give us a very realistic picture of the underlying characteristics of the light_signal values that are later translated into dna_sequences in contrast earlier approaches to modeling flow data have built on parametric i page i i i distributions and the same distributions were used for whole reads without respect to flow or read positions our findings and the empirical distributions are based on large_amounts of data from three different species e coli d labrax gadus morhua four sequencing labs both shotgun and pairedend reads with different gap sizes the empirical flow value distributions are very similar and we have not observed any factors which influence the shape of the distributions apart from the generation thus we have a good reason to believe that the distributions used in flowsim are representative the flow values that result from sequencing exhibit many interesting characteristics and artifacts and we do not address them all here some of these are generation specific some of them have remained_stable over the years and some of them only appear on one certain plate for one certain species or in one lab one known artifact exact or almost exact duplicates has been not only described for metagenomics in the literature but we also observed them in shotgun sequences for e coli and d labrax we do emulate the degradation in empirical flow distributions and we also calculate the corresponding quality_scores in contrast we neglect some of the artifacts that we have observed in the empirical distributions but are not able to interpret properly yet such as for example shifts in peaks that lead to systematic over or under calls jumps neighboring peaks i e subpeaks around the next or preceding integer these are particularly strong for the noise distribution with a neighboring peak around and the distribution with neighboring peaks around and but the values causing these peaks are not many in number analyzing the corresponding data including the related alignments we found that the subpeaks are likely to be caused by real_biological differences this will be explored further in a separate study in this context we also performed a weak smoothing process that helped to reduce subpeaks and jumps furthermore the image_analysis implements a set of quality filters that sets trimming coordinates to identify the high_quality part of each read in addition some reads are eliminated entirely based on quality_metrics although these filters are documented roche applied science the documentation is not sufficient to re implement them and the current version of flowsim does not attempt to simulate them we hope to address this in a future release in conclusion our simulator produces sufficiently realistic files as we model all important phenomena that we have observed furthermore flowsim allows the user to specify many of its parameters making it adaptable to new real or hypothetical generations
