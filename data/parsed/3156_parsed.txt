systems_biology multi omics enrichment_analysis using the genetrail web_service motivation gene_set has revolutionized the interpretation of high_throughput transcrip tomic data nowadays with comprehensive studies that measure multiple omics from the same sample powerful_tools for the integrative_analysis of multi omics_datasets are required results here we present genetrail a web_service allowing the integrated analysis of transcrip tomic mirnomic genomic and proteomic_datasets it offers multiple statistical_tests a large number of predefined reference sets as well as a comprehensive collection of biological categories and enables direct comparisons between the computed results we used genetrail to explore patho genic mechanisms of wilms tumors we not only succeeded in revealing signaling_cascades that may contribute to the malignancy of blastemal subtype tumors but also identified potential bio markers for nephroblastoma with adverse_prognosis the presented use case demonstrates that genetrail is well equipped for the integrative_analysis of comprehensive omics_data and may help to shed light on complex pathogenic_mechanisms in cancer and other diseases availability_and genetrail can be freely accessed under https genetrail bioinf the advent_of analysis technologies during the last decades has revolutionized biology and medicine and has lead to a tremendous increase in the amount of available high_dimensional biological data however technologies like microarrays next_generation or mass_spectrometry are highly_sensitive to changes in the experimental_conditions or protocols giving rise to technological noise that must be carefully accounted for due to the above reasons the development of automated and robust statistical_analysis methods for high_throughput data has become a necessity enrichment_methods are one fundamental class of analysis procedures for the study of pathogenic_mechanisms and the identification of deregulated pathways and categories widely_applied enrichment_methods are over representation analysis ora and gene_set gsea other approaches e g employ straightforward averaging methods that despite their simplicity offer competitive_performance building upon such averaging approaches efron andpresented the maxmean statistics more specialized approaches which complement the generally_applicable methods presented above are e g topgo and go bayes which operate on the gene_ontology go and account for its hierarchical_structure another class of algorithms uses the topology of known biological_networks to improve the computed enrichments examples are ggea and enrichnet due to the popularity of enrichment_methods many implementations are available both as stand alone applications and as web_services some focus on a certain database while others are limited to one or two algorithms examples for available tools are the broad institutes gsea implementation or the gsea snp r package also a wide_variety of web_services for enrichment_analysis exists which we discussed briefly in supplementary note s moreover a comprehensive collection of enrichment tools can be found in the omictools database extensive reviews on enrichment_methods efron and have been published and reveal that no real gold_standard exists this is due to the fact that each of the proposed methods is based on differing definitions of enriched categories differing null_hypotheses making their results incomparable in general instead of using a single magic bullet an appropriate algorithm needs to be chosen carefully for each individual research task finally as heterogenous datasets e g datasets comprised of genomic_variations mirna and mrna_expression measurements are becoming increasingly common integrative platforms for enrichment_analyses are needed unfortunately only few such tools are readily available examples are mirtrail which links mrna mirna and disease phentotypes genevar focusing on the association between snps and eqtls or ramona using a bayesian_model for linking arbitrary omics to ontology_terms in this study we present genetrail a new web_server for the analysis of multi omics_datasets with which we provide one of the most comprehensive tools for enrichment_analysis for human alone it features over categories collected from over databases including kegg reactome go wikipathways drugbank pfam mirwalk and mirdb cf supplementary it natively supports transcriptomics mirnomics proteomics and genomics data and can convert between common identifier types in total we implemented identifier level statistics set level statistics see section two pvalue computation strategies and eight p value adjustment methods data from all major omics are supported making it possible to analyze and explore heterogeneous datasets in an interactive fashion using genetrail s web_interface the web_interface is built on top of modern web technologies with special_attention to usability non expert users can quickly perform comprehensive_analyses using the predefined workflow which is complemented with thorough documentation moreover the interface enables users to integrate enrichments obtained from multiple omics using the integrated mapping procedures and our side_by view for further analysis tasks we offer a deep integration into existing applications like the network visualization_tool bina or the networktrail web_service another key feature of genetrail is its restful api through which power users can script the web_service this scripting interface allows the seamless_integration of genetrail into workflow systems such as galaxy or taverna the backend of genetrail relies on highly optimized c code leading to excellent computation times genetrail can be accessed under https genetrail bioinf uni sb de we demonstrate the capabilities of genetrail by applying it to a wilms_tumor expression dataset with the goal of identifying molecular_determinants for the increased malignancy of certain wilms tumor_subtypes further use cases are discussed on the website
