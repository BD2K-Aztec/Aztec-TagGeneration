data_and improving the efficiency of multidimensional_scaling in the analysis of high_dimensional using singular_value motivation multidimensional_scaling mds is a well known multivariate_statistical method used for dimensionality_reduction and visualization of similarities and dissimilarities in multidimensional data the advantage of mds with respect to singular_value svd based_methods such as principal_component is its superior fidelity in representing the distance between different instances specially for high_dimensional geometric objects here we investigate the importance of the choice of initial_conditions for mds and show that svd is the best choice to initiate mds furthermore we demonstrate that the use of the first principal_components of svd to initiate the mds algorithm is more efficient than an iteration through all the principal_components adding stochasticity to the molecular_dynamics simulations typically used for mds of large_datasets contrary to previous suggestions likewise does not increase accuracy finally we introduce a k nearest_neighbor method to analyze the local structure of the geometric objects and use it to control the quality of the dimensionality_reduction results we demonstrate here the to our knowledge most efficient and accurate initialization strategy for mds algorithms reducing considerably computational load svd based initialization renders mds methodology much more useful in the analysis of high_dimensional such as functional_genomics datasets the appropriate and faithful visualization of high_dimensional is often a prerequisite for their analysis as the human_visual is still one of the most powerful_tools to detect and conceptualize structure in data furthermore communication of numerical and statistical results is greatly aided by the intuition arising from appropriate representations of data different methods to whom correspondence should be addressed for the required dimensionality_reduction have been developed an entire_family of approaches such as principal_component pca finds the minimal orthonormal basis using a mathematical tool called singular_value svd these methods using different similarity or dissimilarity measures such as covariance or correlation order the ensemble of components by their statistical deviation and for visualization only the first two or three components are retained thereby the statistical_information in the first components are entirely retained whereas one of the subsequent components is entirely lost todays highdimensional biological_datasets can easily contain thousands of instances number of measures with variables number of parameters measured the repartition of information is usually homogeneous over the entire number of variables in consequence considering only the first components given by svd based techniques is not necessarily the best choice multidimensional_scaling mds is a methodology that reduces dimensionality using only the information of similarities or dissimilarities between instances hereafter regrouped in the general term of distance the search for an optimal configuration is reduced to finding the global minimum of a function evaluating the loss of distance information to be sure to find an acceptable minima i an initial_state for the optimization_algorithm and ii an optimization_algorithm and the appropriate parameters have to be appropriately chosen recently has shown that the best choice for the second is a molecular_dynamics multidimensional_scaling approach we demonstrate here that the choice of the initial position is paramount to the quality of the representation and its computational_efficiency by using svd for providing an initial configuration for mds we obtain a significantly_increased computational efficacy interestingly we also demonstrate that performing an iterative mds or adding stochastic energy during the molecular_dynamics mds execution do not increase performance or reproducibility of the algorithm we also investigate the local structure of the geometric objects after dimensionality_reduction with our different methodologies and then evaluate the accuracy of the different approaches developed here on biological data these investigations and the use of svd to the initial_state allow to better define anddimensionality reduction of complex high_dimensional is an important problem which becomes ever more complicated due to the increase of data concomitant with an increase in their dimensionality this is particularly true for data from modern genomics analyses where more and more data with thousands of instances each over millions of variables are generated we demonstrate here how a combined molecular_dynamics multidimensional_scaling approach for dimensionality_reduction of high_dimensional can be improved by better defining the initial_conditions we have shown that singular_value is most effective to create an initial condition for mds using links between svd and different standard data analysis methods we demonstrate how our combined svd mds method can be used to improve geometric representation in low dimensional_space that are generally obtained with standard analysis methods pca classical scaling pcca correspondence_analysis we also show that the use of iterative reduction or page stochastic energy does not increase performance of the algorithms in terms of finding a optimal_solution finally we have investigated the local structure deformation induced by dimensionality_reduction and confirmed the superior accuracy of the svdmds overall the methodology_developed here should further advance our capacity to analyze high_dimensional such as the ones produced by functional_genomics approaches
