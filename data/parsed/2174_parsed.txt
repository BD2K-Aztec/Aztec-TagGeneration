heat seq an interactive web_tool for high_throughput sequencing_experiment comparison with public data better protocols and decreasing costs have made high_throughput sequencing_experiments now accessible even to small experimental laboratories however comparing one or few experiments generated by an individual lab to the vast amount of relevant data freely_available in the public_domain might be limited due to lack of bioinformatics expertise though several tools including genome_browsers allow such comparison at a single gene level they do not provide a genome_wide view we developed heatseq a web_tool that allows genome_scale comparison of high_throughput experiments chromatin immuno precipitation followed by sequencing rna_sequencing and cap_analysis provided by a user to the data in the public_domain heatseq currently contains over experiments across diverse tissues and cell_types in human mouse and drosophila heatseq displays interactive correlation heatmaps with an ability to dynamically subset datasets to contextualize user experiments high_quality figures and tables are produced and can be downloaded in multiple formats high_throughput is now becoming routine for many biological_assays including transcriptome_analysis through rnasequencing rna_seq or transcription_factor tf_binding identification through chromatin immuno precipitation followed by sequencing chip_seq additionally collaborative projects such as bgee encode and roadmap epigenomics have generated genome_wide datasets across hundreds of cell_types or tissues despite this large data being freely_available in the public_domain the lack of computational_tools accessible to experimental scientists with no or elementary computational skills prohibits the use of this data to its full potential for discovery though genome_browsers including summary tracks provided by many consortia are extremely useful to study a few genes promoters or single_nucleotide they lack the genome_wide overview only a few public resources such as the codex database s anchez and the blueprint genomestats tool allow a genome_wide comparison with the user data we therefore developed heatseq a free open_source web_application providing fast and interactive comparison against high_throughput sequencing_experiments in the public domainwith heatseq comparing rna_seq chip_seq or cage experiments to hundreds of publicly_available datasets becomes a trivial task researchers can now investigate the relationships betweenvarious high_throughput sequencing_experiments fast and interactively without requiring any programming_skills such analysis can assess data_quality cell variability and generate novel regulatory hypotheses
