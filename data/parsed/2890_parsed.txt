system biology metabolite_identification and molecular_fingerprint prediction through machine_learning motivation metabolite_identification from tandem_mass is an important problem in metabolomics underpinning subsequent metabolic modelling and network_analysis yet currently this task requires matching the observed spectrum against a database of reference spectra originating from similar equipment and closely matching operating_parameters a condition that is rarely satisfied in public_repositories furthermore the computational support for identification of molecules not present in reference_databases is lacking recent efforts in assembling large public mass_spectral databases such as massbank have opened the door for the development of a new genre of metabolite_identification methods results we introduce a novel framework for prediction of molecular_characteristics and identification of metabolites from tandem_mass using machine_learning with the support_vector our approach is to first predict a large set of molecular_properties of the unknown metabolite from salient tandem mass_spectral signals and in the second step to use the predicted properties for matching against large molecule databases such as pubchem we demonstrate that several molecular_properties can be predicted to high_accuracy and that they are useful in de_novo metabolite_identification where the reference_database does not contain any spectra of the same molecule in metabolomics mass_spectrometry ms provides the key measurement technology for quantifying and qualifying chemical_signals to provide biological_knowledge of cellular_processes an ms measurement of a biological_sample results in a set of peaks representing the mass to charge ratios and intensities of the different compounds of the sample identification of these molecules through mass_spectra is a prerequisite for further biological_interpretation and is the most time consuming and laborious step in metabolomics experiments the identification process is still mostly not automatized thus requiring extensive manual_analysis and expert_knowledge some structural_information on a given compound can be obtained by tandem_mass ms_ms through ionization or collision_induced fragmentation experiments tandem mass_spectrum contains peaks representing various fragmentation products of the unknown compound including the difficulty to predict rearrangement reaction_products a compound fragments in specific patterns according to its structure the collision_energy and the experimental configuration elucidation of tandem spectra is at the core of molecular_identification the standard method of performing compound identification is to measure the tandem mass_spectrum of the unknown compound and to query the spectrum against annotated reference libraries of standardized spectra nist massbank wiley registry followed by extensive domain expert analysis in practice the reference_database requires a closely matching type of equipment and operational parameters for reliable matching machine_learning for metabolite_identification from ms_ms data have not been widely_studied early related work includes stirs that uses a nearest_neighbor approach to model the statistical relationships between spectral_features and molecular substructures the neural_network work of and the decision_tree approach by however the impact of these methods has remained dormant perhaps due to predating the era of systems_biology and limited available data in contrast current state of the art methods are based on combinatorial algorithms and database_searches the metfrag software identifies metabolites by matching candidate metabolites with closest combinatorially simulated spectrum to the observed one analysis of isotopic patterns can give additional clues on the metabolites elemental_composition we introduce a novel two step pattern_recognition approach see to the metabolite_identification problem instead of directly learning a mapping between the spectrum and the metabolite we first predict a set of characterizing fingerprints of the metabolite from its tandem mass_spectrum using a kernel based_approach we learn our fingerprint prediction model from a large set of tandem_mass obtained from public mass_spectral database massbank step we match the predicted fingerprints against a large molecular database to obtain a list of candidate metabolites the metabolite_identification model generalizes to metabolites not present in reference spectral databases due to the machine_learning approach data from any type of mass_spectrometer are supported in section we review the basics of mass_spectrometry and the current state of the art of metabolite_identification through reference_databases we introduce three classes of mass spectral_features and a probability product kernel over the spectral_features in section we also discuss the use of multiple measurements from the same metabolite we propose a statistical_approach to retrieve candidate metabolites using the predicted properties in section in section we experiment with the proposed fingerid method in fingerprint prediction and metabolite_identification we conclude this article with discussion in section we presented a novel approach for de_novo metabolite_identification through intermediate fingerprint prediction based on tandem_mass our results indicate that it is possible to learn the statistical_dependencies between tandem mass_spectral signals and molecular_properties which can be used to score and rank metabolites with good identification_performance moreover a sufficiently_large set of fingerprint predictions can give useful clues to the actual metabolite identity to the human expert even if exact automatic identification remains_elusive the machine_learning approach widens the utility of mass_spectral databases such as massbank due to the nature of thethe upper part of the table shows performance of reference queries in general while the lower part indicates the performance when utilizing spectra only from the four different cases section by definition the d case gives no identifications method any type of tandem mass_spectral is applicable this also allows us to handle for example the rearrangement reactions which result in exceptional and difficult to predict fragment products utilizing multiple measurements increases the prediction_accuracies through kernel_based data fusion our method can be easily complemented by inferring additional information about the metabolites such as sum formulas from isotopic patterns or by performing fragmentation analysis in addition to fingerprint prediction further research is obviously necessary to bring the machine_learning based_approach towards a practical tool for metabolomics in de_novo metabolite_identification the identification_performance depends on one hand on the uniqueness of the fingerprints to particular sets of metabolites and on the other hand the ability to predict these fingerprints from tandem_mass it is an interesting future_research direction to develop computational_methods to identify sets of fingerprints that strike a good balance between these two qualities an interesting machine_learning approach for representing the molecular_properties would be to use structured prediction to model the statistical_dependencies between the fingerprints and the input spectrum
