fuse multiple network_alignment via data fusion downloaded from motivation discovering patterns in networks of proteinprotein_interactions ppis is a central problem in systems_biology alignments between these networks aid functional understanding as they uncover important information such as evolutionary_conserved pathways protein_complexes and functional orthologs however the complexity of the multiple network_alignment grows exponentially with the number of networks being aligned and designing a multiple network aligner that is both scalable and that produces biologically_relevant alignments is a challenging_task that has not been fully addressed the objective of multiple network_alignment is to create clusters of nodes that are evolutionarily and functionally conserved across all networks unfortunately the alignment_methods proposed thus far do not meet this objective as they are guided by pairwise scores that do not utilize the entire functional and evolutionary_information across all networks results to overcome this weakness we propose fuse a new multiple network_alignment algorithm that works in two steps first it computes our novel protein functional similarity_scores by fusing information from wiring patterns of all aligned ppi_networks and sequence_similarities between their proteins this is in contrast with the previous tools that are all based on protein similarities in pairs of networks being aligned our comprehensive new protein similarity_scores are computed by non negative matrix tri factorization nmtf method that predicts associations between proteins whose homology from sequences and functioning similarity from wiring patterns are supported by all networks using the five largest and most complete ppi_networks from biogrid we show that nmtf predicts a large number protein pairs that are biologically consistent second to identify clusters of aligned_proteins over all networks fuse uses our novel maximum_weight k partite matching approximation algorithm we compare fuse with the state of the art multiple network aligners and show that i by using only sequence_alignment scores fuse already outperforms other aligners and produces a larger number of biologically consistent clusters that cover all aligned ppi_networks and ii using both sequence_alignments and topological nmtf predicted scores leads to the best multiple network alignments thus far understanding the patterns in molecular_interaction is of foremost importance in systems_biology as it is instrumental to understanding the functioning of the cell a large number of studies focused on understanding the topology of these networks network_alignment started as a pairwise problem given two networks aligning them means finding a node to node mapping called an alignment between the networks that groups together evolutionarily or functionally_related proteins between the networks these methods uncovered valuable information such as evolutionarily_conserved pathways and protein_complexes and functional orthologs finding these allows transfer of information across species such as performing herpes viral experiments in yeast or fly and then applying the insights towards understanding the mechanisms of human_diseases the pairwise network_alignment is computationally_intractable due to np completeness of the underlying sub graph isomorphism problem hence several pairwise network_alignment heuristics have been proposed early methods called local network aligners search for small but highly_conserved subnetworks as such sub networks can be duplicated local network aligners often produce one to many or many to many mappings in which a node from a given network can be mapped to several nodes of the other network while these multiple mappings can indicate gene_duplications they are often biologically implausible hence global network aligners which perform an overall comparison of the input networks and produce one to one mappings between the nodes of the two networks have been introduced seefor the most recent comparison of pairwise network aligners the number of known proteinprotein_interactions increased dramatically over the last decades thanks to the technological_advances in high_throughput interaction detection techniques such as yeast_two and affinity_purification coupled to mass_spectrometry with the availability of ppi_networks of multiple species came the multiple network_alignment where given k networks aligning them means to group together the proteins that are evolutionarily or functionally conserved between the networks similar to pairwise network_alignment multiple network_alignment can be local or global with node mappings one to one or many tomany as the complexity of the problem grows exponentially with the number of networks to be aligned the proposed multiple network_alignment use simple and scalable alignment schemes the pioneering multiple network_alignment algorithm is networkblast which greedily searches for highly_conserved local_regions in the alignment graph constructed from the pairwise protein sequence_similarities graemlin produces local multiple network alignments using a progressive alignment scheme by successively performing pairwise_alignments of the closest network pairs isorank and its successor isorankn are the first multiple network aligners that do not only use pairwise sequence_similarity to guide their alignment processes but they also take into account the topology i e wiring patterns around the two nodes in their corresponding networks to build up global many to many multiple network alignments using a derivative of googles pagerank algorithm smetana also produces global many to many multiple network alignments using both pairwise sequence scores and pairwise topological scores which are derived from a semi_markov random_walk model while netcoffee does not use topological information to build its global one to one alignment it is the first multiple network aligner in which the score for mapping two nodes does not only depend on the scores in pairs of networks but also on their conservation across all ppi_networks being aligned by using a triplet approach similar to the multiple sequence aligner t coffee beams is a fast heuristics that constructs global many to many multiple network alignments from the pairwise sequence_similarities of the nodes by using a backbone seed extraction and merge strategy csrw follows the smetana methodology but uses a context sensitive random_walk model finally nodehandprinting nh produces global many to many multiple network alignments from topological information only by using a progressive alignment heuristic in the aforementioned aligners most of the node mapping scores are local in the sense that they only consider the sequence_similarity or the topological_similarity of the nodes the only exception is netcoffee but its global scores are only based on sequence_similarity and do not take into account the topology of the networks to overcome_these we propose fuse a novel multiple network alignment_method that consists of two parts in the first part we compute novel similarity association scores between proteins by fusing sequence_similarities and network wiring patterns over all proteins in all ppi_networks being aligned our objective is to link together proteins whose homology from their sequence_similarity and functioning similarity from their wiring patterns in ppi_networks are supported by all networks we do this by using nonnegative matrix tri factorization nmtf technique initially used for co clustering heterogeneous data but recently_proposed as a data fusion technique as well nmtf has demonstrated a great_potential in addressing various biological_problems such as drug_induced liver_injuries prediction disease association prediction ppi prediction and gene_function we apply nmtf on the ppi_networks of the five species that have the largest and the most complete sets of ppis in biogrid database on this dataset the fusion process changes the values of sequence_similarities between proteins based on network_topologies so that some of the sequence_similarities that existed before the fusion disappear about in our experiments while a large set of new ones is created by the matrix completion property of nmtf this new set of similar protein pairs is times larger than the set of sequence similar protein pairs due to fusion of sequence_information with network_topology moreover the new set of protein pairs has a higher functional consistency i e shared go terms across the pairs than the set of protein pairs found to be similar by sequence_alignment to control the contribution of topology versus sequence our final functional similarity_score for a pair of proteins is a weighted_sum of their sequence_similarity and their similarity predicted by nmtf based on their wiring and sequence_similarity with proteins in all networks being aligned in the second part of fuse to construct a global one to one multiple network_alignment first we construct an edge weighted k partite graph with the proteins of each of the k ppi_networks being partitions of its node set and the above described functional similarity_scores being edge_weights to construct a multiple network_alignment we find a maximum_weight k partite matching in this graph as finding a maximum_weight k partite matching is np_hard and because nmtf predicts a large number of similarities in the fuses k partite graph we propose a novel k partite matching heuristic_algorithm we evaluate the performance of fuse against other state of the art multiple network aligners and show that fuse produces the largest number of functionally consistent clusters that map proteins over all aligned networks unlike other aligners fuse is able to predict functional_associations between proteins that are not sequence related i e whose sequence_similarity is not significant these associations can contribute to the identification of functionally consistent clusters that cannot be identified by the previous aligners as the previous aligners cannot predict new protein associations that are not sequence_based furthermore these predicted clusters could be used for transfer of annotations across proteins of different species that are not sequence related moreover we show that fuse is scalable and computationally more efficient than all of the previous aligners except smetana but smetanas aligned_proteins are not as functionally consistent as fuses detailed below specifically the data fusion step is the most time consuming in fuse with the time complexity of on where n is the total number of proteins in all ppi_networks being aligned while the alignment step has a smaller time complexity of okn log n kne where k is the number of networks and e is the number of functional_associations similarity_scores between the proteins in them
