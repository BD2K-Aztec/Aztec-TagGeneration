systems_biology functional gene_networks fgnet is an r bioconductor_package that generates gene_networks derived from the results of functional_enrichment fea and annotation clustering the sets of genes enriched with specific biological terms obtained from a fea platform are transformed into a network by establishing links between genes based on common functional_annotations and common clusters the network provides a new view of fea results revealing gene_modules with similar functions and genes that are related to multiple functions in addition to building the functional network fgnet analyses the similarity between the groups of genes and provides a distance heatmap and a bipartite network of functionally overlapping genes the application includes an interface to directly perform fea queries using different external tools david geneterm linker topgo or gage and a graphical_interface to facilitate the use availability_and fgnet is available in bioconductor including a tutorial due to the increasing number of omic studies efficient functional analysis of large lists of genes or proteins is essential to understand the biological_processes in which they are involved functional_enrichment fea is the most popular bioinformatic methodology to obtain significant functional information from sets of cooperating genes fea methods search in biological_databases such as gene_ontology and kegg_pathways among others and use statistical_testing to find biological terms and functional_annotations that are significantly_enriched in a list of genes however in most cases the results of these analyses are very long lists of biological terms associated to genes that are difficult to digest and interpret some tools cluster the fea results like david fac and geneterm linker but their output is provided as large tables and there are not many tools to integrate and visualize these results here we present functional gene_networks fgnet an r bioconductor_package that uses fea results to perform networkbased analyses and visualization the main network is built by establishing links between genes_annotated to similar functional terms in this way fgnet generates and provides a network representing the links and associations between the clusters of genes and enriched terms the network summarizes and facilitates the interpretation of the biological_processes significantly_enriched in the initial list of genes revealing important information such as distance and overlap v c the author published_by
