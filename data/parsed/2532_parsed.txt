data_and interaction based feature_selection and classification for high_dimensional biological data motivation epistasis or genegene_interaction has gained_increasing in studies of complex_diseases its presence as an ubiquitous component of genetic_architecture of common human_diseases has been contemplated however the detection of genegene_interaction is difficult due to combinatorial explosion results we present a novel feature_selection method incorporating variable interaction three gene_expression are analyzed to illustrate our method although it can also be applied to other types of high_dimensional the quality of variables selected is evaluated in two ways first by classification error_rates then by functional_relevance assessed using biological_knowledge we show that the classification error_rates can be significantly_reduced by considering interactions secondly a sizable portion of genes identified by our method for breast_cancer overlaps with those reported in gene to system breast_cancer g sbc database as disease associated and some of them have interesting biological implication in summary interaction based_methods may lead to substantial gain in biological_insights as well as more accurate prediction recent high_throughput biological studies successfully identified thousands of risk_factors associated with common human_diseases most of these studies used single variable method and each variable is analyzed individually the risk_factors so identified account for a small portion of disease heritability nowadays there is a growing_body suggesting genegene_interactions as a possible reason for the missing_heritability recent_reviews of methods for genegene_interaction are given by and the main difficulty in detecting genegene_interaction is typical for many high_dimensional analysis problems only worse with only tens or hundreds of observations available normally one needs to deal with thousands or more genes what is more challenging is that genegene_interaction compels the consideration of variables defined by combining genes which makes the massive number of variables even larger thus feature_selection is particularly crucial for effective data analysis an important and widely_adopted approach to feature_selection is to first assume that the data follow a statistical_model the effects of the explanatory_variables x fx x p g on the response variable y are then estimated by the corresponding coefficients when fitting the data to the model those variables with larger estimated effects are selected for instance assume the data follows a linear_regression modelto improve_the and interpretability of ordinary_least ols lasso of adds an l norm penalty to ols to continuously shrink some coefficients to zero and automatically select a subset of variables the aforesaid approach works well when the number of variables is not very large to detect genegene_interaction however it must include additional_variables defined by products of original variables and thus the number of variables p is exponentially larger than n the number of observations that is p expon for some when p is exponentially larger than n estimating the coefficient vector p accurately is hard this is because the noise_level may be larger than some absolute coefficients j i j and achieving the ideal risk up to the logarithmic factor log p in oracle inequalities may be too large for practical purposes these difficulties are caused by that the approach estimates the effects of all variables simultaneously hence proposed a feature_selection method sure independence screening sis to first screen variables separately using marginal correlation after screening accurate estimation for selected_variables can then be done by using methods well suited for low or moderate dimensional data sis improves substantially the performance of lasso and related methods when variables only have marginal_effects on y however genegene_interaction often comes with module effects that is the effect of some variables can be detected only when considered jointly with other variables of the same module when there is module effect sis is not expected to attain the goal of effective feature_selection to generate useful knowledge on genetic_architecture of complex_diseases where interactions among genetic biological biochemical and environmental_factors work together to produce the response current high_dimensional statistical_methods are facing a few major challenges first to detect the effect of a to whom correspondence should be addressed gene it may be necessary to consider the gene jointly with others in the same functional module such as a pathway secondly the genes may interact with each other in influencing the response thirdly the effect of genes on the response may be highly nonlinear to address these challenges the proposed method extracts different types of information from the data in several stages in the first stage we select variables with high potential to form influential variable modules when combining with other variables in the second stage we generate highly influential variable modules from variables selected in the first stage so that each variable interacts with others in the same module to produce a strong effect on the response y the third stage combines classifiers each constructed from one module to form the classification rule the overarching idea is that since the feature_selection problem involving module interaction and nonlinearity is too complicated to be reduced to one single optimization_problem based on a model equation we break the problem into smaller ones as the nonlinearity interaction and module effects can be adequately accommodated within a smaller problem we then solve each smaller problem and put the solutions together to form the final one our method provides a flexible framework to analyze high_dimensional for classification purposes it is model free and considers variable interaction explicitly which aligns well with the systems oriented biological paradigm lasso related methods were developed for grouped variables comprehensive reviews of feature_selection are available from machine_learning literature and bioinformatics
