detecting genomic indel variants with exact breakpoints in single and paired_end sequencing_data using splazers motivation the reliable_detection of genomic_variation in resequencing data is still a major_challenge especially for variants larger than a few base_pairs sequencing_reads crossing boundaries of structural_variation carry the potential for their identification but are difficult to map results here we present a method for split read_mapping where prefix and suffix match of a read may be interrupted by a longer gap in the read to reference alignment we use this method to accurately detect medium_sized insertions and long deletions with precise breakpoints in genomic resequencing data compared with alternative split mapping methods splazers significantly_improves sensitivity for detecting large indel events especially in variant rich regions our method is robust in the presence of sequencing_errors as well as alignment errors due to genomic mutations divergence and can be used on reads of variable lengths our analysis shows that splazers is a versatile_tool applicable to unanchored or single_end as well as anchored paired_end in addition application of splazers to targeted_resequencing data led to the interesting discovery of a complete possibly functional gene retrocopy variant availability splazers is available from http www seqan de projects splazers next_generation ngs_technologies have had huge impact on the study of molecular_biology ultra high_throughput ngs_technologies provide_excellent means for analyzing rna content of a cell resequencing whole genomes and detecting for example disease_causing or investigating the epigenetic state of a cell there is a long list of biological_applications and accordingly a high_demand for specialized to whom correspondence should be addressed bioinformatics_tools for the analyses due to the tremendous data yield this constitutes a great challenge to computational_biology one of the most fundamental tasks is read_mapping i e determining the origin of the sequenced_reads in a reference_genome all further analysis is based on the mapped_reads e g genomic_variants are identified or transcript_expression is quantified reads containing more than a few variant base_pairs with respect to a reference will be hard to map and sequencing_errors further complicate this task while a large part of human genomic_variation is due to single_nucleotide snps recent_years have shown that insertion_deletion indel variants dramatically contribute to genomic_diversity furthermore they have been linked to many diseases and especially large indels have been shown to have strong structural and functional impact the first high_throughput method for genome_wide detection of large_deletions and duplications was array_comparative acgh where sample and reference dna are competitively hybridized on a probe array given steadily decreasing costs sequencing_approaches are likely to gradually replace acgh methods since they carry the potential to provide base_pair resolution and identify novel insertions while generating less measurement noise sequencing based indel detection methods are based on different strategies often utilizing paired_end or mate_pair sequencing_data one conclusion from the genomes_project so_far is that a comprehensive indel detection method needs to make use of different detection strategies as no strategy alone is sufficient we will briefly introduce the different strategies and point to their strengths_and most prominently strategies based on paired_end or mate_pair data make use of the approximate distance and relative orientation of read_pairs shifts in the mapped distance or changes in relative orientation indicate indel events or also more complex structural_variation examples for popular_methods that address indel detection based on abnormal insert_sizes are pemer breakdancer modil and svdetect a drawback of these read_pair methods is that they require tight insert_size distributions for accurate discovery of small_to indels and for confident localization of breakpoints socalled anchored split read_mapping addresses this shortcoming byfirst we will evaluate our methods ability to accurately identify and locate genomic indel variants in paired_end data comparing splazers with pindel then we will investigate whether our method is also able to accurately detect indels in the simulated single_end datasets comparing results with gsnap and bwa finally we will demonstrate our methods capabilities on real large_scale single_end data from patients providing pcr validation for an especially interesting scenario of predicted indels the availability of various kinds of sequencing_data i e derived from different sequencing_technologies and protocols has fueled the development of various computational_tools for indel identification for reviews see often the overlap of predicted indels between different computational_methods is low indicating that none of the methods is fully comprehensive and a satisfactory solution is yet to be found therefore a comprehensive method is likely to use an integrative approach combining the strengths of different methods the split_read mapping_approach has its strength in the potential to exactly predict indel size and location early next generation technologies yielded very short_read bp where only anchored split mapping was feasible with the mapping search_space greatly_reduced by a confidently mapped paired_end however advances in sequencing_technology have led to singleend reads long enough to reliably_predict long deletions and also medium_sized insertions without anchoring splazers supports both anchored paired_end split mapping as well as unanchored singleend split mapping which is a unique feature among split read_mapping tools by adding unmapped paired_end and treating them as single_end data a significant increase in sensitivity could be demonstrated in our comparisons with pindel which to our knowledge is the most widely used paired_end split_read indel detection method and with state of the art single_end split read_aligners splazers showed highest ppv and highest sensitivity especially in variant rich regions this strength may prove especially page
