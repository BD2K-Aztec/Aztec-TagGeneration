sequence_analysis a probabilistic_framework for aligning paired_end rna_seq motivation the rna_seq paired_end per protocol samples transcript fragments longer than the sequencing capability of todays technology by sequencing just the two ends of each fragment deep sampling of the transcriptome using the per protocol presents the opportunity to reconstruct the unsequenced portion of each transcript fragment using end reads from overlapping pers guided by the expected length of the fragment methods a probabilistic_framework is described to predict the alignment to the genome of all per transcript fragments in a per dataset starting from possible exonic and spliced alignments of all end reads our method constructs potential splicing paths connecting paired ends an expectation_maximization method assigns likelihood values to all splice_junctions and assigns the most probable alignment for each transcript fragment results the method was applied to bp per datasets from cancer_cell mcf and sum per fragment alignment increased the coverage fold compared to the alignment of the end reads alone and increased the accuracy of splice detection the accuracy of the expectation_maximization em_algorithm in the presence of alternative paths in the splice graph was validated by qrtpcr experiments on eight exon_skipping alternative_splicing per fragment alignment with long_range splicing confirmed out of fusion_events identified in the mcf cell_line in an earlier study by maher et_al high_throughput are providing unprecedented visibility into the mrna transcriptome of a cell in cancer alternative_splicing and gene fusion_events are common changes observed in the mrna transcriptome cancer specific splicing_events are promising biomarkers and targets for diagnosis prognosis and treatment purposes recently several computational_methods have been developed to identify splicing_events using rna_seq these methods align rna_seq to the reference_genome rather than to a transcript database to whom correspondence should be addressed making it possible to identify novel splicing_events via gapped_alignment of reads to the genome new protocols and sequencing methods have expanded the length and type of rna_seq enabling more accurate characterization of the splices present in the transcriptome a single_read may constitute consecutive nucleotides of a fragment of an mrna_transcript the paired_end per protocol sequences two ends of a size selected fragment of an mrna_transcript and reports the results as a pair in our experiment for example the expected size of mrna fragments are around bp bp both ends of the fragment are sequenced to at least bp in length this article focuses on predicting the alignment of an entire per fragment starting from the alignments of its end reads and using the alignments of other overlapping per end reads to predict an overall alignment consistent with the expected length of the fragment since a per fragment can be longer than single reads sequenced with todays rna_seq technology achieving such alignments may significantly increase the effective transcriptome coverage longer alignments also decrease alignment ambiguity in regions with genome repeats a unique challenge in per fragment alignment is that the expected distance between the two end reads within the transcript fragment known as mate_pair distance can be very different from distance between the two end reads when aligned to the genome this can happen when the two ends fall in different exons so that their separation in genomic_coordinates includes one or more intervening introns that are not present in the transcript this effect is illustrated as a long tail in the matepair distance distribution when aligned on the genome resolving the discrepancy between the expected mate_pair distance and the paired_end separation on the genome is not trival rna_seq aligners including tophat and splicemap align pers using heuristics when the distance between end alignments is substantially longer than the expected mate_pair distance tophat reports the closest end alignment for a per while splicemap considers pers with ends mapped within bp on the genome while both heuristics have meaningful biological motivations neither method predicts nor validates the per alignment since both approaches discard per alignments that span a very long_interval or cross chromosomes neither of them is capable of finding long_range splicing or gene fusion_events in this article we propose a new probabilistic_framework for aligning rna_seq pers to a reference_genome without relying on transcript databases our goal is to discover both short range splicerna sequencing using the paired_end protocol is a cost efficient way to sample transcript fragments longer than the sequencing
