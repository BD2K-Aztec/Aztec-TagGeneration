genome_analysis seqanswers an open_access community for collaboratively decoding genomes the affordability of high_throughput has created an unprecedented surge in the use of genomic_data in basic translational and clinical research the rapid evolution of sequencing_technology coupled with its broad adoption across biology and medicine necessitates fast collaborative interdisciplinary discussion seqanswers provides a real_time knowledge sharing resource to address this need covering experimental and computational aspects of sequencing and sequence_analysis developers of popular analysis tools are among the active members and peer_reviewed have referenced seqanswers availability the seqanswers community is freely_accessible atthe human_genome represents one of the greatest concerted achievements of the life_sciences this massive global effort jump started the genomics era and enabled more ambitious and collaborative projects such as the cancer_genome cancer_genome research genome_project genomes and human_microbiome the nih hmp working these large population scale studies powered by high_throughput hts technologies have generated massive_amounts of genomic_data with the potential to revolutionize genetics and medicine the translation of these data to actionable medicine however is complicated by the challenges of extracting meaningful_information from hts_data the challenge is not purely computational as bioinformatics is bound by the experimental methods_employed to produce genomic_data a successful experiment minimizes false_positives and depends on to whom correspondence should be addressed the optimization of an entire pipeline from sample_preparation to computational_analysis as hts begins to transform nearly all aspects of biological and medical_science more labs will incorporate the production and analysis of genomic_data into their studies however these experimental and computational_methods are evolving at an incredible pace and it is increasingly challenging for smaller research groups outside of major genome centers to stay current real_time interdisciplinary collaboration helps large genome centers optimize analysis_pipelines and methods and allows smaller groups to exploit them even if they did not have resources to facilitate the initial development the massive_amounts of data and rapid pace of genome technology_development necessitates innovations in scientific communication the current standard for scientific communication between disparate research groups focuses on peer_reviewed research published in traditional scientific_journals these journals have evolved for the internet age especially with the new emphasis on open_access and fast publishing from both new exclusively open_access journals to traditional journals that have created new outlets for open_access publication while scientific_journals will continue to have important roles as curators of research and referees for the peerreview process there is an opportunity for open internet_based platforms to supplement traditional journals by enabling the rapid_exchange of results techniques and data the latter two being crucial for advancing research but notoriously_difficult to access seqanswers was designed to address this need for genomics the community has since developed into a thriving community that offers a wealth of information including discussions that have facilitated the construction of analysis_pipelines and consensus on standards in the genomics community
