genome_analysis mirna mosquito supervised machine_learning are frequently_applied on biological data to learn a regression or classification model whether used for prediction classification or for gaining an understanding on the biological_process that has generated the data larranaga et_al arguably however it is sometimes the case that sophisticated and complicated methods are employed published and advocated as advances without a comparison even against the simplest baseline methods we consider a baseline method as the simplest method that an expert analyst can conceive within a few minutes of consideration of the problem and does not require any engineering or scientific ingenuity or novelty a baseline can take the form of comparing against predicting by the mean of the outcome on a known dataset without use of any special predicting variables or comparing against random guessing because of this lack of comparison the added value of the sophisticated methodsif anyis not quantified it remains_unknown whether the extra effort for implementing or applying it is worth a false perception about the difficulty of the problem may be created we now present an example of the above argument on the problem of identifying the position of mirna mature molecules on their precursor rna_molecules which typically have a hairpin like secondary_structure in the cell the mirna precursor is first cut into a complex of two substring sequences strands with high complementarity called the strand and the strand the complex is called the mirna mirna duplex defined by its four corners denoted as k k k and k corresponding to the strand end strand end strand end and strand end positions respectively fig comparing against the simplest possible method as a baseline in data analysis is an important step of the analysis foregoing this step may result in unnecessary effort and energy spent in code developing publishing and evaluations by future researchers unnecessary use of computationally_expensive methods and a false impression about their benefits and added value they provide in a given task as an example we show that using the mean positions in predicting the four corners of a mirna duplex complex outperforms some state of the art methods and is on par with the rest when trying to predict the exact location of the duplex with zero tolerance
