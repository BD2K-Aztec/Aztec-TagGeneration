predicting relapse prior to transplantation in chronic_myeloid by integrating expert_knowledge and expression data motivation selecting a small number of signature genes for accurate classification of samples is essential for the development of diagnostic_tests however many genes are highly_correlated in gene_expression data and hence many possible sets of genes are potential classifiers because treatment outcomes are poor in advanced chronic_myeloid cml we hypothesized that expression of classifiers of advanced phase cml when detected in early cml chronic_phase cp cml correlates with subsequent poorer therapeutic_outcome results we developed a method that integrates gene_expression data with expert_knowledge and predicted functional_relationships using iterative bayesian_model averaging applying our integrated method to cml we identified small sets of signature genes that are highly_predictive of disease phases and that are more robust and stable than using expression data alone the accuracy of our algorithm was evaluated using cross_validation on the gene_expression data we then tested the hypothesis that gene_sets associated with advanced phase cml would predict relapse after allogeneic_transplantation in independent cp cml cases our gene_signatures of advanced phase cml are predictive of relapse even after adjustment for known risk_factors associated with transplant outcomes the prediction of the diagnostic_category of a tissue_sample from its expression array phenotype given the availability of similar data from tissues in identified categories is known as classification or supervised_learning in the context of gene_expression data the samples are usually the experiments and the classes are usually different types of tissue_samples for example cancer versus non cancer e g different tumor_types e g prognostic outcomes e g van t veer to whom correspondence should be addressed or different stages of disease e g a challenge in predicting the diagnostic_categories using gene_expression data is that the number of genes is usually much greater than the number of tissue_samples available and only a subset of the genes is relevant in distinguishing different classes selection of predictive signature genes for classification is known as variable_selection or feature_selection a wide_variety of algorithms have been proposed in the literature to select predictive signature genes e g a small set of relevant_genes is essential for the development of inexpensive diagnostic_tests different feature_selection can potentially select different relevant_genes different numbers of relevant_genes and lead to different classification_accuracy einreported that gene_selection is heavily influenced by the subset of patients even when the feature_selection method and data_set stayed constant this is mainly due to the fact that many genes have similar correlations with the class_labels and much larger training_sets are needed to generate a robust gene_list the lack of overlap between the genes of different prognostic signatures is well documented e g commented that the discovery of the true gene_signature remains a challenge and emphasized the importance of independent_validation and large_sample another critique of existing feature_selection includes the lack of biological meaning of the signature genes in this article we present a novel approach that integrates expert_knowledge and predicted functional_relationships with gene_expression analysis to derive gene_signatures we aim to select robust signature genes that are both predictive and biologically_relevant to the mechanism underlying the disease of interest our method uses expert_knowledge and predicted functional_relationships to guide our search for signature genes among the many possible genes that are highly_correlated with the class_labels and with each other our method is based on the idea that genes that are functionally_related to a reference gene_set known to be associated with the disease of interest are more likely to be biologically_relevant to this disease shows an overview of our method overview of our method integrating expert_knowledge predicted functional_relationships and microarray_data to derive predictive genes that are biologically_relevant to the disease of interest treated effectively progresses through accelerated phase ap to the acute_leukemia phase of blast_crisis bc a reciprocal_translocation between chromosomes and yields the bcr_abl fusion_protein that is the primary driver of cml disease tyrosine_kinase tkis such as imatinib im dasatinib and nilotinib which target the constitutively_active abl_tyrosine are effective first line therapy for cp cml however tkis are significantly less effective in ap or bc cml where not only bcr_abl dependent but also bcr_abl independent mechanisms are at work quintas allogeneic_hematopoietic hsct is generally reserved for cp patients who are resistant to tki_therapy or patients who have ap or bc cml hsct is associated with survival when performed in cp but outcomes are significantly_worse for advanced_disease in ap and in bc there are no established molecular predictors of transplant outcome in cml thus clinical_measures such as the sokal hasford or european group for blood and marrow_transplantation ebmt risk scores have been used for prognostication the ebmt score has been validated extensively and is used to predict_outcomes prior to hsct the variables that comprise the ebmt score are phase of disease cp ap or bc transplant donor_type related_donor versus unrelated_donor donor_recipient sex combination female donor into male recipient versus all other combinations patient age and interval from diagnosis to transplantation however the ebmt risk_score does not entirely account for the heterogeneity observed in transplant outcomes consequently our goal is to identify molecular prognostic predictors to supplement known clinical risk variables and guide risk adjusted therapy at diagnosis we previously applied a probabilistic_method called iterative bayesian_model averaging ibma to a microarray data_set consisting of patients in different phases of cml and identified a gene_signature that accurately discriminated cp from bc bma is a multivariate method that accounts for the uncertainty in the selection of signature genes by averaging over multiple models i e sets of potentially overlapping predictive genes it yields posterior_probabilities of the predictions and of the inclusion of each gene in the model we extended bma to be applied to high_dimensional gene_expression data and showed that the ibma algorithm identifies small gene_sets with high_prediction we also showed that our gene_signature discriminated cp ap and bc patients and hypothesized a signature associated with progression when detected in cp may predict poorer_outcomes because expression of these genes reflects evidence of more advanced_disease at the molecular level in cp patients in this study we build upon our ibma method and validate this hypothesis in this work we present a novel integrated ibma algorithm that identifies robust and biologically_relevant predictors by integrating prior expert_knowledge predicted functional_relationships and gene_expression data prior expert_knowledge is represented as a set of reference genes that are selected independently of the gene_expression data and consists of genes known to be associated with the disease of interest in the literature see section for details we make use of predicted functional_relationships represented in the fln the fln is an evidenceweighted network i e a weighted undirected graph computed from various functional_genomics data_sources and aimed to represent the functional_associations between human genes related to different diseases and has been used to prioritize_candidate in various diseases the fln represents universal prior_knowledge that can be used in any disease of interest we present a novel method called integrated ibma that incorporates expert_knowledge and predicted functional_relationships into expression analyses to identify genes predictive of cml progression we showed that our method identified signature genes associated with disease_progression with high_prediction we also showed that the signature genes identified by integrated ibma were relatively stable in cross_validation runs compared to genes selected using microarray_data alone we subsequently profiled selected signature gene_sets from independent patient samples using qpcr and showed that our signature genes are predictive of cml phase progression in this independent data_set lastly because therapy response is so dependent on cml phase we hypothesized that advanced phase gene_signatures when detected in cp cml would predict poor response using integrated ibma we derived gene_signatures that were independent molecular predictors
