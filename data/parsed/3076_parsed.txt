databases_and molgenis connect a system for semi_automatic integration of heterogeneous phenotype data with applications in biobanks motivation while the size and number of biobanks patient_registries and other data collections are increasing biomedical_researchers still often need to pool data for statistical_power a task that requires time intensive retrospective integration results to address this challenge we developed molgenis connect a semi_automatic system to find match and pool data from different sources the system shortlists relevant source attributes from thousands of candidates using ontology_based query expansion to overcome variations in terminology then it generates algorithms that transform source attributes to a common target dataschema these include unit conversion categorical value matching and complex conversion patterns e g calculation of bmi in comparison to human_experts molgenis connect was able to auto generate of the algorithms perfectly with an additional needing only minor editing representing a reduction in the human effort and expertise needed to pool data availability_and source_code binaries and documentation are available as open_source under lgplv frombiobanks patient_registries and other human data collections have become an indispensable resource to better understand the epidemiology and biological_mechanisms of disease while these collections have grown to include data from over s of individuals many research_questions still require data from multiple collections to reach sufficient_statistical or to achieve sufficient numbers of subjects having rare_disease characteristics to make data_integration easy all collections would ideally use the same data_collection protocols and questionnaires in practice however biobanks collect different data because of differences in their scientific goals for integration to be valid data must be compared and harmonized before combined analyses are carried_out substantial efforts are now underway to make data inferentially equivalent or harmonized as a basis for pooled_analysis the maelstrom research group has taken the lead in defining protocols for retrospective data_integration https www maelstrom research org within the bioshare project we have re used and refined this protocol to harmonize and integrate variables from biobanks as a basis for pooled_analysis this research_question driven approach consists of three steps defining the target dataschema the list of targeted variables necessary to address the research_questions in a specific study matching biobank schemas to the target dataschema match data elements from participating data_sources biobanks to the variables in the target dataschema generating of extract transform load algorithms define the algorithms that take the matched source data elements as the input and convert these data values to the target dataschema for data_integration we performed a qualitative_evaluation by applying the software in active bioshare bbmri and rd connect harmonization projects and a quantitative evaluation by comparing the auto generated algorithms with the manually_curated algorithms within the bioshare healthy obese project we have introduced and demonstrated the utility of molgenis connect a generic computer system for semi_automatic harmonization and integration of data with focus on human phenotypes in biobanks patient_registries and biomedical_research the system includes a novel method to automatically generate harmonization integration algorithms based on ontological query expansion lexical matching and algorithm template_matching evaluation in bioshare matches showed molgenis connect is able to generate useful matches and algorithms in of the cases while only still needed to be created by completely hand users can use these auto generated algorithms to rapidly design and execute the integration via a user_friendly online web_application the application and source_code are available as open_source via the molgenis software_suite at http github com molgenis molgenis and a demo can be found at http www molgenis org connect
