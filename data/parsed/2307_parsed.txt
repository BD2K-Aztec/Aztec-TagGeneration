structural_bioinformatics identification of subfamily specific sites based on active_sites modeling and clustering motivation current computational_approaches to function prediction are mostly based on protein_sequence classification and transfer of annotation from known proteins to their closest homologous_sequences relying on the orthology concept of function conservation this approach suffers a major weakness annotation reliability depends on global sequence_similarity to known proteins and is poorly efficient for enzyme superfamilies that catalyze different reactions structural_biology offers a different strategy to overcome the problem of annotation by adding information about protein d structures this information can be used to identify amino_acids located in active_sites focusing on detection of functional_polymorphisms residues in an enzyme superfamily structural_genomics programs are providing more and more novel protein_structures at a high_throughput rate however there is still a huge gap between the number of sequences and available structures computational_methods such as homology_modeling provides reliable approaches to bridge this gap and could be a new precise tool to annotate protein functions results here we present active_sites modeling and clustering asmc method a novel unsupervised method to classify sequences using structural_information of protein pockets asmc combines homology_modeling of family_members structural_alignment of modeled active_sites and a subsequent hierarchical conceptual classification comparison of profiles_obtained from computed clusters allows the identification of residues correlated to subfamily function divergence called specificity determining positions asmc method has been validated on a benchmark of pfam families for which previous resolved holo structures were available asmc was also applied to several families containing known protein_structures and comprehensive functional_annotations we will discuss how asmc improves annotation and understanding of protein_families functions by giving some specific illustrative_examples on nucleotidyl cyclases protein_kinases and serine_proteases with the increasing number of genomes and meta genomes sequenced a critical challenge concerns the functional prediction of proteins encoded by novel predicted genes genes and proteins are commonly classified in terms of families subfamilies or superfamilies according to different molecular taxonomy clustering_methods are aimed at identifying functionally_related proteins and defining thresholds to distinguish truly related proteins from homologous_proteins with different functions all these methods rely on the darwinian evolution concept protein_sequences are subjected to random_mutations and selective_pressure adds or causes functional modifications the sequence is hence composed of well conserved positions and others that tolerate mutations insertions_and methods to detect these positions are based on multiple_sequence mseqa analysis using different parameters metrics chemical_properties of residues evolution quantitative information analysis evolutionarybased analysis phylogeny independent methods or combination of properties for a few years new methods have been proposed to include structural_information for enhancing the quality of amino_acids function prediction capra and proposed an evolutionary trace et procedure to predict active_sites and functional interfaces in proteins with known structure in this work we propose asmc a novel methodology for unsupervised classification of protein subfamilies allowing functional and specificity determining positions sdps detection according to sdps are related to fundamental regions that correspond to ligand_binding and protein interaction sites methods developed to detect sdps are based on multiple_sequence and we propose with asmc to improve the detection by using structural_alignments of active sitewhile quantities of sequence and structural data continue to grow only a few methods are using these two kinds of information to annotate proteins at a high_throughput rate our method asmc proposes a new approach to the annotation of enzymes with a high_level of precision indeed prediction of sdps in active_site provides information for understanding protein functions and evolution the main advantage of asmc over existing_methods is the structural_alignment of pockets that provides a high_quality comparison of residues located in the active_site comparison of the method with a multiple_sequence based_methods demonstrated the limitation of using only the sequence_information due to the low quality of sequence_alignments the conceptual clustering step separates the subfamilies and determines the residues responsible for the specificity the methodology has been validated with families of known functions and predicted sdps are well confirmed by experimental_data we identified several applications of patterns proposed by asmc cps and sdps positions outline residues of active_site pockets that are under selective constraint conserved or correlated to subfamily differentiation these residues used as a geometric pattern can be used for screening structure databases to identify new candidates for specific functions asmc can also be used to classify new sequences belonging to families with at least one structure available in order to annotate them into functional subfamilies although we presented results for known protein_families the method can provide valuable insights in the study of families with unknown_functions and can serve as an input to elucidate new enzymatic_activities this is a real challenge as above families of the database of sequences families pfam a are referred to domains of unknown_functions dufs among them about families have at least one structure deposited in pdb asmc can be used by screening and searching for homologous patterns in an active_site profile database associated to an enzymatic_activity another interesting perspective of asmc patterns is the improvement of de_novo function prediction through virtual_screening approaches sdps and cps can be used to improve selection of plausible configurations of substrates in the active_sites by pinpointing important substrate enzyme interactions
