genetics_and inrich interval based enrichment_analysis for genome_wide here we present inrich interval enrichment_analysis a pathway based genome_wide tool that tests for enriched association_signals of predefined gene_sets across independent genomic_intervals inrich has wide applicability fast running time and most importantly robustness to potential genomic biases and confounding_factors such factors including varying gene size and single_nucleotide density linkage_disequilibrium within and between genes and overlapping genes with similar annotations are often not accounted for by existing gene_set enrichment_methods by using a genomic permutation procedure we generate experiment wide empirical significance values corrected for the total number of sets tested implicitly taking overlap of sets into account by simulation we confirm a properly controlled type_i and reasonable power of inrich under diverse parameter_settings as a proof_of we describe the application of inrich on the nhgri gwas catalog availability a standalone c program user_manual and datasets can be freely downloaded from http atgu mgh harvard edu inrich multi_locus approaches often known as pathway or gene_set methods can be used to ask whether sets of single_nucleotide snps often defined by groups of functionally_related are in aggregate more highly associated with a phenotype than expected by chance consideration of the biological_relationships among the top hits in a genomewide association study gwas can provide orthogonal evidence over and above the functionally agnostic analysis of the number statistical_significance and or variance explained of those hits for example that a gwas has three independent snps with p values around at is in itself unremarkable however if the associated regions independently map to three of a small set of functionally_related this will be very unlikely to occur by chance consequently we would likely wish to put more weight to whom correspondence should be addressed on these associations as well as providing additional statistical_evidence to sub threshold association results another use of geneset analysis can be called in silico fine_mapping or prioritizing specific genes in loci that contain multiple genes with equivalent association evidence for example of associated genes within a block of strong linkage_disequilibrium ld we may find that only one shows above chance relatedness to genes that appear in other statistically independent association intervals all other things being equal one would presumably consider that gene as more likely to be causally related compared with the other nine furthermore the identity of the particular enriched_gene may offer insights into disease mechanism and biology although this will be contingent on the gene_sets accuracy comprehensiveness and relevance to the phenotypes underlying biology over the past_few several gene_set methods for gwas have been developed still there clearly exist challenges and limitations to be addressed desirable properties of a gene_set test include the following i robust and so able to calculate experimentwide significance with adjustment for common biases due to gene size ld within and between genes etc ii flexible with application to summary data from different sources such as gwas from imputed data copy_number variant cnv studies targeted_sequencing from tables in manuscripts etc and iii computationally manageable allowing genome_wide analysis in a reasonable time on a single machine here we describe the gene_set tool inrich interval enrichment_analysis that aims to satisfy the above properties inrich takes a set of independent nominally associated genomic_intervals and then tests for the enrichment of predefined gene_sets an interval will typically correspond to a genomic_region of snp association defined by ld from a genome_wide scan although intervals could also represent e g deletion or duplication_events observed in cases regions identified as homozygous bydescent etc
