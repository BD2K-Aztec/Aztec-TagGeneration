databases_and a universal open_source electronic laboratory notebook motivation laboratory notebooks remain crucial to the activities of research_communities with the increase in generation of electronic data within both wet_and analytical laboratories and new technologies providing more efficient means of communication electronic laboratory notebooks eln offer equivalent record_keeping to paper_based laboratory notebooks pln they additionally allow more efficient mechanisms for data_sharing and retrieval which explains the growing number of commercial elns available varying in size and scope but all are increasingly accepted and used by the scientific_community the international agency for research on cancer iarc having already an lims and a biobank management system for respectively laboratory workflows and sample management we have developed a free multidisciplinary eln specifically dedicated to work notes that will be flexible enough to accommodate different types of data availability_and information for installation of our freeware eln with source codes customizations are detailed in supplementary data the requirements for the development of international agency for research on cancer iarc electronic laboratory notebooks eln consisted of integrating all the features existing in the paper_based laboratory notebooks pln together with additional functionalities to enable easy and intuitive navigation and information search capacities upon the notebooks following the definition of the collaborative electronic notebook systems association system to create store retrieve and share fully electronic records in ways that meet all legal regulatory technical and scientific requirements records being collections of information or data associated with an experiment to enable a suitably skilled person to repeat it the specifications included i recording of experimental_data in a flexible way through a common platform suitable for the various research_activities of the institute and at the same time maintaining the rigorous scientific practices required for day to day notekeeping traceability of each single modification all within a highly secure environment ii improving lab efficiency and work productivity by facilitating protocol and data_sharing record_keeping particularly in terms of limiting repetitive tasks iii providing an efficient means by which to search archived material iv being free open_source and web_based requiring no installation of software on users computer and finally v enabling long_term and secure storage in basic electronic format text elns provide significant advantages over plns data can be quickly entered retrieved located shared and are easy to archive and backup data including text images attached documents links an eln can belong to one single person or be shared within and or between research groups when being specific to one common project or one instrument or equipment for example for maintenance follow_up and troubleshooting issues it can be used for proposal developments meetings notes as well as centrally updated manuals or sops we will detail in the following chapters and also in the supplementary_material how we managed to fulfill all the requirements and rules of a pln and the additional features making the eln a far better alternative to pln after months of testing and validation the eln accounts for around regular users notebooks and over pages this exploratory phase having been a complete success the agency has decided to switch from the pln to the eln since st of january as iarcs lims and iarcs biobank management system the iarc eln has been largely adopted and is now intensively used within the agency as it has proven to bring higher quality documentation gain of time for data_recording and retrieving as well as higher security it should also strengthen collaborations and exchanges between researchers within the agency last but not least it demands verylow resources and is scalable whatever the size of the institution or laboratory is cf supplementary_material
