computational_approaches towards understanding human long_non biology long_non lncrnas form the largest class of non protein_coding in the human_genome while a small subset of well characterized lncrnas has demonstrated their significant role in diverse_biological like chromatin_modifications post_transcriptional imprinting etc the functional significance of a vast_majority of them still remains an enigma increasing evidence of the implications of lncrnas in various diseases_including and major developmental_processes has further enhanced the need to gain mechanistic_insights into the lncrna functions here we present a comprehensive_review of the various computational_approaches and tools available for the identification and annotation of long_non we also discuss a conceptual roadmap to systematically explore the functional properties of the lncrnas using computational_approaches non_coding have been one of the major focuses in the field of functional_genomics since the last decade non_coding have been largely classified based on their size into small and long_noncoding the former class of ncrnas encompasses well studied candidates including trnas mirnas pirnas and snornas the latter class of non_coding encompasses a functionally diverse set of transcripts which by definition are transcripts greater than nucleotides in length with no potential to encode for functional proteins of more than amino_acids a large number of transcripts of this class were initially discovered through earlier studies_reporting expressed_sequence ests in human and mouse through the h invitation and fantom consortia this repertoire was significantly expanded in the recent_years benefitting from the availability of technologies to annotate transcriptome at single nucleotide resolutions there are over transcripts from genomic_loci as reported by gencode gencode v for humans which encompass classes of transcripts previously annotated as antisense_transcripts intronic transcripts large intergenic non_coding lincrnas and processed pseudogenes long_non are generally thought to be transcribed by rna_polymerase and largely observed to be capped and poly adenylated though exceptions to this general rule are not uncommon recent_evidence a small subclass of lncrnas could encode for small_peptides and could also be processed to smaller rnas the functional_relevance of these observations has not been explored to great detail the lncrna class also includes transcripts classified by some authors as macrornas and vlincrnas macrornas are long un spliced rnas transcribed from rna_pol and can readily form secondary_structures macrornas such as airn or kcnq ot function mainly in the maintenance of imprinting in normal_tissues vlincrnas or very long intergenic rnas on the other hand represent a subset of human_transcriptome spanning the intergenic genomic space ranging from to kb in size these transcripts have been identified in various tumors and show cell_specific they have also been shown to be associated with pluripotency or the extent of malignancy in some tumours highthroughput techniques have enabled the identification of large number of circular non coding transcripts commonly known as circrnas circrnas are non canonical alternatively_spliced rna_structures in which donor and acceptor_sites are back spliced to form a circular rna product recent_studies have discovered large number of circrnas majority of which have not yet been functionally characterized nevertheless one of the human circrnas cdr as has been shown to harbor binding_sites for mir thus potentially acting as microrna sponge of the lncrna repertoire known till_date only a small subset of lncrnas appear to be evolutionary_conserved lncrna conservation could potentially be dealt in four dimensions viz i primary sequence ii secondary or tertiary_structure iii function and iv conservation in terms of their expression and regulation most of the lncrnas are not conserved at the level of their primary sequence though lncrnas could harbor small stretches of ultra conserved elements which serve as functional_motifs at the structural level lncrnas could have conserved_motifs as in the case of sra lncrna where they act as functional_domains recent analysis from our laboratory show that regions of lncrnas participating in bio molecular_interactions have a paucity of variations in potential functional_domains similar to that of protein coding_exons suggesting a strong_selective operating at these loci the long_non repertoire further encompasses transcripts which have distinct molecular_functions these functional_attributes could be broadly classified as guides decoys signals and scaffolds depending upon the types of molecular_interactions with other biomolecules in the cell namely dna rna proteins or small_molecules these interactions have been shown to result in a wide_spectrum of functional_outcomes ranging from chromosomal inactivation as in the case of xist in x chromosomal inactivation epigenetic_modifications as in the association with polycomb repressor proteins rna_interference as in antisense activity or scaffolding of biomolecules as in the case of peri nuclear bodies this diversity of functional_outcomes is reflected in the myriad ways that lncrnas have been implicated in disease processes long_noncoding are presently implicated in a number of disease processes included cancers developmental_disorders neurological metabolic and immunological disorders it would be noteworthy to mention the distinct functional_roles and molecular dissection of the functional interactions that have been characterized for a small subset of lncrnas the functional_roles of a vast_majority of the lncrnas still remain uncharacterized and elusive the majority of lncrnas annotated in the recent_years have come out of analysis of transcriptome sequencing_datasets and the information on these transcripts have been largely limited to the genomic_loci and expression_patterns in the various conditions studied this gap in the understanding of the functional_roles of lncrnas has largely been due to the non availability of tools to characterize specific biomolecular_interactions on genome_scale and of resources which systematically catalogue these interactions recent_insights into specific molecular_interactions of lncrnas have been obtained from the integration of genome_scale datasets both from our laboratory and from others additional evidence on the potential functional_attributes of lncrnas have also been obtained from methodologies which rely on expression_patterns and guilt by association methods based on correlation of expression_patterns with genes or mutations linked to known phenotypes computational methodologies integrating genome_scale datasets expression_patterns motifs and structure annotations provide immense opportunities towards understanding the functional role of lncrnas in the present review we provide an overview of the computational_resources methodologies and tools available for the identification and functional_annotation of human long_non we also provide a conceptual overview of computational_approaches using genome_scale bio molecular_interactions and expression correlation towards understanding the potential function of lncrnas we also summarize the current status in identifying_functional variations in lncrnas and discuss the major challenges and opportunities
