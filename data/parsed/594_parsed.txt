bioimage_informatics automated annotation of developmental_stages of drosophila_embryos in images containing spatial_patterns of expression motivation drosophila_melanogaster is a major model_organism for investigating the function and interconnection of animal genes in the earliest_stages of embryogenesis today images capturing drosophila gene_expression are being produced at a higher throughput than ever before the analysis of spatial_patterns of gene_expression is most biologically_meaningful when images from a similar time point during development are compared thus the critical first step is to determine the developmental_stage of an embryo this information is also needed to observe and analyze expression changes over developmental time currently developmental_stages time of embryos in images capturing spatial expression pattern are annotated manually which is time and labor_intensive embryos are often designated into stage ranges making the information on developmental time course this makes downstream_analyses inefficient and biological interpretations of similarities and differences in spatial expression_patterns challenging particularly when using automated tools for analyzing expression_patterns of large number of images results here we present a new computational_approach to annotate developmental_stage for drosophila_embryos in the gene_expression images in an analysis of images the new approach shows high_accuracy in predicting the developmental_stage correctly in addition it provides a stage score that enables one to more finely annotate each embryo so that they are divided_into early_and periods of development within standard stage demarcations stage scores for all images containing expression_patterns of the same gene enable a direct way to view expression changes over developmental time for any gene we show that the genomewide expression maps generated using images from embryos in refined stages illuminate global gene activities and changes much better and more refined stage annotations improve our ability to better interpret results when expression pattern matches are discovered between genes availability_and the software_package is availableincreasingly higher throughput bio imaging_technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatiotemporal_patterns of gene_expression which promises to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function and interaction today gene_expression and protein localization_patterns are being captured with unprecedented spatial_resolution in numerous model_organisms for example more than one hundred thousand images of gene_expression from early embryogenesis are available for drosophila_melanogaster fruit_fly these images are a treasure trove for identifying co expressed and coregulated genes and for tracing the changes in a genes expression over time knowledge gained from analyses of these drosophila expression_patterns is widely important because a large_number involved in fruit_fly development are commonly found in animal_kingdom consequently many of the inferences made from studies of fruit_flies have been shown to apply to humans and other species overall research_efforts into the spatial and temporal_characteristics of gene_expression of drosophila have been at the leading_edge of scientific investigations into the fundamental_principles of animal_development the comparative_analysis of gene_expression is most biologically_meaningful when images from a similar time point are compared campos based on morphological landmarks the continuous_process of drosophila embryogenesis is traditionally divided_into a series of stages however the standard practice of manually inspecting images containing spatial_patterns is a ratelimiting step especially when it has to be done for large number to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons

generated in some high_throughput experiments are currently given stage range assignments e g rather than individual stages as the original developmental_stage delineations are based on major morphological events in the fruit_fly development it is in principle possible to distinguish embryos in images at the level of individual stages however previous methods only predict stage ranges and no methods currently exist to provide specific stage annotations for drosophila_embryos furthermore no approach currently exists to annotate developmental_stage for an embryo on a continuous numerical basis which would be more biologically_realistic because development is a continuous_process that is reflected in the output of the high_throughput experiments visually it is possible to scan a set of embryonic expressions and arrange them into a progression of gene_expression which informs us about the change and direction of spatial expression over time this indicates need for a system that has the ability to assign more finely graded stage information that enables one to conduct biological discovery using images with higher_resolution of stage similarity in this article we report one such computational system and show how it enhances visualization and scientific discovery in this article we propose an automated system for the developmental_stage annotation of drosophila embryo gene_expression images a pool of classification_models is constructed using a variety of state of the art sparse learning algorithms based on this model pool we design a voting scheme which not only produces accurate stage annotation but also a stage score for each embryo this stage score can be used to more finely annotate each embryo into early_and periods of developmental_stage we use this system to annotate images lateral view from the flyexpress database and show that the refined stage and sub stage annotations greatly improve our ability to view global gene activities and to interpret matching expression_patterns our current system is designed for size and orientation standardized images in the flyexpress database to extend our system for annotating non standardized images e g disoriented ones will be an interesting future direction three evaluation criteria are used namely the sub stage accuracy acc the stage accuracy acc stage and the plus minus half accuracy
