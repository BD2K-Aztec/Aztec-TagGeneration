sequence_analysis psortb improved protein subcellular_localization prediction with refined localization subcategories and predictive capabilities for all prokaryotes motivation psortb has remained the most precise bacterial protein subcellular_localization scl predictor since it was first made available in however the recall needs to be improved and no accurate scl predictors yet make predictions for archaea nor differentiate important localization subcategories such as proteins targeted to a host_cell or bacterial hyperstructures organelles such improvements should preferably be encompassed in a freely_available web_based predictor that can also be used as a standalone program results we developed psortb version with improved recall higher proteome scale prediction coverage and new refined localization subcategories it is the first scl predictor specifically geared for all prokaryotes including archaea and bacteria with atypical membrane cell_wall topologies it features an improved standalone program with a new batch results delivery system complementing its web_interface we evaluated the most accurate scl predictors using fold_cross plus we performed an independent proteomics_analysis showing that psortb is the most accurate but can benefit from being complemented by proteome analyst predictions availability http www psort org psortb download open_source or use the web_interface computational_prediction of bacterial protein subcellular_localization scl provides a quick and inexpensive means for gaining insight into protein_function verifying experimental_results annotating newly_sequenced bacterial_genomes detecting potential cell_surface secreted drug_targets as well as identifying biomarkers for microbes in recent_years this area of computational research has achieved an impressive level of precision allowing scl prediction_tools to be reliably integrated into automated proteome annotation_pipelines and to complement analyses of high_throughput experiments psortb version the most precise bacterial scl prediction software was introduced in and has been widely used for the scl prediction of individual proteins as well as for whole proteomes it generates prediction results for five major localizations for gram_negative cytoplasmic inner membrane periplasmic outer_membrane and extracellular and four localizations for gram_positive cytoplasmic cytoplasmic_membrane cell_wall and extracellular since then numerous scl prediction_tools have been created for bacteria using a variety of machine_learning cello version uses multilayered support_vector svms slp local predicts scls based on local composition and distance frequencies of amino_acid groups psl makes predictions based on amino_acid coupled with structural_feature conservations and psldoc bases its svm features on gapped di peptides other tools such as gpos ploc and gneg ploc make predictions for bacterial_proteins by clustering swiss_prot proteins with annotated scls based on their go terms and amino_acid using the k nearest_neighbor algorithm some methods such as subcellpredict and hensbc combine multiple classifying algorithms in order to boost the prediction_performance locatep and augur differentiate between different types of membrane_anchored cell_wall anchored and secreted_proteins for gram_positive bacterial proteomes based on the principle that training_datasets could benefit from being genus specific tbpred was developed specifically for the genus of mycobacterium spp even though many bacterial scl prediction_methods have been published most of them focus on optimizing prediction_accuracy maximizing the number of positive predictions on the training_dataset at the expense of producing more false_positive page
