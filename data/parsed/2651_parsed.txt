genome_analysis knime bio a set of custom nodes for the interpretation of next_generation data with knime analysing large_amounts of data generated by next_generation ngs_technologies is difficult for researchers or clinicians without computational skills they are often compelled to delegate this task to computer biologists working with command_line utilities the availability of easy to use tools will become essential with the generalization of ngs in research and diagnosis it will enable investigators to handle much more of the analysis here we describe knime bio a set of custom nodes for the knime the konstanz information miner interactive graphical workbench for the interpretation of large biological_datasets we demonstrate that this tool can be utilized to quickly retrieve previously_published scientific_findings next_generation ngs_technologies have led to an explosion of the amount of data to be analysed as an example a vcf file variant call formata standard specification for storing genomic_variations in a text_file produced by the genomes_project contains about million single_nucleotide snv http tinyurl com all of intersection retrieved making_it to extract relevant_information using spreadsheet programs while computer biologists are used to invoke common command_line toolssuch as perl and rwhen analysing those data through unix pipelines scientific investigators generally lack the technical_skills necessary to handle these tools and need to delegate data manipulation to a third_party scientific workflow and data_integration platforms aim to make those tasks more accessible to those research_scientists these tools are modular environments enabling an easy visual assembly and an interactive execution of an analysis_pipeline typically a directed graph where a node defines a task to be executed on input_data and an edge between two nodes represents a data flow these applications provide an intuitive framework that can be used by to whom correspondence should be addressed during the reviewing process of this article another solution based on knime but focusing on fastq data_files was published by the scientists themselves for building complex analyses they allow data reproducibility and workflows sharing galaxy cyrille and mobyle are three web_based workflow engines that users have to install locally if computational needs on datasets are very large or if absolute security is required alternatively softwares such as the knime workbench or taverna run on the users desktop and can interact with local_resources taverna focuses on web_services and may require a large number of nodes even for a simple task in contrast knime provides the ability to modify the nodes without having to re run the whole analysis we have chosen this latest tool to develop knime bio a set of new nodes mostly dedicated to the filtering and manipulation of vcf files although many standard nodes provided by knime can be used to perform such analysis our nodes add new functionalities some of which are described below in practical terms a computer biologist was close to our users to help them with the construction of a workflow after this short tutorial they were able to quickly play with the interface add some nodes and modify the parameters without any further assistance but the suggestion or the configuration of some specific nodes for example those who require a snippet of java code at the time of writing knime bio contains new nodes we believe knime bio is an efficient interactive tool for ngs_analysis
