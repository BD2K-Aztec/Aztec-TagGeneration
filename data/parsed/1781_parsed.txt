genetics_and fast pairwise ibd_association in genome_wide recently investigators have proposed state of the art identity by descent ibd mapping methods to detect ibd segments between purportedly unrelated_individuals the ibd information can then be used for association testing in genetic_association one approach for this ibd_association strategy is to test for excessive ibd between pairs of cases pairwise method however this approach is inefficient because it requires a large number of permutations moreover a limited number of permutations define a lower_bound for p values which makes fine_mapping of associated regions difficult because in practice a much larger genomic_region is implicated than the region that is actually associated results in this article we introduce a new pairwise method fast pairwise fast pairwise uses importance sampling to improve_efficiency and enable approximation of extremely_small p values fast pairwise method_takes only days to complete a genome_wide scan in the application to the wtccc type_diabetes data fast pairwise successfully fine maps a known human_leukocyte gene that is known to cause the disease identity by descent ibd is a fundamental concept in genetics two individuals are ibd at a locus if they have identical alleles inherited from a common_ancestor investigators have put tremendous efforts to map the ibd segments between purportedly unrelated_individuals the current state of the art methods such as germline and beagle can detect even small several megabases ibd segments shared between individuals one promising application of ibd mapping is to use discovered ibd segments in the association testing investigators usually test single_nucleotide snps for association but snps may not tag low_frequency causal variations well imputation also performs poorly on rare_variants association testing based on the ibd information or ibd_association can complement standard association testing methods there are two categories of ibd_association method the first method is the pairwise method where one compares the ibd rate of case case pairs with the background ibd rate to detect excessive ibd between cases the rationale is that if a rare causal variation has occurred in a relatively recent ancestor cases will likely share an ibd segment containing the causal_variant the second method is the clustering method where one divides individuals into clusters based on the ibd information and then test each cluster for association assuming the cluster tags a rare causal variation in this article we focus on the pairwise method the pairwise method has two computational challenges the first challenge is computational_efficiency in the pairwise method one uses permutation to approximate p values because it is difficult to analytically obtain the asymptotic distribution of the statistic because the p value threshold for genome_wide gwas is necessarily low due to multiple testing one must perform a large number of permutations which can be computationally_demanding the second challenge is fine_mapping after one identifies significant loci it is important to pinpoint the most significant peak within the loci to further follow_up candidate_genes the permutation is limited for this purpose because the smallest p value it can approximate is constrained by the number to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion first two authors should be regarded_as of permutations often resulting in many snps having the same minimal p values in the region in this article we present a new method fast pairwise to overcome the computational challenges of the traditional pairwise method fast pairwise uses importance sampling to improve_efficiency and to enable approximation of extremely_small p value to devise an importance sampling procedure we introduce a new statistic that has two properties it can approximate the pairwise method statistic and it can be conveniently used for designing a sampling procedure we show that the new statistic has a close relationship with the pairwise method statistic through the properties of the graph_representation of ibd fast pairwise is efficient and takes only days to complete a genome_wide scan to demonstrate the utility in fine_mapping we apply our method to the type_diabetes dataset of the wellcome_trust in this dataset the traditional pairwise method can identify a significant region in chromosome but it gives the same minimal p value for a wide region mb including all eight classical human_leukocyte hla genes among these fast pairwise pinpoints hladqb which is known to cause the disease fast pairwise is publicly_available at http genetics cs ucla edu graphibd we have developed a new efficient method for pairwise ibd_association called fast pairwise fast pairwise uses importance sampling and can perform the pairwise method more efficiently than the traditional method based on permutation moreover unlike permutation fast pairwise can approximate extremely_small p values beyond the genome_wide threshold using the wtccc type_diabetes data we show that fastpairwise can successfully pinpoint a gene known to be associated to the disease within the mhc region the true utility of the ibd_association is on finding novel loci where there are potentially multiple rare_variants that cannot be found using single snp tests an important advantage of ibd_association is its wide applicability the analysis can be performed using the same genotype data collected for single snp tests without incurring additional_cost for this reason we feel that many investigators will apply our method to search for these additional loci bearing rare causal_variants what is preventing researchers from applying this approach is an efficient method for ibd_association which we provide in this article we expect that a b c accuracy of importance sampling in simulations using the hapmap encode region we assess the p values of pairwise cn method using both the standard permutation and fast pairwise importance sampling we compare samples of fast pairwise to a b and c permutations the vertical dashed_line denotes the lower_bound of p value that permutation can approximate given the number of permutations the dots along the vertical_line denote the simulations where none of the permutations exceeds the observed statistic and therefore the lower_bound of p value is reported by the permutation_test the triangles in c are the p values that we performed extra permutations our new method will promote the wide use of ibd_association and facilitate further research on the power and utilities of ibd_association
