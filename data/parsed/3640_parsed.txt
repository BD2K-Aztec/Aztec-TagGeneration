systems_biology predicting dynamic signaling_network response under unseen perturbations motivation predicting trajectories of signaling_networks under complex perturbations is one of the most valuable but challenging tasks in systems_biology signaling_networks are involved in most of the biological_pathways and modeling their dynamics has wide_applications including drug_design and treatment outcome_prediction results in this paper we report a novel model for predicting the cell_type time course response of signaling proteins under unseen perturbations this algorithm achieved the top performance in the th dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods dream subchallenge time course prediction in breast_cancer we formulate the trajectory prediction_problem into a standard regularization problem the solution becomes solving this discrete ill posed problem this algorithm includes three steps denoising estimating regression_coefficients and modeling trajectories under unseen perturbations we further validated the accuracy of this method against simulation and experimental_data furthermore this method reduces computational time by magnitudes compared to state of the art methods allowing genome_wide modeling of signaling_pathways and time course trajectories to be carried_out in a practical time availability_and source_code is available atprotein signaling_networks especially those involving phosphoproteins play_a in diverse_cellular and are related to almost all pathways understanding these networks under defined perturbations e g inhibitions or stimulations on certain gene s has wide_applications in many medical_fields especially cancers which are heterogeneous in their genetics experimental methods that quantify the dynamics of the signaling phosphoproteins tend to be expensive and timeconsuming making them unaffordable to be extended to the genome_scale and tested under a large number of perturbations mass_spectrometry based_methods are now the major approach used to quantify dynamic changes in phosphoproteins i e trajectories of these proteins over time they are vitally_important for inferring signaling_networks drug_responses and treatment outcome di knockdown coupled with phosphoproteomics can help determine the causal_relationships between signaling elements however these experiments are labor_intensive and unlikely to be carried_out for a large number of perturbations or a large number of knockdown genes thus computational_modeling becomes vitally_important for predicting time course signaling network_dynamics under unseen situations generally cell_line specific signaling network_dynamics under several known perturbations are observed the observed data are time course data_describing phosphorylation levels of phosphoproteins at different time points and under several different perturbations the task is to predict time course responses if new drugs perturbations come in with the knowledge of their targeted proteins thus given phosphorylation level data e px k t for a group of proteins k in to n sampled at a series of time points under perturbations p p we are interested in the phosphorylation levels e pnew k t for the same group of proteins under a new unobserved perturbation p new for the same time course computationally predicting the response of signaling_networks under unseen perturbations remains_a first current models for reconstructing directional signaling_networks tend to be time consuming preventing them to be applied to the genome_scale the algorithms that are capable of reconstructing directional networks are usually designed to search the prohibitively large space of all possible network_structures through temporal models this basic approach renders the problem to be insolvable at the genome_scale even they are explored using an efficient probabilistic algorithm for example recently_proposed belief_propagation bp based searching method which is three orders_of than previous standard monte_carlo methods used in this field but still requires minutes to solve a network with proteins however the to whom correspondence should be addressed human_genome contains about protein_kinases and an estimated proteins modified by kinases because the time required to reconstruct the network is exponentially_growing with the number of proteins these methods are impossible to be applied to the genome of a typical mammalian_species second the performance of most established algorithms is not satisfactory as quoted from the dream report overall a handful of best performer teams were identified while a majority of teams made predictions that were equivalent to random dream challenges focused on the same topic of the most recent dream signaling_cascade identification and signaling response prediction it is indeed repeatedly observed from community blind assessments that the actual_performance of most submitted algorithms are not far from random guesses thus a more accurate mathematical_model different from what has already been established must be sought last but not least even if these networks can be established at a smaller_scale it is still challenging to use these networks to accurately_predict trajectories for a time course under unseen situations most of the previous endeavors have focused on inferring the network_structures but not predicting its changes over time thus we developed a novel mathematical_model to solve the above challenges in signaling_network modeling we formulate the network_inference problem into a standard form regularization problem and the solution to this discrete ill posed problem was found using truncated singular_value tsvd this new method developed here has four advantages i highly_accurate in the dream subchallenge time course predictions this algorithm was the top performing one when tested on experimental_data it also achieved the top performance in aggregated experimental and in silico results furthermore it was identified as the most consistent performer defined as robustly ranked first when evaluated with a subset of data ii highly computationally_efficient both the network_inference and the trajectory prediction steps of this algorithm take linear time to the number of proteins which allow us to achieve magnitudes of improvement in speed over previous methods making its application to the genome_scale possible iii capable of de_novo prediction this algorithm is capable of inferring network_structures and predicting trajectories without any prior_knowledge of signaling interactions iv able to incorporate unseen perturbations by manipulating the solution to the regularization problem the regression_coefficient matrix the levels of phosphoproteins under unseen perturbations can be predicted this trajectory prediction method is a regression_based method using the first order markov and stationarity assumption it first estimates the regression_coefficients between phosphoproteins and determines the starting phosphorylation levels under unseen perturbation then predicts the trajectory one time point by one time point in the following sections we first demonstrate the accuracy of this algorithm using simulation_data second we evaluate the prediction_accuracy under different assumptions such as different levels of noise and regression_coefficient matrix density third we examine the accuracy of this method on experimental_data in breast_cancer analyzing time course trajectories under unseen perturbations has important application in model biology such as predicting dynamic phosphorylation_networks drug_responses and treatment outcomes however previous_research mainly focused on recovering the relationship between phosphoproteins in this article we describe a novel framework to predict trajectories under unseen perturbations we found that the noise_level and the signaling_network density have noticeable influence on the prediction_accuracy however this model is able to handle all the noise levels and signaling network_structures with a satisfying performance the effectiveness of this model is also validated using experimental_data on a breast_cancer the experimental_validation indicates that the predicting error of this model is at the similar level as the difference between experimental replicates the effectiveness of this model was demonstrated in the th dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods dream https www synapse org wiki syn entity challenge as the best performing and most consistent method judged by rmse see supplementary_materials for more details in the subchallenge time course prediction in this subchallenge
