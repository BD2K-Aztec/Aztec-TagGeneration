genome_analysis oncosnp seq a statistical_approach for the identification of somatic copy_number from next_generation of cancer_genomes recent major cancer_genome studies have used whole_genome to detect various types of genomic_variation however a number of these studies have continued to rely on snp_array information to provide additional results for copy_number and loss_of estimation and assessing tumour purity oncosnp seq is a statistical_model based_approach for inferring copy_number profiles directly from high coverage whole_genome sequencing_data that is able to account for unknown tumour purity and ploidy many cancers are characterized by complex structural_rearrangements involving copy_number cnas and or losses of heterozygosity loh events genetic_abnormalities in specific regions may be related to the aggressiveness of a cancer and be associated with clinical_outcomes oncosnp seq is a statistical_model based_approach for identifying cnas and loh events directly from next_generation data that builds on the oncosnp tool for snp_array analysis the statistical_model used differs from previous methods such as bic seq control freec and apolloh hmmcopy by addressing three major_issues in the analysis of cancer samples i normal_cell ii intra tumour heterogeniety and iii polyploidy within a fully integrated statistical_framework for using both read_depth and allele specific information in highcoverage experiments in the following we describe the statistical_model and its application to a publicly_available normal cancer cell_line dataset simulated mixtures and a heterogeneous cancer oncosnp seq is a tool for automatic_detection of cnas and loh regions using high coverage and above wholegenome sequencing_data high coverage data allows allele specific information to be utilized and in the case of tumour_samples oncosnp seq uses this information to evaluate the level of contamination by normal cells as well as allowing for degrees of intra tumour heterogeneity the formal assessment of the accuracy of this latter capability will need to be ascertained using independent assays e g fish in future_studies for polyploid tumours oncosnp seq provides a probabilistic means of evaluating different ploidy configurations the software is written in matlab and the source codes are freely_available for modification re engineering or incorporation into genomic analysis_pipelines tumour purity estimation and copy_number loh discordance for simulated normal cancer mixtures
