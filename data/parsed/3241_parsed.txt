systems_biology networkprioritizer a versatile_tool for network based prioritization of candidate_disease or other molecules the prioritization of candidate_disease is often based on integrated datasets and their network representation with genes as nodes connected by edges for biological_relationships however the majority of prioritization methods does not allow for a straightforward integration of the users own input_data therefore we developed the cytoscape_plugin networkprioritizer that particularly supports the integrative network based prioritization of candidate_disease or other molecules our versatile software_tool computes a number of important centrality_measures to rank nodes based on their relevance for network_connectivity and provides different methods to aggregate and compare rankings availability networkprioritizer and the online documentation are freely_available www networkprioritizer de an important objective of medical bioinformatics is to elucidate the genetic foundations of human_diseases to this end it is crucial to identify genes that might predispose to or cause specific diseases to rank candidate_genes e g from some genome_wide according to their disease relevance the existing plethora of computational prioritization methods exploits the available biomedical knowledge many methods combine multiple genotypic_and data_sources e g gene_expression protein interactions and overlapping disease characteristics integrated information of biological and molecular relationships and interactions is naturally represented as networks the biological connections between known disease genes and the remaining genes in a network are of particular interest as they can point to new disease genes according to the guilt by association principle the majority of prioritization methods are available only as web_services since these require the upload of the users input_data they do not allow for the analysis of confidential data furthermore most web_services rely on predefined background data for example genewanderer ranks candidate_genes based on their distance to disease genes in a pre defined proteinprotein_interaction genedistiller and endeavour combine multiple data_sources but do not allow the user to include own data additionally the rank_aggregation used by endeavour cannot be modified by the user existing cytoscape plugins for prioritization tasks are also subject to major limitations the plugin ictnet queries only a specific database to construct networks but a straightforward integration of own data is not possible the plugins cytohubba and gpec rank network nodes using their close neighborhood and random_walks in the network respectively however neither one supports multiple rankings or further analysis of the rankings the plugin networkanalyzer and the java_application centibin feature a large set of centrality_measures but they cannot compute the measures for a userdefined set of seed nodes or for weighted networks here we present networkprioritizer a novel cytoscape_plugin for the integrative network based prioritization of candidate_genes or other molecules it comprises two main functionalities first it facilitates the estimation of the relevance of network nodes e g candidate_genes with regard to a set of seed nodes e g known disease genes second our plugin allows for the userguided aggregation and comparison of multiple node rankings derived according to different relevance measures users can supply their own data and tailor the network_analysis as well as the rank_aggregation to their needs
