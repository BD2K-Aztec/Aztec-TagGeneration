inferring boolean network_structure via correlation motivation accurate context specific regulation of gene_expression is essential for all organisms accordingly it is very important to understand the complex relations within cellular gene_regulatory a tool to describe and analyze the behavior of such networks are boolean models the reconstruction of a boolean_network from biological data requires identification of dependencies within the network this task becomes increasingly computationally_demanding with large_amounts of data created by recent high_throughput thus we developed a method that is especially suited for network_structure reconstruction from large_scale data in our approach we took advantage of the fact that a specific transcription_factor often will consistently either activate or inhibit a specific target_gene and this kind of regulatory behavior can be modeled using monotone functions results to detect regulatory dependencies in a network we examined how the expression of different genes correlates to successive network states for this purpose we used pearson_correlation as an elementary correlation measure given a boolean_network containing only monotone boolean functions we prove that the correlation of successive states can identify the dependencies in the network this method not only finds dependencies in randomly created artificial networks to very high percentage but also reconstructed large fractions of both a published escherichia_coli regulatory_network from simulated_data and a yeast_cell network from real microarrayboolean networks were popularized by stuart kauffman as models for genetic_regulatory in this kind of model only two states are discriminated active inactive for each gene the dynamics of the network can then be described by boolean functions this model works with a very small set of parameters and thus represents a very stringent application of occams razor which makes it especially suitable for modeling large genetic_networks to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as nonetheless it is powerful enough to model the structure of network_motifs basic network_components frequently found in gene_regulatory gene_transcription in eukaryotic_cells has to be tightly_regulated to ensure_proper cell function i e according to a particular cellular_context cell_cycle cell_type environmental_conditions developmental_stage a specific subset of genes is expressed while the expression of other genes has to be actively repressed this regulation is generally mediated via certain proteins called transcription_factors that bind to specific sequence_motifs in the promoter_region of a gene and either enhance or inhibit the transcription of this gene reviewed e g in if a promoter_region contains binding_motifs for different transcription_factors these factors can either cooperate in the regulation of a certain target_gene or counteract each other moreover in some cases specific cofactors determine_whether a transcription_factor acts as activator or repressor despite the variety in the modes of transcriptional_regulation most transcriptional_regulators will be either activators or inhibitors of a certain gene in a specific cell_type in this case the activating or repressing effect of a transcription_factor monotonically depends on its cellular concentration in other words an increase in the concentration of an activator will increase but never decrease transcription of its target while an increase in the concentration of a repressor will decrease but never increase transcription of its target this kind of transcriptional_regulation can be modeled mathematically in a very simplistic manner by the use of monotone boolean functions which describe exactly this monotonic relation besides the monotone boolean functions applied in this work there exist further related classes of functions describing such monotonic relations among them are for example nested canalyzing functions single layer perceptrons and multilinear functions gene_expression data can be analyzed and visualized on the basis of correlations identified in the observed expression_patterns of the analyzed genes models from information_theory correlate expression values from two genes directly and predict an interaction between two genes to be present if the correlation_coefficient is exceeding a certain threshold algorithms based on this principle are for example clr or aracne however these correlations generally reflect co expression of genes and can under some restrictions to the underlying_network like e g absence of cyclic dependencies also give information on direct causal relationshipspage for a boolean_network consisting only of monotone boolean functions we showed that pearson_correlation is a fast method to find dependencies in the network this method makes it possible to analyze large_networks that contain nodes with large input degree we could show for both simulated and real microarray_data that our approach could reconstruct large_parts of published regulatory_networks
