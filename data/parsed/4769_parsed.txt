sequence_analysis uchime improves sensitivity and speed of chimera detection motivation chimeric dna_sequences often form during polymerase_chain especially when sequencing single regions e g s rrna or fungal internal_transcribed to assess diversity or compare populations undetected chimeras may be misinterpreted as novel species causing inflated estimates of diversity and spurious inferences of differences between populations detection and removal of chimeras is therefore of critical importance in such experiments results we describe uchime a new program that detects chimeric sequences with two or more segments uchime either uses a database of chimera free sequences or detects chimeras de_novo by exploiting abundance data uchime has better sensitivity than chimeraslayer previously the most sensitive database method especially with short noisy sequences in testing on artificial bacterial_communities with known composition uchime de_novo sensitivity is shown to be comparable to perseus uchime is faster than perseus and faster than chimeraslayer contact robert drive com availability source binaries and data http drive com uchime chimeric sequence identification poses a challenging_problem in algorithm design especially with short_reads where the available evidence is often limited to very small numbers of observed differences uchime achieves a significant_improvement in detection_accuracy over previous methods that use a reference_database and performs comparably to a state of the art de_novo method designed specifically for pyrosequencing despite the fact that uchime was not designed or trained for this particular type of data uchime achieves much faster execution speeds than previous programs our results show that uchime has robust performance when presented with different types of s data and is tolerant of simulated noise suggesting that uchime is likely to perform well page uchimeinput sequences are denoised amplicons and abundances predicted by ampliconnoise these results show that de_novo uchime ucdn with default_parameters obtained by training on sim has similar sensitivities and error_rates to perseusd in reference_database mode ucref using the microbiome utils gold reference_database uchime performance is similar reflecting the fact that many of the s sequences in the communities are found in the gold database n is the number of chimeric sequences and m is the number of segments in the chimera goodseqs and chimeras are the total numbers of biological_sequences and chimeras respectively found using a separate reference_database of s sequences for species in the communities seefor details elapsed time required to execute two implementations of the uchime algorithm compared with chimeraslayer and perseus on the uneven subset of the mock data which has sequences the chimeraslayer reference_database sequences was used for both uchime and chimeraslayer the stand alone uchime program is tested and also an implementation of the same algorithm in the usearch package a single core ghz bit i linux computer with gb ram was used with other types of data e g the fungal its region or reads from novel sequencing_technologies uchime requires either a database with adequate coverage of the phylogenetic diversity in the input_sequences reference mode or an estimate of unique amplicon sequences and their abundances de_novo mode construction of a suitable reference_database and robust estimation of amplicon sequences and their abundances denoising are both challenging problems that are discussed in more detail in the supplementary_material although we regard the experiments reported here as informative for comparing algorithms realism is hard to achieve both in simulations and in mock communities so results may not be predictive of sensitivity and error_rates that would be achieved on experimental_data from environmental_samples the emerging interest in characterizing the effects of members of the rare biosphere in a range of clinical and environmental contexts combined with the rapid decrease in sequencing cost challenges us to improve the efficiency of sequence_analysis so that that computational_cost does not become a limiting_factor uchime meets this challenge for an essential step in many experiments offering a unique combination of accuracy and speed that will be of great value to biologists
