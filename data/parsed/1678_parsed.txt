systems_biology exhaustive database_searching for amino_acid in proteomes motivation amino_acid in proteins can be found by searching tandem_mass acquired in shotgun_proteomics experiments against protein_sequences predicted from genomes traditionally unconstrained searches for amino_acid have been accomplished by using a sequence tagging approach that combines de_novo sequencing with database_searching however this approach is limited by the performance of de_novo sequencing results the sipros algorithm v was developed to perform unconstrained database_searching using high_resolution tandem_mass by exhaustively enumerating all single non isobaric mutations for every residue in a protein database the performance of sipros for amino_acid mutation identification exceeded that of an established sequence tagging algorithm inspect based on benchmarking results from a rhodopseudomonas_palustris proteomics dataset to demonstrate the viability of the algorithm for meta proteomics sipros was used to identify amino_acid in a natural microbial_community in acid_mine availability the sipros algorithm is freely_available atmicrobial communities drive biological_processes in many natural_environments such as the rhizosphere the human_gut and acid_mine amd in recent_years meta proteomics has emerged as a culture independent approach for studying the activities of microbial_communities in their natural_environments generally the proteomes of a community are extracted from field samples of interest and measured using shotgun_proteomics proteins are identified by matching tandem_mass to a protein database using standard database_searching algorithms the protein database is typically compiled from the meta genomic_sequences of the community although this approach can effectively_identify peptides whose sequences are represented in the protein database it is unable to identify peptides with amino_acid which differ slightly to whom correspondence should be addressed from the original sequences in the database characterization of amino_acid in meta proteome samples will not only increase the number of identified peptides and proteins but also capture sequence_polymorphisms of proteins across environmental_samples because a microbial_species in a community is generally comprised of multiple strains and because different strains often have significant sequence_polymorphisms between homologous_proteins identification of amino_acid informs the selection of certain strains or certain variants of a protein under different conditions of an ecosystem identification of amino_acid is of interest for many proteomics_studies the existing_methods can be classified into the following two broad categories i database_searching based_methods this approach was first demonstrated by identification of amino_acid in six variants of isolated human_hemoglobin using the sequest snp algorithm a total of mutations were identified in a breast_tumor proteome by searching mass_spectral against a customized protein database that contained a list of potential mutations inferred from the ncbi single_nucleotide database dbsnp the x tandem algorithm can identify a subset of mutations with positive scores in the pam point accepted mutation substitution matrix from a targeted set of proteins that are identified in an unmodified form by a preceding search because amino_acid can be considered as post translation modifications all standard database_searching algorithms can be used to search for a small number of mutations however because there are non isobaric mutations i e considering mutations to i or l as one mutation for every residue in the protein database all the existing_methods based on database_searching need to constrain their search_space by limiting the number of proteins and or the number of mutations these constraints are necessary to reduce the running time of the search and to maintain a low false_discovery fdr but as a result of these constraints they likely exclude many true amino_acid from consideration ii sequence tagging based_methods sequence_tags predicted by de_novo sequencing algorithms can be used to dramatically narrow down the search_space without using the pre imposed constraints needed for database_searching based_methods example algorithms include gutentag inspect paragon directag and vonode the tagrecon algorithm was developed to leverage sequence_tags to identify amino_acid in proteomic_datasets although much improved in recent_years de_novo sequencing algorithms still trail behind database_searching algorithms in terms of the number of identified spectra and the accuracy of identification the sequence tagging based_algorithms are dependent on obtaining correct sequence_tags from de_novo sequencing in this study we developed a new strategy for amino_acid mutation identification experimentally we acquired high_resolution orbitrap tandem_mass from collision_induced cid for the purpose of amino_acid mutation identification computationally we developed an algorithm sipros v to perform an unconstrained database_search that exhaustively enumerates and scores all single non isobaric mutations for every residue in a protein database the performance of sipros was compared with an established sequence tagging algorithm inspect using an rhodopseudomonas_palustris dataset the new approach was used to identify amino_acid from a natural community in amd previously sipros v was used to determine the stable_isotope enrichment level of partially labeled peptides for proteomic stable_isotope probing
