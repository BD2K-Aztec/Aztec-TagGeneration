accurate viral_population assembly from ultra deep sequencing_data next_generation sequence viruses with ultra deep coverage thus promising to revolutionize our understanding of the underlying diversity of viral_populations while the sequencing_coverage is high enough that even rare viral_variants are sequenced the presence of sequencing_errors makes_it to distinguish between rare_variants and sequencing_errors results in this article we present a method to overcome the limitations of sequencing_technologies and assemble a diverse viral_population that allows for the detection of previously undiscovered rare_variants the proposed method consists of a high_fidelity sequencing protocol and an accurate viral_population assembly method referred to as viral_genome assembler vga the proposed_protocol is able to eliminate sequencing_errors by using individual barcodes attached to the sequencing fragments highly_accurate data in combination with deep coverage allow vga to assemble rare_variants vga uses an expectationmaximization algorithm to estimate abundances of the assembled viral_variants in the population results on both synthetic and real_datasets show that our method is able to accurately assemble an hiv viral_population and detect rare_variants previously undetectable due to sequencing_errors vga outperforms state of the art methods for genome_wide viral assembly furthermore our method is the first viral assembly method that scales to millions of sequencing_reads availability our tool vga is freely_available athuman immunodeficiency virus hiv exhibits_high genomic_diversity within an infected_host which affects many clinically_important phenotypic_traits such as escape from vaccine induced immunity virulence and response to antiviral therapies to accurately characterize an intra host hiv population sequencing_technologies must be sensitive enough to detect and quantify rare_variants next_generation ngs_technologies offer deep coverage of genomic_data in the form of millions of sequencing_reads while the sequencing_coverage is high enough to capture rare_variants the presence of sequencing_errors makes_it to distinguish between rare_variants and sequencing err ors additionally low viral_population variability i e pairs of individual viral_genomes that have small genetic_distance and the presence of individual variants having low_abundance complicates accessing viral diversity and assembling full_length viral_variants the full picture of viral diversity in a population remains undiscovered due to errors produced by sequencing_platforms current_sequencing use different underlying chemistry and offer trade_offs among throughput read_length and cost while the current sequencing_platforms can potentially detect point_mutations error_rates may result in false_positive single_nucleotide snv calls or wrong genome variant sequences computational error_correction techniques are able to partially correct the sequencing_error and provide an opportunity to discover highly_expressed individual viral_genomes but low abundant variants remain undiscovered current methods are not able to differentiate true_biological mutations from sequencing artifacts thus significantly limiting the possibility of a method to assemble the underlying viral_population in this article we propose a method to overcome_these by coupling a high_fidelity sequencing protocol with an accurate method referred to as viral_genome assembler vga to assemble a heterogeneous viral_population high_fidelity sequencing protocol known as safeseqs has been applied to detect rare somatic_mutations but its application on detecting rare viral mutations has been neglected similar to safe seqs we apply a special library_preparation technique that eliminates sequencing_errors during the demultiplexing step the proposed_protocol attaches individual barcode sequences during the library_preparation step for every fragment then amplifies each tagged fragment reads are clustered according to the original fragment based on the attached barcode an error_correction protocol is then applied for every read group resulting in a method that corrects errors inside the group and produces a corrected consensus read highly_accurate data in combination with deep coverage allows for accurate estimation of the underlying diversity of a viral_population importantly the low per base sequencing cost of the illumina_platform makes it realistic to greatly_increase coverage to detect ultra rare_variants our sequencing protocol introduces novel challenges for virus assembly and we develop a novel assembly approach for reconstructing and estimating the frequency of a to whom correspondence should be addressed we have presented vga an accurate method for viral_population assembly from ultra_deep data the proposed algorithm is coupled with a high_fidelity sequencing protocol able to eliminate errors from sequencing_data deep coverage in combination with highly_accurate data allows our method to accurately estimate the underlying diversity of a viral_population in particular it makes possible to distinguish true_biological mutations from sequencing_errors facilitating assembly of rare individual_genomes our method condenses the viral_population into a conflict graph built from aligned_reads to distinguish between viral_variants the conflict graph is colored into a minimal set of colors each color represents individual viral_genomes composed from the set of non conflicting reads an expectationmaximization algorithm was used to estimate relative_abundance frequencies of assembled viral_genomes to our knowledge our method is the first viral assembly method that scales to millions of paired_end sequencing_reads experiments on both real and synthetic hiv datasets generated with various sequencing parameters and distribution assumptions suggest that vga is able to assemble diverse viral_population from millions of paired_end the ability of our method to maintain assembly accuracy makes it suitable for clinical_applications in addition the constant_increase of sequencing_depth offered by high_throughput technologies_provide us with unprecedented_resolution promising to increase number of discovered ultra rare viral_variants in the population
