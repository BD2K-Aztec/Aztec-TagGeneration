tenet topological feature_based target characterization in signalling_networks motivation target characterization for a biochemical_network is a heuristic evaluation process that produces a characterization model that may aid in predicting the suitability of each molecule for drug_targeting these approaches are typically used in drug research to identify novel potential targets using insights from known targets traditional approaches that characterize targets based on their molecular_characteristics and biological_function require extensive experimental study of each protein and are infeasible for evaluating larger_networks with poorly_understood proteins moreover they fail to exploit network connectivity_information which is now available from systems_biology methods adopting a network based_approach by characterizing targets using network_features provides greater insights that complement these traditional_techniques to this end we present tenet target characterization using network_topology a network based_approach that characterizes known targets in signalling_networks using topological_features results tenet first computes a set of topological_features and then leverages a support_vector based_approach to identify predictive topological_features that characterizes known targets a characterization model is generated and it specifies which topological_features are important for discriminating the targets and how these features should be combined to quantify the likelihood of a node being a target we empirically study the performance of tenet from a wide_variety of aspects using several signalling_networks from biomodels with real_world curated outcomes results demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority in comparison to state of the art approaches complex intra_and cellular signalling drives various biological_processes such as growth proliferation and apoptosis within systems in systems_biology these molecular_interactions are typically modelled as signalling_networks that provide a holistic_view of the various interactions between different molecular_players in the system as signalling_networks become an increasingly acceptable way for representing biological_systems various network based computational_techniques have been developed to analyze these networks with the goal ofanswering biological needs such as target characterization and target discovery in this article we focus on the target characterization problem for signalling_networks target characterization identifies characteristics e g topological_features that distinguishes targets i e nodes from other nodes in the network these characteristics can be summarized as models which we refer to as characterization models traditionally targets are characterized based on their molecular_characteristics e g structure and binding_sites of targets and biological_function e g regulation of apoptosis these traditional approaches focus primarily on the target alone and are oblivious to the presence of other interacting molecules in the system however understanding how a target interacts with other molecules in a biological system may provide valuable and holistic insights for superior target characterization for example the degree centrality of a target may be leveraged to assess potential toxicity of targets as high degree nodes tend to be involved in essential proteinprotein_interactions and are potentially_toxic as a result in particular network based target characterization_techniques can exploit such topological_features for superior characterization of targets recently there have been increasing efforts toward devising network based target characterization_techniques these methods focus on using topological_features to characterize targets of protein_protein ppi_networks specifically performed characterization of targets in protein coabundance networks the protein co abundance networks are essentially proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks constructed by identifying highly differentially_regulated proteins from proteomics_data using specific filters using several topological_features such as degree centrality although this study suggests that multiple topological_features can be combined for superior target characterization it did not explore how these topological_features should be combined towards this goal in contrast concluded that bridging centrality is useful in identifying targets in ppi_networks however the complexity and diversity of biological_networks make target characterization using a single_feature challenging as in some networks the chosen feature may perform poorly showed that bridging centrality performs well in the mapk pi k network but not in the glucose_metabolism network proposed the use of machine_learning such as support_vector svm and logistic_regression for characterizing known targets in a manually_curated human ppi_network using topological_features in contrast to their goal was to identify topological characteristics of drug_targets in general instead of for specific diseases however characterizing targets in general assumes that targets of different diseases share similar target characteristics which may not always be true indeed as we shall see in section known targets in signalling_networks tend to be characterized by different sets of topological_features consequently target characterization based on individual disease specific networks may yield better characterization that is specific to the disease a common thread running through the aforementioned target characterization_techniques is their focus on ppi_networks surprisingly similar systematic study in curated signalling_networks has been lacking in the literature compared to signalling_networks ppi_networks may contain many false_positive ppi in the sense that although these proteins can truly physically bind they may never do so inside cells due to different localization or they are not simultaneously expressed furthermore ppi_networks are static that is the edges in ppi_networks are undirected there is neither flow of information nor mass between nodes hence they lack of knowledge of the underlying mechanism i e actual signal flow causing the disease as network quality directly affects the results of network based target characterization the aforementioned limitations of ppi_networks may adversely impact the search for superior characteristics of targets signalling_networks however model the dynamic_interaction of the biological_systems and present an attractive alternative to ppi_networks in our recent work we took the first step to demonstrate how signalling_networks can be effectively leveraged to identify topological_features that are discriminative of targets using the wilcoxon_test however similar to this work does not shed any insight on a predictive_model to combine these features for identifying potential targets in this article we address this limitation by presenting tenet target characterization using network_topology a network based_approach that characterizes known targets in signalling_networks using topological_features specifically we use an svm based_approach to identify the set of topological_features referred to as predictive topological_features that characterizes known targets and to generate a characterization model using these features the model specifies which topological_features are important for discriminating the targets and how these features should be combined to produce a quantitative score that identifies the likelihood of a node being a target in particular tenet uses feature_selection to select predictive topological_features and weighted misclassification cost wmc to handle svm training issues such as noisy labels and imbalanced data our empirical study on four real_world curated signalling_networks demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of tenet
