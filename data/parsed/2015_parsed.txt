genome_analysis genomerunner automating genome exploration motivationgenomes encode the instructions for life and within genomes are many different features with different roles e g genes cpg islands micrornas high_throughput ht technologies have enabled us to experimentally examine whether or not genomic_variations associate with certain conditions e g disease these variations in features of interest foi such as single_nucleotide snps come from various technologies like genome_wide association gwa studies peaks called from chip on chip and chip_seq and other data from deep sequencing_experiments regardless of the type of data each foi has genomic_coordinates that uniquely identify it within the genome to whom correspondence should be addressed tools to prioritize fois usually analyze local genomic_features e g evolutionary_conservation of individual fois and do not consider the set of experimentally_identified fois as a whole functional_interpretation of foi sets is often performed using geneand pathway based tools adopted from microarray_data analysis these tools perform mapping of fois to genes prioritize lists of fois and calculate gene and pathway enrichment statistics they however rely upon a genes role being known and for humans approximately one third of genes have no known function plus as projects like encode are showing there are many non coding_regions of interest in the genome as such were lacking a way to automatically explore the genome and associate our fois with genomic_features beyond well annotated gene regions the idea of automating genome exploration is not new but automated exploration of correlations is complicated by the heterogeneous nature of the ht data versus annotated genomic_features gf types many efforts have been devoted to developing tools for prioritizing individual snps but analysis of what annotated genomic_features other than well annotated gene regions may be associated with foi sets has not received as much attention particularly with regards to data_driven exploration the great tool for example associates genomic_regions with their putative target_genes and calculates gene_ontology statistics but is gene centric whereas genomerunner is designed as a much more general_purpose association tool galaxy has a variety of tools for operating on genomic_intervals and snp prioritization and gengen provides a set of perl scripts for the association of fois with genes transcription_factor micrornas evofold regions and other user provided data but requires programming_skills and data formatting genomerunner differs from these tools in that it annotates snps and regions and automatically searches for any statistically significant_enrichment of fois with multiple gfs as a proof_of of the potential of genomerunner to discover associations we ran an enrichment_analysis of all probes recognizing non_coding on affymetrixs human gene st array genomerunner found them enriched within genes p e but significantly underrepresented in exon regions p e confirming recently published_findings another positive control was validation of the h_k dnase hypersensitive site association p e more examples of genomerunner analyses are shown in supplementary_material genomerunner is designed to scan a large set of genomic_features including non gene regions such as ncrnas and epigenetic_marks in search of correlations with genomic foi the open_ended structure of genomerunner can and will be adapted to be included in the galaxy suite currently human and mouse genome_annotations are available for genomerunner and new organisms will be added in the near future besides automatic correlation of fois with known genomic_features genomerunner will calculate enrichment against either the whole_genome or a user_defined background in summary we provide the scientific_community with a tool for automated exploration of statistically_significant associations between experimental fois and annotated genomic_features
