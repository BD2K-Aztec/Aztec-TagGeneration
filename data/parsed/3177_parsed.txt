genome_analysis multovl fast multiple overlaps of genomic_regions we present the multovl application suite that detects and statistically analyses multiple overlaps of genomic_regions in a fast and efficient manner the package supports the detection of multiple region intersections unions and solitary genomic_regions the significance of actually observed overlaps is estimated by comparing them with empirical null distributions generated by random shuffling of the input regions availability_and source_code are downloadable from http www csf ac at facilities scc tools
