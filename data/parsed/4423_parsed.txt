statistical_modeling of isoform splicing dynamics from rna_seq time series data motivation isoform quantification is an important goal of rna_seq experiments yet it remains problematic for genes with low expression or several isoforms these difficulties may in principle be ameliorated by exploiting correlated experimental_designs such as time series or dosage response experiments time series rna_seq experiments in particular are becoming increasingly popular yet there are no methods that explicitly leverage the experimental_design to improve iso form quantification results here we present diceseq the first isoform quantification_method tailored to correlated rna_seq experiments diceseq explicitly_models the correlations between different rna_seq experiments to aid the quantification of isoforms across experiments numerical_experiments on simulated_datasets show that diceseq yields more accurate results than state of the art methods an advantage that can become considerable at low coverage levels on real_datasets our results show that diceseq provides substantially more reproducible and robust quantifications increasing the correlation of estimates from replicate datasets by up to on genes with low or moderate expression levels bottom third of all genes furthermore diceseq permits to quantify the trade_off between temporal sampling of rna and depth of sequencing frequently an important choice when planning experiments our results have strong implications for the design of rna_seq experiments and offer a novel tool for improved analysis of such datasets availability_and python code is freely_available diceseq sf net in most eukaryotes alternative_splicing is an important posttranscriptional mechanism of regulation of gene_expression and largely increases the diversity of the proteome for example over of human genes have multiple_isoforms several lines of evidence indicate that alternative_splicing plays a vital role in regulating biological_processes and its failure often causes serious diseases the study of splicing has been revolutionized by the advent_of transcriptome_sequencing rna_seq techniques which enable unbiased sampling of the transcriptome and have greatly contributed to uncover novel biological_functions for alternative_splicing more recently rna_seq technologies have been combined with biotin labelling treatment to provide kinetic measurements of rna_transcription and splicing with high_temporal providing invaluable mechanistic_insights in the dynamics of splicing at the current stage of the technology sequenced_reads in rna_seq experiments are much shorter than almost all eukaryotic transcripts thus most reads from an rna_seq experiment cannot be unambiguously aligned to a specific_isoform while in some cases a high_level of coverage may obviate the problems in many cases the number of reads that map to a single isoform is too low when many isoforms are present there may be no unambiguously assigned reads to address this problem several probabilistic methods were proposed to quantify the isoform proportion for example isoem cufflinks miso and bitseq all of these methods introduce latent_variables to model the identity of a read i e which isoform it came from and then reconstruct isoform proportions by maximum_likelihood or by computing a posterior_distribution from the observed read_distribution most of these computational_methods can quantify the isoform proportions accurately in many cases however for all methods isoform quantification at low coverages remains_challenging a natural approach in these cases is to exploit additional information for example exploiting correlations across different experiments arising out of structured experimental_designs such as time series or dosage response experiments time series rna_seq designs in particular are becoming increasingly popular as an effective tool to investigate the dynamics of gene_expression in a range of systems to our knowledge no methods have been proposed that can exploit structured experimental_designs in order to improve isoform estimation this methodological gap also negatively_affects the ability to design effectively experiments for example it is difficult to understand whether resources should be invested in gathering more time points or in sequencing at a deeper level on a more limited number of samples in this article we present a new methodology diceseq dynamic isoform splicing estimator via sequencing_data to jointly estimate the dynamics of isoform proportions from rna_seq experiments with structured experimental_designs diceseq is a bayesian_method based on a mixture_model whose mixing proportions represent isoform ratios as in however diceseq incorporates the correlations induced by the structured design by coupling the isoform proportions in different samples through a latent gaussian_process gp by doing so diceseq effectively transfers information between samples borrowing strength which can aid to identify the isoform proportions our results show that diceseq consistently improves in accuracy and reproducibility over the state of the art this improvement can be very significant for a large fraction of genes on one real_dataset the correlation between estimates from replicate datasets increased by over across one third of the genes as a result of taking temporal_information into account furthermore simulation_studies indicate that diceseq can be an important tool in experimental_design enabling an effective trade_off of resources between sequencing_depth and sample numbers diceseq therefore offers an effective way to maximize information_extraction from complex high_throughput datasets the advent of rna_seq technologies has revolutionized the study of mrna_splicing and provided a powerful stimulus for the development of computational_biology methods recent_years have seen a more wide_spread use of rna_seq technology for the analysis of dynamical biological_processes resulting in a marked_increase of biological studies adopting rna_seq within a time series experimental_design in this article we presented diceseq the first method to jointly estimate the dynamics of the splicing isoform proportions from time series rna_seq a comparison of diceseq to a selection of popular state of the art methods shows that diceseq has excellent accuracy and good computational performance in particular diceseq can effectively pool information across time points to improve isoform quantification at low coverages giving more accurate and confident predictions our analysis also points to the importance of coverage versus temporal sampling trade_offs in designing dynamic rna_seq experiments while our analysis focussed on time series experiments we expect similar considerations to hold for other structured designs such as dose response experiments in this light the use of methods which can capture structural_information such as diceseq may lead to a rethink of biological experimental_designs for a broad class of experiments our application to two diverse biological_datasets shows that diceseq can be an effective tool on real biological_investigations leading to improved_performance and more reproducible results methodologically diceseq builds on a fertile line of research using gps to model transcriptional dynamics gps have been used to study the dynamical behaviour of gene_expression in various contexts from transcriptional_regulation to identifying the time intervals of differential_expression with time series microarray_data more recently aij et_al used a latent gp with negative_binomial observation noise to study the profiles of gene_expression during th cell_differentiation with time course rna_seq to our knowledge this is the first time gps have been proposed within the context of isoform estimation while we believe diceseq offers a valuable new tool for the analysis of dynamic rna_seq it also opens several novel lines of investigation first the gaussian_process prior which is based on a general regression could be extended to more general dynamic splicing modeling e g a first order linear dynamic system for rna_splicing kinetics and an oscillatory system for circadian or cell_cycle studies all of these could be incorporated in a straightforward way as parametric mean functions in a gp framework however it would also be of interest to explicitly_model the noise correlations they induce diceseq could be useful in elucidating rna_processing from biotin labelled rna_seq as attempted e g in de pretis et_al more generally diceseq could provide a flexible bayesian_framework for explaining rna_seq from other observations and aid studies attempting to link splicing with other genetic and epigenetic_factors
