rnaquast a quality assessment_tool for de_novo transcriptome_assemblies ability to generate large rna_seq created a demand for both de_novo and reference based transcriptome assemblers however while many transcriptome assemblers are now available there is still no unified quality assessment_tool for rna_seq assemblies we present rnaquasta tool for evaluating rna_seq assembly_quality and benchmarking transcriptome as semblers using reference_genome and gene database rnaquast calculates various metrics that demonstrate completeness and correctness levels of the assembled transcripts and outputs them in a user_friendly report availability_and rnaquast is implemented in python and is freely_available atnext generation sequencing_technologies have raised a challenging problems of de_novo genome and transcriptome_assembly from short_reads as a result multiple assembly tools were developed in the last decade even though most papers describing novel assembly approaches provide benchmarking of various tools no unified methods for assessing assembly_quality were developed until recently while multiple tools for both reference based and reference free genome_assembly evaluation were developed and later used in various genomic studies no tool have set a standard for assessing quality of transcriptome_assemblies although several studies provided evaluation methods or performed independent benchmarks of rna_seq assemblers in papers describing novel transcriptome_assembly software the resulting transcripts were evaluated using different in house methods therefore making_it to compare the results across various publications we present rnaquasta quality assessment_tool for transcriptome_assemblies which utilizes reference_genome and gene database rnaquast takes assembled transcripts as an input and maps them to the reference_genome using either blat or gmap by comparing the resulting alignments with the gene database rnaquast calculates various statistics and generates a summary report below we describe methods implemented in rnaquast present an example of summary report and compare rnaquast with detonate software in this section we demonstrate assembly quality_metrics calculated by rnaquast and compare them with scores computed by refeval and rsem eval from detonate software_package version to perform the comparison we assembled m musculus rna_seq paired_end library using the following transcriptome assemblers trans abyss idba_tran soapdenovo trans and trinity idbatran and trinity were run with the default_parameters k for idba_tran and k for trinity as for trans abyss and soapdenovo trans we ran both tools using various k_mer lengths and selected the best assemblies for the comparison we used the number of assembled isoforms number of misassemblies and database coverage reported by rnaquast as the main criteria for selecting optimal assemblies we also included contigs produced by spades genome assembler which was run in single_cell mode due to uneven coverage of rna_seq with the default k_mer lengths k although spades was not designed as a transcriptome assembler it turned out to show decent results on rna_seq we included the most important metrics from the reports produced by rnaquast and detonate and presented them in rnaquast was launched with the default_parameters ref eval and rsem eval were run as recommended in the user_manual http deweylab biostat wisc edu detonate vignette html command lines that were used to run all tools are provided in the supplementary_material although there is no direct connection between rnaquast metrics and scores reported by the detonate software seefor the details shows that they mostly have a good correlation to ease the comparison with detonate we also added the number of assembled isoforms since ref eval uses the threshold for calculating contig scores demonstrates that trans abyss assembly has the largest number of assembled isoforms and the highest database per nucleotide coverage and at the same the highest contig recall value on the other hand trans abyss has the largest fraction of unaligned and unannotated transcripts which correlates with the lowest contig precision reported by ref eval idba_tran assembly conversely has the highest fraction of matched transcripts and respectively but the lowest database coverage which correlates with the highest contig and nucleotide precision and rather low contig nucleotide and k_mer recall values soapdenovo trans generates an accurate assembly in terms of number of misassemblies mismatch rate and nucleotide precision but its assembly appears to be rather fragmented almost of transcripts are shorter than bp the smallest_number of assembled isoforms similarly trans abyss assembly also contains a lot of short sequencesabout of assembled transcripts are shorter than bp trinity and surprisingly spades have relatively high database coverage and recall metrics and the same time assemble the largest number of assembled isoforms however both tools generate rather high number of misassembled contigs with spades having approximately twice more misassemblies than trinity elevated number of misassembled contigs in spades assembly can be explained by the fact that spades is a genome assembler and has no specific algorithm for detecting transcripts in the de_bruijn during assembly
