thermodynamics of rna_structures by wang landau sampling motivation thermodynamics based dynamic_programming rna_secondary algorithms have been of immense importance in molecular_biology where applications range from the detection of novel selenoproteins using expressed_sequence est data to the determination of microrna genes and their targets dynamic_programming have been developed to compute the minimum_free secondary_structure and partition_function of a given rna_sequence the minimum_free and partition_function for the hybridization of two rna_molecules etc however the applicability of dynamic_programming methods depends on disallowing certain types of interactions pseudoknots zigzags etc as their inclusion renders structure_prediction an nondeterministic polynomial time np complete problem nevertheless such interactions have been observed in x_ray structures results a non boltzmannian monte_carlo algorithm was designed by wang and landau to estimate the density of states for complex systems such as the ising_model that exhibit a phase_transition in this article we apply the wang landau wl method to compute the density of states for secondary_structures of a given rna_sequence and for hybridizations of two rna_sequences our method is shown to be much faster than existent software such as rnasubopt from density of states we compute the partition_function over all secondary_structures and over all pseudoknot free hybridizations the advantage of the wl method is that by adding a function to evaluate the free_energy of arbitary pseudoknotted structures and of arbitrary hybridizations we can estimate thermodynamic_parameters for situations known to be np complete this extension to pseudoknots will be made in the sequel to this article in contrast the current article_describes the wl algorithm applied to pseudoknot free secondary_structures and hybridizations availability the wl rna_hybridization web_server is under construction atrna is an important biomolecule now known to play both an information carrying role as well as a catalytic role indeed the genomic_information of retroviruses such as the hepatitis c and human_immunodeficiency is encoded by rna rather than dna while the peptidyl transferase reaction arguably the most important enzymatic_reaction responsible for life is catalyzed not by a protein but rather by rna it has recently_emerged that rna plays a wide_range of previously_unsuspected roles in many biological_processes including retranslation of the to whom correspondence should be addressed genetic_code selenocysteine insertion ribosomal frameshift transcriptional and translational gene_regulation temperaturesensitive conformational switches chemical_modification of specific nucleotides in the ribosome regulation of alternative_splicing etc a secondary_structure for a given rna nucleotide_sequence a a n is a set s of base_pairs i j such that a i a j forms either a watsoncrick or gu wobble base_pair and such that there are no base triples or pseudoknots in s for example the secondary_structure of y rna with embl access code aapy is displayed inand b whileand d depicts the pseudoknotted structure of the gag pro ribosomal frameshift site of mouse_mammary in conventional dot bracket notation this latter structure is given as follows where it should be noted that two kinds of bracket are needed due to the pseudoknot aaaaaacuuguaaaggggcaguccccuagccccgcucaaaagggggaug it is computationally_intractable to compute the minimum freeenergy tertiary_structure of rna indeed determining the optimal pseudoknotted structure is nondeterministic polynomial time np complete lyngso and pedersen in contrast by disallowing pseudoknots secondary_structure is algorithmically tractable there are dynamic_programming to compute the minimum_free for a single rna_molecule as well as for the hybridization of two or more rna_molecules in particular such methods can be loosely grouped into two types of algorithm those that use i a stochastic context free grammar to compute a covariation model and ii free_energy parameters obtained from uv_absorbance optical melting experiments in order to determine the minimum_free i e thermodynamic based_algorithms examples of stochastic_context are the programs infernal and pfold examples of thermodynamics based_algorithms are the programs mfold unafold rnafold rnastructure thermodynamics based_algorithms for hybridization of two structures are given in unafold rnacofold while the nupack software considers hybridization of three or more rna_molecules pseudoknot free secondary_structure of y rna with embl access code aapy depicted in a in feynman circular form and in panel b in classical form c and d pseudoknotted structure for the gag pro ribosomal frameshift site of mouse_mammary depicted in c in feynman circular form and in d in classical form images produced with sofware jviz from structures taken respectively from rfam and pseudobase thedisplays the run time of the wl method compared with that of rnasubopt from the vienna rna package while theof the same figure shows sample output from our wl program clearly shows the advantage of wl over existent methods in computing the density of states for both single rna_molecules and for hybridization complexes of two rna_molecules and b depicts the heat_capacity computed by the wl method and the program unafold melting_temperature which is usually defined as the temperature at which half of the molecules are single_stranded while the other half are hybridized is determined as that temperature where heat_capacity achieves its maximum the program unafold does not allow any intramolecular structure base_pairing between nt of the same structure a feature that our wl method_permits as does the rnacofold program while it is clear that additional work must be done to improve heat_capacity computation with the wl method the melting_temperature t m computed by wl agrees reasonably well i in computing density of states since the program ofis no longer publicly_available and is superceded by rnasubopt private correspondence from hofacker we computed the execution time in seconds as a function of logn where n is rna_sequence size horizontal green line is slightly above the value of exp seconds or equivalently a day it appears that for sequences of length nt the wl method is more efficient than rnasubopt b sample output of wl method on sequence cugcuuugaggacaaagagaauaaagacuucauguu after wl monte_carlo steps where the value of in line ofis defined to be the leftmost column contains the energy bin the middle column contains the relative frequency in the wl sampling run and the rightmost column contains the lowest energy secondary_structure in the associated energy bin though our wl program allows the user to modify bin size the default energy bin size here is kcal_mol empty bins where no structure has yet been sampled are not displayed the lowest energy structure sampled by the wl method iswith that computed by o n methods unafold rnacofold and the recent o n method ofeach of which methods admits slightly different interactions we now describe how to approximately compute the partition_function z t over all secondary_structures and over all pseudoknotfree hybridizations simultaneously over all temperatures from bullet c to bullet c by performing two wl computations followed by a computation of the convolution of enthalpy relative frequency with free_energy relative frequency similar computations using existent methods require over cubic time computations bullet compute the relative_density of states p h for free_energy using wl with temperature t bullet c absolute zero kelvin it follows that p h is the relative_density of states for enthalpy due to the fundamental thermodynamic relationin this article we have implemented the wl algorithm to compute the relative_density of states for rna_secondary and hybridizations separately computing the number of structures and hybridizations we obtain the absolute density of states which then yields the partition_function and thence in the case of hybridization the melting_temperature the wl method is much faster than existent software rnasubopt in computing the density of states but could not be benchmarked with the binning method ofwhich runs in o m n time for length n sequence and m energy bins since the latter software is no longer available being superceded by rnasubopt d in preliminary tests we obtain roughly the same melting_temperature for duplex rna as that computed by existent methods however the real advantage of the wl method is that there is no restriction on types of allowed interaction unlike the situation with dynamic_programming approaches that disallow pseudoknots zig zags etc
