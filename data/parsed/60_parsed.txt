genome_analysis accusa accurate snp_calling on draft_genomes next_generation facilitate genome_wide analysis of several biological_processes we are interested in whole_genome genotyping to our knowledge none of the existing single_nucleotide snp callers consider the quality of the reference_genome which is not necessary for high_quality assemblies of well studied model_organisms however most genome_projects will remain in draft status with little to no genome_assembly improvement due to time and financial_constraints here we present a simple yet elegant solution accusa that considers both the read qualities as well as the reference_genomes quality using a bayesian_framework we demonstrate that accusa is as good as the current snp_calling software in detecting true snps more importantly accusa does not call spurious snps which originate from a poor reference_sequence
