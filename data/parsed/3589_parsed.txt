structural_bioinformatics pli a web_based for the comparison of protein_ligand observed on pdb structures motivation a large fraction of the entries contained in the protein_data describe proteins in complex with low_molecular molecules such as physiological compounds or synthetic_drugs in many cases the same molecule is found in distinct protein_ligand there is an increasing interest in medicinal_chemistry in comparing protein binding_sites to get insight on interactions that modulate the binding_specificity as this structural_information can be correlated with other experimental_data of biochemical or physiological nature and may help in rational_drug results the web_service protein ligand_interaction presented here provides a tool to analyse and compare the binding_pockets of hom ologous proteins in complex with a selected ligand the information is deduced from protein_ligand present in the protein_data and stored in the underlying database about one fourth of the entries deposited with the protein_data pdb represent proteins in complex with small_molecules not including common salts and compounds commonly used in molecular and structural_biology the number of these ligands in the pdb referred to as heterogeneous compounds is currently binding_specificity is achieved by the formation of a network of interactions between the protein and the ligand which depends on the shape and on the physicochemical nature of the amino_acids forming the binding_pocket as well as on structure flexibility of both ligand and protein in particular of the ligands present in the pdb are found in complex with distinct proteins the proteins involved may either share homology with each other or belong to distinct families in the first case it is possible to establish a relationship of structural equivalence among the amino_acids forming the binding_pockets this allows to analyse the residuedrug design and lead_optimization often rely on information obtained by structural_biology methods this information may integrate that obtained with other approaches such as those used to generate pharmacophore models e g in spite of the abundant and rapidly_growing structural_information in the pdb describing the interaction of ligands with distinct target_proteins there is a substantial lack of tools for the comparison of the binding_pockets of homologous_proteins not requiring the use of programs of structural superposition and significant expertise in the field of structural_biology furthermore the structural superposition and comparison becomes rapidly time consuming if the number of homologous protein_ligand exceeds four the pli web_service provides and aids to carry out this comparison see
