genetics_and post_hoc power estimation in large_scale multiple testing problems background the statistical_power or multiple type_ii error_rate in large_scale multiple testing problems as for example in gene_expression microarray_experiments depends on typically unknown_parameters and is therefore difficult to assess a priori however it has been suggested to estimate the multiple type_ii error_rate post_hoc based on the observed data methods we consider a class of post_hoc estimators that are functions of the estimated proportion of true null_hypotheses among all hypotheses numerous estimators for this proportion have been proposed and we investigate the statistical_properties of the derived multiple type_ii error_rate estimators in an extensive simulation_study results the performance of the estimators in terms of the mean squared error depends sensitively on the distributional scenario estimators based on empirical distributions of the null_hypotheses are superior in the presence of strongly correlated test_statistics availability r code to compute all considered estimators based on p values and supplementary_material is available on the authors web pagein genomic and proteomic research thousands of hypotheses are tested_simultaneously numerous procedures have been proposed to control multiple type_i e g the false_discovery fdr or the family_wise the multiple type_ii error_rate or the statistical_power in contrast have received less attention so_far the power of a multiple testing procedure can be defined in several ways for example one can consider the probability to reject at least one alternative hypothesis or the probability to reject all alternative_hypotheses we consider an intermediate approach the average_power defined as the arithmetic mean of the elementary power values of all alternative_hypotheses the average_power can be interpreted as the expectation of the proportion of rejected alternative_hypotheses among all alternative_hypotheses and corresponds to the so_called false_negative to whom correspondence should be addressed rate fnr e g the fnr is defined as the expectation of the false_negative proportion fnp the proportion of retained true alternative_hypotheses among all true alternative_hypotheses and is related to the average_power by average_power fnr the fnr depends on a number of parameters as the sample_size the effect_sizes and the proportion of true null_hypotheses among all hypotheses therefore the fnr of an experiment is unknown a priori and can only be guessed based on preliminary assumptions however if data have already been observed the fnr can be estimated based on the observed test_statistics this concept of post_hoc power analysis has been criticized for the case of a single hypothesis_test e g where the post_hoc power is just a function of a single p value however in experiments with a large number of hypotheses one can utilize the empirical distribution of the test_statistics to estimate the fnr under suitable assumptions e g if the elementary test_statistics are sufficiently independent the fnr is asymptotically equivalent to the fnp such that an estimator for the fnr can also be used to estimate the fnp an essential element in the estimation of the fnr is the estimation of the proportion of true null_hypotheses among all null_hypotheses denoted by numerous estimators for have been proposed in the literature and we assess their performance in the estimation of the fnr the fnr is a measure for the fraction of undetected alternative_hypotheses and is therefore a crucial parameter to interpret negative findings in experiments where a large number of hypotheses is investigated in addition in large_scale multiple testing problems fnr estimates can be used to define stopping_rules for sequential testing for example one could continue sampling until the estimated fnr falls below a prespecified threshold as shown inunder suitable assumptions such sequential testing asymptotically does not inflate the fdr if the sample_size is increased for all hypotheses simultaneously and only the test at the final interim_analysis determines which hypotheses are rejected the nomenclature for the fnr is not consistent in literature we label the expected proportion of retained true alternatives under all alternatives fnr according toand norris and kahn label this quantity fraction of genes not selected craiu and sun non discovery rate additionally the term fnr has also been used to denote the proportion of false_negatives among all retained hypotheses a quantity that has also been labeled e g false non discovery rate fndr in section we introduce a family of estimators of the fnr that depend on the data only through the number of
