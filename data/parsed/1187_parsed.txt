count evolutionary_analysis of phylogenetic profiles with parsimony and likelihood count is a software_package for the analysis of numerical profiles on a phylogeny it is primarily designed to deal with profiles derived from the phyletic distribution of homologous gene_families but is suited to study any other integer valued evolutionary characters count performs ancestral reconstruction and infers family and lineage_specific characteristics along the evolutionary tree it implements popular methods_employed in gene content analysis such as dollo and wagner parsimony propensity for gene loss as well as probabilistic methods involving a phylogenetic birth and death model availability count is available as a stand alone java_application as well as an application bundle for macos x at the web sitesome aspects of genome_evolution are best captured by integer quantities given a phylogeny with terminal taxa x such a quantity forms a numerical profile which extends the so_called phylogenetic profile of presenceabsence x in a typical application denotes the number of genes in genome x x for a certain homolog gene_family a homolog family comprises all descendants of the same ancestral gene in evolutionary lineages such families are routinely identified by pairwise sequence_comparisons coupled with the clustering of postulated homolog pairs in other interesting examples might be the size of genome x or a sequence_length polymorphism in population x given a phylogeny an evolutionary characters history can be inferred by various means in order to reconstruct its state at ancestral nodes or to estimate the tempo of evolution the count software_package provides a convenient graphical_user to sophisticated computational_methods in such analyses and to the manipulation of datasets involving numerical profiles count was already used to study the evolution of gene_repertoire in archaea and nucleo cytoplasmic dna_viruses
