systems_biology cytoseed a cytoscape_plugin for viewing manipulating and analyzing metabolic_models created by the model seed cytoseed is a cytoscape_plugin for viewing manipulating and analyzing metabolic_models created using the model seed the cytoseed plugin enables users of the model seed to create informative visualizations of the reaction_networks generated for their organisms of interest these visualizations are useful for understanding organism specific biochemistry and for highlighting the results of flux variability analysis experiments availability_and freely_available for download on the web at http sourceforge net_projects cytoseed implemented_in se and supported on all platforms that support cytoscape the model seed http www theseed org models is a web_based resource for the automatic generation of metabolic_models from prokaryotic genome_sequences these models are automatically gap filled by adding reactions that enable the model to produce all specified components of the organisms biomass although the model seed provides extensive capabilities for viewing and running analyses on these metabolic_models the graphical displays of the biochemical_reaction are limited to static kegg_pathway maps cytoseed provides model seed users with a complementary means of visualizing their metabolic_models using cytoscape cytoscape is an open_source platform for dynamic graphical visualization manipulation and analysis of networks the cytoseed plugin extends cytoscape to enable users to load a metabolic model from the model seed sort the reaction_network into metabolic_pathways and modify the pathway visualizations to create the representations they find most informative through this process users are able to identify and represent connections in the biochemical reaction_network that are not readily apparent in the kegg_pathway maps cytoseed also enables users to display the results of flux variability analysis experiments for visualization in the context of a metabolic model and to compare multiple models to whom correspondence should be addressed
