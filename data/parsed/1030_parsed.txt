cocacola binning metagenomic contigs using sequence_composition read_coverage co alignment and paired_end linkage motivation the advent_of technologies enables researchers to sequence complex microbial_communities directly from the environment because assembly typically produces only genome fragments also known as contigs instead of an entire_genome it is crucial to group them into operational_taxonomic otus for further taxonomic_profiling and down streaming functional analysis otu clustering is also referred to as binning we present cocacola a general framework automatically bin contigs into otus based on sequence_composition and coverage across multiple samples results the effectiveness of cocacola is demonstrated in both simulated_and in comparison with state of art binning approaches such as concoct groopm maxbin and metabat the superior_performance of cocacola relies on two aspects one is using l distance instead of euclidean_distance for better taxonomic identification during initialization more importantly cocacola takes_advantage of both hard clustering and soft clustering by sparsity regularization in addition the cocacola framework seamlessly embraces customized knowledge to facilitate binning accuracy in our study we have investigated two types of additional knowledge the co alignment to reference_genomes and linkage of contigs provided by paired_end as well as the ensemble of both we find that both co alignment and linkage information further improve binning in the majority of cases cocacola is scalable and faster than concoct groopm maxbin and metabat metagenomic_studies aim to understand microbial_communities directly from environmental_samples without cultivating member species the next_generation allow biologists to extract genomic_data with unprecedented high_resolution and sufficient sequence depth offering insights into complex microbial_communities even including species with low_abundance to further investigate the taxonomic structure of microbial samples assembled sequence_fragments also known as contigs need be grouped into operational_taxonomic otus that ultimately represent genomes or significant parts of genomes otu clustering is also called binning or genomic binning serving as the key_step toward taxonomic_profiling and downstream functional analysis therefore accurate binning of the contigs is an essential problem in metagenomic_studies despite extensive studies accurate binning of contigs remains_challenging for several major reasons including chimeric assemblies owing to repetitive sequence_regions within or across genomes sequencing_errors or artifacts strain level variation within the same species etc the currently available binning methods can be broadly categorized into classification and clustering_approaches classification approaches are taxonomy dependent that is reference_databases are needed for the assignment from contigs or reads to meaningful taxons the classification is either based on homology owing to sequence_identity or genomic_signatures such as oligonucleotide composition patterns and taxonomic clades homology based_methods include megan which assigns reads to the lowest common taxonomic ancestor examples of genomic signature based_methods include phylopythia and kraken which are composition based_classifiers and naive bayesian_classifier a clade specific approach in addition hybrid methods are available to take both alignment and composition based strategy into consideration such as phymmbl and sphinx in comparison clustering_approaches are taxonomy independent that is no additional reference_databases or taxonomic information is needed these approaches require similarity measurements from gc_content tetra mer composition or interpolated markov_models to contig coverage profile recently several methods have been developed to bin contigs using the coverage profiles of the contigs across multiple metagenomic_samples here the coverage of a contig is defined as the fraction of reads_mapped to the contig in a sample the idea is that if two contigs are from the same genome their coverage profiles across multiple samples should be highly_correlated these methods can be further improved by integrating coverage profiles with the sequence tetra mer composition of the contigs among these methods groopm is advantageous in its visualized and interactive pipeline on one hand it is flexible allowing users to merge and split bins under expert intervention on the other hand in the absence of expert intervention the automatic binning results of groopm is not as satisfactory as concoct concoct makes use of the gaussian_mixture gmm to cluster contigs into bins also concoct provides a mechanism to automatically_determine the optimal otu number by variational_bayesian model_selection metabat calculates integrated distance for pairwise contigs and then clusters contigs iteratively by modified k medoids algorithm and maxbin compares the distributions of distances between and within the same genomes in this article we present cocacola a general framework for contig binning incorporating sequence_composition coverage co alignment and paired_end linkage across multiple samples by default cocacola uses sequence_composition and coverage across multiple samples for binning compared with recent_approaches such as concoct groopm maxbin and metabat cocacola performs better in three aspects first cocacola reveals superiority with respect to precision recall and adjusted rand index ari second cocacola shows better robustness in the case of varying number of samples cocacola is scalable and faster than concoct groopm maxbin and metabat in addition the cocacola framework seamlessly embraces customized knowledge to facilitate binning accuracy in our study we have investigated two types of knowledge in particular the coalignment to reference_genomes and linkage between contigs provided by paired_end we find that both co alignment and linkage information facilitate better binning performance in the majority of the cases given the same input i e sequence_composition and coverage across multiple samples we show the effectiveness of cocacola on simulated species and strain datasets in comparison with three state of art methodologically distinct methods for contigs binning concoct groopm maxbin and metabat the comparison excludes canopy that is based on binning co abundant gene groups instead of binning contigs furthermore we investigate the performance improvement of cocacola after incorporating two additional knowledge co alignment to reference_genomes and linkage between contigs provided by paired_end as well as the ensemble of both results reveal both information facilitating better performance in the majority of cases finally we report the performance of cocacola on two real_datasets in this article we develop a general framework to bin metagenomic contigs using sequence_composition and coverage across multiple samples our approach cocacola outperforms state of art binning approaches concoct groopm maxbin and metabat on both simulated_and the superior_performance of cocacola relies on several aspects first initialization plays an important role in binning accuracy second cocacola uses l distance instead of euclidean_distance for better taxonomic identification third cocacola takes_advantage of both hard clustering and soft clustering specifically soft clustering such as the gmm used by concoct allows a contig to be assigned probabilistically to multiple otus hence gains more robust results in general in comparison with hard clustering such as the hough partitioning used by groopm however in complex environmental_samples with strain level variations the corresponding otus are closely intertwined whereas soft clustering in turn further mixes the otus up and thus deteriorates clustering performance cocacola obtains better trade_off between hard clustering and soft clustering by exploiting sparsity however we notice that binning metagenomic contigs remains_challenging when the number of samples is small regardless of using cocacola concoct groopm maxbin or metabat with small number of metagenomic_samples the relationship between the contigs cannot be accurately inferred based on the relationship between the abundance profiles therefore future_research needs to study how to re weight the contributions of abundance profiles and composition profiles in unsupervised or semisupervised scenario moreover recent_studies euclidean or l distance between l mer frequencies do not perform as well as alternative dissimilarity measurements such as d and d shepp in comparing genome_sequence however the use of such measurements is computationally_challenging which needs further exploration the cocacola framework seamlessly embraces customized knowledge to facilitate binning accuracy in our study we have investigated two types of knowledge in particular the co alignment to reference_genomes and linkage of contigs provided by paired endthough the contributions from additional knowledge diminish when there are sufficient number of samples they play_an in binning results when the number of samples is small in future_studies we intend to explore better customized prior_knowledge one option is exploiting phylogenetic_information in taxonomic annotation another option relies on identifying functional_annotation of contigs including open_reading that are likely to encode_proteins or co abundance gene groups etc we have also investigated the ensemble of both co alignment and linkage knowledge and it shows more stable performance than individual information in future_studies we aim to find optimal weights instead of equal weights
