genetics_and discoal flexible coalescent simulations with selection here we describe discoal a coalescent simulator able to generate population samples that include selective_sweeps in a feature rich flexible manner discoal can perform simulations conditioning on the fixation of an allele due to drift or either hard or soft sweepseven those occurring a large genetic_distance away from the simulated locus discoal can simulate sweeps with recurrent mutation to the adaptive allele recombination and gene_conversion under non equilibrium demographic histories and without specifying an allele_frequency trajectory in advance the coalescent_process which describes the stochastic genealogy of a sample of alleles from a natural_population has become the dominant paradigm for both theory and empirical analysis in population_genetics over the past three decades indeed the great efficiency of coalescent simulations relative to forward in time population_genetic simulations allows researchers to perform statistical_inference of population_genetic parameters directly from simulations e g such efforts have mostly focused on inferring demographic_parameters such as population_size histories or migration_rates e g and accordingly the majority of coalescent_simulation software has focused on being flexible with respect to the range of demographic histories they can model increasingly population_genomics as a field has recognized the role that natural_selection has played in shaping patterns of variation in natural_populations e g the coalescent again provides a convenient framework for modeling the action of selection on population_genetic samples in particular good coalescent approximations to both selective_sweeps and balancing_selection have been described analytically while that is so there are relatively few software_packages that flexibly model the coalescent with selection notable exceptions include msms and mbs here we introduce discoal a coalescent simulator that incorporates genic selection in a flexible manner discoal is able to simulate standard demographic events such as population splits and mergers instantaneous population_size changes admixture and migration along with selective_sweeps that occur either at the locus sampled or in neighboring loci discoal is further capable of simulating both hard and soft selective_sweeps while conditioning on the fixation of the selected allele in addition discoal simulates coalescent samples that are conditional on the fixation of a neutral mutation
