genetics_and a study of the efficiency of pooling in haplotype estimation motivation it has been claimed in the literature that pooling dna samples is efficient in estimating haplotype_frequencies there is however no theoretical justification based on calculation of statistical efficiency in fact the limited_evidence given so_far is based on simulation_studies with small numbers of loci with rapid advance in technology it is of interest to see if pooling is still efficient when the number of loci increases methods instead of resorting to simulation_studies we make use of asymptotic statistical theory to perform exact calculation of the efficiency of pooling relative to no pooling in the estimation of haplotype_frequencies as an intermediate step we use the log_linear formulation of the haplotype probabilities and derive the asymptotic variancecovariance matrix of the maximum_likelihood estimators of the canonical parameters of the log linear_model results based on our calculations under linkage equilibrium pooling can suffer huge loss in efficiency relative to no pooling when there are more than three independent loci and the alleles are not rare pooling works better for rare alleles in particular if all the minor_allele are pooling maintains an advantage over no pooling until the number of independent loci reaches high linkage_disequilibrium effectively reduces the number of independent loci by ruling out certain haplotypes from occurring similar calculations of efficiency for the case of no pooling justify the common_belief that it is not worthwhile to use molecular methods to resolve the phase ambiguity of individual genotype data pooling dna samples is a common cost_effective practice in genetic_association especially for the purpose of initial screening large pools of dna samples also come up in forensic studies to facilitate haplotype_based association analysis it is necessary to estimate haplotype_frequencies from pooled_dna data and many algorithms mainly the expectation_maximization em_algorithm and its variants to whom correspondence should be addressed have been proposed in the literature however the emphasis of these papers is very much algorithmic and numerical focusing on computing speed and numerical convergence rather than on the statistical property and efficiency of the estimates being computed this is unfortunate because even if the best available algorithm is used to compute say the maximum_likelihood estimate mle it will be of no use if the estimator itself does not possess good statistical property what we meant by the statistical property of an estimator is its performance under repeated sampling from the postulated model thus we are concerned about quantities such as bias variance and also coverage in the case of interval estimation to compute the estimation efficiency of one estimator relative to another we adopt the usual definition of taking the ratio of the variance or mean squared error for biased estimators of estimator to that of estimator in this article estimator is the mle based on pooled genotype data and estimator is the mle based on individual genotype data the number of pools used in estimator and the number of individuals used in estimator are kept equal so that the genotyping costs of the two estimators are the same given the large body of work on haplotype estimation based on pooled data it will be important for practitioners to know when to pool and when not to pool believed that pooling dna samples is efficient in estimating haplotype_frequencies in particular they demonstrated that although pooling k individuals increases ambiguities the uncertainty of ml estimation increases less than k times that of unpooled dna at least for small_pool sizes and small number of loci thus for the same genotyping cost the pooled data mle will be more efficient than the mle computed from individual genotype data their comparison was limited to the case of small number of loci due to rapid advance in technology huge numbers of snps are genotyped routinely and it would be interesting to find out what happens when the number of loci increases our study differs fromin that our reported efficiencies are based on theoretical_calculations using asymptotic variance formulae rather than based on simulations by carrying out theoretical_calculations we avoid some of the shortcomings of simulation_studies and can handle more loci our findings for the case of linkage equilibrium and non rare allele suggest that pooling begins to lose estimation efficiency relative to no pooling at the same genotyping cost when the number of loci is larger than other factors_affecting the efficiency of pooling that have been mentioned in the literature include sparsity linkage_disequilibrium ld and allele_frequencies commented that it is not necessarily the case that pooling will lead to loss of haplotypepage we have shown in this article that contrary to the findings of pooling loses efficiency relative to no pooling in the estimation of haplotype_frequencies when the number of independent loci is more than and the alleles are not rare rare alleles cause sparsity which favors pooling when the minor_allele is pooling is more efficient than no pooling until the number of independent loci reaches or rarer alleles will favor pooling even more the effect of high_ld is also to cause sparsity which allows pooling to maintain an advantage over no pooling for a larger number of loci than is possible under linkage equilibrium to apply the guidelines derived under the assumption of linkage equilibrium we find it useful to think in terms of the effective number of independent loci for example for model the effective number of independent loci is when d and when d by interpolation it seems reasonable to treat the cases d like there are and independent loci respectively and this is substantiated by comparing table with to summarize the main finding of this article is that for non rare alleles and for the same genotyping cost pooling loses efficiency relative to no pooling in the estimation of haplotype_frequencies when the number of independent loci is more than the critical number will increase for rare alleles for example to when the minor_allele is our findings do not mean that pooling should not be applied in practice there are circumstances under which pooling is more efficient than no pooling namely in situations when only a small number of haplotypes can occur with appreciable frequency which can be caused by high_ld or rare alleles or both thus pooling is potentially useful in studies which employ dense sets of markers such as in the genome_wide context suggests that genotyping error does not have a prominent effect on our findings ideally one could incorporate genotyping error into the modeling and estimation procedure but this is beyond the scope of the present article to compare haplotype_frequencies in casecontrol_studies we must first estimate the frequencies separately for the cases and the controls and so our findings are still relevant note that when we say no pooling in this article we actually mean that we are not pooling individuals i e pool size is as commented by even when the pool size is the data collected for each individual is typically genotype data which is a pool of two chromosomes or haplotypes there will be information_loss due to phase ambiguity the are of haplotype estimation from individual genotype data without phase_information relative to genotype data with phase_information which is much more expensive to get easily times more according to our colleagues who collect such data can also be calculated using the results of this article for the asymptotic variance of the unphased data mle and the multinomial variance formula for the phased data mle assuming again that the minor_allele are equally_spaced between and the asymptotic efficiencies of the estimator based on unphased data relative to that based on phased data are for the case of page
