databases_and snpxge a database for human snp coexpression associations motivation recently genecoexpression relationships have been found to be often conditional and dynamic many studies have suggested that single_nucleotide snps have impacts on gene_expression variations in human populations results the snpxge database contains the computationally predicted human snpcoexpression associations i e the differential_coexpression between two genes is associated with the genotypes of an snp these data were generated from a large_scale association study that was based on the hapmap phase i data which covered individuals from human populations snps and gene_expression in order to reduce the computational_cost the snpcoexpression associations were assessed using gap substitution models proven to have a comparable power to logistic regression_models the results at a false_discovery fdr cutoff of consisted of and snpcoexpression associations based on single and pooled populations respectively and can be queried in the snpxge database via either gene symbol or reference snp id for each reported association a detailed information page is provided it is widely_accepted that eukaryotic gene_expression variation may be potentially modulated by many genetic and epigenetic_factors such as transcription_factors cis_regulatory enhancers repressors transposons mirnas nucleosome_positioning dna_methylation histone_modifications and by environmental_factors moreover much of gene_expression variation is heritable recently many studies have suggested that single_nucleotide snps also have impacts on gene_expression variations in human populations found that many regions within mb of expressed genes of interest had significant association of snps with expression variation subsequently performed association_analyses of expression levels of transcripts with snps and copy to whom correspondence should be addressed number variants using multiple_linear and suggested that snps captured of the total detected genetic_variation in gene_expression later on carried_out another association analysis of million common_snps with gene_expression using multiple_linear and identified at least and genes with association_signals in cis and trans effects respectively suggested that common_genetic accounted for differences in gene_expression as well as prevalence of complex_diseases among ethnic_groups also reported several thousands of significant associations between expression quantitative nucleotides and transcript clusters in two of hapmap populations in a separate study identified that some genes which were differentially_expressed among human populations were also associated with particular biological_processes using a bayesian_hierarchical found strong enrichments of quantitative_trait for gene_expression eqtls in bp_upstream regions of transcription end site tes and around the transcription_start tss similarly identified genetic_variations in more than a thousand genes which influenced the overall gene_expression or splicing in addition to individual gene_expression the relationships among transcripts such as coexpression are also often studied for deciphering gene regulatory_mechanisms the identification of human genecoexpression relationships using microarray_data has often relied on overall correlations between gene_expression across many experiments or conditions recently some studies have suggested that the coexpression relationships between genes are often dynamic and conditional which may be dependent on cellular_states developmental_stages disease status case or control or human populations however few studies have related such differential_coexpression to genetic_bases the effects of snps on gene_expression variation in humans have been well documented and so it is reasonable to conjecture that the differential_coexpression between two genes may be associated with the genotypes of an snp which is termed as an snpcoexpression association in this study showed a biological switch mechanism in coexpression between correlation and inverse_correlation of two genes controlled by the genotypes of an snp however the switch mechanism in two genes coexpression controlled by an snp could be only part of the whole picture of snpcoexpression associations because it is also possible that two genes are well coexpressed under individual genotypes of an snppage unlike traditional eqtl analyses in this study we have associated differential_coexpression relations between two genes with the genotypes of an snp on a genome_scale we found that most of the associated snps in snpcoexpression associations are located remotely from the coexpressed genes and that the snprelated genes are enriched with regulatory_functions a potential mechanism underlying snpcoexpression associations could be thatthe associated snps affect the functions or expression of their related genes which are regulators of downstream coexpressed genes and thereby these associated snps could fine_tune coexpression relationships between genes gene_expression is important for understanding the genetics of complex_diseases this study suggests that natural variations in human gene_expression may exist in coexpression relationships the analysis of genetically_determined variation in coexpression relationships may enhance understanding of both the underlying genetics and the population differences in complex_diseases the snpxge database provides information on computationally predicted human snpcoexpression associations the interfaces of snpxge are friendly and easy to use biologists may use this database to find whether their genes of interest have coexpressed interacting_partners associated with a particular distribution of genotypes and or their potential upstream regulatory_genes which are difficult to detect using routine correlation_analyses biologists may also use this database to study potentially dynamic and complex relationships among the members of a biological_process using go term search snpxge is a continuing project and is expected to grow substantially over the coming_years as next_generation like illumina plus pacbio and ion_torrent have made the data generation cheaper and newer mapping technologies will lead to enormous amounts of rnaseq_data for studying gene_expression which is quantitative enough to be included in human snpcoexpression association_analyses furthermore mapping differential gene coexpression to more genetic_features like dna_copy generated from array_cgh data is also under investigation and will be incorporated into snpxge in the next release in addition this study establishes preliminary_results for constructing human genotype_dependent coexpression_networks which will be carried_out more extensively in the future
