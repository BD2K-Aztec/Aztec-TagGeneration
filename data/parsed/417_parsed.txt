ape new tools for distance based phylogenetics and evolutionary_analysis in r reflecting its continuously increasing versatility and functionality the popularity of the ape analysis of phylogenetics and evolution software_package has grown steadily over the years among its features it has a strong distance based component allowing the user to compute distances from aligned dna_sequences based on most methods from the literature and also build phylogenetic_trees from them however even data generated with modern genomic_approaches can fail to give rise to sufficiently reliable distance estimates one way to overcome this problem is to exclude such estimates from data analysis giving rise to an incomplete distance data_set as opposed to a complete one so_far their analysis has been out of reach for ape to remedy this we have incorporated into ape several methods from the literature for phylogenetic_inference from incomplete distance_matrices in addition we have also extended apes repertoire for phylogenetic_inference from complete distances added a new object class to efficiently encode sets of splits of taxa and extended the functionality of some of its existing functions availability ape is distributed through the comprehensive_r http cran r project org_web ape index html further information may be found at
