bioinformatics_discovery a novel splicing outcome reveals more than new mammalian protein isoforms motivation we have recently_characterized an instance of alternative_splicing that differs from the canonical gene_transcript by deletion of a length of sequence not divisible by three but where translation can be rescued by an alternative start_codon this results in a predicted protein in which the amino_terminus differs_markedly in sequence from the known protein product s as it is translated from an alternative reading_frame automated pipelines have annotated thousands of splice_variants but have overlooked these protein isoforms leading to them being underrepresented in current databases results here we describe human and mouse transcripts that can be transcribed from an alternate atg of these have not been annotated previously those conserved between human and mouse genomes and hence under likely evolutionary selection are identified we provide mass_spectroscopy evidence for translation of selected transcripts of the described splice_variants only one has previously been studied in detail and converted the encoded_protein from an activator of cell function to a suppressor demonstrating that these splice_variants can result in profound functional change we investigate the potential functional effects of this splicing using a variety of bioinformatic_tools the variants we describe are involved in a wide_variety and therefore open many new avenues of research alternative_splicing is one of the most significant_contributors to proteome diversity through the production of multiple mrna_transcripts a single gene can encode multiple and functionally_distinct protein isoforms these isoforms can differ subtly varying in only a single amino_acid or demonstrate drastic changes in their peptide_sequences accompanied by equally significant changes in their function automated pipelines have been developed which can identify and annotate alternative splice events and their encoded_proteins primarily through the alignment of expressed_sequence ests we have previously_characterized an alternative splice form of the mouse non smc condensin ii complex subunit h ncaph gene that was incorrectly annotated by these pipelines the gene can produce a transcript that lacks the last bp of the first exon while normally such a deletion would produce a frame_shift of the downstream sequence translation at an alternate start_codon rescues the reading_frame of the sequence downstream from the splice event while shifting that of the upstream sequence the result is a protein isoform that possesses a unique amino_terminus but in which the remainder of the protein is identical to the known isoform an exhaustive literature_search revealed only three other proteins displaying similar alternative_splicing mouse innositol polyphosphate phosphatase type_ii inpp b human leishmanolysin like metallopeptidase m family lmln and otubain otub all couple a frame shifting splice event with an alternate start_codon to change the readingframe of the amino_terminus and all have been overlooked by the genome annotation_pipelines leading us to question if the few documented instances of this splicing are a true representation of their prevalence here we report the genome_wide identification of new examples of this type of alternative_splicing using publically available est data the aim of this study was to investigate an unusual outcome of alternative_splicing that results in the amino_terminal exons of a gene being translated in two reading frames our pipelinepredicted a total of instances of this splicing in the mouse and human_genomes the majority of which have not been previously annotated previous large_scale studies have treated genes as possessing a single start_codon only considering alternate sites of translation_initiation when a splice event removes the canonical start_codon a few studies have investigated the potential of alternate start_codons but these have focused on either downstream in frame start_codons that produce truncated versions of proteins or those that result in a frame_shift of the entire transcript our study is the first to investigate the prevalence of this unusual amino_terminus frame shifting form of alternative_splicing our search_strategy identified three of the four published instances of this alternative_splicing upon further inspection it was found that inpp b was not detected due to low est coverage the unigene database contained only ests associated with inpp b none of which encode the experimentally_validated splice_variant the splice_forms we have identified are therefore likely to be an underestimate of the true frequency of this splicing low est coverage of genes hides instances of this splicing as seen in inpp b in addition variants transcribed at low levels or under restrictive conditions such as in specific cell_subsets or under particular metabolic conditions may not be represented in databases only one of the splice_variants we have identified otubain has been previously functionally characterized and was found to have a dramatic effect on the function of the protein while the canonical form of the protein activated t cells the alternate form was found to promote tcell anergy turn off t cells the profound functional difference found in the only one of these genes studied coupled with our predictions for alterations in domain_composition and subcellular_localization highlights the potential importance of the novel proteins we have identified in this study we have identified novel protein isoforms in human and mouse genomes these result from an unusual outcome of alternative_splicing combining frame shifting splice_variants with alternative start_codons this largely overlooked form of alternative_splicing therefore contributes significantly to transcriptome diversity in each case the novel proteins differ from their known isoforms by their amino_terminus being translated from an alternate reading_frame the remainder of the protein is identical in both isoforms this can result in a profound change to protein_function the proteins we have identified are involved in a wide_range research into the biological_functions of these novel proteins will therefore open new avenues of research into almost every facet of cell_biology
