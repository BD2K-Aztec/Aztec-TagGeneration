immquant a user_friendly for inferring immune cell_type composition from gene_expression data the composition of immune_cell is key to the understanding of major diseases and pathologies computational deconvolution methods enable researchers to investigate immune_cell quantities in complex tissues based on transcriptome_data here we present immquant a software_tool allowing immunologists to upload transcription profiles of multiple tissue_samples apply deconvolution methodology to predict differences in cell_type quantities between the samples and then inspect the inferred cell_type alterations using convenient visualization_tools immquant builds on the dcq deconvolution algorithm and allows a user_friendly utilization of this method by non bioinformatician researchers specifically it enables investigation of hundreds of immune_cell in mouse_tissues as well as a few dozen cell_types in human samples the repertoire of changes in immune_cell between different physiological_states and the accurate determination of these changes can facilitate biomedical_research diagnosis and treatment despite this important attribute experimental quantification of cell_types has remained relatively low_throughput one attractive approach is to apply deconvolution techniques to infer the composition of cell_types based on geneexpression data thus avoiding the need for experimental cell_sorting shen using immune deconvolution methods the quantities of cell_subsets within a given heterogeneous tissue can be inferred based on i transcription profiling of a tissue_sample ii prior_knowledge about the signatures of immune_cell referred to as reference data and iii a group of effective gene markers for each of the cell_subsets in the reference data most deconvolution methods were proven useful in human applications where the reference datasets are of intermediate sizes and cell_types in the iris and dmap reference datasets respectively however these methods are typically not scalable to the substantially larger number of reference signatures that are available in mouse cell_types in the immgen dataset to address this we recently_introduced the dcq deconvolution algorithm which can robustly infer differences between murine samples at a scale of a few hundreds of cell_types dcq is focused on fold changes in cell_type quantities between samples while assuming sparse changes in cell_type composition that is assuming that only a subset of the cell_types differs between the compared samples using this assumption dcq can be effectively applied on mouse_tissues utilizing the cell_types contained in the immgen dataset indeed the accuracy of dcq on mouse samples was validated using several simulations and experimental_approaches e g since dcq was so_far applied only on mouse data we decided to test the performance of dcq in the case of human data as well to facilitate the use of dcq by immunologists we developed immquant a freely_available multiplatform software running on both windows and mac that enables users to apply dcq on transcription profiling in heterogene ous samples both human and mouse and observe the inferred alterations in composition of immune_cell using convenient visualizations our simulations show that immquant can withstand the large number of predicted cell_subsets in mouse data while maintaining a good accuracy in human data we show that dcq can be usefully applied for example to examine immune cell_type alterations in murine lung_infection and in human sjgrens syndrome pathogenesis we first evaluated the quality of dcq using synthetic data focusing on assessment of performance using the low and high number of cell_types in the human and mouse reference collections respectively our analysis showed that dcq accurately_predicts relative cell_type quantities across a range of numbers of cell_types in comparison with existing_methods dcq achieves the best performance when using mouse data and is the second best for human data a detailed_description of data generation and performance evaluation is provided in supplementary methods supplementary_information and supplementary we next aimed to provide a software_tool to enable nonbioinformatician users to apply dcq on their own datasets immquant implements the entire analysis_pipeline first import of the transcriptionprofiling data next selection of reference data and marker_genes and finally visualization of the resulting cell_type quantities and supplementary reference data and marker_genes can either be selected from a collection of pre compiled options two reference datasets in human and one dataset in mouse or alternatively be uploaded by the user the ability to add user_defined reference datasets opens the way to future deconvolution analyses of newly_identified cell_types finally immquant allows two types of fold_change calculations relative to the average of all samples and relative to a selected subset of control samples we note that immquant does not support data pre_processing and the input gene_expression is assumed to be normalized beforehand supplementary methods deconvolution takes several minutes for a dataset of samples see supplementary immquant provides several options for visualization of the inferred cell_type quantities including a matrix viewer a comparative viewer and projection of the cell_type quantities on top of the haematopoieticlineage tree supplementary
