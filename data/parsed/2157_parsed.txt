systems_biology hammer automated operation of mass frontier to construct in silico mass_spectral fragmentation libraries experimental ms n mass spectral_libraries currently do not adequately cover chemical_space this limits the robust annotation of metabolites in metabolomics_studies of complex biological_samples in silico fragmentation libraries would improve the identification of compounds from experimental multistage fragmentation data when experimental reference data are unavailable here we present a freely_available software_package to automatically control mass frontier software to construct in silico mass spectral_libraries and to perform spectral matching based on two case studies we have demonstrated that high_throughput automation of mass frontier allows researchers to generate in silico mass spectral_libraries in an automated and high_throughput fashion with little or no human intervention required availability_and documentation examples results and source_code are available atmass spectrometry ms based_metabolomics is a rapidly_developing that aims to detect and measure a variety of small biological_molecules metabolites over a wide_dynamic although thousands of metabolites are typically detected in an untargeted metabolomics study of a biological_sample their subsequent identification represents the most significant bottleneck in the discovery of new biochemical knowledge in many cases multiple empirical formulae and or putative chemical_structures are reported for each observed mass feature or more strictly mass to charge ratio m z multistage ms n mass_spectrometry which is an experimental technique to collect in depth fragmentation data related to the chemical_structure of metabolites is often applied to increase accuracy and specificity in metabolite annotation and identification however experimental ms n mass spectral_libraries currently do not adequately cover the search_space for all metabolites present in complex biological_samples as authentic chemical standards are not available for all metabolites the generation of in silico ms n libraries is anticipated to greatly improve the success_rate of annotation of metabolites detected in metabolomics_studies when experimentally acquired ms n data of authentic chemical standards are unavailable commercial software_packages such as mass frontier and acd ms fragmenter predict in silico fragmentation_patterns to assist the interpretation of experimental ms n data additionally a freely_available tool named metfrag has been developed previously this tool selects candidate structures from a compound library based on the molecular_ion m z and generates in silico substructures to subsequently annotate fragment peaks metfrag does not provide the ability to create in silico patterns or libraries independent of the use of experimental_data however it has been proven to be an efficient approach to annotate fragmentation mass_spectra derived from ms experiments mass frontier is a well known software_package that has been used by more than a thousand academic_institutions and companies throughout the world for the management evaluation and interpretation of mass_spectra it includes three resources that assist the user to robustly predict in silico fragmentation_patterns a set of general fragmentation rules a fragmentation library comprising fragmentation mechanisms collected from the scientific_literature and user specified mechanisms however mass frontier cannot readily perform batch processing on the scale required to generate comprehensive in silico libraries for thousands of metabolites here we present a freely_available software_package named hammer high_throughput automation of mass frontier to automatically control mass frontier software to perform in silico fragmentation in an automated and high_throughput matter this package allows the user to readily generate to whom correspondence should be addressed
