systems_biology resque network reduction using semi_markov random_walk scores for efficient querying of biological_networks motivation recent_technological in measuring molecular_interactions have resulted in an increasing number of large_scale biological_networks translation of these enormous network data into meaningful biological_insights requires efficient computational_techniques that can unearth the biological_information that is encoded in the networks one such example is network_querying which aims to identify similar subnetwork regions in a large target network that are similar to a given query network network_querying tools can be used to identify novel biological_pathways that are homologous to known pathways thereby enabling knowledge_transfer across different organisms results in this article we introduce an efficient algorithm for querying large_scale biological_networks called resque the proposed algorithm adopts a semi_markov random_walk smrw model to probabilistically estimate the correspondence scores between nodes that belong to different networks the target network is iteratively reduced based on the estimated correspondence scores which are also iteratively re estimated to improve accuracy until the best matching subnetwork emerges we demonstrate that the proposed network_querying scheme is computationally_efficient can handle any network query with an arbitrary topology and yields accurate querying results availability the source_code of resque is freely_available atbiological functions in cells are carried_out through complicated interactions among various cellular constituents for instance proteinprotein_interactions ppi lie at the core of various transcriptional signaling and metabolic_processes in cells quantitative genome_scale description of such interactions by graphical_representation of biological_networks can facilitate the study of the cell as an integrated system and help us better understand the structure and dynamics of diverse biological_mechanisms recent_technological have enabled high_throughput global measurement of proteinprotein_interactions uetz to whom correspondence should be addressed resulting in large_scale ppi_networks furthermore many text_mining tools have been developed to search the vast amount of biomedical_research literature to collect known molecular_interactions that have been reported before as a result genome_scale biological_networks are available for a number of model_organisms and biological_network databases are still in rapid expansion in order to translate these large_scale network data into meaningful biological_insights we need efficient computational_techniques that can be used to unearth the important information that is buried in these networks as comparative_methods have played crucial roles in the analysis of biological_sequences comparative network_analysis can also serve as an effective way of analyzing the available network data one such example is network_querying network_querying aims to identify similar subnetwork regions in a large biological_network referred as the target network that are similar to a given query network this technique can be used to search for novel potential pathways in a given biological_network that are similar to known biological_pathways thereby enabling knowledge_transfer across different organisms from well studied ones to others that have been studied less to obtain biologically_meaningful the network_querying algorithm needs to incorporate the similarity between the individual nodes i e biomolecules in the networks in terms of their composition structure or functionas well as the similarity between their interactions patterns i e topological_similarity however the optimal network_querying problem has been shown to be npcomplete by reduction to the graph isomorphism problem and until now various approaches have been proposed to make this problem computationally_feasible pathblast is one of the pioneering network_querying schemes that identify_conserved linear pathways in a pair of networks using a greedy seed and extendapproach due to the high computational_burden this algorithm is restricted to relatively short pathways to reduce computational_complexity qpath and qnet adopted a color codingbased approach qpath is restricted to querying linear paths while qnet allows searching for trees and bounded tree width graphs another recent algorithm called pada also used the color coding scheme andproposed two algorithms called pathmatch which searches for the longest weighted path and graphmatch which enumerates all possible solutions to find the highest scoring subgraphs in a directed_acyclic proposed a hidden_markov hmm_based scheme for querying linear paths sigma and rinq consider the problem of efficient querying in biological_network databases using indexing schemes proposed an asymmetric approach that uses a master slave scheme to extract via the viterbi algorithm matching subgraphs in the master network another recent algorithm called torque proposed a topology free querying scheme that looks for a connected set of matching proteins in the target network that are sequence similar to proteins in the query network where the underlying motivation for taking a topology free approach was the incompleteness of the currently available protein interaction data another algorithm called gramofone also adopted this topology free approach based on a color_coded motif matching scheme currently most network_querying algorithms cannot handle queries with general network_structures many algorithms either restrict the query to have a relatively simple structure e g linear path or tree or simply view it as a collection of nodes by ignoring the underlying topology furthermore many algorithms strongly rely on sequence_similarity to identify homologous node pairs where candidate pairs are typically identified by thresholding the similarity_scores e g blast score besides many network_querying algorithms still suffer from high_computational which often increases exponentially with the query size rendering them impractical for large queries in this article we propose a novel network_querying algorithm called resque reduction based scheme using semi_markov scores for network_querying that can effectively address the shortcomings of existing algorithms for fast and accurate network_querying the proposed algorithm takes an efficient reduction based_approach where the target network is iteratively reduced based on the so_called node correspondence scores that are computed using a semi_markov random_walk smrw model the node correspondence score provides a probabilistic similarity measure between nodes that belong to different networks i e query and target networks which can be efficiently computed using a closedform formula at each iteration the estimated scores are used to remove the nodes in the target network that have minimal correspondence to the nodes in the query network thereby shrinking the search_space the node correspondence scores are then reestimated based on the reduced network and the aforementioned reduction process is repeated until the best matching subnetwork emerges based on real as well as synthetic examples we demonstrate that resque outperforms state of the art network_querying techniques in terms of both computational_efficiency and querying accuracy to investigate the performance of the proposed network_querying algorithm we conducted a set of querying experiments based on real ppi datasets as well as a number of simulated examples in this article we proposed resque a novel network_querying algorithm that can efficiently query biological_pathways and molecular complexes in large_scale biological_networks the algorithm uses a smrw model to estimate probabilistic correspondence scores between nodes across different networks which are used to identify the best match to the given query according to the maximum expected_accuracy principle resque adopts an iterative network reduction and score re estimation technique to improve the expected_accuracy of the final querying result as discussed in this article resque does not restrict the topology of the query network and it can handle paths trees and loopy graphs the algorithm supports both connected and partially connected query networks in the extreme case resque can also be used with a query pathway or complex with an unknown topology in which case we can simply treat the query as a collection of isolated nodes in this case the steady_state distribution of the random_walk on the query network q will be uniform over all the query nodes furthermore resque can effectively deal with node insertions_and at arbitrary locations despite its generality resque has very low computational_complexity which allows us to use the algorithm for querying large pathways complexes in genome_scale networks experimental_results based on real and synthetic examples
