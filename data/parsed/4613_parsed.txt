structural_bioinformatics the mempack alpha_helical transmembrane_protein structure_prediction server motivation the experimental_difficulties of alpha_helical transmembrane_protein structure_determination make this class of protein an important target for sequence_based structure prediction_tools the mempack prediction server allows users to submit a transmembrane protein_sequence and returns transmembrane topology lipid exposure residue_contacts helixhelix interactions and helical packing arrangement predictions in both plain_text and graphical formats using a number of novel machine_learning based_algorithms availability the server can be accessed as a new component of the psipred portal by atgiven the biological and pharmacological importance of transmembrane tm proteins and the difficulties associated with obtaining their crystal_structures the use of bioinformatics approaches to direct experimental work while furthering our understanding of their structure and function is essential the mempack prediction server applies a selection of machine_learning tools to predict tm topologythe total number of tm helices their boundaries and in out orientation relative to the membranewith the addition of lipid exposure residue_contacts helixhelix interactions culminating in prediction of the optimal helical packing arrangement using a force directed algorithm provides an example of some of the server output the underlying tools have recently been shown to provide significant improvements in prediction_accuracy compared with existing_methods it is hoped that this service will be of benefit to the broader scientific_community
