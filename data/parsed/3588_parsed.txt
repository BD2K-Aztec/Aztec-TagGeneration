sequence_analysis plexy efficient target prediction for box c d snornas motivation small_nucleolar snornas are an abundant class of non_coding with a wide_variety of cellular_functions including chemical_modification of rna telomere maintanance pre_rrna and regulatory_activities in alternative_splicing the main role of box c d snornas is to determine the targets for o ribose methylation which is important for rrna maturation and splicing regulation of some mrnas the targets are still unknown however for many orphan snornas while a fast and efficient target predictor for box h aca snornas is available no comparable tool exists for box c d snornas even though they bind to their targets in a much less complex manner results plexy is a dynamic_programming that computes thermodynamically optimal interactions of a box c d snorna with a putative target_rna implemented as scanner for large input_sequences and equipped with filters on the duplex structure plexy is an efficient and reliable tool for the prediction of box c d snorna target_sites availability the perl script plexy is freely_available atbox c d snornas are mainly involved in o ribose methylation of specific nucleotides in ribosomal and spliceosomal rnas they are characterized by two sequence_motifs the c box rtgatga close to the end the d box ctga close to the end and in most cases an additional c and d box the targeted position is located exactly nt upstream of the end of the d and or d box it is determined by sequence specific hybridization the base_pairing region has a length of nt and exhibits a simple structure consisting of stacked base_pairs and only a few mismatches in particular bulges are absent recently an efficient and reliable tool for predicting the much more complex interactions of box h aca snornas with their to whom correspondence should be addressed targets has become available it is based on the thermodynamic principles of rna_folding no comparable approach is currently available for the simple box c d snornarna duplexes snotarget at present the only computer program devoted to box c d snorna target prediction employs pattern matching to find candidates which are then ranked by the cofolding energy of snorna and target as computed by rnacofold in contrast plexy directly computes the interaction_energies by means of dynamic_programming the plexy algorithm plexy takes a snorna sequence with annotated box motifs and a list of potential target rnas as input first plexy extracts the putative antisense elements ases which are defined as the nt_long segments directly upstream of the d d boxes plexy then calls the rnaplex algorithm to compute stable duplexes between the ase and the putative targets rnaplex is a fast folding algorithm for unbranched rna_structures that utilizes a linearized energy_model to achieve a linear runtime behavior in contrast to rnacofold used in snotarget rnaplex neglects the internal_structure of the interacting rna_sequences and hence is fast enough for genomewide searches without the need for additional prefiltering steps the resulting duplexes are then filtered using the rules compiled by a the interaction should be at least nt_long b no bulges are allowed c the core duplex region contains at most one mismatch and d the methylated residue forms a watsoncrick pair finally putative target_sites are ranked by their duplex energies supplementary_material s runtime the runtime of plexy scales linearly with the length of the target_sequence it scans nt of target_sequences in s on a ghz intel processor q this is only four times slower than the pattern search algorithm employed by snotarget accuracy to compare the performance of plexy and snotarget we used a collection of experimentally_verified snornarrna interactions of yeast and human and used yeast and human snornaand rrna sequences in yeast plexy correctly_predicted all target_sites being ranked first in contrast snotarget recovered only of of the methylation_sites and only achieved the top rank in human plexy found of known rrna targets with top rank supplementary_material s snotarget retrieved of these targets and ranked of them at the top the data are summarized as roc_curves in the minimum_free for the predicted duplexes on the rrnas averages kcal_mol the energy_distribution is shown in false_positive we tested snornas with known targets on rrnas against a mb segment of the human_genome chr m m a duplex is a false_positive hit fp if its interaction_energy is lower than that of the true interaction for snornas no fp was found additional snornas had less than one fp per mb and more than of the snornas had less than one fp per kb the false_positive depends exponentially on the interaction_energy hence plexy cannot reliably_predict the few snornarrna interactions that have very poor interaction_energies targets in mrnas in contrast to the majority of the box c d snornas the members of the brain specific hbii family do not methylate rrnas or snrnas but basepair close to an alternative splice_junction in the mrna_transcript ht c which codes for the serotonin_receptor a target search in a large dataset of primary_transcripts expressed in brain covering about nt returned the known target_site with median duplex energy of kcal_mol for of the members of the snorna family and revealed a second putative target with a median interaction_energy of kcal_mol in of the snornas the second region is located in a large intronic region of the neurexin primary transcript hg chr the example demonstrates that plexy can be employed for essentially transcriptome_wide target searches recently it was discovered that hbii is also processed into shorter rnas so_called psnornas for processed snornas that appear to be involded in splicing regulation the psnornas form rnps distinct from the common snornps it is not surprising therefore that the psnornas mediated mode of action follows somewhat different interaction rules although they involve the same regions of the snorna for instance psnornamrna duplexes appear to have more mismatches than canonical snornarrna ones as soon as these recognition parameters are better understood they could be easily included in the plexy algorithm by simply adding new filtering rules finally we remark that the specificity of plexy can be enhanced by considering evolutionary_conservation of the target_site this can be achieved most easily by filtering the predicted putative targets by their sequence_conservation or by using the ability of rnaplex to compute interactions between multiple_sequence in summary plexy is a computationally_efficient tool to predict target_sites for box c d snornas it is specific enough to reliably identify modification_sites on rrnas and snrnas at the same time it is efficient enough to perform genome_wide searches for potential mrna_targets of orphan snornas
