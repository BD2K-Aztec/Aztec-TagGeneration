genome_analysis visualization and quality_assessment of de_novo genome_assemblies recent technological_progress has greatly_facilitated de_novo genome_sequencing however de_novo assemblies consist in many pieces of contiguous sequence contigs arranged in thousands of scaffolds instead of small numbers of chromosomes confirming and improving the quality of such assemblies is critical for subsequent analysis we present a method to evaluate genome scaffolding by aligning independently obtained transcriptome sequences to the genome and visually summarizing the alignments using the cytoscape software applying this method to the genome of the red fire ant solenopsis_invicta allowed us to identify inconsistencies in confirm contig order in and extend of scaffolds contact oksana ribagrognuz unil ch yannick wurm unil ch availability scripts that generate tables for visualization in cytoscape from fasta sequence and scaffolding information files are publicly_available at https github com ksanao tgnet de_novo assemblies of eukaryotic_genomes consist in many pieces of contiguous sequence contigs arranged in thousands of scaffolds instead of a few scaffolds corresponding to the chromosomes evaluating the qualities of such assemblies is a major_challenge especially in emerging model_organisms that lack reference_genomes independently obtained mrna or protein_sequences or pairs of sequences separated by known genomic distances can be aligned to a genome_assembly to help assess its quality however it is difficult to systematically evaluate the thousands or millions of resulting alignments abyss explorer provides a global view of a genome_assembly but it displays only the information used to create that assembly other visualization_tools often display alignments of to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address school of biological and chemical sciences queen mary university of london london e ns uk individual sequences but fail to provide genome level overviews supplementary we present an approach for genome quality_assessment based on a general visualization_tool cytoscape which is a popular platform to visualize and analyze molecular_interaction examined synteny between metagenomic scaffolds using cytoscape thus demonstrating its potential for visualizing genomic alignments here we show that cytoscape can be used for visually representing alignments between independently obtained mrna_sequences genome contigs and scaffolds it allows rapid confirmation of intrascaffold connections between contigs and detection of possible scaffold extensions and inconsistencies
