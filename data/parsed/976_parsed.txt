genome_analysis circleator flexible circular visualization of genome associated data with bioperl and svg circleator is a perl application that generates circular figures of genome associated data it leverages bioperl to support standard annotation and sequence file_formats and produces publication quality svg output it is designed to be both flexible and easy to use it includes a library of circular track types and predefined configuration files for common use cases including i visualizing gene_annotation and dna sequence_data from a genbank flat file ii displaying patterns of gene conservation in related microbial_strains iii showing single_nucleotide snps and indels relative to a reference_genome and gene_set and iv viewing rna_seq plots availability_and circleator is freely_available under the artistic license from http jonathancrabtree github io circleator and is integrated with the clovr cloud_based sequence_analysis virtual_machine vm which can be downloaded fromthere are numerous circular genome visualization_tools with varying_degrees of interactivity usability and utility they differ in the data types and formats they accept the types of output they produce and the ease of customizing the mapping from input_data to graphical display flexibility and ease of use are frequently at odds with the most flexible tools often being the hardest to customize particularly for non programmers to address_this circleator provides multiple configuration options allowing each user to choose the one that best suits his her needs similar tools include genomeplot a perl tk application and dnaplotter a java_application both of which have graphical_user and also support linear displays genomap is a tcl tk microarray_data viewer and the genewiz browser is an interactive java_applet some combine analysis and visualization brig incorporates a blast_based prokaryotic_genome comparison algorithm and cgview server is a cgview based web_service that runs on the fly blast comparisons at the other extreme some tools display only predefined datasets the microbial genome viewer and genome projector are web_based tools in this category genomediagram supports linear and circular displays but requires python programming expertise circos is a popular and powerful stand alone tool but its use of complex hierarchical configuration files may put it out of reach of some users the d js toolkit has a circos like chord diagram but does not to our knowledge accept standard bioinformatic file_formats circster which uses d js adds circular drawing capabilities to galaxy circleator follows the computer design principle of making the common case fast if a researcher has data in a standard format and needs a routine visualization then he she should not have to reformat the data or experiment with parameter_values conversely with sufficient time it should be possible to create novel and intricately detailed figures circleator users who wish to accomplish the former can choose a predefined configuration file whereas those seeking more flexibility can write their own circleators configuration file_format supports several novel high_level abstractions e g loops symbolic track references feature_based coordinate scaling and reuses existing standards e g svg css cascading style sheets where possible
