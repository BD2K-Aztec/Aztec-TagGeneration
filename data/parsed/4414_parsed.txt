statistical_analysis of the cancer cell's molecular entropy using high_throughput data motivation as cancer progresses dna_copy accumulate and the genomic entropy chromosomal disorganization increases for this surge to have any oncogenetic effect it should to some extent be reflected at other molecular levels of the cancer cell in particular that of the transcriptome such a coincidence of cancer_progression and the propagation of an entropy increase through the molecular levels of the cancer cell would enhance the understanding of cancer evolution results a statistical argument reveals that under some assumptions an entropy increase in one random variable dna_copy leads to an entropy increase in another gene_expression statistical methodology is provided to investigate the relation between the genomic and transcriptomic entropy using high_throughput data analyses of multiple high_throughput datasets using this methodology show a close concordant relation among the genomic and transcriptomic entropy hence as cancer evolves and the genomic entropy increases the transcriptomic entropy is also expected to surge dna_copy are one of the key_characteristics of cancer in fact the accumulation of dna_copy is the most consistent feature of cancer_progression the entropy at the genomic_level chromosomal disorganization of cancer_cells thus exceeds that of healthy cells and tends to surge as cancer progresses dna_copy affect mrna_expression levels as the central dogma of molecular_biology suggests and numerous high_throughput studies have shown e g aberrations need not only affect the expression of its driver gene but may also alter expression levels of the other genes that map to the aberrated segment in fact genomic_aberrations also affect expression levels of other transcripts like micrornas e g the close relation between the genome to whom correspondence should be addressed and transcriptome suggests that the entropy increase spreads to other molecular levels of the cells regulatory system and is expected to manifest itself most prominently in the transcriptome indeed for this surge in genomic entropy to have any phenotypic oncogenetic effect it needs to some extent to propagate to the transcriptomic level and beyond cancer may be considered an evolutionary_process driven by random variation and natural_selection during its life a cell may undergo heritable genetic_alterations e g dna_copy such alterations may be neutral but may also affect the cells phenotype irrespective of the type of alteration any cell is subject to natural_selection it has to survive in the environment of the organisms tissue within this framework a cancer cell can be thought of as having acquired alterations that resulted in beneficial traits to survive proliferate and metastasize evolution explores different paths via random variation and the path that leads to a faster entropy increase is naturally selected as cancer evolves progresses the entropy at the genomic_level increases here we investigate using high_throughput studies whether this is reflected at the transcriptomic level as suggested by if so this may shed light on the path of evolution of the cancer cell before we facilitate the study of the propagation of increased entropy of genome to transcriptome in the cancer cell we first provide a statistical argument that suggests this indeed seems plausible we then present statistical methodology to analyze highthroughput genomic experiments in order to answer the following related_questions bullet is the entropy of a cancer samples transcriptome higher than that of a normal sample bullet is a cancer samples genomic entropy associated to that of its transcriptome these questions are portrayed schematically in we illustrate how the discussed methodology may be utilized by application to multiple datasets we provide statistical motivations for the hypothesis that an increase of the entropy at the genomic_level leads to an increase of the entropy at the for our first motivation we assume that dna_copy and gene_expression are both measured without error and their relation at any loci may be described by a strict monotone increasing function g in addition we note that according to theorem of ramsay any smooth monotone function g x may be represented as where c and c are constants and w is a coefficient function that isto show that h g we first note that the entropies of x and g x are linked via it thus suffices to show that in case g is a linear map g x ax this is immediate to prove the desired inequality for other choices of g we note that appealing to representation the original inequality follows if we prove integration by parts yields the expression levels of two genes that map to these loci furthermore assume that the relation between dna_copy changes and gene_expression at both loci may be described by y x with x and independent e y x x and to reflect the empirical observation that a n increase decrease in dna_copy leads to a n increase decrease in gene_expression theorem then tells us that if locus is more prone to be aberrated at the genomic_level than locus statistically operationalized as x disp x this is reflected in the transcriptome under the assumption of a simple linear_model and locus will exhibit more abnormal expression levels than locus corollary is formulated in terms of the dispersive ordering whereas our interest is in the entropy ordering the relevance of theorem stems from the fact that dispersive ordering implies entropy ordering i e x disp x h x h x corollary is illustrated for the entropy ordering by two examples in the first let n and n all are independent then this difference is non negative in the second example letcauchy and cauchy all are independent then using a result from blyth this difference is non negative analysis results depend to some extent on the normalization method applied it may therefore be argued that we should have preprocessed the data with more than one normalization method in fact we analyzed two different preprocessed version of the singh dataset type_ii one preprocessed by the rma approach ofand the other by the mas approach of affymetrix this yielded comparable significant p values in addition we re analyzed the chitale dataset type i with segmented instead of normalized dna_copy data also leading to identical results for other datasets when preprocessed differently we expect similarly consistent analysis results perhaps more convincing is the fact that e g an entropy difference among normal and cancer is observed over many datasets involving many different tissue_types generated on various platforms and preprocessed with a diverse_array of normalization_methods this despite the fact that normalization aims to remove differences between hybridizations and is thus likely to obscure at least partially the entropy signal in addition results are within tissue type consistent over datasets for type_ii experiments the prostate_cancer datasets chandran kim and singh reveal concordant_results for type i experiments the results of the breast_cancer datasets bergamaschi pollack and zhang all agree in future the data analyzed here dna_copy and gene_expression data will be generated by means of massive_parallel mps apart from the improved_resolution such data will be less noisy and normalization is expected to be less of a nuisance for entropy comparison we provided a motivating statistical argument which suggests that an increase in genomic entropy is reflected in the transcriptome statistical methodology that facilitates the investigation of this hypothesis through analysis of high_throughput dna_copy and gene_expression data is presented the methodology is illustrated on a multitude of datasets from cancers of various tissues in addition the results from analyses of these data suggest that the hypothesis of a related genomic and transcriptomic entropy in cancer has more than only face value
