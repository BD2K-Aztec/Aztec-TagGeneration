netcmpt a network based tool for calculating the metabolic competition between bacterial_species netcmpt is a tool for calculating the competitive potential between pairs of bacterial_species the score describes the effective metabolic overlap emo between two species derived from analyzing the topology of the corresponding metabolic_models netcmpt is based on the emo algorithm developed and validated in previous_studies it takes as input lists of species specific enzymatic_reactions ec numbers and generates a matrix of the potential competition scores between all pairwise combinations availability_and netcmpt is provided as both a web_tool and a software_package designed for the use of non computational_biologists the netcmpt web_tool software examples and documentation are freely_available online atthe availability of many fully sequenced_genomes together with several generic metabolic schemes allows the systematic reconstruction of the metabolic_networks of hundreds of species across the tree of life analyses of the structure and topology of such genome_scale enabled despite ignoring thermodynamic_properties various systematic cross_species studies of lifestyle and evolution in the microbial world beyond studying various aspects of genome_evolution such metabolic driven approaches allow further processing genomic_information into ecological information by using the topological_structure of the network for predicting the biochemical composition of speciesenvironment such reverse ecology approaches predict the set of nutrients a species extract from its environment providing a proxy for its habitat the recently_published netseed web_tool allows to freely calculate the environments of the selected input species on top of predicting the species specific biochemical habitat the systematic inference of biochemical habitats together with the availability of a large collection of species specific metabolic_networks enabled the conductance of several studies indicating that computational systems_biology approaches can be applied to study microbial_ecology in particular network driven approaches allow studying the complex set of interactions microbes form with other species thriving in similar habitats notably within a community of bacterial_species sharing limited resources competitive and cooperative interactions are to a large extent derived by metabolism accordingly a growing number of studies testify for the ability of metabolic driven computational_approaches to describe the metabolic interaction between two species the effective metabolic overlap emo score was introduced by providing a systematic approach for the quantification of the level of competition between bacterial_species through the processing of genomic driven metabolic information several lines of evidence point at the ecological relevance of the emo score as a tool for predicting the metabolic competitive potential between bacterial_species b and supplementary based on the emo algorithm here we provide netcmpta publically available easy to use tool for computing the competitive potential between selected input species notably the emo score is solely aimed at the metabolic dimension while putting aside other aspects and mechanisms of inter_species competition the rapid increase in the number of metagenomic_projects and whole community analysis techniques highlights the need for accessible tools allowing delineating the web of interactions in a given environment netcmpt the first free tool for calculating inter_species competition is available online as a web_tool and software_package at http app agri gov il shiri netcomp php the relevance of the netcmpt tool for analyzing data derived from metagenomic_data was verified through simulations using incomplete datasets supplementary note in this example the pair specific environment of species a and b is composed of metabolite emo score denotes minus the fraction of produced essential metabolites species b cannot produce any of its target metabolites leading to an emo score species a can produce half of its target metabolites leading to an emo score the metabolic environment species c is composed solely of non overlapping metabolites hence species c is not metabolically affected by the presence of the other species
