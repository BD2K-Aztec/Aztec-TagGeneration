exploring single sample snp and indel calling with whole_genome de_novo motivation eugene myers in his string_graph paper suggested that in a string_graph or equivalently a unitig graph any path spells a valid assembly as a string unitig graph also encodes every valid assembly of reads such a graph provided that it can be constructed correctly is in fact a lossless representation of reads in principle every analysis based on whole_genome wgs_data such as snp and insertion_deletion indel calling can also be achieved with unitigs results to explore the feasibility of using de_novo in the context of resequencing we developed a de_novo assembler fermi that assembles illumina short_reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the input reads snps and indels can be called by mapping the unitigs against a reference_genome by applying the method on fold human resequencing data we showed that in comparison to the standard pipeline our approach yields similar accuracy for snp_calling and better results for indel calling it has higher sensitivity than other de_novo based_methods for variant_calling our work suggests that variant_calling with de_novo can be a beneficial complement to the standard variant_calling pipeline for whole_genome resequencing in the methodological_aspects we propose fmd index for forward_backward extension of dna_sequences a fast algorithm for finding all super maximal_exact and one pass construction of unitigs from an fmd index the rapidly decreasing sequencing cost has enabled whole_genome shotgun wgs resequencing at an affordable price many software_packages have been developed to call variants including snps short insertions_and indels and structural_variations svs from wgs_data at present the standard approach to variant_calling is to map raw sequence_reads against a reference_genome and then to detect differences from the reference it is well established and has been proved to work from a single sample to thousands of samples nonetheless a fundamental flaw in this mapping based_approach is that mapping algorithms ignore the correlation between sequence_reads they are unable to take full advantage of data and may produce inconsistent outputs which complicate variant_calling this flaw has gradually attracted the attention of various research groups who subsequently proposed several methods to alleviate the effect including postalignment filtering iterative mapping read realignment and local_assembly however because these methods still rely on the initial mapping it is difficult for them to identify and recover mismapped or unmapped reads due to highsequence divergence long insertions svs copy_number changes or misassemblies of the reference_genome they have not solved the problem from the root another distinct approach to variant_calling that fundamentally avoids the flaw of the mapping based_approach is to assemble sequence_reads into contigs and to discover variants via assembly toassemby alignment it was probably more widely used in the era of capillary sequencing the assembly based method became less used since due to the great difficulties in assembling bp reads but with longer paired_end and improved methodology de_novo is reborn as the preferred choice for variant discovery between small_genomes for variant discovery between human_genomes however the assembly based_approach has not attracted_much assembling a human_genome is far more challenging than assembling a bacterial_genome firstly due to the sheer size of the genome secondly to the rich repeats and thirdly due to the diploidy of the human_genome many heuristics effective for assembling small_genomes are not directly applicable to the human genome_assembly as a result only a few de_novo assemblers have been applied on human short_read among them abyss soapdenovo and sga as of now do not explicitly output heterozygotes although in theory it is possible to recover heterozygotes from their intermediate output it may be difficult in practice as the assemblers may not distinguish heterozygotes from sequencing_errors cortex is specifically_designed for retaining heterozygous variants in an assembly but it may be missing heterozygotes allpaths_lg also paid particular attention to keep heterozygotes but it still has a relatively low sensitivity in addition allpaths_lg only works with reads from libraries with distinct insert_size distributions and prefers read_pairs with mean insert_size below three times of the read_length whereas many resequencing projects do not meet these requirements and thus allpaths_lg may not be applied or work to the best performance even if we also include de_novo assemblers developed for capillary sequence_reads the version of the celera_assembler used for assembling the huref genome is the only one that retains heterozygotes while capable of assembling a mammalian_genome at last one may think to map sequence readswe evaluated fermi on bp paired_end from na the total coverage of the original data is fold but we only used half of them we assembled the fold reads with fermi on a machine with cpus and gb_memory in days the peak memory_usage is gb we obtained unitigs of n bp totaling gb after collapsing most heterozygotes and closing gaps with paired_end we got longer contigs unitigs are short and redundant mainly because they break at heterozygotes for snp and indel calling we aligned unitigs to the reference_genome using bwa_sw with command_line options b q r w we called snps with the samtools caller and called indels by directly counting indels from the pileup output we did not run a standard indel caller as short_read indel callers do not work well with long contig sequences
