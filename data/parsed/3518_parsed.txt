phacts a computational_approach to classifying the lifestyle of phages motivation bacteriophages have two distinct lifestyles virulent and temperate the virulent lifestyle has many implications for phage_therapy genomics and microbiology determining which lifestyle a newly_sequenced phage falls into is currently determined using standard culturing techniques such laboratory work is not only costly_and but also cannot be used on phage_genomes constructed from environmental sequencing therefore a computational_method that utilizes the sequence_data of phage_genomes is needed results phage classification_tool set phacts utilizes a novel similarity algorithm and a supervised random_forest to make a prediction whether the lifestyle of a phage described by its proteome is virulent or temperate the similarity algorithm creates a training_set from phages with known lifestyles and along with the lifestyle annotation trains a random_forest to classify the lifestyle of a phage phacts predictions are shown to have a precision rate availability_and phacts was implemented in the perl programming_language and utilizes the fasta program pearson and lipman and the r programming_language library random_forest liaw and weiner the phacts software is open_source and is available as downloadable stand alone version or can be accessed online as a_user the source_code help files and online version are available at http www phantome org phacts viruses that infect bacteria are called bacteriophages or phages it is estimated that there are bacterial cells in biosphere given that typical ratios of bacteria to phage are on the order of it is estimated that there exist phage_particles on the planet viruses thus are the most abundant biological_entities on the planet phages are ubiquitous and can be found in any environment where their bacterial hosts are present phages are found in high numbers in terrestrial to whom correspondence should be addressed environments such as soil and in aquatic_environments such as lakes and seawater recent estimates suggest that there exist globally million phage species however only a small fraction of phages have so_far been characterized when a phage infects a bacterial cell the phage enters into one of two distinct lifestyles virulent or temperate during a virulent lifestyle a phage infects a bacteria its genome is replicated many times and the newly created copies are released into the surrounding environment through lysis extrusion or budding in contrast during a temperate lifestyle a phage infects a bacteria and either integrates its dna into the bacterial_genome or re circularizes its dna into a stable plasmid the temperate phage will live in this semi stable lifestyle as a prophage as the host_bacteria continues to grow and divide the prophage will be carried through future bacterial cell_divisions until appropriate environmental_conditions cause the temperate phage to enter into a virulent lifestyle and release itself from the host bacterium this switch into a virulent lifestyle is referred to as induction and is generally caused by host cell_damage or environmental_stressors not only does the characterization of phage lifestyles contribute to the understanding of phage population_dynamics genomics and microbiology but also the virulent lifestyle has applications toward phage_therapy and biocontrol previously the lifestyle of a phage was identified through culturing and isolation in the lab this is not only time consuming but also costly with the advent of shotgun_sequencing large_numbers of phage are being sequenced at an increasing rate as the ability to sequence new phages faster than culturing can identify the lifestyle there is a need to computationally annotate genomic_data and also to make predictions about the lifestyle in addition because many of these newly_sequenced are derived from entire environmental community sequencing methods it may not be possible to isolate the phages for culturing computationally classifying phages based on their genomes is difficult due to the highly mosaic organization of their genomes unlike bacteria which have s rrna and various other conserved genes that can be used for taxonomy and phylogeny phages have no universally present gene that can be used for analysis the first attempt at using genomic_data to classify phage by comparing structural proteins does not work well across all clades of phages an alternative methodology was created by rohwer and page
