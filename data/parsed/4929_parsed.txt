wormexp a web_based application for a caenorhabditis_elegans specific gene_expression enrichment_analysis motivation a particular challenge of the current omics age is to make sense of the inferred differential_expression of genes and proteins the most common approach is to perform a gene ontol ogy go enrichment_analysis thereby relying on a database that has been extracted from a variety of organisms and that can therefore only yield reliable information on evolutionary_conserved functions results we here present a web_based application for a taxon specific gene_set exploration and enrichment_analysis which is expected to yield novel functional insights into newly determined gene_sets the approach is based on the complete collection of curated high_throughput gene_expression data_sets for the model nematode_caenorhabditis including gene_sets from more than studies availability_and wormexp is available at http wormexp high_throughput molecular technologies have greatly_enhanced our understanding of biological_processes by characterizing expression changes of genes microarray_and data and proteins proteomics_data or transcription_factor targets and epigenetics states chip_chip and chip_seq these technologies usually yield hundreds_or of differentially_regulated or proteins that are not always easy to interpret validation of the numerous differentially_expressed is usually not possible uncovering the underlying organizational_principles from such large gene_lists requires computational and statistical_approaches as well as precise biological reference information gene_set represents a powerful_tool to link the identified differentially_expressed gene_lists to biological_processes and functions they are based on the statistical_evaluation of the overlap between the generated gene_set and a specified reference list of genes these enrichment_analyses are usually based on public functional genomic_analyses several applications such as gsea and ease have been developed to permit performance of enrichment_analyses with curated gene_sets derived for example from published expression studies in the same organism yet a systematic_assessment of the value of taxon specific enrichment_analyses is still missing wormexp provides a web_resource to explore such an approach for the nematode c elegans this nematode has a well annotated genome_sequence and is widely used as a powerful model_organism in biological_research over the last decade more than high_throughput expression studies have been published covering a large variety of research themes such as immunity aging development and stress_responses the resulting lists of differentially_expressed are publicly_available and can be related to a specific experimental_design environmental condition and or gene defect because they capture a variety of inducible_expression responses of this particular organism they might be highly useful in interpreting new c elegans gene_lists or predicting candidates for downstream_analysis in this manuscript we present wormexp a web_based application for gene_set in c elegans we collated nearly all published highthroughput expression data_sets of c elegans from public_databases and also the available literature we classified these gene_sets in nine categories according to the experimental_designs or specific condition used wormexp accepts wormbase identifiers ids sequence names gene names or a mixture of these as input it offers tools for performing an enrichment_analysis based on the taxon specific gene_sets searching specific gene_lists and downloading complete data_sets
