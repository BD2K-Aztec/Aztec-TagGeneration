structural_bioinformatics assignment of protein_sequences to existing domain and family classification_systems pfam and the pdb motivation automating the assignment of existing domain and protein_family classifications to new sets of sequences is an important task current methods often miss assignments because remote relationships fail to achieve statistical_significance some assignments are not as long as the actual domain definitions because local alignment_methods often cut alignments short long insertions in query_sequences often erroneously result in two copies of the domain assigned to the query divergent repeat sequences in proteins are often missed results we have developed a multilevel procedure to produce nearly complete assignments of protein_families of an existing classification system to a large set of sequences we apply this to the task of assigning pfam domains to sequences and structures in the protein_data pdb we found that hhsearch alignments frequently scored more remotely related pfams in pfam clans higher than closely_related pfams thus leading to erroneous assignment at the pfam family level a greedy_algorithm allowing for partial overlaps was thus applied first to sequence hmm alignments then hmmhmm alignments and then structure alignments taking_care to join partial alignments split by large_insertions into single domain assignments additional assignment of repeat pfams with weaker e values was allowed after stronger assignments of the repeat hmm our database of assignments presented in a database called pdbfam contains pfams for of chains residues clustering proteins of known structures into families or superfamilies is a long_standing task of particular importance in understanding structurefunction relationships and for protein_structure by homology usually protein classification in the pdb is accomplished at the level of domainssubstructures that recur as functional_units in different protein contexts structure based domain classifications of the pdb such as scop and cath are constructed by comparing the available protein_structures in the pdb and creating classifications of new folds and superfamilies manually existing structure based classifications cover only a portion of the pdb the most recent scop release v a is years behind the pdb and only covers of current pdb entries cath was last updated in november and covers of the current pdb sequence based_approaches such as pfam prodom interpro smart and supfam can be readily applied to new structures because most new structures fit into existing sequence clusters in this way they are well suited for rapid and automated classification of new structures in a way that structure based classifications are not some differences between sequence_based and structurebased classifications occur when a single_sequence domain is structurally two or more domains with separate hydrophobic cores or a single structural_domain is two sequence domains structure based_methods are often superior in recognizing remote relationships between families as these relationships may be apparent only from structural_similarity and in the absence of any recognizable sequence_similarity even with structural_information it may be difficult to distinguish between divergent and convergent evolutionary_relationships our aims in this article are two fold first to develop a general procedure that can be used to make rigorous assignments of existing protein_family classification_systems for any set of protein_sequences and second to perform this task for the entire pdb for the pdb we wish to define a method that can be run automatically on a weekly or monthly basis we have thus chosen the sequence_based domain classification given by pfam as new proteins in the pdb can be readily assigned to existing pfams without manual intervention required by structure based classification_systems pfam is a database of protein_families in which each family is represented by a hidden_markov hmm created from manually_curated multiple_sequence the pfam classification of protein_families has gained_widespread among biologists because of its wide coverage of proteins and a sensible naming convention related to protein functions and commonly used names pkinase sh etc pfam was recently used in the protein_structure initiative to select targets and divide them among different high_throughput centres some pfam families are seeded by structures in the pdb two or more related pfam families are grouped into a pfam clan such relationships are often to whom correspondence should be addressed identified through structural_similarity as they are in the structural classification_systems several assignments of pfam domains to the pdb are currently available including pfam itself sifts and the rcsb research collaboratory for structural_bioinformatics covering and of unique_sequences in the pdb respectively each of the currently available sources of pfam assignments to the pdb suffer from one or more of a number of problems first because they use only the original pdb or uniprot sequences against the pfam hmms they miss many potential assignments that occur when the sequence is not closely_related to any single pfam family it is likely that sequence methods based on profileprofile comparison may identify these relationships and provide higher levels of statistical_significance second in some cases these sources also provide completely overlapping assignments sometimes when two different pfams in the same clan align to the same region of a pdb sequence with good e values if we want to cluster at the family level and then the superfamily level this produces discrepancies third some proteins have long insertions relative to the pfam hmm definition and hmmer may produce two alignment segments one on either side of the insertion these two segments cover non overlapping regions of the hmm and together should comprise a single pfam assignment however the publicly_available sources simply list these separately and they cannot easily be distinguished from repeated domains in the same protein fourth some protein_structures are composed of two chains that together comprise a single pfam_domain i e two non overlapping regions of the same pfam hmm pfam sifts and the rcsb do not properly account for domains split by insertions or split between different chains we overcome some of the deficiencies of other pfam databases using several strategies the first is to use consensus_sequences derived from psi_blast profiles and to run these through the pfam hmm library such sequences can be fed to the pfam hmms like any protein_sequence and they usually produce more complete alignments with better e values than the original sequences similar techniques have been used by us previously and by others secondly we utilize hhblits to produce hmms for pdb sequences and their parent uniprot sequences and then apply hmmhmm alignment of these hmms against the pfam hmms using hhsearch the third approach is to utilize structure alignment of statistically confident and complete structures in pfam families with weak hits in the same pfam familieseither those with poor e values and or alignments that cover only a portion of the pfam hmm this allows us to verify whether a weak assignment is correct and to extend short alignments finally we have developed a procedure for optimally combining assignments from these multiple sources into pfam architectures for each protein in the pdb the procedure combines non overlapping or minimally overlapping partial assignments to the same pfam into single assignments thus accounting for large_insertions or domains split across multiple protein_chains we assign additional repeat domains at weaker e values if the same repeat family is assigned earlier in the procedure at an e value better than the general cut_off we explore the properties of the regions and proteins that cannot be assigned to a pfam_domain and the interactions between pfam domains in the biological assemblies of structures in the pdb according to our pfam assignments regions not assigned to pfams have a greater_tendency to be disordered in protein_structures and to have lower rates of regular secondary_structure than regions assigned to pfam domains the number of pfampfam interactions is increased by the number of assignments made using the methods described here but are also critically dependent on the usage of biological assemblies from crystal_structures rather than the asymmetric units the pfam assignments can be searched through the protcid server http dunbrack fccc edu protcid by pdb codes pfam codes and sequences downloadable files of the pfam assignments and those proteins that cannot be assigned are also available on the website_http dunbrack fccc edu protcid pdbfam our procedure is general and can be applied to other domain classification_systems and other target sequence_sets even if the target_sequence set is not the pdb structural_information may still be used for proteins in the sequence set that can be readily aligned with proteins of known structure one potential use for the assignments in pdbfam is in programs that perform searches of the pdb with a query_sequence or structure and return lists of structures that contain similarities to the query above some threshold examples_include fold_recognition servers such as ffas and structure similarity_search servers such as fatcat often the list of hits returned consists solely of the pdb entry and chain residue numbers and sequence or structure alignments it is therefore difficult to know whether the hits are related to each other or whether they share any functional relationship with the query scop and cath designations are sometimes provided which solves the first problem but scop and cath represent less than two thirds of the pdb and their utility for this purpose is therefore limited we believe that our pfam_domain assignments and associated clan information may be used to provide both relationships among the hits shared pfams or clans and functional information of the hits e g pkinase protein domain classification is also useful in the analysis of the interactions of protein_domains with each other our protcid server provides information on clusters of similar interfaces between homologous_proteins or protein pairs in multiple crystal forms in the pdb assignments that are as accurate and complete as possible allow for better identification of biologically_relevant interfaces in multiple crystal forms each pfam in the pdb has a webpage in protcid listing all pdb entries that contain that pfam the chain architecture of the protein containing the pfam and the chain architectures of any other protein_sequences in the same entry thus looking up a pfam in protcid provides information on other domains that the pfam may interact with either within the same chain or in protein_complexes our assignments using pfam have some limitations we have defined a pipeline using a combination of available methods that is relatively efficient and can be applied automatically on a regular basis it is possible that different choices might increase the representation slightly e g different ways of defining the consensus_sequences or the use of several structure alignment programs but the coverage is high as it is and exploring further avenues is likely to be a case of rapidly dwindling returns pfam does not have models for some kinds of proteins for instance about half of the entities amino_acids that do not have pfam assignments in our results are virus proteins especially virus capsids pfam is organized into clans and these may in most cases be useful for inferring structural_relationships at the superfamily level but many clans have hmms of very different lengths therefore the structural_domains are not likely to be completely consistent across clans also it is likely the case that some superfamily relationships evident in scop and cath are missed by the pfam clans we cannot make assignments to many peptides either because the parent uniprot sequence is not known or does not exist or because the peptide belongs to the region of a protein that is not within a pfam_domain it is likely that intrinsically_disordered protein regions have less coverage in pfam than folded domains and many peptides bound to proteins come from these regions nevertheless our assignments cover of unique_sequences in the pdb
