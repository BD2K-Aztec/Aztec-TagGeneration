gene_expression prada pipeline for rna sequencing_data analysis technological_advances in high_throughput necessitate improved computational_tools for processing and analyzing large_scale datasets in a systematic automated manner for that purpose we have developed prada pipeline for rna sequencing_data analysis a flexible modular and highly scalable software platform that provides many different types of information available by multifaceted analysis starting from raw paired_end rna_seq gene_expression levels quality_metrics detection of unsupervised and supervised fusion_transcripts detection of intragenic fusion variants homology scores and fusion frame classification prada uses a dual mapping strategy that increases sensitivity and refines the analytical endpoints prada has been used extensively and successfully in the glioblastoma and renal clear_cell projects of the cancer_genome program availability_and http sourceforge net_projects prada transcriptome_sequencing provides insights into the quantity structure and composition of rna_molecules in a biological_sample analytical_tools for analysis of rna sequencing_data are available but those tools generally focus on single end_points such as quantitation of expression levels or identification of fusion_transcripts as the technology becomes more accessible there is an increased need for computational_pipelines that can process large_numbers of raw rna sequencing_datasets quickly accurately and comprehensively for that purpose we have developed prada pipeline for rna sequencing_data analysis prada was designed to be modular in the functional sense that different modules output different types of information on the transcripts it implements resource management structures such as lsf and pbs allowing quick scale up for processing of thousands of rna_seq samples the power of prada is based on i its scalability ii its mapping to both transcriptomic and genome a distinctive_feature of prada in comparison with other rna analysis tools such as tophat fusion and defuse which rely on alignments of partial reads to identify gene_fusions iii its modularity and iv its comprehensive repertoire of output information from the incorporated modules it enables the user to compute multiple analytical metrics using one software_package and to do so for large_numbers of samples at once in a fully_automated fashion it has been tested on thousands of rna_seq samples from a wide_variety of tumor_types and normal_tissues in tcga prada is designed to be run out of the box with little configuration and is compatible with pbs and lsf compute clusters a single prada tarball including binaries of the packages it relies on a comprehensive and detailed manual and test fastq bam_files are freely_available sourceforge net_projects prada and through galaxy at http toolshed g bx psu edu view siyuan prada funding the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent nci nih supported in part by nci grant number ca chapman foundation dell foundation
