genome_analysis advanced complex_trait motivation the genome_wide complex_trait gcta software_package can quantify the contribution of genetic_variation to phenotypic_variation for complex_traits however as those datasets of interest continue to increase in size gcta becomes increasingly computationally prohibitive we present an adapted version advanced complex_trait acta demonstrating dramatically improved_performance results we restructure the genetic_relationship matrix grm estimation phase of the code and introduce the highly optimized parallel basic linear algebra subprograms blas library combined with manual parallelization and optimization we introduce the linear algebra package lapack library into the restricted_maximum reml analysis stage for a test case with individuals and single_nucleotide snps we reduce the total runtime using a compute node with two multi core intel nehalem cpus from h to min availability_and the source_code is fully available under the gnu public license along with linux binaries for more information see http www epcc ed ac uk software products acta complex_traits are determined by large_numbers of genetic_and as well as their interactions identifying the contributing genes and quantifying their effects in the context of one or multiple environments is of key importance in the development of improved breeding strategies in livestock the identification of therapeutic_targets for animal and human disease and the understanding of how natural and artificial selection shape the genomes of animals and humans genome_wide complex_trait gcta is a freely_available c software_package for quantifying the contribution of genetic_variation to phenotypic_variation for complex_traits this comprises two stages estimation of the genetic_relationship matrix grm which contains a measure of genetic_correlation between individuals and is calculated using single_nucleotide snp data and the use of restricted_maximum reml to maximize the likelihood of the phenotypes given the grm the specific algorithmic implementation in gcta is sub optimal when compiled for modern multi core processors which are discussed in the supplementary_material in this article we present an adapted version of the code advanced complex_trait acta which offers dramatic performance_improvements in section we describe the model used by gcta and present the adaptations performed to the grm estimation and reml analysis stages of the code respectively in section we evaluate and discuss the effects of these developments
