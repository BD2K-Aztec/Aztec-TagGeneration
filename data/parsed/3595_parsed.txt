sequence_analysis poisson factor_models with applications to non normalized microrna profiling motivation next generation nextgen sequencing is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative for transcriptional_profiling as is the case for micro_rnas mirna_profiling and classification mirnas are a new class of molecules that are regulated in response to differentiation tumorigenesis or infection our primary motivating application is to identify different viral_infections based on the induced change in the host mirna profile statistical challenges are encountered because of special_features of nextgen sequencing_data the data are read_counts that are extremely skewed and non negative the total number of reads varies dramatically across samples that require appropriate normalization statistical_tools developed for microarray_expression such as principal_component are sub optimal for analyzing nextgen sequencing_data results we propose a family of poisson factor_models that explicitly takes_into the count nature of sequencing_data and automatically incorporates sample normalization through the use of offsets we develop an efficient algorithm for estimating the poisson factor model entitled poisson singular_value with offset psvdos the method is shown to outperform several other normal ization and dimension_reduction methods in a simulation_study through analysis of an mirna_profiling experiment we further illustrate that our model achieves insightful dimension_reduction of the mirna profiles of samples the extracted factors lead to more accurate and meaningful clustering of the cell_lines gene_expression is at the center of targeted_therapy and rapid disease diagnosis high_throughput or nextgen sequencing has recently_emerged as an alternative platform to hybridization based microarrays for the purpose of gene_transcription profiling for example witten claims that nextgen sequencing is on track to replace microarray as the technology of choice for characterizing gene_expression nextgen sequencing_data have several features that create statistical challenges first of all sequencing_data record the number of reads between a sample and a particular region of interest which are naturally skewed non negative counts with a large number of zeros second the nature of the sequencing_experiment such as technical sequence lane capacity can result in different samples with dramatically different total number of sequence_reads which suggest that the samples need to be normalized in a certain way it is well established that for highthroughput sequencing_data applications poisson_distribution represents an appropriate choice however the predominant form of sequencing_data analysis is to forcefully transform the data and then use statistical_tools that were initially_developed for microarray_data which are continuous and reasonably modeled using normal_distributions with or without transformation this leads to sub optimal results and prompted the development of poisson based_methods different from existing poisson based_methods for analyzing sequencing_data we focus on dimension_reduction i e identifying low_dimensional features or factors in the data genetic_studies usually involve a large number of genetic_markers e g thousands of genes for a small group of samples e g individuals tumor_samples or virus_infected which face the curseof dimensionality dimension_reduction is thus a desirable and sometimes necessary pre_processing and the identified features can then be used as inputs for unsupervised_clustering in this article we specifically take into account the poisson nature of nextgen expression_profiling count_data and develop a new family of poisson factor_models for efficient dimension_reduction on a collection of sequencing samples our approach extends the earlier work ofto automatically address the issue of sample normalization through the use of unknown offset parameters which are simultaneously estimated along with the underlying_factors model identification constraints are derived and incorporated in an efficient alternating estimation algorithm we also introduce poisson factor_models to sequencing analysis and consider follow_up clustering analysis the rest of the article is organized as follows we present our model in section and develop a computationally_efficient estimation algorithm a simulation_study is reported in section to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm as well as to whom correspondence should be addressed several methodological details in section we then illustrate its performance through our primary motivating application micro_rna mirna_profiling mirnas are a class of nt non_coding that are able to post_transcriptionally regulate_gene o b in addition to being heavily skewed mirna nextgen sequencing_data are also sparse because in a typical cell of all known mirnas are expressed and are not the numerical illustrations suggest that our method results in accurate extraction of key features from the sequencing_data which then leads to more meaningful clustering of various experimental cell_lines we conclude the article with some discussion of future work in section we illustrate the performance of our proposed psvdos method through a simulation_study section and an analysis of an mirna sequencing dataset section we compare psvdos with five other svd based_methods svd raw first subtract each entry by the mean of each row and then apply svd to the row centered raw_data svd cuberoot first apply the transformation to take cube root of each entry and then apply svd to the transformed_data rsvd first divide each entry by total_count of each row and then apply svd to the obtained relative frequency data matrix qn svd first apply quantile normalization to each row and then apply svd to the obtained normalized data matrix after row centering psvd apply poisson svd of shen and huang to the raw_data which ignores the existence of offsets the comparison will illustrate the shortcomings of ignoring the poisson count nature of the data as well as the necessity of incorporating sample specific scaling effect through offsets both numerical studies suggest that psvdos performs the best we also show that our data_driven approach can select the number of underlying_factors accurately and stably and that the psvdos algorithm can estimate the offset parameters accurately where the offset matrix t t t n m and the proportion matrix p in log scale follows a four factor svd model with the n left singular vector matrix u the m right singular vector matrix v and the diagonal singular value matrix s containing the four positive singular values as its diagonal entries we simulate n different samples measured on m mirnas displays the true offsets in the log scale which are generated as follows in the log scale they fall into six clusters with distinct cluster means gray dotted lines and are uniformly_distributed around the cluster mean within each cluster the overall mean across the clusters is solid line each offsets cluster membership is displayed with different colors and markers the four diagonal elements of s i e the singular values arenextgen sequencing based mrna and mirna_expression is rapidly gaining_popularity and may eventually replace other methods however it yields a completely different data_structure compared with hybridization based microarray_experiments microarray_based expression_profiling data can with some difficulty be transformed into a dataset that has a normal distribution and is amenable to statistical_tools for pattern discovery and classification nextgen sequencing based expression data cannot expression_patterns of mirnas represent examples of the most skewed expression data that are encountered in thefor this extreme distortion are both technical and biological as only a handful of mirnas tend to dominate the mirna population within cells it offers a practical justification to develop statistical_methods for extreme data profiling mirnas is a novel approach to query cell status and to classify samples in our case different viral_infections hence there exists an urgent need to develop appropriate clustering and classification approaches that take into account the particulars of these data_structures psvd is a factorization method to perform dimension_reduction specifically for poisson count_data it has been applied for data dimension_reduction in non biological_applications such as call_center data in this article we proposed an extended approach psvdos to improve unsupervised_clustering of rnaseq_data by incorporating offset parameters so that necessary normalization of mirna sequencing_data can be automatically accounted for using simulated_data as well as an even sparser experimental example set that highlights variation and limitations of real_world nextgen sequencing_data we show that psvdos was superior to other approaches that separate normalization from dimension_reduction such as svd on cube rooted or relative frequency or the raw counts those normalization_methods are commonly used to eliminate variation because of technical imperfection psvdos correctly clustered samples on the basis of nextgen derived mirna_expression this new approach should help the analysis of nextgen based rnaseq_data in general and mirna based classification of experimental and clinical samples in particular there are several future_research worth pursuing the current poisson factor model uses row specific or cell_line specific offset parameters t i to normalize the cell_lines more generally the offset parameters can be allowed to depend on both the cell_line and the mirna e g denoted as t ij for the ith cell_line and the jth mirna one can then impose some two way analysis_of model on the offsets to model effects of cell_lines and mirnas such as logt ij i j subject to some identifiability constraints such as p i i p j j interaction_terms can also be included if necessary our framework makes use of the poisson distributional nature of the sequencing_data through the poisson likelihood_function the likelihood approach is general and flexible enough that it can be extended to model other distributions for example researchers have noticed that some sequencing count_data exhibit overdispersion with respect to poisson_distribution and propose to use negative_binomial instead see among others anders and huber andin the context of supervised clustering an interesting direction for future_research is to develop an appropriate factor model to address the overdispersion
