sequence_analysis multiple alignment_free motivation recently a range of new statistics have become available for the alignment_free comparison of two sequences based on k tuple word content here we extend these statistics to the simultaneous comparison of more than two sequences our suite of statistics contains first c l and c s l extensions of statistics for pairwise_comparison of the joint k tuple content of all the sequences and second c c s and c geo averages of sums of pairwise_comparison statistics the two tasks we consider are first to identify sequences that are similar to a set of target_sequences and second to measure the similarity within a set of sequences results our investigation uses both simulated_data as well as cis_regulatory module data where the task is to identify cis_regulatory with similar transcription_factor we find that although for real_data all of our statistics show a similar performance on simulated_data the shepp type statistics are in some instances outperformed by star type statistics the multiple alignment_free statistics are more sensitive to contamination in the data than the pairwise average statistics availability our implementation of the five statistics is available as r package named multialignfree at bea cis_regulatory module crm is a stretch of dna in charge of regulating expression of some nearby genes crms typically consist of a few hundred base_pairs and they contain multiple transcription_factor tfbs as crms with similar tfbss may show similar regulatory_patterns a pertinent question is how to classify crm sequences and how to measure the similarity within a set of crm sequences usually the similarity between two crm sequences is assessed by either global or local_alignment a main issue with applying alignment_based for this problem is that tfbss are normally much shorter than the crm and hence the alignment score of two crms may be dominated by the content of their background sequences therefore a high alignment score between two crms may arise without them containing similar tfbss regulatory_patterns moreover especially in distantly_related the crm sequences may simply not be alignable finally alignment_based are time consuming hence crms provide a challenging test case for sequence comparison see also hardison and taylor in contrast alignment_free first proposed by have been developed at a fast pace during the past_two here we focus on alignment_free based on the joint k tuple content of sequences for two sequences a a a a n and b b b b n of letters from a finite alphabet a of size d and for a k tuple word w a k let x w denote the frequency of w in sequence a and similarly x w denote its frequency in sequence b we centralize the word counts based on a probabilistic_model let p i w denote the probability of occurrence of the word w w w w k in the i th sequence i for example when the letters in the underlying sequence are assumed to be drawn independently at random from the identical distribution the i i d model then p i w q k j p i wj where p i wj is the probability of letter w j in the ith sequence in practice p i wj is estimated by the frequency of letter w j in the ith sequence for a word w the centralized count variablesand their approximate standardization measure the deviation of the word frequencies in the sequence from the word occurrence expectation in the so_called background sequences the statistics d and d s for alignment_free comparison of two sequences are now defined byboth c and c s range from to with a value close to when the sequences are closely_related for sequences that do not have the same length the total number of k tuple words could have a large influence on the value of d type statistics and hence for such sequences we use the c type statistics to measure the similarity as crm sequences vary by a few hundred base_pairs in length we only use the c type statistics in our applications variants of our d type statistics have been considered in the literature a main issue with them is that they may be dominated by single_sequence noise in it has been shown that the straightforward non centred statistic d a b p w a k x w x w may be dominated either by noise in the single sequences or by difference in sequence backgrounds thus it has weak power in detecting relationship between two sequences see also a standardized statistics d z d ed sdd was proposed where ed and sdd are the mean and standard_deviation of d under a given model of the sequence it was shown that d z outperforms d yet the noise in the single_sequence may still dominate the statistics d z when the background sequence is not uniform standardizing the count vectors themselves as in d and d s resolves this issue in the work of goke the background sequence model is generalized from i i d to a first order_markov model showing that a first order_markov model improves the ability of detecting similarity between regulatory_sequences compared with the i i d model higher_order markov_chain models could be considered but owing to the limited length of crm sequences estimating the higher_order markov_chain model_parameters leads to an overfitting problem and results in poor_performance gokealso showed that including the reverse complement of a word could increase the prediction_accuracy although the statistics c and c s perform well for pairwise alignment_free in applications the similarity within a set of more than two sequences may be of interest there are two main types of problems to tackle the first problem is an identification problem suppose that we have already classified sequences according to whether they are crms of a particular type and we are presented with a new sequence how should we classify this sequence the second problem is how to assess the similarity within a set of sequences both problems are motivated by the task of predicting sets of related crms given a set of co regulated_genes in the overall similarity within a set of crm sequences is addressed as follows a set of crms known to regulate expression in the same tissue and or development stage is taken as the so_called positive set a set of equally many randomly_chosen sequences with lengths matching the crms is taken as the so_called negative set the positive set is randomly partitioned into two disjoint subsets of equal size and each subset of sequences is concatenated to produce one long sequence the similarity between these sequences can then be assessed using an alignment_free statistic for pairwise sequence comparison recommend d z as this method requires many repeats of the random partitioning it is time intensive and hence alternative_methods are of interest here we extend the renormalized pairwise alignment_free statistics c and c s to two families of multiple statistics denoted by c l and c s l we also introduce three families of average pairwise statistics for the identification problem called c c s and c geo and their versions for measuring similarity within a set of sequences called c c s and c geo we evaluate these families of statistics by testing them on the identification problem described earlier in the text both through a simulation_study and through analysing real_data by using each of our statistics as a score the higher the score the more similar the sequences should be in the simulation_study we follow the common motif model inandbut under a first order_markov model for the background sequence then we apply our statistics to the data fromof tissue_specific enhancer crms identified in vivo in mouse_embryos we also evaluate these families for the task of assessing the similarity within sets of sequences again using both the simulated sequences as mentioned previously and the crm data from our evaluation is based on confidence_intervals ci for the area under the receiver operational characteristic roc_curve auc which is implemented by the r package rocr in in hardison and taylor it is emphasized that it is often the number_of that make crm prediction not very successful hence we also assess the performance of our statistics through cis for the false_positive at sensitivity we say that a statistic outperforms the other if the cis of the former statistic is smaller than the lower_bound of the ci of the latter statistic we find that although for real_data all of our statistics show a similar performance on simulated_data the shepp type statistics are in some instances outperformed by star type statistics the multiple alignment_free statistics are more sensitive to contamination in the data than the pairwise average statistics the article is organized as follows in section we introduce two families of multiple alignment_free statistics called c l and c s l for l moreover three families of average pairwise alignment_free statistics called c c s and c geo are introduced with the identification problem in mind
