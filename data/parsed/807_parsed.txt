structural_bioinformatics boctopus improved topology prediction of transmembrane barrel proteins motivation transmembrane barrel proteins tmbs are found in the outer_membrane chloroplast and mitochondria they play_a in the translocation machinery pore_formation membrane anchoring and ion_exchange tmbs are also promising targets for antimicrobial_drugs and vaccines given the difficulty in membrane_protein structure_determination computational_methods to identify tmbs and predict the topology of tmbs are important results here we present boctopus an improved method for the topology prediction of tmbs by employing a combination of support_vector svms and hidden_markov hmms the svms and hmms account for local and global residue preferences respectively based on a fold_cross test boctopus performs better than all existing_methods reaching a q accuracy of further boctopus predicted the correct number of strands for proteins in the dataset boctopus might also help in reliable identification of tmbs by using it as an additional filter to methods specialized in this task availability boctopus is freely_available as a web_server at http boctopus cbr su se the datasets used for training and evaluations are also available from this site two types of transmembrane_proteins are known to exist helical membrane_proteins and transmembrane barrel proteins tmbs the former class has been the major focus of computational_methods as they are known to constitute of a typical proteome however tmbs are worthy of attention as they play_an in the translocation machinery of both inner and outer_membrane in bacteria chloroplast and mitochondria moreover tmbs are involved in transport of molecules voltage gating membrane anchoring pore_formation and are also candidate molecular_targets for development of antimicrobial_drugs and vaccines however the number to whom correspondence should be addressed of solved tmb structures in pdb is limited since they are difficult to crystalize consequently better computational_methods for the topology prediction of tmbs are needed such a predicted topology can function as a template for experimental_investigations and can further aid in elucidating the structure and function of putative tmbs tmbs typically consist of a central pore region made up of anti_parallel strands and residues in the strands follow a strict dyad repeat pattern the general construction principles of tmbs have been employed for the topology prediction and genome_wide identification of tmbs however the low number of known tmb structures and a less prominent hydrophobicity profile pose problems in the development of computational_methods for the identification and topology prediction of tmbs the computational_methods in the realm of tmbs can be divided_into two parts i methods that aim to identify tmbs from genomic_data and ii methods that predict the tmb topology assuming that the given sequence is a putative tmb the first group consists of a variety of methods including methods that combine statistical propensities and c terminal pattern identification empirical scores k nearest_neighbor methods svms neural_networks hidden_markov hmm amino_acid and secondary_structure element alignments the hhomp method for the identification of tmbs employs hmmprofile comparison and is based on the observation that almost all barrel omp have a common_ancestry methods aiming at the prediction of topologies include hmmbased methods such as pred tmbb tmbhmm and proftmb svm based_methods such as tmbetapred rbf neural_network based_methods such as tmbpro and methods based on statistical_potentials such as transfold proftmb tmbeta net and pred tmbb also predict the topology of the identified tmbs a comparison and evaluation carried_out indicated that hmm based_methods outperform methods based on other types of machine_learning here we present an improved topology predictor for tmbs named boctopus boctopus is based on the ideas used in twopage
