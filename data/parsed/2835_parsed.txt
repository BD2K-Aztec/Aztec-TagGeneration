measurement of genome_wide rna_synthesis and decay_rates with dynamic transcriptome_analysis dta standard transcriptomics measures total cellular rna levels our understanding of gene_regulation would be greatly_improved if we could measure rna_synthesis and decay_rates on a genome_wide level to that end the dynamic transcriptome_analysis dta method has been developed dta combines metabolic rna labeling with standard transcriptomics to measure rna_synthesis and decay_rates in a precise and non perturbing manner here we present the open_source r bioconductor software_package dta it implements all required bioinformatics steps that allow the accurate absolute_quantification and comparison of rna turnover availability dta is part of r bioconductor to download and install dta refer tototal rna levels are a consequence of rna_synthesis and decay these individual contributions can be monitored by dynamic transcriptome_analysis dta dta requires culturing cells in the presence of a labeling substrate e g su or tu during a short non perturbing rna labeling pulse cells incorporate tutp into newly transcribed rna instead of uridine this setup yields three types of rna fractions total cellular rna newly transcribed labeled rna and pre_existing unlabeled rna the quantification of these fractions on microarrays or by rna_seq is used to estimate rna_synthesis and decay_rates on a genome_wide scale assuming exponential_decay for each rna g the synthesis rate g and the decay_rate g are estimated from the equationswhere t is the labeling duration ccl the cell cycle_length and l g u g t g are the measurements of the labeled unlabeled and total_rna fractions respectively can be set to in the case of primary cells e g macrophages it has been shown that dta has higher sensitivity and higher temporal_resolution in detecting gene regulatory changes than standard transcriptomics to whom correspondence should be addressed one of the technical obstacles of standard transcriptomics is the unknown normalization factor between samples i e wild_type cells variations in rna_extraction efficiencies and amplification steps in the biochemical protocol introduce differences in the global intensity levels the estimation of the normalization factors limits the precision of dta we have extended dta to comparative dta cdta to eliminate this obstacle cdta allows for direct comparison of rna_synthesis and decay_rates between samples this is done by mixing an internal normalization standard of schizosaccharomyces_pombe sp cells to samples of wild_type or perturbed saccharomyces_cerevisiae sc cells here we present the r bioconductor_package dta it implements all required methods to estimate rna_synthesis and decay_rates from pre processed microarray or rna_seq measurements of any organisms that are obtained via the dta or the cdta protocol the dta package delivers straightforward methods to estimate rna_synthesis and decay_rates from pre processed microarray or rnaseq measurements that are obtained via the dta cdta protocol the dta package fulfills the high standard of the bioconductor platform regarding documentation and usability it can therefore be easily incorporated in r scripts for pre_processing and further statistical_analysis of the results can readily be carried_out by other methods within the r bioconductor programming environment
