inferring cluster based networks from differently stimulated multiple time course gene_expression data motivation clustering and gene network_inference often help to predict the biological_functions of gene subsets recently researchers have accumulated a large amount of time course transcriptome_data collected under different treatment conditions to understand the physiological_states of cells in response_to and to identify drug responsive_genes although a variety of statistical_methods for clustering and inferring gene_networks from expression_profiles have been proposed most of these are not tailored to simultaneously treat expression data collected under multiple stimulation conditions results we propose a new statistical_method for analyzing temporal_profiles under multiple experimental_conditions our method simultaneously performs clustering of temporal expression_profiles and inference of regulatory_relationships among gene_clusters we applied this method to mcf_human treated with epidermal_growth and heregulin which induce cellular_proliferation and differentiation respectively the results showed that the method is useful for extracting biologically relevant_information availability a matlab_implementation of the method is available fromin this article we propose a new statistical_method for analyzing time course gene_expression data collected under multiple conditions although the probabilistic_model assumed in our method is simple we confirmed that our method can induce biologically_important information furthermore we verified using synthetic data that as the number of experimental_conditions increases the network estimation accuracy improves note that many model based_methods assume some generative_models considering the situation of interest if multiple stimuli are not incorporated into the model the method cannot deal with them methods which do not assume specific probabilistic_models e g k means are comparatively broadly applied in various situations such as multiple stimulation conditions nevertheless we think model based_methods are beneficial because we can extract the nature of the data by investigating estimated parameters of the models state_space model is not the only one suitable for dealing with multiple conditions for example we can make dbn so as to page treat several different conditions by adding new nodes representing the existence of the stimuli to take advantage of differently stimulated multiple time course expression data for inferring gene_networks wet_lab experimental_designs must be carefully considered at the stage of collecting data furthermore it is necessary to further elaborate the statistical_method inferring gene_networks is a very challenging project we believe that collecting comparative temporal_profiles collected under multiple stimulation conditions greatly_facilitates this task
