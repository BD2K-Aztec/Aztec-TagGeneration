genome_analysis rseg an r package to optimize segmentation of snp_array the use of high_density snp_arrays for investigating copy_number in clinical tumor_samples with intra_tumor and varying_degrees of normal_cell imposes several problems for commonly used segmentation_algorithms this calls for flexibility when setting thresholds for calling gains_and in addition sample normalization can induce artifacts in the copy_number ratios for the non changed genomic_elements in the tumor_samples results we present an open_source r package rseg which allows the user to define sample specific thresholds to call gains_and it also allows the user to correct for normalization artifacts affymetrix snp_arrays have been used to estimate genomic copy_numbers in tumor_samples different methods have been developed to segment the genome into contiguous regions that share the same copy_number on average these include cbs glad and more recently ultrasome ultrasome is the fastest method and gives similar output as cbs however ultrasome does not allow to correct for artifacts induced by the normalization of the arrays in fact when there is an imbalance between gains_and commonly used normalization_methods like quantile and invariant set normalization introduce a systematic shift in the copy_numbers estimated for normal regions so that they appear as if they have an altered copy_number that is if a sample contains only two different copy_numbers then normalization will make the regions with no change in copy_number appear as being slightly lost or gained cf patient a in while this problem could potentially be overcome using a different normalization procedure an alternative would be to use the intensities distribution to correct for it generally segmentation_algorithms apply a common threshold for calling gains_and for all investigated samples however when applied to tumor_samples this often imposes a problem as several to whom correspondence should be addressed sample specific factors like the level of normal_cell intra_tumor and technical noise affects the resolution with which different copy_number levels can be discerned this calls for an option to set sample specific thresholds in this article we describe an r package that guides the user through the segmentation of each sample histograms of the log_ratio copy_number between a tumor and its matched germline sample can distinguish between different copy_numbers represented by different peakscf therefore by modeling each peak and by selecting the peak representing segments with no copy_number change and its neighbors correction for the normalization induced copy_number and optimal thresholds for calling gains_and can be statistically defined
