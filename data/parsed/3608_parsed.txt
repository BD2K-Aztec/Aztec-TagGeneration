popins population scale detection of novel sequence insertions motivation the detection of genomic structural_variation sv has advanced tremendously in recent_years due to progress in high_throughput novel sequence insertions insertions without similarity to a human_reference have received less attention than other types of svs due to the computational challenges in their detection from short_read sequenc ing data which inherently involves de_novo de_novo is not only computation ally challenging but also requires high_quality data although the reads from a single individual may not always meet this requirement using reads from multiple_individuals can increase power to detect novel insertions results we have developed the program popins which can discover and characterize non reference insertions of bp or longer on a population scale in this article we describe the approach we implemented in popins it takes as input a reads to reference alignment assembles unaligned reads using a standard assembly tool merges the contigs of different individuals into high_confidence sequences anchors the merged sequences into the reference_genome and finally genotypes all individuals for the discovered insertions our tests on simulated_data indicate that the merging step greatly_improves the quality and reliability of predicted insertions and that popins shows significantly better recall and precision than the recent tool mindthegap preliminary_results on a dataset of icelanders demonstrate the practicality of the new approach availability_and the source_code of popins is available from http github com bkehr popins the latest_version of the human_reference grch is of a remarkable quality however the sequence of a single individual is inherently different from the reference due to sequence_diversity some sequences are missing in the reference as they are not present in the individuals from whom the reference was constructed alternate haplotypes have been added to the reference_genome to account for highly variable_regions but they cover only a small part of the variation the variable_regions are of great biological and medical interest since their sequence_diversity is known to affect phenotypes including numerous_diseases thus the characterization of differences to the reference_genome is a major task differences between human_genomes include single_nucleotide snps small_indels and structural_variants svs one type of svs which affect a larger piece of sequence than indels v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com are insertions insertions can be further classified into duplications and novel sequence insertions duplications are insertions of sequence also present elsewhere in the genome e g mobile_elements the focus of this work is on novel sequence insertions insertions of unique_sequence that is not similar to other regions of the reference_genome the evolutionary origin of a novel sequence insertion may be explained by two types of events on the one hand it may be an addition of sequence to the genome of a sequenced individual e g lateral transfer or viral_genome insertion on the other hand it may as well be a deletion of sequence in the individuals used to contruct the reference in order to successfully associate genetic_differences with phenotypes large_numbers of individuals are necessary with the enormous improvements in sequencing_technology recent_years have seen a marked_increase in large_scale efforts that aim at discovering variation at a population level e g the hapmap project the genomes projects genomes and the genome of the netherlands project the achievements of these efforts have been the characterization of a great number of snps indels and deletions but comparatively fewer novel insertions for example reported only novel insertions in contrast to deletions in their release set one reason for a smaller number of insertions discovered is the fact that their detection from short_read sequencing_data is challenging unlike detection of other types of variation insertion detection requires a de_novo typical genotype callers such as gatk or freebayes use only reference aligned read_pairs and therefore are not suitable for calling insertions longer than the reads sequencing_technologies that yield longer_reads show promise in simplifying insertion detection but they are still not commonplace nor cost_effective on a large_scale thus insertions remain one of the most challenging types of variation to detect strategies for detecting insertions incorporate either a local_assembly of unknown sequence not present in the reference_genome or a whole genome_assembly a whole genome_assembly needs to be followed by a comparison step of the assembled_contigs to the reference_genome for identifying the insertions in the local_assembly strategy the positions of the insertions need to be identified either before or after assembly for example the strategy implemented in the program mindthegap first identifies candidate insertion_sites without a read_alignment before initiating local assemblies whereas the novelseq approach first assembles unaligned reads before anchoring them in the genome both the whole_genome and the local_assembly strategies face difficulties when integrating the results of many individuals this issue is most pronounced in de_novo whole genome_assembly strategies and thus has previously been addressed suggested a reference guided whole genome_assembly approach that makes the results of several samples more compatible developed cortex a program that rigorously assembles the whole genomes of several individuals at the same time based on colored de_bruijn however the tests in the cortex paper were limited to relatively few individuals or to pooled data furthermore all whole genome_assembly strategies commonly suffer from a considerable demand for computational_resources in addition the assembly problem demands high coverage data assemblies from lowcoverage data are typically incomplete i e fragmented and with significant portions of the sequences missing hence the application of any of the mentioned approaches on a dataset from a single individual sequenced at insufficient coverage results in a largely incomplete set of insertions polymorphic insertions with low_frequency in a population are particularly hard to detect as they are likely to appear only at heterozygous loci additionally incomplete assemblies lead to greater difficulties in comparing and integrating sets of insertions across multiple_individuals if not carefully considered at the population level all this can add to an underestimation of allele_frequencies less power to detect rare insertions and may eventually impede association with phenotypes despite the caveats mentioned the task of analyzing large_numbers of individuals can also aid in the detection of insertions insertions that occur within many individuals have an increased total coverage across the whole dataset if used in the assembly step this may reduce fragmentation and fill in gaps of the insertion_sequences the larger the number of individuals the more likely it is that we can capture low_frequency insertions thus instead of merging insertions detected from many individuals we can take advantage of all individuals during the detection of insertions we have developed an approach for characterizing insertions across a large number of individuals simultaneously using a local_assembly strategy we start by assembling per individual_reads that do not align to the reference_genome subsequently we merge the assemblies into a multi individual contig set of higher quality each contig in this set is then placed into the reference_genome using readpair and split_read information finally we propose a genotyping procedure that determines for each individual the number of copies it carries of an insertion in its diploid_genome we have implemented the approach in a program called popins our tests on simulated_data indicate that merging of single individual assemblies increases the quality of insertion_sequences by a comparison to mindthegap confirms that we greatly benefit in recall from the merging step and that our approach is precise an additional test on data from whole genomes obtained with illumina sequencers demonstrates its practicality on real_data we implemented our solutions to the merging positioning and genotyping subproblems in a program called popins using the seqan c library we assess the performance of popins on the simulated dataset compare its results to that of the program mindthegap and demonstrate its practicality on the data of icelanders supplementary section s andsummarizes the results of popins on our simulated dataset the unaligned reads assemble into an average of contigs per individual which align to of the simulated insertion_sequences using stellar with a minimal length of and a maximal error_rate of after merging the supercontigs align to of the simulated insertion_sequences with anchoring read_pairs we find approximate locations for all supercontig ends the anchoring score always points to the correct location if multiple_locations are suggested for supercontigs popins findsthe column full sequence both ends considers only those predictions where no more than bp are missing from one of the insertion_sequences ends or both ends are positioned genotyped the column partial_sequence at least end includes also predictions where one end of the insertion_sequence is truncated or only one end is positioned or correctly genotyped the numbers include one insertion_sequence that is split into two supercontigs an exact insertion position for both ends using split_reads for the remaining five supercontigs popins finds an exact insertion position only for one end these supercontigs turn out to be truncated with respect to the insertion_sequence by five or more base_pairs at the other end finally popins genotypes ends of insertions in all individuals correctly reports a false position as heterozygous in individuals and discards false positions in all individuals by typing them as homozygous reference in relation to the single individual insertions this yields a recall of and a precision of after genotyping when counting only those insertions where both ends are fully characterized supplementary section s provides further details of our evaluation on simulated_data furthermore we made an experiment of pooling the unaligned reads of all individuals before assembly with velvet using the same parameters except for an extended coverage window of this yields only contigs a small number possibly_reflecting assumptions made by velvet e g on even coverage a program that was developed for whole genome_assembly of a single individual we have introduced popins a method for discovering and genotyping novel sequence insertions popins takes_advantage of the information provided by many individuals increasing the quality of the insertion_sequences and significantly improving on our ability to determine the correct insertion position our local_assembly approach reduces computational requirements as compared to wholegenome assembly on the downside our approach depends on a read_alignment and thus will be biased against the reference the major novelty of our approach is the addition of a merging step to a local_assembly strategy the merging subproblem is per se an assembly problem but significantly different from the classical genome_assembly problem the input_sequences of the merging subproblem are themselves assembled_contigs and hence can contain artifacts from misassemblies in addition they vary in length and we expect them in the best case not to be much shorter than the supercontigs similar to transcriptome_assembly the coverage is uneven depending on the number of individuals that are carriers of an insertion and finally more than two haplotypes are possible for each insertion locus as the contigs originate from many individuals nevertheless our solution to the merging subproblem is similar to the overlap_layout olc approach for genomeassembly the use of the union find data_structure is similar to the graph used in the overlap phase of olc approaches our sets of contigs correspond to connected components in this graph our approach differs from the olc approach in the layout phase by allowing for branching components when constructing supercontigs when finding insertion positions popins greedily clusters anchoring read_pairs by location while other sv_detection methods solve a maximum clique problem our approach can lead to very long intervals for a single location but since we cluster the anchoring read_pairs only per contig and not over the whole dataset we observe only very few abnormally long intervals we discard these applying a length threshold as they are unlikely to lead to a clear insertion position in our evaluation we were not always able to find the insertion position for both contig ends which can have several reasons if we find a single location with anchoring read_pairs but no clear position with split_reads the contig is likely not to contain the whole insertion the split alignment algorithm we used penalizes all gaps in the reference allowing for a large_gap in both the reference and the reads may help in narrowing down the position of these insertions another reason may be non unique_sequence being inserted together with the novel sequence the set of unaligned reads will not assemble into contigs of non unique_sequence e g mobile_elements thus these are missing in our approach in many cases this leads to many low scoring locations suggested by read_pairs that anchor to known occurrences of the repeated_sequence finally we observe read_pairs connecting several contigs suggesting insertions of novel sequence interspersed with non unique_sequence an additional scaffolding step of supercontigs would be necessary to fully characterize these cases in many cases we observe the same short sequence repeated at the two ends of an insertion often referred to as target_site duplications if the repeated_sequences become too long our genotyping approach has difficulties in distinguishing the reference allele from the alternate allele this may potentially be improved by focusing the computation on the unique part of the sequence our results on simulated_data do not reflect all of these limitations of popins that are due to the complex structure of real genomic_sequences still we could show the practicality of the approach on real_data where it yields many novel sequence insertions therefore we are expecting a rich set of polymorphic insertion when applying popins to a larger number of individuals which will open up the door to include novel sequence insertions in genomewide_association conflict of interest none declared
