bioinformatics_discovery structural_bioinformatics human structural proteome_wide characterization of cyclosporine a targets motivation off target interactions of a popular immunosuppressant cyclosporine a csa with several proteins besides its molecular target cyclophilin a are implicated in the activation of signaling_pathways that lead to numerous side_effects of this drug results using structural human_proteome and a novel algorithm for inverse ligand_binding prediction ilbind we determined a comprehensive set of putative partners of csa we empirically show that predictive quality of ilbind is better compared with other available predictors for this compound we linked the putative target_proteins which include many new partners of csa with cellular_functions ca nonical pathways and toxicities that are typical for patients who take this drug we used complementary approaches molecular_docking molecular_dynamics surface_plasmon binding analysis and enzymatic_assays to validate and characterize three novel csa targets calpain caspase and p map_kinase the three targets are involved in the apoptotic_pathways are interconnected and are implicated in nephrotoxicity first identified in cyclosporine a csa was purified from the fungus tolypocladium inflatum this drug is primarily used an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection in solid organ_transplants the mechanism of action of csa involves binding to its therapeutic_target cyclophilin a and forming a complex with calcineurin cyclophilin a is a peptidylprolylisomerase located in the cytoplasm that is inhibited by binding of csa peptidylprolylisomerases are involved in the isomerization of proline peptide_bonds in oligopeptides and allow accelerated folding of a protein calcineurin is a calcium calmodulin dependent serine_threonine protein_phosphatase that is specifically involved in the dephosphorylation of transcription_factors involved in signaling_events including nuclear_factor nfat the binding of csa to cyclophilin and calcineurin prevents the dephosphorylation of nfat thwarting transit to the nucleus nfat is critical for initiation of promoters that stimulate the production and activation of t cells consequently the immune_response is shut down csa is also used to treat several disease_states including heart_failure psoriasis and rheumatoid_arthritis unfortunately use of csa is associated with severe side_effects including nephrotoxicity fibrosis hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity and their mechanistic_details remain_unclear csa was shown to interact with many proteins other than its molecular target cyclophilin a these off target interactions could be involved in the activation of signaling_pathways that lead to the undesirable symptoms and their knowledge could be exploited in other disease_states as a few examples csa induced_nephrotoxicity involves renal_tubular dysfunction that is thought to result from a blockade of the mitochondria permeability_transition component cyclophilin d csa also causes endoplasmic_reticulum er_stress by inhibiting the er localized cyclophilin b and indirectly activates other proteins such as tgf that is involved in fibrosis motivated by the ubiquity of the proteincsa interactions we used inverse ligand_binding predictions to comprehensively determine putative partners of csa this prediction uses structures of a few proteinligand drug complexes in our case the available csacyclophilin complexes to predict other targets of csa on the structural human_proteome scale the predictions were generated with the ilbind method that was recently shown to accurately find distant targets targets that have structurally different folds compared with the proteins that are known to interact with the given compound for a diverse set of small organic ligands similar inverse ligand_binding based_approaches that used older predictors were used to find novel targets for other compounds such as comtan cholesteryl_ester cetp inhibitors and raloxifene we empirically show that predictive_performance of ilbind is better when compared with other available predictors we assessed selected top_ranked putative partners of csa in the to whom correspondence should be addressed we performed a large_scale structural human proteome_wide study to find protein off targets of csa using state of the art computational_method ilbind we empirically demonstrate that predictions generated by ilbind offer good predictive_performance we compiled a comprehensive list of putative targets of this drug and then linked these targets with an assortment of cellular_functions canonical pathways and toxicities which are typical for patients who take csa we used a complementary arsenal of approaches including ilbind molecular_dynamics molecular_docking spr and enzymatic_assays to identify and characterize in detail three novel targets of csa we show that csa likely binds to and may be an exogenous agonist of capn and mapk and that it also activates casp but to a lesser extent a detailed discussion of the functional_roles of these interactions is provided in the supplementary_materials our study may also lead to new discoveries for a wide_range of toxic responses to csa for which we found previously_unknown putative proteins targets moreover our pipeline could be used to provide insights into side_effects and mechanisms of action of other small_molecule that target_proteins
