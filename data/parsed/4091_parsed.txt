rule_based modeling with virtual cell rule_based modeling is invaluable when the number of possible species and reactions in a model become too large to allow convenient manual specification the popular rule_based software_tools bionetgen and nfsim provide powerful modeling and simulation capabilities at the cost of learning a complex scripting language which is used to specify these models here we introduce a modeling tool that combines new graphical rule_based model specification with existing simulation engines in a seamless way within the familiar virtual cell vcell modeling environment a mathematical_model can be built integrating explicit reaction_networks with reaction rules in addition to offering a large choice of ode and stochastic solvers a model can be simulated using a network free approach through the nfsim simulation engine availability_and available as vcell versions and later at the virtual cell web_site vcell org the application installs and runs on all major platforms and does not require registration for use on the users computer tutorials are available at the virtual cell website and help is provided within the software source_code is available at sourceforge the traditional approach for modeling reaction_networks requires explicit specification of all molecular_species and reactions therefore a reaction_network developed manually by the modeler can include only a limited number of species and reactions and cannot capture the combinatorial complexity of many cell signaling_systems the rule_based modeling_approach overcomes this limitation by providing a compact model description that is capable of accounting for all the potential molecular complexes and interactions among them that can be generated during a response to a signal without explicit enumeration in this approach molecular_interactions and their effects are represented in the form of reaction rules that serve as generators of molecular_species and reactions a model is defined as an initial set of species with non zero amounts seed species a set of reaction rules operating on seed species and a set of observables that define computed outcomes of simulations every rule in the set is applied to those species among the seed species that can be selected as reactants generating proper well defined reactions and an extended set of species seed species and species that are products of these reactions the set of rules is again applied to this extended set of species to generate even more reactions and more species during network generation this process is iteratively repeated until no new species and reactions are generated or until a specified termination condition is reached producing a reaction_network that can be then simulated using deterministic or stochastic_methods during networkfree simulations individual particles rather than populations of identical species are stochastically tracked over time without the need to explicitly enumerate all possible species and reactions the rule_based modeling_approach was implemented in numerous modeling and simulation tools such as bionetgen software and simmune v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com for simulations following network generation kasim and nfsim for network free simulations rule_based are often described using scripting languages such as bionetgen language bngl used by bionetgen and nfsim kappa language used by kasim ml rules python scripts etc modeling with scripting languages requires considerable mathematical and or computational expertise and has a steep learning_curve writing such scripts although easier than writing a program in a computer language and usually aided by a set of tutorials may be difficult for beginner modelers without programming experience writing a script is also an error_prone process where a simple typo can lead to a valid model that implements an unexpected mechanism different from the intended one while a reaction_network model can be verified by checking every species and reaction such verification may be impossible for a model specified by rules because the generated network may include thousands of species and reactions and it can be too large for manual tracking and validation thus preventing errors is a critical issue in rule_based modeling here we present a novel tool that makes rule_based modeling easier by i providing a graphical_user for specification and simulation of rule_based eliminating the need to use a scripting language ii preventing errors in model specification by constructing model elements through verified components and extensive built in automatic updating and verification algorithms of the model after any edits additionally we allow user to link specified reaction_networks and rules together where a species can be a part of a reaction_network and participate in a rule at the same time ordinary species and reactions are not required to be encoded in a script as trivial rules rather they can be specified and visualized graphically another feature is an explicit unit system where a modeler is guided to distinguish between molecules and concentrations thus avoiding situations when an inexperienced modeler may use concentrations in place of particle numbers for stochastic_simulations the tool is implemented within the virtual cell vcell modeling and simulation framework
