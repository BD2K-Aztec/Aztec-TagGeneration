structural_bioinformatics a holistic in silico approach to predict functional sites in protein_structures motivation proteins execute and coordinate cellular_functions by interacting with other biomolecules among these interactions proteinprotein including peptide mediated proteindna and proteinrna interactions cover_a of critical processes and cellular_functions the functional characterization of proteins requires the description and mapping of functional biomolecular_interactions and the identification and characterization of functional sites is an important step towards this end results we have developed a novel computational_method multi vorffip mv a tool to predicts protein peptide dna and rna binding_sites in proteins mv utilizes a wide_range of structural evolutionary experimental and energy based information that is integrated into a common probabilistic_framework by means of a random_forest ensemble classifier while remaining competitive when compared with current methods mv is a centralized resource for the prediction of functional sites and is interfaced by a powerful web_application tailored to facilitate the use of the method and analysis of predictions to non expert end_users in order to fulfill their cellular_functions proteins interact with other proteins and biomolecules proteinprotein_interactions including peptide mediated_interactions are the basis of the formation of macromolecular_complexes required to coordinate and perform complex cellular_functions as well as the regulation and coordination of signaling_pathways proteindna_interactions mediate a wide_range of cellular_functions including gene_expression and regulation dna_replication dna_repair and dna_recombination likewise proteinrna interactions are central to a number of crucial cellular_processes such to whom correspondence should be addressed as post_translational gene_regulation protein_synthesis alternative_splicing and rna_processing and metabolism thus deciphering and dissecting biomolecular_interactions are central to fully understand the function of proteins and their role in cells furthermore the prediction of functional sites can be used to improve the selection of structural_models residues located in functional sites present a number of unique_structural and physicochemical_properties that vary across the different types of interfaces e g protein binding interfaces are different from dna_binding ones these distinctive_features are used by a number of computational_tools to predict binding_sites a common_denominator for most of recent computational_methods is the use of machinelearning algorithms to combine heterogeneous information this is mainly because simple or composite scoring_functions are either not suitable or cannot be fully optimized due to the incomplete understanding of the biophysical events underpinning interactions between biomolecules thus statistical_models are better to combine and unify data of diverse nature and a number of methods have been proposed to predict protein peptide dna rna binding_site and more generally functional sites in this work we present multi vorffip mv a structurebased machine_learning computational_method developed to predict four different types of interactions or functional sites in proteins proteinprotein proteinpeptide proteindna and proteinrna binding_sites mv integrates a wide_range of structural evolutionary energy based and experimental_data i e crystallographic b factors into a common probabilistic_framework the different functional sites e g peptide binding_sites are predicted using statistical_models developed and tailored to that end the method compares_favorably with recently described methods moreover the mapping of functional sites e g proteinand dna_binding within the same protein is highly_accurate and selective mv is accessible through a user_friendly web_application available at http www bioinsilico org mvorffip the web_application features a powerful and convenient graphic interface that allows the visualization and analysis of the different predictions simultaneously the algorithm has been trained using four different types of interactions proteinprotein peptide protein dnaprotein rnaprotein interactions bs binding sitea novel computational_method mv has been developed to predict protein peptide dna and rna binding_sites mv has been compared with recently published_methods that predict individual types of interactions with a positive outcome the structural mapping of functional sites is highly_selective allowing multiple sites to be predicted with high_accuracy and reliability a user_friendly web_application has been developed to easily access to the method prediction results are readily available for download or can be analyzed within the same web_browser by using a web_application and a special graphic visualization viewer
