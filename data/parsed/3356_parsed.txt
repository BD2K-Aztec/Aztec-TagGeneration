opensegspim a user_friendly segmentation tool for spim data opensegspim is an open_access and user_friendly d automatic quantitative analysis tool for single plane illumination microscopy data the software is designed to extract in a user_friendly way quantitative relevant_information from spim image_stacks such as the number of nu clei or cells it provides quantitative measurement volume sphericity distance intensity on light_sheet fluorescent microscopy_images availability_and freely_available fromsingle plane illumination microscopy spim was developed in by stelzer and colleagues to image d live developing embryos further improvements have been made by and more recently intrinsic to the concept of spim was low phototoxicity and photodamage development on spim technology over the last years has led to the more general term of light_sheet fluorescent_microscopy lsfm to describe this imaging_technique the advent of openspim and openspin has opened a new era in lsfm these two projects provide detailed information and resources to allow any scientist to build and start lsfm importantly these open projects are associated with websites and the ability to interact with the developers here we provide_details of an image_processing tool opensegspim which is made available on the same basis as openspin and openspim the combination of openspin openspim and opensegspim allows image generation to be connected to image_processing allowing the automated extraction of quantitative information from lsfm images lsfm generates large_numbers of raw image_stacks gigabytes going to terabytes in a time series that require initial processing_steps such as registration of multiple view and deconvolution to reconstruct the data acquisition visualization and quantitative analysis are the milestones to go from a biological_sample to quantitative results we propose opensegspim here as a user_friendly to perform the quantitative analysis step to obtain the information on a cell by cell basis the objects in the d stacks should be separated from each other i e segmented before further quantitative analysis a variety of algorithms are available for segmentation of nuclei including watershed iterative voting methods level set approach based on gradient flow and flexible contour model however the implementation of these algorithms to segment lsfm data is not straightforward due to complex installation procedures or difficulty in tuning the parameters for individual biological_samples moreover a good segmentation result relies not only on an efficient segmentation_algorithm but also on a sequence of steps preparing the image so that thesegmentation algorithm can perform efficiently therefore putting all these steps together requires a systematic_design of the pipeline and the interface currently few graphical_user are specifically_designed for nuclei segmentation in d especially cell aggregates modular interactive nuclei segmentation was developed as a user_interface to segment early mouse_embryo but it is only available for matlab license owner dedicated effort is urgently_needed to build user_friendly interface for lsfm users
