bioimage_informatics a benchmark for comparison of cell_tracking algorithms motivation automatic tracking of cells in multidimensional time lapse fluorescence_microscopy is an important task in many biomedical_applications a novel framework for objective_evaluation of cell_tracking algorithms has been established under the auspices of the ieee international symposium on biomedical_imaging cell_tracking challenge in this article we present the logistics datasets methods and results of the challenge and lay down the principles for future uses of this benchmark results the main contributions of the challenge include the creation of a comprehensive video dataset repository and the definition of objective_measures for comparison and ranking of the algorithms with this benchmark six algorithms covering a variety of segmentation and tracking paradigms have been compared and ranked based on their performance on both synthetic and real_datasets given the diversity of the datasets we do not declare a single winner of the challenge instead we present and discuss the results for each individual dataset separately availability_and the challenge web_site www codesolorzano com celltrackingchallenge provides access to the training and competition datasets along with the ground_truth of the training videos it also provides access to windows and linux executable files of the evaluation software and most of the algorithms that competed in the challenge cell_migration is an essential process in normal_tissue development tissue_repair and disease the dynamics of cell movement e g speed directionality and migration type i e the morphological changes that the cell undergoes during the movement are closely_related to the biomechanical_properties of the surrounding environment therefore accurate quantification of both is the key to understanding the complex mechanobiology of cell_migration traditionally cell_migration experiments have been performed in two dimensions d using phase or differential_interference microscopy nowadays it is increasingly acknowledged that proper evaluation of the cellular movement as well as related forces requires looking at the cells in their three_dimensional d tissue environment this can be done by taking_advantage of the versatility of fluorescence labeling and the optical_sectioning capability of multidimensional fluorescence in vivo microscopy fluorescence_microscopy has several advantages e g multidimensionality specificity however tracking fluorescent cells poses specific challenges compared with more traditional phase contrast enhancing techniques non homogenous staining low signal tonoise ratio uneven background illumination photobleaching phototoxicity etc moreover an

permissions_oup com staining is the cell to cell intensity variability caused by differential transfection_efficiency therefore tracking of fluorescent cells requires specialized tools several methods have been described for the segmentation of cells in static d fluorescence microscopy_images these methods have been extended to account for the temporal variable in multidimensional timelapse microscopy combining accurate segmentation of the cells with proper tracking of their movements and lineage events e g apoptosis mitosis cell merging and overlapping they can be classified into two broad categories tracking by detection and tracking by model evolution in the former paradigm cells are first detected in all the frames of the video independently using gradient features intensity or wavelet_decomposition subsequently an optimization strategy such as multiple hypothesis tracking integer_programming dynamic_programming magnusson and jaldenjalden or coupled minimum cost flow tracking is used to determine the most likely cell correspondence between frames in the latter paradigm cells are segmented and tracked simultaneously using the final_result of each frame as the initial condition for the analysis of the following frame this is mostly done by evolving the contours of the cells represented either parametrically or implicitly using a velocity term defined by the content of the target frame e g gradient features or intra_and region heterogeneity and by the internal properties of the evolved contours e g mean curvature shape or topology the main benefit of the first paradigm is the mutual independence of detection and association steps which allows straightforward tracking of new cells entering the field of view as well as forward_backward spatiotemporal data association on the contrary the tracking by model evolution approaches is popular for easy accommodation of morphological and behavioral clues into the model to inherently deal with the topologically flexible behavior of live cells bridging both paradigms together to take advantage of their benefits proposed a complex cell_tracking system that combines a fast level set framework with a local spatiotemporal data association step the tracking_methods described until this date have been tested in one or few private datasets using different metrics and have seldom been compared against other algorithms a noteworthy attempt toward a formalization of the evaluation of cell_tracking algorithms was described by they compared a novel cell_tracking strategy to a publicly_available probabilistic tracker using a customized tracking measurement and mostly publicly_available data similarly partly addressed this issue by providing a method for the validation of the accuracy of cell_tracking results and a dataset composed of two manually_annotated brightfield microscopy videos finally two recent_studies presented two rigorous comparisons of algorithms developed for the segmentation of fluorescently_labeled cells from static d images using their own image repositories and adapted accuracy_measures the limitations of these studies such as being monomodality using d or static images one or two cell_types only or comparing with none or few competing algorithms highlight the need for common standards to evaluate new and existing algorithms bearing this in mind we organized the first cell_tracking challenge http www codesolorzano com celltrackingchallenge hosted by the ieee international symposium on biomedical_imaging isbi http www biomedicalimaging org in this article we present the methods used in the challenge briefly describe the competing algorithms and report on the results of the comparison which was based on common accuracy_measures and datasets covering a wide_variety of scenarios of live_cell in fluorescence_microscopy in the next paragraphs we will discuss the main contributions of the challenge datasets we have created a public data repository composed of annotated time lapse sequences obtained from conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopes along with realistic computer simulations of moving nuclei the cell_types selected are relevant in the context of cell_migration being cells with stem like properties involved in embryonic and adult organ_development and homeostasis or cancer_cell with metastatic properties these videos cover a wide_variety microscopy and experimental_setups cell_density and motility resolution image_quality and dimensionality there are d sequences of nuclearly stained cells commonly used in cell_population studies e g n dl hela and d sequences of cytoplasmically stained cells more appropriate for single_cell studies that demand a realistic rendering of the cellular_environment e g c dl mda the characteristics of the videos in terms of contrast resolution and signal_to are also diverse covering conditions ranging from those that could be considered high_quality i e high_numerical lens homogeneous and bright fluorescent staining to conditions that could be classified as high_throughput i e low magnification low numerical aperture lens heterogeneous and dim fluorescent staining all real videos used in the competition were manually_annotated at three different sites and a final ground_truth per video was generated using a majority_voting approach to account for intersubject_variability the two additional simulated_datasets provide an absolute ground_truth for the comparison of the algorithms eliminating the possible bias introduced by the annotators of the real videos measures and rankings key to the establishment of a credible benchmark is the use of common measures for algorithm evaluation and comparison we have described and used measures that account for two aspects of the cell_tracking problem segmentation and tracking accuracy the segmentation accuracy measure was based on the jaccard similarity_index which evaluates how close the cell segmentations are to the ground_truth tracking accuracy was evaluated using a novel measure based on matching acyclic oriented graphs this method automatically assesses the difficulty of transforming a computed graph into the ground_truth reference the difficulty is measured as the weighted_sum of the least number of operations needed to make the graphs identical therefore the tracking accuracy was measured by one comprehensive scalar measure whereas in most previous_works it required evaluating multiple_measures to characterize various cell_tracking events the weights are not biologically_motivated therefore the measure is application independent the highest weight is put on missing nodes in the weighted_sum therefore the ability of the method to detect all the cells is important for achieving low score because both parameters i e segmentation and tracking accuracy are of similar importance they were weighted equally in the final ranking function only when the algorithms achieved the same rank in terms of accuracy the faster one was preferred which was guaranteed by adding time performance with a smaller adaptive weight results participants and algorithms six algorithms were submitted to the first cell_tracking challenge covering a wide_variety of methods stemming from the two main tracking paradigms tracking by detection and tracking by model evolution most of the existing state of the art methods for filtering enhancement segmentation particle analysis and track association are represented four of the six participating groups com us heid ge kth se and prag cz provided results for all the datasets this is a remarkable fact that emphasizes the generalization of the results results global analysis based on the numbers provided in supplementary table s both seg and tra accuracy_measures were higher for nuclear labeling than for cytoplasmic labeling furthermore they both reflected the level of complexity provided in along with the description of the datasets there were large differences in the segmentation accuracy the lowest mean values being for c dl msc and c dl mda both with cytoplasmic labeling the highest mean value being for n dh cho this could be explained by the fact that the algorithms seem to be developed and tuned for the segmentation of nuclei as they often incorporate cluster separation routinesbased on the circularity of segmented objects therefore they are not appropriate for cellular shapes which are seldom uniform present protrusions and frequently establish contacts or overlaps the tra measure generally provided more uniform results among datasets with the exception of c dl msc interestingly the algorithms achieved significantly_higher tracking accuracy on the simulated_datasets than on the real ones this is likely because of the fact that the computer simulated nuclei are in general uniformly sized and the simulated cell_motility does not cover all possible random events that occur in real live_cell experiments finally the tim measure strongly depended on the size of each video being the lowest for c dl msc and n dh sim and the highest for n dh sim and c dh h another important factor_influencing time consumption of the competing algorithms was the number of objects to be analyzed note that the standard_deviations of the tim measure indicate significant differences in the speed of competing algorithms for all the datasets results rankings the final ranking inshows that kth se performed best in four real_datasets c dl msc c dl mda n dh gowt and n dl hela heidge and prag cz performed best in one real_dataset n dhcho and c dh h respectively leid nl performed best in the two simulated_datasets n dh sim and n dh sim when we look at the number of appearances of each method among the top three best performing methods both kth se and heid ge appeared in all eight datasets leid nl and prag cz appeared in three datasets and finally upm es and com us appeared in one dataset it is also important to note that in the case of c dh h n dh gowt n dl hela and n dh sim the decisive_factor for establishing the final ranking was the speed of competing algorithms because multiple methods were evenly ranked based on the seg and tra accuracy_measures only looking at each accuracy measure separately heid ge and kth se ranked among the top three most accurate methods for all the datasets with the exception of the segmentation accuracy for n dh cho where kth se ranked fourth however one should note that in this specific case the difference in seg between the most accurate method heid ge and kth se was small the other two methods that often belonged to the top three most accurate methods were prag cz and leid nl in terms of tim measure com us prag cz and kth se were consistently the top three fastest methods for all the datasets it is remarkable that kth se was at worst second fastest among the top three best performers in terms of seg and tra results per dataset we will now look at the results of each particular dataset in detail trying to extract relevant conclusions about the best performing methods seeand supplementary c dl msc supplementary video s the accuracy_measures were generally poor especially because of problems with the segmentation of elongated protrusions often incorrectly considered as whole cells kth se achieved significantly better accuracy than the other methods because of the optimized track linking algorithm used and an adaptive post_processing step which merges segmented object portions into adjacent segments with tracks regardless of this additional post_processing step the method was still fast being the second fastest in terms of tim and faster than the other two top three best performing methods heid ge and upm es c dh h supplementary video s all the algorithms that competed for this dataset achieved comparable segmentation accuracy heid ge being the most accurate compared with the segmentation accuracy the tracking accuracy was more spread out prag cz being the most accurate the decisive_factor for establishing the final ranking of the top three best performing methods was tim globally prag cz was ranked first having the lowest time consumption namely because the preprocessing_step involving gaussian filtering is applied only in d slice by slice c dl mda supplementary video s the calculated accuracy_measures were generally poor because of the
