adegenet new tools for the analysis of genome_wide snp data while the r software is becoming a standard for the analysis of genetic data classical population_genetics tools are being challenged by the increasing availability of genomic_sequences dedicated tools are needed for harnessing the large amount of information generated by next_generation we introduce new tools implemented in the adegenet package for handling and analyzing genome_wide snp data using a bit level coding scheme for snp data and parallelized computation adegenet enables the analysis of large genome_wide snps datasets using standard personal_computers availability adegenet is available from cran http cran r project org_web adegenet information and support including a dedicated forum of discussion can be found on the adegenet website http adegenet r forge r project org adegenet is released with a manual and four tutorials totalling over pages of documentation and distributed under the gnu general public licence the free software r r development core is becoming a standard for the analysis of genetic data offering a wealth of packages dedicated to population_genetics phylogenetics or genome_wide until recently classical genetic_marker data such as microsatellites could be analyzed using standard_tools and personal_computers however the increasing availability of genomic sequence_data has challenged both the tools and the ressources needed to carry such analyses while some specific packages have been developed for human association studies more general tools for the analysis of the genetic_structure of biological populations are needed in this article we introduce new tools implemented in the r package adegenet which to whom correspondence should be addressed allow large genomic_datasets e g hundreds of individuals typed for hundreds of thousands snps to be analyzed using standard personal_computers as an illustration we show how a new implementation of the discriminant_analysis of principal_components dapc can be used to identify structuring alleles from genomic_data with minimum computing_resources
