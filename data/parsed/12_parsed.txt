abaenrichment an r package to test for gene_set expression enrichment in the adult and developing human_brain we present abaenrichment an r package that tests for expression enrichment in specific brain_regions at different developmental_stages using expression information gathered from multiple regions of the adult and developing human_brain together with ontologically organized structural_information about the brain both provided by the allen brain atlas we validate abaenrichment by successfully recovering the origin of gene_sets identified in specific brain cell_types and developmental_stages availability_and abaenrichment was implemented as an r package and is available under gpl from the bioconductor websitefunctional enrichment_analyses using ontologies such as the gene_ontology have been widely used to gain insight into the functions and phenotypes influenced by sets of gene_candidates that emerge from various genome_wide screens patterns of gene_expression can be very informative about developmental_processes and functions taking_place in particular organs or tissues but this requires extensive expression information including component tissues and developmental_stages to be available for the organ tissue of interest the allen human_brain atlas projects have quantified gene_expression in multiple regions of the human_brain over the course of brain development and provide a valuable resource that can be used to pinpoint sets of genes that are characteristic of particular brain_regions and or developmental_stages allen human_brain atlas human brain map org and brainspan atlas of the developing human_brain brainspan org to date the transcriptomes of multiple regions of the brains of adult_humans as well as brains from individuals at various developmental_stages have been measured supplementary tables s s none of the tools developed to date e g brain explorer http human brainmap org static brainexplorer allow for the statistical_evaluation of gene_candidates in terms of expression enrichment in specific regions or stages using an ontology here we demonstrate the utility of a tool to carry out enrichment_analyses using the allen brain atlas information we apply an expression threshold to identify expressed genes in this step a workflow illustrating the entire data_processing and enrichment_analyses is shown in supplementary
