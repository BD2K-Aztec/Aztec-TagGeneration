sequence_analysis fr hit a very fast program to recruit metagenomic_reads to homologous reference_genomes fragment recruitment a process of aligning sequencing_reads to reference_genomes is a crucial step in metagenomic_data analysis the available sequence_alignment programs are either slow or insufficient for recruiting metagenomic_reads we implemented an efficient algorithm fr hit for fragment recruitment we applied fr hit and several other tools including blastn megablast blat last ssaha soap bwa and bwa_sw to recruit four metagenomic_datasets from different type of sequencers on average fr hit and blastn recruited significantly more reads than other programs while fr hit is about two orders_of than blastn fr hit is slower than the fastest soap bwa and bwa_sw but it recruited times more reads availability http weizhongli lab org frhit metagenomic_data provide a more comprehensive picture for our understanding of the microbial world an important step of such understanding is to compare the raw sequencing_reads against the available microbial_genomes to analyze the phylogenetic composition genes and functions of the samples such a procedure referred to as fragment recruitment was introduced in the global ocean sampling gos metagenomics study sequences from metagenomic_samples exhibit great_differences from the available genomes although there are thousands of available complete microbial_genomes they hardly cover the broad and diverse_species in many metagenomic_samples a typical metagenomic_dataset may have hundreds_or of species and many of them are novel therefore it is critical for fragment recruitment methods to align_reads to homologous genomes in the gos study blast was used for fragment recruitment however it is too slow to handle large_datasets the explosion of next_generation data stimulated the development of new mapping programs such as soap bowtie bwa and many others these programs are several orders_of times_faster than blast but they can only identify very stringent similarities that tolerate only a few to whom correspondence should be addressed mismatches and gaps so these mapping programs are insufficient for fragment recruitment the slightly slower programs like blat ssaha and last can recruit more reads than the mapping programs but their fragment recruiting capacities are still limited in this article we present a new fragment recruitment method fr hit given reference_genomes metagenomic_reads and sequence_identity and alignment_length cutoffs the goal of fr hit is to align the most reads to references with minimal computational time we applied fr hit on four metagenomic_datasets and compared it with blastn megablast soap bwa bwa_sw ssaha blat and last the first dataset has million bp illumina_reads from metahit sample mh the other three datasets are from gs gsflx and titanium platforms with and reads respectively their average lengths are and bp respectively the gs and gsflx datasets were downloaded from camera under ids scums smpl arctic and bats smpl the titanium data were from ncbi under accession srr for the illumina dataset we used the human_gut genomes from metahit study as reference for the datasets we used the completed bacterial genome_sequences downloaded from ncbi in april as references the two reference_databases are and gb in size a read is considered recruited if it is aligned to a reference with bp and identity such cutoffs represent a basic need for fragment recruitment to recruit more reads and to prevent obviously spurious hits more discussions and examples of parameters are available in supplementary_material parameters of all the programs are listed in supplementary table s the cpu time and the number of recruited reads are shown_inand supplementary fr hits results with different parameters are provided in supplementary table s on average fr hit and blastn recruited significantly more reads than other programs fr hit is orders_of than blastn fr hit is slower than the fastest mapping programs soap bwa and bwa_sw but it recruited times more reads in these tests fr hit shows better recruitment rate and speed than ssaha fr hit is slightly slower than megablast blat and last but it recruited much more reads than them using the illumina data as an example blastn recruited reads in min soap used min but only recruited reads fr hit recruited reads in min metagenomic_data contain many novel species so of reads cannot be recruited by fr hit due to the use of overlapping k_mers fr hit needs more memory than other programs it used and gb for the two reference_databases in these tests
