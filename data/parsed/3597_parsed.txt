polyester simulating rna_seq with differential transcript_expression motivation statistical_methods development for differential_expression of rna sequenc ing rna_seq requires software_tools to assess accuracy and error_rate control since true differential_expression status is often unknown in experimental_datasets artificially constructed datasets must be utilized either by generating costly spike in experiments or by simulating rna_seq results polyester is an r package designed to simulate rna_seq beginning with an experimental_design and ending with collections of rna_seq its main advantage is the ability to simulate reads indicating isoform level differential_expression across biological_replicates for a variety of experimental_designs data generated by polyester is a reasonable approximation to real rna_seq and standard differential_expression workflows can recover differential_expression set in the simulation by the user availability_and polyester is freely_available from bioconductor http bioconductor org rna_sequencing rna_seq experiments have become increasingly popular as a means to study gene_expression there are a range of statistical_methods for differential_expression of rna_seq the developers of statistical methodology for rna_seq need to test whether their tools are performing correctly often accuracy tests cannot be performed on real_datasets because true gene_expression levels and expression differences between populations are usually unknown and spike in experiments are costly in terms of both time and money instead researchers often use computational simulations to create datasets with a known signal and noise structure typically simulated expression measurements used to evaluate differential_expression tools are generated as gene counts from a statistical_model like those used in common differential_expression tools but these simulated scenarios do not account for variability in expression measurements that arises during upstream steps in rna_seq such as read_alignment or read counting polyester is a new r package for simulating rna_seq polyester s main advantage is that users can simulate sequencing_reads with specified differential_expression signal for either genes or isoforms this allows users to investigate sources of variability at multiple points in rna_seq pipelines existing rna_seq simulators that generate sequencing_reads are not designed for simulating experiments with biological_replicates and specified differential_expression signal for example the rsemsimulate reads utility shipped with rsem requires a time consuming first step of aligning real sequencing_reads to develop a sequencing model before reads can be simulated and differential_expression simulation is not built in neitherfluxsimulator nor benchmarker for evaluating the effectiveness of rna_seq beers have a built in mechanism for inducing differential_expression these simulators also do not provide methods for defining a model for biological_variability across replicates or specifying the exact expression_level of specific_transcripts tuxsim has been used to simulate rna_seq with differential_expression but it is not publicly_available polyester was created to fulfill the need for a tool to simulate rna_seq for an experiment with replicates and well defined differential_expression users can easily simulate small experiments from a few genes or a single chromosome this can reduce computational time in simulation_studies when computationally_intensive steps such as read_alignment must be performed as part of the simulation polyester is open_source cross_platform and freely_available for download from bioconductor at http www bioconductor org_packages release bioc html polyester html
