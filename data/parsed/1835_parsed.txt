structural_bioinformatics first insight into the prediction of protein folding_rate change upon point_mutation the accurate prediction of protein folding_rate change upon mutation is an important and challenging_problem in protein_folding kinetics and design in this work we have collected experimental_data on protein folding_rate change upon mutation from various sources and constructed a reliable and non redundant dataset with mutants these mutants are widely_distributed based on secondary_structure solvent_accessibility conservation score and long_range from systematic analysis of these parameters along with a set of amino_acid we have selected a set of features for discriminating the mutants that speed up or slow down the folding_process we have developed a method based on quadratic regression_models for discriminating the accelerating and decelerating mutants which showed an accuracy of using the fold_cross test the sensitivity_and are and respectively the method can be improved with the inclusion of physical_interactions and structure based parameters protein_folding is a process by which a polypeptide_chain of amino_acid folds into a specific d structure the rate of protein_folding is a measure to understand the tendency of folding slow fast from unfolded_state to its native d structure and it varies several orders_of ranging from microseconds to an hour studies of protein folding_rates enhance our understanding of the variations in protein_folding kinetics which may lead to several pathologies such as prion and alzheimers diseases hence several investigations have been carried_out to measure protein folding_rates and the data are accumulated in different databases such as protein_folding database pfd and protein_folding kinetics database kineticdb to whom correspondence should be addressed these databases provide annotated structural methodological kinetic and thermodynamic data of proteins and mutants currently experimental_data for protein folding_rates are available for less than proteins which demand the necessity of computational_methods to predict protein folding_rates from d structures of proteins and or just from amino_acid proposed the first method based on contact order to relate protein folding_rates with the total number of contacts in protein_structures introduced the concept of long_range which relates long_range lrc contact between two residues that are close in space and far in the sequence in protein_structures with protein folding_rate consequently several parameters such as total contact distance cliquishness multiple contact index etc have been developed to understand protein folding_rates using d structures of proteins on the other hand several methods have been proposed for predicting protein folding_rates from amino_acid with without the structural_class information these methods include the relationship with amino_acid predicted secondary_structures sss predicted inter residue_contacts amino_acid ss length and hybrid sequence representation reviewed the details of computational_methods for predicting protein folding_rates all the above_mentioned studies are focused on predicting the folding_rates of proteins without any modifications of amino_acids in fact the substitution of amino_acid in a protein drastically alters the folding stability specificity and functions of proteins the problems related to protein_stability and function upon point_mutations have been addressed in earlier_studies consequently several methods have been proposed to predict protein_stability and function due to amino_acid however the influence of amino_acid to proteinpage
