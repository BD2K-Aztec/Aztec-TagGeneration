bio samtools a package for analysis and visualization of sequence and alignment data with samtools in ruby motivation bio samtools is a ruby language interface to samtools the highly popular library that provides utilities for manipulating high_throughput sequence_alignments in the sequence_alignment format advances in ruby now allow us to improve the analysis capabilities and increase bio samtools utility allowing users to accomplish a large amount of analysis using a very small amount of code bio samtools can also be easily developed to include additional samtools methods and hence stay current with the latest samtools releases results we have added new ruby classes for the mpileup and variant_call vcf data_formats emitted by samtools and introduced more analysis methods for variant analysis including alternative allele calculation and allele_frequency calling for snps our new implementation of bio samtools also ensures that all the functionality of the samtools library is now supported and that bio samtools can be easily extended to include future changes in samtools bio samtools also provides methods that allow the user to directly produce visualization of alignment data many large_scale genomics studies rely heavily on re sequencing_experiments in which genomes of individuals or populations are to be compared typically these experiments begin with shotgun_sequencing of dna using high_throughput methods followed by alignment of the sequences to a reference genome_assembly overdeveloped samtools features and can produce publication quality visualizations of data with minimal effort by the coder we previously described bio samtools a ruby language binding to the samtools library and a biogem of the bioruby framework since its release bio samtools has been downloaded times samtools is in constant development and hence there is a need to accommodate any future functionality of samtools by facilitating extension of our software by other programmers
