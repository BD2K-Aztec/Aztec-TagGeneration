structural_bioinformatics gpu linear_and poisson_boltzmann solver module for delphi in this work we present a cuda based gpu_implementation of a poissonboltzmann equation solver in both the linear_and versions using double precision a finite_difference scheme is adopted and made suitable for the gpu architecture the resulting code was interfaced with the electrostatics software for biomolecules delphi which is widely used in the computational_biology community the algorithm has been implemented using cuda and tested over a few representative cases of biological interest details of the implementation and performance test results are illustrated a speedup of times was achieved both in the linear_and cases availability_and the module is open_source and available atthe poissonboltzmann equation pbe is a widely used tool to estimate the electrostatic energy of molecular_systems in ionic solution given the continuously increasing size of structural data for proteins and other macromolecules and the need to deal with bigger and more complex structures the availability of tested and reliable algorithms on the most recent and affordable computational architectures such as graphical processing units gpus is highly_desirable in this context we present an implementation on a gpu architecture of both a linear and a non linear pbe solvers based on the finite_difference fd scheme the first use of an fd approach to solve the pbe can be ascribed to our implementation follows that adopted by the delphi solver and described in which exploits the checkerboard structure of the fd discretization of the laplace differential operator and adopts successive over relaxation to converge to the solution to our knowledge this is the first description of a gpu_implementation of the non linear pbe which follows the same approach used by delphi and detailed in our implementation can be executed on any nvidia card with compute_unified cuda capabilities the results inshow the speedup between the serial code executed on a cpu with an amd opteron ghz chip and a tesla kepler k m the solver was run on the fatty_acid protein with atoms a monovalent salt_concentration of m was used the relative dielectric_constant of the molecule was taken as and that of the solution as the debye length is roughly a the speedup of the non linear algorithm is comparable with that of the linear one in fact the former benefits from a larger number of floating point operations but it suffers from a larger number of data transfers
