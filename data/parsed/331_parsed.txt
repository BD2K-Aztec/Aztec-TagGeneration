sequence_analysis a new approach for detecting riboswitches in dna_sequences motivation riboswitches are short_sequences of messenger_rna that can change their structural conformation to regulate the expression of adjacent genes computational_prediction of putative ribos witches can provide_direction to molecular_biologists studying riboswitch mediated gene_expression results the denison riboswitch detector drd is a new computational_tool with a web_interface that can quickly identify putative ribos witches in dna_sequences on the scale of bacterial_genomes riboswitch descriptions are easily modifiable and new ones are easily created the underlying algorithm converts the problem to a heaviest path problem on a multipartite graph which is then solved using efficient dynamic_programming we show that drd can achieve sensitivity and specificity on riboswitch families the regulation of gene_expression is a critical process that dictates the ability of cells to function properly to establish cellular identity and to respond to changes in environmental_conditions gene_regulation is manifested in a variety of ways ranging from the action of transcriptional_activators and repressors through cis_acting regulatory binding_sites dna accessibility via chromatin_structure and localization of dna within the cellular nuclear confines in addition to these mechanisms rna has surfaced as a player in gene_regulation specific forms of rna such as micrornas small_interfering and many others have been identified and characterized as important components of gene_regulation one specific_manner by which rna_molecules serve as regulators of gene_expression is in the form of riboswitches riboswitches are short_sequences nt in length located in the non coding portions of specific messenger_rnas mrnas that regulate the expression of the coding sequences_contained within the mrna they function via their ability to fold into distinct secondary_structures that influence the ability of the mrna to be transcribed processed or translated riboswitches consist of two specific components an aptamer region that binds to a specific organic molecule often some type of metabolite and an expression platform that produces a change in structural conformation as a result of binding to the aptamer the aptamer region is generally a highly conserved_sequence capable of binding to a number of organic_molecules with high_specificity binding to the aptamer triggers changes in the intramolecular base_pairing within the expression platform leading to changes in secondary_and of the rna the change in conformation in turn influences the ability of the mrna to be expressed in a variety of different ways depending on the specific riboswitch the activation of some riboswitches results in premature_termination of transcription ending synthesis of the mrna before the coding_region others act by directly blocking translation of the mrna by restricting access to the ribosomal binding_site in eukaryotes riboswitch folding may also influence expression via regulation of mrna_splicing there are currently about known families of riboswitches that bind to a variety of nucleobases amino_acids metal_ions and other organic_compounds many of the more extensively_studied riboswitches serve as part of a feedback regulatory system for genes that participate in cellular_metabolism the metabolites that bind to the aptamer serve as indicators of the relative activity of specific metabolic_pathways and upon binding influence expression of genes that participate in the pathway for example certain genes involved in the synthesis of vitamin b thiamin are regulated by a riboswitch that binds thiamin pyrophosphate tpp the biologically_active form of thiamin tpp binds to a conserved rna_sequence known as a thi box which represses_transcription of genes possessing this sequence in the untranslated_region the thi box is a particularly intriguing example of a riboswitch as it is found in a wide_range of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes and functions in a variety of contexts the tpp riboswitch is the only known eukaryotic riboswitch identified to date given the importance of riboswitches in gene_regulation in the context of whole_genome regulation methods to identify such sequences are needed a variety of efforts have been previously to whom correspondence should be addressed undertaken to develop bioinformatics_tools to predict the presence of riboswitches in rna_sequences most programs that have been developed operate on the principle of sequence_alignment to identify conserved_sequences in previously_identified riboswitches coupled with rna structural folding algorithms programs that are currently available are generally limited to the identification of a specific subset of known riboswitch types and are only able to search modest sized sequence inputs to date few programs have been developed to take advantage of the abundance of completed full genome_sequences to address the need for riboswitch prediction on the wholegenome scale we have developed a new computational_tool with a web_interface that can identify putative riboswitches in dna_sequences called the denison riboswitch detector drd drd can quickly typically min process complete bacterial_genomes and achieve sensitivity and almost specificity drds description of a riboswitch is simple and easily modifiable based on the highly conserved_motifs found in all known riboswitches to identify an optimal sequence of short motifs drd transforms the search into a path finding problem on a directed multipartite graph which is then solved by an efficient dynamic_programming drd can be accessed at http drd denison edu researchers interested in using the program as a stand alone tool may also contact the first author we tested drd on riboswitch families using definition files derived from multiple_sequence of the families rfamdesignated seed sequences these definition files may be viewed in supplementary table s or in the web_interface by clicking on the riboswitch name for each riboswitch we performed two types of tests first to obtain robust sensitivity results for each riboswitch family we tested drd on all known riboswitchsequences predicted for each family in the rfam database at http rfam xfam org the sensitivity or true_positive tpr is tp tp fn where tp is the number of true_positive findings and fn is the number of false_negative findings second to measure the corresponding false_positive fpr for each family in genome_scale sequences we randomly_selected a small number of rfam predicted riboswitch sequences and tested drd on the set of genbank sequence records in which they are contained the false_positive is specificity specificity is defined to be tn tn fp where tn is the number of true negative findings and fp is the number of false_positive we discuss each of these tests in detail below
