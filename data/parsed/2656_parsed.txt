sequence_analysis ksnp snp_detection and phylogenetic_analysis of genomes without genome alignment or reference_genome we announce the release of ksnp a program for snp identification and phylogenetic_analysis without genome alignment or the requirement for reference_genomes ksnp is a significantly_improved version of ksnp v availability_and ksnp is implemented as a package of stand alone executables for linux and mac os x under the open_source bsd_license the executable packages source_code and a full user guide are freely_available at https sourceforge net_projects ksnp files contact next_generation has led to an explosion in the number of sequenced_genomes especially microbial_genomes snp analysis of those genomes is important in forensic investigations strain identification outbreak tracking phylogenetic_analysis and identifying strain_differences that are important to phenotypes such as virulence and antibiotic_resistance the availability of genome_sequences of up to thousands of genomes of a single species requires tools that can handle very large_datasets in reasonable times because microbial_genomes are subject to massive gene gains_and insertion deletions and rearrangements alignment of whole microbial genome_sequences has proven to be computationally_intensive and not applicable to datasets of hundreds_or of genomes the increasing tendency to leave genome_sequences at the assembly or even raw unassembled reads stage has necessitated the development of genome_analysis tools that do not require genome alignments and that can be applied to genomes at all stages of completion ksnp v released in is a tool that can identify snps in hundreds of microbial_genomes without the requirement for genome alignment or a reference_genome if one or more annotated genomes are included ksnp can automatically annotate the identified snps ksnp v estimates phylogenetic_trees by parsimony neighbor_joining and maximum_likelihood methods and reports trees with a variety of node labels including the number of snps unique to each node ksnp can analyze finished closed genomes draft_genomes at the assembly stage genomes at the raw_reads stage or any combination of those stages ksnp v proved to be relatively fast analyzing genomes of the rhabdoviridae family in h and analyzing escherichia_coli shigella genomes in h on a linux cluster or h on a desktop imac ksnp v has been used for snp identification and phylogenetic_analysis in several recent_studies and has proven itself a valuable_tool for identifying snps that predict phenotype here we announce the release of ksnp a significantly_improved version of ksnp v the ksnp package also includes a number of new tools and utilities that facilitate the downloading of genomes for ksnp analysis preparation of input_files and a variety of post ksnp run analyses of the output_files the input_files the genome_sequence input file_format of ksnp v resulted in annotation being limited to snps that were within the chromosome thus snps in plasmids or other replicons were identified as not being in an annotated region this was a particularly serious problem for genomes such as the vibrio genomes that consist of two chromosomes in which case almost half of the snps would be unannotated but a considerable amount of annotation was also lost in strains with multiple plasmids ksnp now uses a different input format that provides annotation of all replicons
