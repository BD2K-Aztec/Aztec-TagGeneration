open ms_ms spectral_library to identify unanticipated post_translational and increase spectral identification_rate motivation identification of post_translationally proteins has become one of the central issues of current proteomics spectral_library is a new and promising computational_approach to mass_spectrometry based protein identification however its potential in identification of unanticipated post_translational has rarely been explored the existing spectral_library tools are designed to match the query spectrum to the reference library spectra with the same peptide mass thus spectra of peptides with unanticipated modifications cannot be identified results in this article we present an open spectral_library tool named pmatch it extends the existing library search algorithms in at least three aspects to support the identification of unanticipated modifications first the spectra in library are optimized with the full peptide sequence_information to better tolerate the peptide fragmentation pattern variations caused by some modification s second a new scoring system is devised which uses charge dependent mass shifts for peak matching and combines a probability based model with the general spectral dot product for scoring third a target_decoy strategy is used for false_discovery control to demonstrate the effectiveness of pmatch a library search experiment was conducted on a public dataset with over spectra in comparison with spectrast the most popular library search_engine additional validations were done on four published datasets including over spectra the results showed that pmatch can effectively_identify unanticipated modifications and significantly increase spectral identification_rate liquid chromatography_coupled lc_ms is the key experimental method for large_scale protein identification in this method proteins are digested into peptides which are then ionized and dissociated in a mass_spectrometer the mass to charge ratios m z and the intensities of the resulting product_ions are measured to produce ms_ms to identify the peptides and proteins sequence database_search has achieved great success in the past_years and a variety of search tools have been developed e g sequest mascot and pfind such an approach is implemented by comparing the similarities between the experimental_spectra and the theoretical spectra predicted from peptide_sequences in a database unfortunately due to insufficient understanding of the factors that determine peptide fragmentation most current search tools employ simplified fragmentation models such as the uniform backbone dissociation model leading to many unidentified or misidentified spectra in recent_years with the availability of millions of confidently identified ms_ms an alternative as well as complementary approach_called spectral_library has emerged its essential idea is to build a library of experimental reference spectra rather than theoretically predicted ones since this approach was first introduced to the field of protein identification by the last decade has witnessed a group of mass spectral_library tools such as spectrast nist mspepsearch http peptide nist gov bibliospec x hunter promex hmmatch and msdash compared to the sequence database_search the spectral_library takes_advantage of the previously_obtained knowledge and has three obvious merits first improved_sensitivity spectral_library takes_into the fragmentation pattern individually for each experimental_spectrum it yields more discriminative match scores than does the sequence database_search second high search speed experiments show that in shotgun_proteomics some peptides are detected all the time while some are never thus a well organized spectral library consisting of empirically_observed experimental_spectra permits a smaller and more accurate search_space third convenient identification of extraordinary spectra such as those produced from peptides with unusual posttranslational_modifications ptms these spectra are big challenges to sequence database search_engines but could be identified as easily as the ordinary ones by spectral_library apparently the above merits are based on reliable and comprehensive spectral_libraries one of the main obstacles is library coverage many efforts have been made on library constructions such as nist http peptide nist gov and peptideatlas http www peptideatlas org speclib however it remains difficult considering that ptms may generate substantial modified forms of a peptide note that there have been hundreds of known modifications e g entries recorded in the resid modification database by and only a few of them e g phosphorylation were extensively_studied in the past in this study a comparison experiment on a public dataset was carried_out with detailed analysis between pmatch and spectrast in both the conventional and the open search modes to further validate pmatch four additional published datasets were analyzed in the open search mode the five datasets including spectra in total were all engaged in the same experimental workflow we have presented a novel spectral_library tool pmatch deliberately designed for the open search mode its ability to identify spectra with unanticipated ptms was demonstrated on several datasets in cooperation with traditional sequence database_search pmatch is able to push up the spectral identification_rate to a large extent the key_points to contributing the success of this method lie in three aspects the consideration of accurate_mass shifts for peak matching the use of full peptide sequence_information for consensus spectral optimization a new scoring_function that combines the general intensity based dot product with a probabilistic_model of peak matching
