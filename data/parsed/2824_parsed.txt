data_and mcagui microbial_community r graphical_user gui microbial_communities have an important role in natural_ecosystems and have an impact on animal and human_health intuitive graphic and analytical_tools that can facilitate the study of these communities are in short supply this article introduces microbial_community gui a graphical_user gui for the r programming_language r development core team with this application researchers can input aligned and clustered sequence_data to create custom abundance tables and perform analyses specific to their needs this gui provides a flexible modular platform expandable to include other statistical_tools for microbial_community in the future availability the mcagui package and source are freely_available as part of bionconductor atseveral graphical_user software gui packages exist for the analysis of microbial_community data these programs include invue which specializes in creating interactive graphical_representations for large_datasets and unifrac a web_based gui that allows users to compare microbial_communities using phylogenetic_information many of these applications were built using programming_languages such as c and c currently there are few guis specifically available for the analysis of microbial_communities that also take advantage of the r programming_language this article introduces microbial_community gui mcagui an r package built to help microbial biologists harness the power of statistical_analysis tools provided in r without having to learn the r programming_language using mcagui researchers can perform statistical_analyses and create various interactive and analytical data representations specific to microbial_ecology to whom correspondence should be addressed what distinguishes mcagui from similar applications is its ability to directly input aligned sequence_data that provide information about microbial_community this allows researchers to create custom abundance tables using both sample metadata and data on operational_taxonomic otu mcagui is modular and expandable it provides a platform that can be extended to include more functionality in the future
