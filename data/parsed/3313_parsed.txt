data_and ocap an open comprehensive analysis_pipeline for itraq motivation mass_spectrometry based itraq protein quantification is a high_throughput assay for determining relative protein_expressions and identifying disease_biomarkers processing and analysis of these large and complex data involves a number of distinct_components and it is desirable to have a pipeline to efficiently integrate these together to date there are limited public available comprehensive analysis_pipelines for itraq data and many of these existing pipelines have limited visualization_tools and no convenient interfaces with downstream_analyses we have developed a new open_source comprehensive itraq analysis_pipeline ocap integrating a wavelet_based preprocessing algorithm which provides better peak_picking a new quantification algorithm and a suite of visualizsation tools ocap is mainly developed in c and is provided as a standalone version ocap standalone as well as an r package the r package ocap provides the necessary interfaces with downstream statistical_analysis availability ocap is freely_available and can be downloaded ataccurate identification and quantification of protein_expressions are crucial in developing new diagnostic prognostic and therapeutic products for the treatment of various diseases with the introduction of isobaric quantification technologies such as itraq and tmt researchers are able to determine relative expressions of thousands of proteins simultaneously however analysis of itraq data remains a very challenging_task typical workflow of itraq data analysis can be viewed as two major components the preprocessing of the data and higher statistical_analysis the first component can be further divided_into three main_stages i spectrum peak_picking ii peptide and protein identification and iii protein quantification the second component consists of quality_control and higher_level statistical_analyses such as identification of differentially_expressed and prediction some and or all of the components are usually combined in an analysis_pipeline currently there are several pipelines designed for other purposes e g topp for label_free quantification maxquant for silac analysis however there are a limited number of public available pipelines specifically to whom correspondence should be addressed designed for itraq from the initial preprocessing phase right through to higher_level statistical_analysis and existing pipelines include the trans proteomic pipeline tpp multi q and msnbase many existing open_source pipelines that support itraq focus primarily on preprocesssing of itraq data and offer limited visualization_tools for efficiently exploring the data e g tpp pipeline as the eventual aim of itraq analysis includes identifying differentially_expressed and finding biomarkers for good prediction outcome it is important that the output from the three main_stages from the preprocessing component is effectively integrated with major statistical softwares such as r spss and sas to facilitate downstream_analyses to this end we have developed a new comprehensive itraq data analysis_pipeline with the three main_stages of the first component forming a standalone software in addition we have provided an r interface ocap of this software that includes additional visualization_tools for exploring the data this interface also provides easy access to the suite of downstream analytical packages including limma pamr and isobar being open_source ocap can be easily extended and modified to fit specific analyses it provides an alternative workflow to the tpp pipeline ocap also incorporates a range of visualization_tools for exploring the itraq data and a convenient interface to many downstream_analyses greatly facilitating the understanding of the underlying biological problem
