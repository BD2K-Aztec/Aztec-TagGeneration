denovo virus host sequence_based protein_protein prediction motivation can we predict proteinprotein_interactions ppis of a novel virus with its host three major problems arise the lack of known ppis for that virus to learn from the cost of learning about its proteins and the sequence dissimilarity among viral families that makes most methods inapplic able or inefficient we develop denovo a sequence_based negative sampling and machine_learning framework that learns from ppis of different viruses to predict for a novel one exploiting the shared host_proteins we tested denovo on ppis from different domains to assess generalization results by solving the challenge of generating less noisy negative interactions denovo achieved_accuracy up to and when predicting ppis of viral_proteins that have no and distant sequence_similarity to the ones used for training receptively this result is comparable to the best achieved in single virus host and intra species ppi prediction cases thus we can now predict ppis for virtually any virus infecting human denovo generalizes well it achieved near optimal accuracy when tested on bacteriahuman interactions predicting protein interactions of a novel virus with its host is a fold data problem first few or no proteinprotein_interactions ppis may be available for a novel virus to learn from prohibiting the application of the typical single virus host ppi prediction_methods second learning advanced protein features like structure for a novel virus protein can be time consuming a challenge to obtain and a generalization barrier third sequence dissimilarity among viral families makes transferring knowledge from ppis of some families to another family insufficient to model its ppis predicting inter_species ppis which involve proteins from two different organisms imposes additional difficulty over intra species ppi prediction there are four interleaving components to address for the case of predicting ppis of novel viruses with their shared host ppi samples to learn from features to represent the ppis in a way that allows generalization a learning approach that deals with the difficulties imposed by this type of prediction and the consequent problem of generating negative ppi samples to learn from features prediction_methods need features extracted from ppi examples to learn four major feature_extraction approaches are typical in pathogen host ppi prediction sequence_homology based_approaches structure based_approaches and domain based_approaches known interactions from one protein to another based on sequence_homology structure similarity or sharing of interaction interfaces respectively additionally sequence dissimilarities among viral families hamper the generalization of these knowledge based_approaches to all novel viruses the fourth category extracts features from the amino_acid of the protein pairs it is successfully used on single virus host ppi prediction and adopted in denovo learning approaches three major learning approaches dominate inter_species ppi prediction classic machine_learning where a model learns to discriminate between positive_and ppis data_mining approaches that model true ppis and measure a putative ppi similarity to them and transfer learning where knowledge of ppis is selectively transferred from a rich domain of ppis to the target one for which prediction is needed using commonalities between the two domains we anticipate that data_mining and transfer learning approaches are not adequate for novel virus ppi prediction mainly because virus families carry no sequence_similarities among themselves sufficient to make data_mining or transfer learning from available ppis of other viruses possible data problem in predicting ppis for a virus with its host either there are a sufficient number of known ppis few or none in the first case usually a model is trained on the available ppis to predict additional ones as most viruses do not have many known ppis these single virus host prediction_approaches are not universally_applicable recently transfer learning is applied to learn from ppis between a pathogen and its host and make prediction for another pathogen through a transfer_function that maps knowledge between the domains however transfer_function design can be a challenge to build between viral families where members share no sequence_similarities and may require prior_knowledge of the two domains negative sampling a machine_learning model needs to learn the difference between the positive_and classes yet there is no gold_standard of non interacting_proteins nor is there enough information to build one typically negative_examples are generated randomly for other knowledge based_methods are mostly biased ben data_mining approaches bypass negative sampling by modeling true interactions for example conformal prediction is used in a recent study where the conformance of a putative ppi is evaluated against the known ppis and classified as positive if its prediction confidence is above a predefined threshold solution overview this study addresses the generalized problem of predicting ppis between a virus and its host without the need to know any of their interactions in advance the key idea is to learn interaction features for the host_proteins rather than for specific viral_proteins the model depends only on protein_sequences to extract features and generate unbiased negative_examples to ensure generalization data are partitioned in a way that simulates the situation of a new virus to reasonably evaluate the performance we further make three hypotheses on what attributes potentially guide the learning_process and use our framework to test them to link biological and computational aspects of the prediction process we name the proposed solution denovo as an analogy to de_novo for it makes prediction without prior_knowledge of any interactions between the two organisms to learn from see_supplementary s for the solution workflow denovo demonstrates the feasibility of predicting interactions of a virus protein with human proteins by learning from the available interactions of other viruses that also infect human even with little or no sequence_similarity to the viral_proteins in training the framework achieves accuracy comparable to the best reported for intra species ppi prediction using sequence_information despite the challenging nature of the generalized problem we additionally demonstrate denovo generalization to other pathogens
