domino development of informative molecular_markers for phylogenetic and genome_wide popula tion genetic_studies in non model_organisms motivation the development of molecular_markers is one of the most important challenges in phylo genetic and genome_wide population_genetics studies especially in studies with non model_organisms highly_promising approach for obtaining suitable markers are the utilization of genomic partitioning strategies for the simultaneous discovery and genotyping of a large number of markers unfortunately not all markers obtained from these approaches provide enough information for solving multiple evolutionary questions at a reasonable taxonomic resolution results we have developed domino a bioinformatics tool for informative marker development from both ngs_data and pre_computed sequence_alignments the application implements popular ngs tools with new utilities in a highly versatile pipeline specifically_designed to discover or select personal ized markers at different levels of taxonomic resolution these markers can be directly used to study the taxa surveyed for their design utilized for further downstream pcr_amplification in a broader set taxonomic scope or exploited as suitable templates to bait design for target dna enrichment techniques we conducted an exhaustive evaluation of the performance of domino via computer simulations and illustrate its utility to find informative markers in an empirical dataset it is well known that phylogenetic inferences based on a single or very few genetic_markers can lead to systematic errors and reach invalid conclusions next_generation ngs has become a feasible and cost_effective way of obtaining large_amounts of genetic_markers suitable for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions among current methodologies the hybrid enrichment and the reduction representation sequencing methods for a review see are particularly promising approaches for studies in non model_organisms markers developed with these methodologies however may not be informative enough to resolve multiple evolutionary questions across a reasonable taxonomic range indeed some markers may be inefficient for a particular study in a specific taxonomic_group or can be useful only for limited phylogenetic ranges these problems make often necessary to accomplish various cost intensive enrichment or reduction representation experiments to further obtain makers suitable to be applicable across a wide_range of species recently some optimizing approaches have been developed to try to overcome this limited marker informativeness for instance the markerminer pipeline outputs different types of multiple_sequence msa files some of them including reference coding_sequences containing introns which facilitates the downstream evaluation of the phylogenetic utility of each marker or the prediction of intron_exon and intron sizes very useful for primer or probe of development nevertheless the pipeline does not perform these assessments by itself and the application is specifically devised to work only with transcriptome_assemblies and with a set of plant reference_genomes indeed the possibility of selecting particular markers with a specific number of samples has been recently implemented in the rad_seq data_processing pipeline radis however this application does not include other key options and parameter combinations such as the selection of a specific nucleotide variation range across a set of pre defined taxa options that can be very useful for a plethora of studies baitfisher also implements a novel approach to optimize the design of target enrichment baits to be applicable across a wide_range of taxa this software includes an algorithm to infer target dna enrichment baits from multiple taxa by exploiting user provided nucleotide sequence_information of target_loci in a representative set of species and can handle both genomic and cdna data nevertheless this software works on the basis of msa of already known target_loci that directly serves as templates for bait design i e it cannot be used with raw ngs_data or for de_novo marker discovery here we present domino development of molecular_markers in nonmodel organisms a new bioinformatics tool that facilitates the development of highly informative markers from different data_sources including raw ngs_reads and pre_computed msa in various formats such as those from rad data domino efficiently process ngs_data or pre_computed msa and identifies i e de_novo discovery or selects the sequence_regions or alignments that meet user defined_criteria customizable features include the length of variable and conserved_regions when requested the minimum levels or a preferred range of nucleotide variation how to manage polymorphic_variants or which taxa or what fraction of them should be covered by the marker all these criteria can be easily defined in a user_friendly gui graphical_user or under a command_line version that implements some extended options and that it is particularly useful for working with large ngs data_sets in high performance computers supplementary see also the domino documentation the regions identified or selected in domino can be i directly used as markers with a particular depth of taxonomic resolution ii utilized for their downstream pcr_amplification in a broader taxonomic scope or iii used as suitable templates to optimized bait design for target dna enrichment techniques
