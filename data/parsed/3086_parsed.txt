systems_biology most a software environment for constraint based metabolic modeling and strain design most metabolic optimization and simulation tool is a software_package that implements gdbb genetic design through branch and bound in an intuitive user_friendly interface with excel like editing functionality as well as implementing fba flux_balance and supporting systems_biology and comma separated values files gdbb is currently the fastest algorithm for finding gene_knockouts predicted by fba to increase production of desired products but gdbb has only been available on a command_line which is difficult to use for those without programming knowledge until the release of most many software_packages are currently available to create constraint_based of metabolism load existing_models export models and run analyses on these models to predict the production of desired compounds by microbes under genetic_manipulations this software differs in data input type and display of results where input type ranges from command_line to spreadsheet and results display as text or in spreadsheet form many packages can load the commonly used systems_biology sbml format and some can load text_files microsoft_excel files or other formats many packages also export sbml or other formats in general all the software_packages implement fba and some implement optknock evolutionary algorithms gdls genetic design through local_search or other analyses extensively tested on windows xp and linux and macintosh releases are also available most requires a mixed integer_linear solver to run fba e flux and gdbb most offers a choice of solvers either gurobi solver gurobi optimization houston tx usa which is free for academic use or glpk gnu linear_programming kit http www gnu org software glpk a free solver most also requires a quadratic solver for e flux either gurobi or ipopt interior point optimizer http openopt org ipopt and a nonlinear solver for spot ipopt
