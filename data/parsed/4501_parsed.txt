sylvx a viewer for phylogenetic_tree reconciliations motivation reconciliation methods aim at recovering the evolutionary_processes that shaped the history of a given gene_family including events such as duplications transfers and losses by comparing the discrepancies between the topologies of the associated gene and species_trees these methods are also used in the framework of host_parasite studies to recover co diversification scenarios including co speciation_events host switches and extinctions these evolutionary_processes can be graphically represented as nested trees these interconnected graphs can be visually messy and hard to interpret and despite the fact that reconciliations are increasingly used there is a shortage of tools dedicated to their graphical management here we present sylvx a reconciliation viewer which implements classical phylogenetic graphic operators swapping highlighting etc and new methods to ease interpretation and comparison of reconciliations multiple maps moving shrinking sub reconciliations availability_and sylvx is an open_source cross_platform standalone editor available for windows and unix like systems including osx it is publicly_available at www sylvx org reconciliation methods compare gene_trees and species_trees to recover the history of gene_families such a history is composed of speciation_events duplications losses transfers and other evolutionary_events affecting particular genes at specific times in evolution reconciliation methods are also used in co diversification studies where the phylogeny of parasite species is compared to that of host_species infected by these parasites here a different set of evolutionary_events is considered including co speciation_events duplications extinctions and host switches few tools are currently available to visualize reconciliations tarzan core pa jane and primetv packages use a two_dimensional euclidean slanted layout for the representation of reconciliations the dpe editor uses a d representation of a slanted layout crossing species x versus evolutionary distance y versus paralogs z in spite of these powerful_tools for illustrating how a guest tree e g a gene history evolves inside a host tree e g a species_tree these interconnected graphs can be visually hard to interpret when the number of evolutionary_events depicted is high another issue is that the available viewers lack the ability to compare reconciliations obtained under different settings e g different event costs or to compare reconciliations for different genes families or parasite taxa on the same species_tree the goal of sylvx is the graphical management of such drawings and the generation of publication ready illustrations sylvxs consists of three toolboxes the first one is related to maps a map is a resizable and scrollable display space showing a species_tree with one superimposed gene reconciliation the user can add remove maps and choose which reconciliation to display on a given map from the reconciliation toolbox see below both the species_tree and its gene reconciliation are updated by applying a tool e g zoom from this map toolbox the second toolbox is specific to reconciliations in order to display a reconciliation first the user needs to target one or several map s from the map toolbox and secondly select a reconciliation from the list of available ones the reconciliation toolbox offers graphical operators such as highlighting line thickness dash line foreground color shrinking translation or annotation that can be applied to internal nodes of a reconciliation these operations take into account evolutionary_events including horizontal transfers for instance setting a new color to an internal node of a reconciliation also updates the color of all the subsequent horizontal transfers and their descendants reconciliations can be synchronized meaning that a graphical modification on a reconciliation from a given map can be automatically conducted on a selection of maps displaying the same reconciliation the third toolbox is dedicated to the species_tree a species subtree can be swapped hidden highlighted colored and annotated like reconciliations species_trees from several maps can be synchronized the main_feature of sylvx is the ability to manage multiple interactive maps of reconciliations synchronous highlighting operations between juxtaposed maps ease their comparison zooming annotating color text shrinking sub parts of the trees help in the interpretation of chains of events the sylvx method for displaying reconciliations is based on upward and downward translations of segments linked by versatile connectors displaying reconciliations having a high number of evolutive events such as a set of successivesylvxduplications within one short species_tree segment is still a challenge superimpositions of a high number of graphical items in a small drawing area more elaborated methods available in the field of information_visualization will be useful such as the production of symbolic views e g replacing a set of duplications by one hot_spot in the tree or tree navigation tools based on focus context distortion such as the accordion zoom another challenge is a global view of multiple genes histories on a single map species_tree in this context flattening or smoothing reconciliation graphs and its evolutionary_events will be required to avoid messy visualizations and graphical operators acting locally manually or automatically must be developed in the short_term one priority is the ability to import reconciliations from other packages such as primetv
