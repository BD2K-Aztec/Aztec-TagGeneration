gene_expression gfold a generalized fold_change for ranking differentially_expressed from rna_seq motivation rna_seq has been widely used in transcriptome_analysis to effectively measure gene_expression levels although sequencing_costs are rapidly decreasing almost of all the human rna_seq samples in the gene_expression do not have biological rep licates and more unreplicated rna_seq were published than replicated rna_seq in despite the large amount of single replicate studies there is currently no satisfactory method for detecting differentially_expressed when only a single biological repli cate is available results we present the gfold generalized fold_change algorithm to produce biologically_meaningful rankings of differentially_expressed from rna_seq gfold assigns reliable statistics for expression changes based on the posterior_distribution of log_fold in this way gfold overcomes the shortcomings of p value and fold_change calculated by existing rna_seq analysis methods and gives more stable and biological meaningful gene rankings when only a single biological replicate is available availability the open_source c c program is available atin rna_seq high_throughput is applied to transcriptome_analysis to effectively measure gene_expression levels identify alternative_splicing variants and reconstruct novel or fusion_transcripts since the first publications in a series of studies in rna_seq has quickly gained popularity for use in transcriptome_analysis one fundamental use of transcriptome_analysis is to measure the level of gene_expression and to identify genes that are differentially_expressed between conditions for this purpose rna_seq produces gene_expression with much smaller technical variance than traditional microarray_technologies specifically in a typical rna_seq experiment millions of short_reads are sampled from expressed transcripts and the expression_level of a gene is then measured by the number of reads_mapped back to this gene the variance in the read_count of a gene may be decomposed into the variance due to the random_sampling of reads and the variance due to other sources of variation including technical and biological noise the variance due to read sampling can be closely_approximated by a poisson_distribution which serves as the lower_bound on the overall variance when biological variance is taken into consideration the number of reads_mapped to a gene should resemble an over dispersed poisson_distribution a natural distribution for modeling over dispersed count_data is the negative_binomial nb distribution which has been applied to build tools such as edger deseq and bayseq models other than the nb have also been developed for example built a tool referred to as asc based on the observation that log fold changes obey the normal distribution the same assumption has also been adopted byproposed an ma based method that approximates the distribution of the m value log_fold at given a value log intensity sum with a normal distribution srivastava and chen adopted a two parameter generalized poisson_model to fit the nucleotide wise read_distribution on each gene independently cufflinks adopts the delta method a commonly used method in microarray expression analysis to estimate the variance of the log_fold when comparing rna_seq between two conditions existing_methods calculate a p value for the differential_expression of each gene these p values however do not measure how much a gene is expressed in one condition relative to the other highly_significant p values can result from even miniscule relative differences in gene_expression if the number of sequencing tags available for the comparison is large enough this type of result is contrary to what is of fundamental biological interest in most studies of gene_expression the genes of highest interest are those with large relative differences the relative difference or fold_change is a basic and widely used measure for identifying differential_gene unfortunately the raw fold_change is unreliable because it does not take into account the uncertainty of gene_expression measures under the two conditions being compared in particular the fold changes of genes with low read_counts are less reliable than those of genes with high read_counts in other words fold changes based on read_counts are not comparable for genes with different expression levels or genes of different lengths in microarray_analysis a well known variance stabilization method is fold_change with offset or start log which adds an offset before calculating fold changes researchers have also attempted to combine the fold_change and p value to provide more meaningful_results by setting cutoffs for both the fold_change and p value as in the well known volcano plot however such an ad_hoc technique does not result in meaningful gene rankings although sequencing_costs are rapidly decreasing experimentalists are reluctant to sequence replicate rna samples without pilot_data that demonstrate the utility of the study by comparing single rna_seq treatment samples from control conditions experimentalists can obtain valuable information that allows them to adjust the experimental plan before scaling up to include multiple replicates that may partially explain why almost of all the human rna_seq samples in the gene_expression do not have biological_replicates and more un replicated rna_seq were published than replicated rna_seq in supplementary despite the importance of single replicate studies there is currently no satisfactory method for detecting differentially_expressed when only a single biological replicate is available in this article we describe a technique for estimating fold_change that takes_into the uncertainty of gene_expression measurement by rna_seq we argue that this new measure of fold_change is more informative for the biology of a perturbed system than either p values or raw fold_change especially for single biological replicate experiments from a bayesian perspective our representation of fold_change is derived from the posterior_distribution of the raw fold_change this representation denoted as gfold balances the estimated degree of change with the significance of this change gfold is more reliable than raw fold_change for estimating the relative difference of gene_expression and facilitates the comparison of genes with different expression levels or of different lengths to validate its effectiveness we applied gfold to several datasets with biological_replicates and compared it with edger deseq degseq poisson cufflinks and fold_change with offset by comparing the results of different methods when biological_replicates are not available with the results when biological_replicates are available we were be able to estimate the performance of different methods using information from single replicates we also explored the biological_significance of gene rankings produced using different methods comparisons show that gfold outperforms all other methods in most cases when there is only a single replicate we built a hierarchical_model for cases in which biological_replicates are available in such cases gfold provides comparable results to existing_methods an experiment with multiple treatment and control replicates should be considered better designed and more informative than one that has single treatment and control samples however it is common for experimental_groups to have biological_material that is sufficient for only single replicate rna_seq experiments the data from such experiments provide imperfect information which is nevertheless far better than no information at all in many experimental_settings when it is not clear which downstream experiment is better single replicate experiments are efficient for collecting useful knowledge that allows informed decisions to be made in this study we have shown that gfold provides a more consistent and more biologically_meaningful approach to ranking differentially_expressed than other commonly used methods for rna_seq without biological_replicates although raw fold_change does not take the variance of gene_expression into account and many p value estimation methods rely too much on variance estimates gfold seeks a balance between estimates of expression change and variability the gfold value for each gene can be considered as a robust fold_change which measures primarily the relative change of the expression_level instead of the significance i e p value of differential_expression the evaluation results conducted on real_datasets showed that in the analysis of a single pair of replicates the gene ranking by gfold is better than other methods in terms of consistency with rankings based on multiple replicate data the results from the encode and gro seq dataset suggest that when using single replicate data the rankings produced by gfold are more biologically_meaningful than the gene rankings by other methods we stress that while useful information can be obtained from single replicate experiments an analysis of variation between samples is necessary to draw sound conclusions especially on the individual gene level in comparison with other methods besides fold_change with offset gfold is simple and intuitive if there is no biological replicate gfold is based on only one assumption that the read_count of a gene follows a poisson_distribution on the contrary p value is likely to be inaccurate without reliable measurements and modeling of gene_expression variation because it is in the tails of the null_distribution even if the biological variance has been captured accurately p values from other methods tell only of whether a gene is differentially_expressed and not directly of the relative difference in expression in comparison with gfold fold_change with offset is even simpler and could give comparable results if the optimal offset is selected however it is hard to select the optimal offset furthermore the optimal offset seems uncorrelated with the sequencing_depth in contrast gfold with the default cutoff performed well on all five datasets we have tested gfold is generalizable to isoform level analysis of differential_expression the main_challenge is that a system of linear equations has to be solved before calculating the posterior_distribution of log_fold which is out of scope of this study in general we believe that the ranking of gene_expression changes by gfold using a reliable measure of fold_change is more biologically_meaningful than ranking by pvalue this concept can be broadly applied beyond rna_seq or gro seq to other types of genomic_data including chip_seq
