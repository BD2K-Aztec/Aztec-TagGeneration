genome_analysis mirena finding micrornas with high_accuracy and no learning at genome_scale and from deep sequencing_data micrornas mirnas are a class of endogenes derived from a precursor pre mirna and involved in post_transcriptional experimental identification of novel mirnas is difficult because they are often transcribed under specific conditions and cell_types several computational_methods were developed to detect new mirnas starting from known ones or from deep sequencing_data and to validate their pre mirnas results we present a genome_wide search algorithm called mirena that looks for mirna sequences by exploring a multidimensional space defined by only five physical and combinatorial parameters characterizing acceptable pre mirnas mirena validates pre mirnas with high_sensitivity and detects new mirnas by homology from known mirnas or from deep sequencing_data a performance comparison between mirena and four available predictive systems has been done mirena approach is strikingly simple but it turns out to be powerful at least as much as more sophisticated algorithmic methods mirena obtains better results than three known algorithms that validate pre mirnas it demonstrates that machine_learning is not a necessary algorithmic approach for pre mirnas computational validation in particular machine_learning can only confirm pre mirnas that look alike known ones this being a limitation while exploring species with no known pre mirnas the possibility to adapt the search to specific species possibly characterized by specific properties of their mirnas and pre mirnas is a major_feature of mirena a parameter adjustment calibrates specificity and sensitivity in mirena a key feature for predictive systems which is not present in machine_learning comparison of mirena with mirdeep using deep sequencing_data to predict mirnas highlights a highly_specific predictive_power of mirena availability at the addressmicrornas mirnas are a class of endogenes of nt in length and they occur in a precursor pre mirna with a to whom correspondence should be addressed characteristic hairpin secondary_structure mirnas are involved in post_transcriptional of protein_coding in animals and plants by sequence complementarity within the corresponding messenger_rna since the discoveries of lin and let in caenorhabditis_elegans the number of mirna pre mirna pairs found in mirbase the reference_database collecting all known mirnas from species has grown to more than in version experimental identification of novel mirnas is difficult because they might be transcribed under specific conditions and cell_types only the half out of of mirbase pre mirna mirna pairs have been experimentally_validated several computational_methods were developed to detect mirnas in genomes see for a review a first family of methods tests specific physical and geometrical characteristics of the associated pre mirnas these properties concern the hairpin_structure of sequences that are similar to experimentally known pre mirna sequences a second family is constituted by de_novo methods that use thermodynamic_stability of pre mirna hairpins and characteristic_patterns of sequence_conservation to predict pre mirnas to confirm premirna sequences and their structures tools that are based either on machine_learning or on ranking euclidean_distances in a multidimensional space constructed from more than parameters have been developed a third approach to mirna prediction is based on deep sequencing_data a computational_tool named mirdeep predicting pre mirna mirna pairs by combining experimental_data to a dicer processing model has been introduced we propose a new tool named mirena designed for answering several questions on mirnas and pre mirnas mirena searches for mirnas and pre mirnas at genome_scale and computationally validates pre mirnas it can be used in four different ways depending on available data known mirnas deep sequencing_reads potential mirnas occurring in long_sequences and putative pre mirnas containing potential mirnas it has been compared to four existing computational_tools mipred that classifies sequences from real or pseudo pre mirnas by using a random_forest prediction model with combined features mirabela that uses an ab_initio approach to identify clustered mirnas based on the validation of pre mirnas by apage mirena has been tested in several manners to validate criteria iv we fully varied the corresponding thresholds we evaluated different combinations of these criteria and we compared iv to mirfold criteria mirena performance in the validation of pre mirnas brown path in has been evaluated against three predictive systems mir abela mipred and micropred mirena predictive_power on deep sequencing_data red path in was compared to mirdeep mirena was used to predict mirnas and pre mirnas on six different species black path in starting from known mirnas in mirbase mirena is a platform that helps to test new hypothesis on mirnas and pre mirna structures across organisms it might be that the characteristic length of mirna sequences might vary slightly and a tool like mirena allowing for length calibration can help in silico investigation of the existence of mirna sequences with nonstandard properties similar considerations might be extended to unusual characteristics of pre mirna structures as hairpin multiple branching contrary to what has been usually assumed experimentally_validated multiple branched pre mirnas exist supplementary and in mirbase they constitute the over of experimentally_validated pre mirnas many other properties of mirnas and pre mirnas can be fine_tuned in mirena giving the opportunity to the biologist to perform an in silico identification of mirna sequences possibly with non standard features in experimentally unexplored genomes mirena does not search for structurally_similar pre mirnas in consequence its results are different from those obtained by mostpage
