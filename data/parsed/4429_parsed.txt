stochhmm a flexible hidden_markov tool and c library hidden_markov hmms are probabilistic_models that are well suited to solve many different classification_problems in computation biology stochhmm provides a command_line program and c library that can implement a traditional hmm from a simple text_file stochhmm provides researchers the flexibility to create higher_order emissions integrate additional data_sources and or user_defined functions into multiple points within the hmm framework additional features include user_defined alphabets ability to handle ambiguous characters in an emission dependent_manner user_defined weighting of state paths and ability to tie transition_probabilities to sequence availability_and stochhmm is implemented in c and is available under the mit_license software source_code documentation and examples can be found atsince the first application of hidden_markov hmms to biological_sequences in the s they have become a fundamental tool in bioinformatics this is because of their robust statistical foundation conceptual simplicity and malleability that allow researchers to adapt them to fit diverse classification_problems many hmm_based programs have adapted the basic hmm framework to solve unique biological_problems such as development of generalized hmm ghmm to simplify state durations stochastic sampling to predict alternative_splicing and integration of additional data_sources into the decoding algorithms to improve gene predictions currently there are a small number of different applications libraries and compilers available to quickly develop hmms such as mamot schutzschutz and hmmoc hmmlib ghmm hmmconverter r hmm and matlab each tool differs in the level of expertise required to use them and the features available to the users see stochhmm is a program and c library that provides the ability to implement hmms quickly from a simple text_file it provides accessibility to a broader audience by providing many of the features available in the higher_level libraries without requiring the same level of programming skill in addition to providing traditional hmm algorithms stochhmm implements a few stochastic decoding algorithms and provides multiple_ways to integrate additional data_sources into the model either as multiple independent or joint emissions the c library provides the flexibility to integrate additional user_defined functions into the hmm framework thereby allowing us to integrate existing bioinformatics_tools into the hmm in the human_genome in collaboration with diane schroeder we created a simple state model which uses a unique alphabet based on percent methylation of cpg_sites to classify high and partial methylation domains in multiple methyl seq datasets the stochhmm library was used to implement ploidamatic a state hmm to identify copy_number using nextgeneration whole genome_sequence from a diploid organism porter et_al submitted for publication we are currently using stochhmm to create gene prediction_models that integrate existing bioinformatics_tools and additional data_sources into the hmm framework to improve gene prediction
