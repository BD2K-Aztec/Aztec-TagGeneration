systems_biology batman an r package for the automated quantification of metabolites from nuclear_magnetic using a bayesian_model motivation nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectra are widely used in metabolomics to obtain metabolite profiles in complex biological mixtures common methods used to assign and estimate concentrations of metabolites involve either an expert manual peak fitting or extra pre_processing such as peak alignment and binning peak fitting is very time consuming and is subject to human_error conversely alignment and binning can introduce artefacts and limit immediate biological_interpretation of models results we present the bayesian automated metabolite analyser for nmr_spectra batman an r package that deconvolutes peaks from one dimensional nmr_spectra automatically assigns them to specific metabolites from a target list and obtains concentration estimates the bayesian_model incorporates information on characteristic peak patterns of metabolites and is able to account for shifts in the position of peaks commonly seen in nmr_spectra of biological_samples it applies a markov_chain algorithm to sample from a joint posterior_distribution of the model_parameters and obtains concentration estimates with reduced error compared with conventional numerical integration and comparable to manual deconvolution by experienced spectroscopists availability and implementationnuclear magnetic_resonance nmr_spectroscopy is widely used in metabolomics to provide information on metabolite profiles of complex biological mixtures such as biofluids or tissue_samples these spectra commonly contain around a thousand peaks from possibly hundreds of metabolites the concentrations of metabolites are useful in biomarker_discovery investigating the aetiology of disease and in understanding fundamental biological_processes quantitative measurement of metabolite abundances from nmr_spectra is complicated due to shifting peak positions peak overlap noise and effects of the biological_matrix
