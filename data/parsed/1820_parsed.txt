sequence_analysis fimo scanning for occurrences of a given motif a motif is a short dna or protein_sequence that contributes to the biological_function of the sequence in which it resides over the past several decades many computational_methods have been described for identifying characterizing and searching with sequence_motifs critical to nearly any motif based sequence analysis_pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database for occurrences of a given motif described by a position specific frequency matrix results we describe find individual motif occurrences fimo a software_tool for scanning dna or protein_sequences with motifs described as position_specific the program computes a log likelihood_ratio score for each position in a given sequence database uses established dynamic_programming methods to convert this score to a p value and then applies false_discovery analysis to estimate a q value for each position in the given sequence fimo provides output in a variety of formats including html xml and several santa_cruz genome_browser formats the program is efficient allowing for the scanning of dna_sequences at a rate of mb s on a single_cpu availability_and fimo is part of the meme suite software toolkit a web_server and source_code are available ata dna or protein sequence_motif is a short pattern that is conserved by purifying_selection in dna a motif may correspond to a protein binding_site in proteins a motif may correspond to the active_site of an enzyme or a structural_unit necessary for proper_folding of the protein thus sequence_motifs are one of the basic functional_units of molecular_evolution consequently identifying and understanding these motifs is fundamental to building models of cellular_processes at the molecular_scale and to understanding the mechanisms of human disease we describe here a software_tool called fimo find individual motif occurrences pronounced f em o that carries out in an efficient statistically_rigorous fashion one of the core_functions required for any motif based sequence_analysis scanning a collection of to whom correspondence should be addressed dna or protein_sequences for occurrences of one or more motifs fimo is by no means the first motif scanning method however many publicly_available motif scanners are either not currently maintained or lack some of fimos features summarizes the differences between fimo and eight currently available motif scanners furthermore as part of the meme suite fimo can be used seamlessly in conjunction with a variety of complementary motif based sequence_analysis note that the meme suite provides two other motif scanning algorithms that are useful in different scenarios mast searches with one or more dna or protein motifs against a database composed of relatively short_sequences e g proteins or candidate regulatory_regions assigning a single score to each target_sequence assuming that every motif occurs exactly once in the sequence mcast in contrast uses a hidden_markov to search dna_sequences for regions that are enriched with occurrences of one or more of the given motifs thus mcast is designed to scan chromosomes to detect cis_regulatory containing a known collection of cofactor motifs compared with mast and mcast fimo is simpler and more general fimo only assigns scores to individual motif occurrences it makes no attempt to assign scores to joint occurrences of motifs to sequence_regions or to complete sequences fimo is thus a general_purpose tool for identifying individual candidate binding_sites or protein motifs
