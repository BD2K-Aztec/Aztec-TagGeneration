genetics_and multimeta an r package for meta analyzing multi phenotype genome_wide as new methods for multivariate_analysis of genome_wide become available it is important to be able to combine results from different cohorts in a meta_analysis the r package multimeta provides an implementation of the inverse variance based method for meta_analysis generalized to an n dimensional setting availability_and the r package multimeta can be downloaded from cran genome_wide gwas have been a powerful_tool for genetic discovery for almost a decade results have shed light on many different biological_processes from lipid_metabolism to blood composition as well as social and behavioral_patterns www genome gov gwastudies a key to the success of gwas was the ability to combine several studies in a meta study which allowed sufficiently_large sample_sizes for powered association studies even for variants of small phenotypic effect although typically gwas test one phenotype at a time many biological_features are better described by a combination of several variables thus addressing multiple_phenotypes can give great increase in power by taking_into the underlying correlations between variables multivariate_regression is a straightforward generalization of standard gwas where a linear multivariate mixed model can be fit and allows controlling for population_stratification and relatedness in particular a new set of algorithms included in the gemma software allows for a fast multivariate fitting and testing up to phenotypes in large_sample as for the univariate gwas it might be desirable in some settings to be able to combine multivariate results from different studies to further increase_statistical in genotypephenotype associations here we describe a novel statistically efficient method to perform meta_analysis in a multivariate setting it is an inversevariance based method that allows different weights for each cohort to take into account the accuracy of each effect estimate the inversevariance method has been successfully used for single_trait association testing and is suitable for n dimensional generalization finally it is implemented as part of the r package multimeta to benefit from flexible environment and open_access as well as extra plotting functions for results visualization the method was implemented as part of the r package multimeta together with plotting functions useful for visual representation of the results including manhattan plot quantilequantile plot and an overview plot of effect_sizes for a chosen snp the default options for the meta_analysis function multi meta are set to work with gemma file_format multivariate_analysis option the plotting functions work with output_files from the multi meta function by default however both can be easily adapted to deal with different file_formats by changing options such as field separators or by changing column names as specified in the manual furthermore the plotting functions can be run by passing files and objects in input this choice is meant to provide more flexibility and avoid_unnecessary opening of large files example datasets with only few snps are included in the package and can be analyzed as detailed in the instruction manual to test the software we analyzed uk k data two cohorts total_sample on six lipid related traits apolipoprotein a apoa apolipoprotein b high_density lipids hdl low_density lipids triglycerides and total_cholesterol supplementary results were compared with univariate gwas meta_analysis on the same sample seven known associations were confirmed interestingly two of these lipc and pltp did not reach genomewide significance in the univariate gwas meta_analysis in our sample but did using the multi trait approach clearly showing a gain in power with the latter conversely the multivariate_analysis did not detect one locus on chromosome suggesting that a single test is not necessarily the most powerful and that the two approaches should be complementary supplementaryshows the plot obtained with betas plot function for one of the significant snps the meta_analysis runs on very low memory with default options e g ram mb for two cohorts computation time is s snp for two cohorts and it grows linearly with the addition of other cohorts in input as each snp is analyzed singularly overall computation time depends linearly on the total number of snps by changing settings to increase the dimension of regions in which the genome is divided see manual it is possible to increase the performance while allocating more memory the package is freely_available on cran repository and can be run on any operating system chr chromosome single_trait analysis which trait in the univariate gwas showed_the for the snp ldl low_density lipid tg triglycerides apob apolipoprotein b aonly previously_reported snps are shown www genome gov gwastudies
