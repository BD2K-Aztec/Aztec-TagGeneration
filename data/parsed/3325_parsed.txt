omics pipe a community_based framework for reproducible multi omics_data analysis motivation omics pipe http sulab scripps edu omicspipe is a computational framework that automates multi omics_data analysis_pipelines on high performance compute clusters and in the cloud it supports best practice published pipelines for rna_seq mirna seq exome seq whole_genome chip_seq analyses and automatic processing of data from the cancer_genome tcga omics pipe provides researchers with a tool for reproducible open_source and extensible next_generation analysis the goal of omics pipe is to democratize next_generation analysis by dramatically increasing the accessibility and reproducibil ity of best practice computational_pipelines which will enable researchers to generate biologically_meaningful and interpretable results results using omics pipe we analyzed tcga breast invasive_carcinoma paired_tumor datasets based on the latest ucsc hg refseq annotation omics pipe automatically downloaded and processed the desired tcga samples on a high_throughput compute cluster to produce a results report for each sample we aggregated the individual sample results and compared them to the analysis in the original publications this comparison revealed high overlap between the analyses as well as novel findings due to the use of updated annotations and methods availability_and source_code for omics pipe is freely_available on the web https bitbucket org sulab omics pipe omics pipe is distributed as a standalone python_package for installation https pypi python org pypi omics pipe and as an amazon machine image in amazon_web elastic compute cloud that contains all necessary third_party software dependencies and databases https pythonhosted org omics pipe aws installation html next_generation ngs has presented researchers with the opportunity to collect large_amounts of sequencing_data which has accelerated the pace of genomic_research with applications to personalized_medicine and diagnostics these technologies have resulted in the development of a large number of computational_tools and analysis_pipelines necessitating the creation of best practices and reproducible integrative_analysis several automated pipelines have been developed to tie together individual software_tools such as bcbio nextgen https github com chapmanb bcbio nextgen galaxy and others in addition several groups have published step_by directions for well established best practices in ngs_analysis examples_include the broad institutes best practices for variant_calling using the genome_analysis gatk and encodes standardized data_processing guidelines encode_project despite the establishment of best practices and analysis_pipelines there exists a need for a platform that provides researchers with an analysis tool that can be easily understood and reproduced by other researchers in a variety of computational environments galaxy a widely known platform for performing reproducible computational_analyses has been designed to make computational_analyses accessible to non programmers it allows the user to pipeline together various software_tools pre wrapped by galaxy without the need to learn the implementation details of any single tool in a web_based interface other biologist oriented ngs software_tools include unipro ugene ngs pipelines and the workflow management system taverna while these tools are extremely useful for biologists and other non programmers more advanced users may have a need for a tool that supports programmatic_access to the individual tools is easily extensible and is reproducible several tools exist to allow developers to pipeline together functions such as bpipe snakemake and ruffus although developers are still required to develop their own pipelines using these frameworks a complete analysis_pipeline bcbio nextgen https github com chapmanb bcbio nextgen is designed for bioinformaticians to implement high_throughput optimized ngs analysis_pipelines and requires familiarity with command_line programming the focus of bcbio nextgen is on variant_calling using a variety of software_tools that have been performance optimized for use in bcbio nextgen this makes bcbio nextgen a powerful_tool for implementing variant_calling pipelines however customizing and extending a bcbio nextgen pipeline requires extensive programming knowledge in addition there are several other pipelining tools although many focus only on a single ngs platform require computational expertise require commercial licenses and or are poorly documented necessitating the need for an open_source computational_tool that provides researchers with a reproducible framework to democratize ngs analyses to address this need we developed omics pipe http sulab scripps edu omicspipe an open_source modular computational platform that provides a community curated framework for automating best practice multi omics_data analysis_pipelines with built in version control for reproducibility it currently supports several best practice ngs pipelines a non programmer with basic unix command_line programming experience can easily execute the supported pipelines within omics pipe although the target users for omics pipe are computational_biologists and bioinformaticians that require full programmatic_access to the individual software_tools and parameters the omics pipe framework is modular which allows researchers to easily and efficiently add new analysis tools with scripts in the form of python modules that can then be used to assemble a schematic diagram of omics pipe demonstrating the parallel execution of pipelined tasks and samples omics pipe requires a parameter file in yaml format and can be run on a local compute cluster or in the cloud each run of omics pipe is logged with the version and run information for reproducibility pre built best practice pipelines and the third_party software_tools supported by omics pipe users can easily create custom pipelines from the existing modules and they can create new modules supporting additional third_party software toolswe reanalyzed samples in hours using dell poweredge m blades with two ghz intel quad core e xeonemt processors and gb of ecc ddr memory h per sample runtime on other systems will vary depending on the hardware specs and the number of nodes used the updated ucsc refseq v annotations contained additional genes compared to the ucsc refseq general annotation format from used to originally analyze the tcga data the reanalysis of the tcga breast invasive carcinoma_samples using omics pipe revealed de genes compared to the original tcga analysis which resulted in de genes supplementary tables s and s there were de genes shared between the two analyses in the reanalyzed dataset de genes were unique of which were due to new annotations this result is expected as different algorithms andannotations are used in this study compared to the original analysis one of the newly annotated de genes dscam as was upregulated x in tumor versus normal samples and has been implicated in the malignant_progression of breast_carcinomas by an estrogenindependent mechanism consensus clustering was performed to determine the number and membership of possible clusters within the dataset consensus clustering of the original tcga counts resulted in four clusters with each cluster containing both tumor and normal samples figs and consensus clustering of the reanalyzed counts resulted in clusters with tumor and normal samples clustering separately with the exception of one normal sample clustering with two tumor_samples in cluster figs and these results indicate that improved quantification of genes common to both datasets and the addition of the genes in the new annotation provide_additional to improve the separation of tumor and normal samples twenty significantly dysregulated pathways were identified from the de genes from the original tcga counts and significantly dysregulated pathways were identified in the reanalyzed dataset eleven newly_identified pathways were primarily related to rna_polymerase supplementary tables s and s dysregulation of which has been implicated in mediating malignant_transformation in cancer the reanalysis of the tcga data using a best practice pipeline and updated annotations demonstrates the utility of omics pipe as a tool for conducting reproducible ngs analyses that can lead to novel biological_insights omics pipe is an automated and reproducible community_based framework that can be used to efficiently analyze newly_generated data to reanalyze publically available data and to serve as a framework for community curated ngs analysis_pipelines it currently supports several best practice pipelines for rna_seq wes wgs and chip_seq this list of pipelines will continue to be updated and we invite the broader community to participate in the development of omics pipe through our open source_code repository pull requests for new components and new pipelines will be promptly reviewed future development of omics pipe will include hosting community curated pipelines and modules in addition the built in version control system allows for the reproducibility of analyses performed within the omics pipe framework which is important as new versions of software_tools and annotations are released it can be easily extended as new tools become available and it can be implemented on a local machine a computer cluster or the cloud the goal of omics pipe is to democratize ngs_analysis by dramatically increasing the accessibility and reproducibility of best practice computational_pipelines which will enable researchers to generate biologically_meaningful and interpretable results
