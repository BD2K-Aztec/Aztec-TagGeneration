data_and kaspod a web_service for highly_specific and explorative oligonucleotide design kaspod is a web_service dedicated to the design of signature sequences using a k merbased algorithm such highly_specific and explorative oligonucleotides are then suitable for various goals including phylogenetic oligonucleotide_arrays environmental dna_microarrays including phylogenetic oligonucleotide_arrays poas are key technologies that are well adapted to profiling environmental communities the extreme diversity of microorganisms however means that molecular community exploration or specific analysis of microbial groups are faced with a new challenge designing group specific probe_sets that must harbour a high coverage i e being able to hybridize with all the target_sequences and a high_specificity showing no cross hybridizations with non target_sequences sensitivity i e being able to detect even low_abundance targets and uniformity i e uniform thermodynamic behaviours for all the probes are also main criteria in the selection of the best probe set the development of comprehensive poas requires integrating large_datasets produced by metagenomics projects to assess the coverage and specificity of the probe set unfortunately many available probe design programmes are not suitable to deal with such data to overcome_this two recent strategies have been implemented despite major speed improvements both strategies are still not able to define explorative probes they only define regular oligonucleotides found uniquely in the target group whereas explorative probes take into account the sequence_variability within the target group to define new combinations not yet deposited in public_databases but potentially present in the environment in spite of large_amounts of data our current vision of the microbial_diversity is indeed still incomplete this is partially explained by the tremendous diversity of microbial_species ecological_niches and technological limits detecting of the richness in some complex_environments could require tens_of of times the current sequencing effort microarrays coupled with explorative probe design strategies are therefore well suited to survey complete microbial_communities including microorganisms with uncharacterized sequences currently the only software dedicated to poas that allows the design of explorative probes is the phylarray programme which relies on group specific alignments before the probe design step to identify_conserved probe length regions building large multiple_sequence however represents a time consuming task that is not compatible with high_throughput data here we propose kaspod a fast and alignment_free algorithm to detect group covering signature sequences allowing the design of explorative probes we used kaspod to design mer probes for prokaryotic genera based on the recently_published greengenes taxonomy see supplementary data for complete procedure finally group specific signatures were designed supplementary and are freely_available on the kaspod website_http g im u clermont fr kaspod about php this high_quality probe set could be used to build a poa to allow monitoring of complete prokaryotic communities in complex environmental_samples the probe set was not filtered using thermodynamic calculations to let the users select the entire probe set or subset for their own applications such as polymerase_chain pcr fluorescence_in fish gene capture or in silico for rapid sequence identification a runtime performance analysis of the web_service has been performed and results are available in the supplementary data as kaspod does not allow the generation of probes longer than nucleotides an interesting strategy would be to combine kaspod and goarrays to concatenate two short probes with a random linker this approach produces oligonucleotide_probes as specific as short probes and as sensitive as long ones kaspod could therefore be used for applications such as functional_genes arrays offering the opportunity to generate group specific and explorative probes allowing a broad coverage of multiple sequence_variants for a given gene_family
