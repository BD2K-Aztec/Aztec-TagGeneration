gene_expression spliceplot a utility for visualizing splicing quantitative_trait rna_sequencing has provided unprecedented_resolution of alternative_splicing and splicing quantitative_trait sqtl however there are few tools available for visualizing the genotype_dependent effects of splicing at a population level spliceplot is a simple command_line utility that produces intuitive visualization of sqtls and their effects spliceplot takes mapped rna sequencing_reads in bam format and genotype data in vcf format as input and outputs publication quality sashimi plots hive plots and structure plots enabling better investigation and understanding of the role of genetics on alternative_splicing and transcript structure availability_and source_code and detailed documentation are available at http montgomerylab stanford edu splice plot index html under resources and at github spliceplot is implemented in python and is supported on linux and mac os a virtualbox virtual_machine running ubuntu with spliceplot already installed is also available alternative_splicing is a post_transcriptional process in which exonic_regions of the pre_mrna are spliced together and intronic_regions are removed because numerous combinations of exons can be spliced together splicing contributes significantly to the diversity of the transcriptome and the resultant proteome further adding to this diversity genetic_variation in cis_acting splice_site regulators and trans_acting splicing_factors can affect patterns of splicing between individuals and potentially manifest as phenotypic_differences here the study of splicing quantitative_trait sqtls through the statistical_testing of genetic_association with changes in alternative_splicing proves useful in identifying_functional effects that may contribute to the etiology of various genetic_diseases the invention of rna_sequencing rna_seq provides high_resolution single base characterization and quantification of the transcriptome providing enhanced resolution of patterns of alternative_splicing specifically using rna_seq the usage of exons and splice_junctions can be precisely quantified enabling the comparison of splicing between individuals in a population indeed several studies have reported on extensive diversity of sqtl detectable from rna_seq however currently there are few if any existing_tools that provide convenient and effective visualizations of sqtl and their effects in rna_seq existing_tools such as the sashimi plot provided within the miso package are capable of showing differential splicing between individual samples but not between genotypes a three way comparison because the study of sqtls is by nature a study of individuals within a population effective sqtl visualization requires tools that integrate population scale rna_seq and genotype_information to visualize the effect of genetic_variation on alternative_splicing here we present spliceplot a command_line utility for visualizing the effects of genetic_variants on alternative_splicing and transcript structure it produces hive plots and structure plots as novel ways of visualizing and comparing patterns of splicing as measured by splice junctionspanning reads by genotype it also modifies and extends the sashimi plot to support the comparison of splicing and transcript structure between genotypic groups such visualizations take advantage of the high_precision quantification of rna_seq and enable a better understanding of the genetic effects behind alternative_splicing in rna_seq spliceplot is an analytic tool for summarizing read data and generating intuitive publication quality figures for visualizing sqtl it draws hive plots structure plots and sashimi plots to enable the effective comparison of alternative_splicing and transcript structure we have further provided an ubuntu virtual_machine containing thedataset with spliceplot this virtual_machine can be downloaded and installed to allow users to investigate loci of interest thereby providing new opportunity for the research_community to investigate the impact of any genetic_variant on splicing
