uniref clusters a comprehensive and scalable alternative for improving sequence_similarity motivation uniref databases provide full scale clustering of uniprotkb sequences and are utilized for a broad range of applications particularly similarity based functional_annotation non redundancy and intra cluster homogeneity in uniref were recently improved by adding a sequence_length overlap threshold our hypothesis is that these improvements would enhance the speed and sensitivity of similarity_searches and improve the consistency of annotation within clusters results intra cluster molecular_function consistency was examined by analysis of gene_ontology results show that uniref clusters bring together proteins of identical molecular_function in more than of the clusters implying that clusters are useful for annotation and can also be used to detect annotation inconsistencies to examine coverage in similarity results blastp searches against uniref followed by expansion of the hit lists with cluster members demonstrated advantages compared with searches against uniprotkb sequences the searches are concise times shorter hit list before expansion faster times and more sensitive in detection of remote similarities recall at e value our results support the use of uniref clusters as a comprehensive and scalable alternative to native sequence_databases for similarity_searches and reinforces its reliability for use in functional_annotation availability_and web access and file download from uniprot website atthe uniref databases uniprot reference clusters provide clustered sets of sequences from the uniprot knowledgebase and selected uniparc records to obtain complete coverage of sequence_space at several resolutions and identity while hiding redundant sequences the uniref database combines identical_sequences and subfragments from any source organism into a single uniref entry i e cluster uniref and uniref are built by clustering uniref sequences at the or sequence_identity levels uniref entries contain v c the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work doi bioinformatics btu advance_access date november original paper summary cluster and membership information including the sequence of a representative best annotated protein member count and common taxonomy of the cluster the accession_numbers of all the merged entries and links to rich functional_annotation in uniprotkb to facilitate biological discovery the uniref databases have been produced for years and are used worldwide for a broad range of applications since first released in uniref has been cited over times based on google_scholar and unique citations from pubmed central unirefs ability to reduce redundancy while preserving information on source and quality annotation has proven useful in many studies based on the citation analysis the most common uses of uniref databases continue to be in functional_annotation family classification systems_biology structural_genomics phylogenetic_analysis and mass_spectrometry recent_studies have also used uniref for improving protein sequence_alignments through homology extension increasing sequence_search sensitivity with transitive alignments developing representative proteomes and proteome clusters predicting the functional effects of disease variants performing functional screening of metagenomics_data developing large_scale hierarchical clustering_algorithms studying gene_duplication and conducting genomic studies of peptide and oligonucleotide frequencies based on the uniprot usage statistics uniref web_pages receive approximately hits per month the uniref file download has been increasing steadily since its inception with an annual growth_rate of in recent_years now reaching more than annual unique ip downloads in this article we present analysis of two additional qualities of uniref databases that clusters bring together proteins with similar to identical functional_annotation and that similarity_searches are faster and as sensitive as searches on native sequence_databases we also provide an update on uniref database production and coverage
