nonlinear dimension_reduction with wright fisher kernel for genotype aggregation and association_mapping motivation association tests based on next_generation data are often under powered due to the presence of rare_variants and large amount of neutral or protective variants a successful strategy is to aggregate genetic_information within meaningful single_nucleotide snp sets e g genes or pathways and test association on snp sets many existing_methods for group wise tests require specific assumptions about the direction of individual snp effects and or perform poorly in the presence of interactions results we propose a joint association test strategy based on two key components a nonlinear supervised dimension_reduction approach for effective snp information aggregation and a novel kernel specially_designed for qualitative genotype data the new test demonstrates superior_performance in identifying causal_genes over existing_methods across a large variety of disease_models simulated from sequence_data of real genes in general the proposed method provides an association test strategy that can i detect both rare and common causal_variants ii deal with both additive and interaction effect iii handle both quantitative_traits and disease dichotomies and iv incorporate non genetic covariates in addition the new kernel can potentially boost the power of the entire_family of kernel based_methods for genetic data analysis availability the method is implemented in matlab source_code is available upon request genome_wide gwass based on singlenucleotide polymorphism snp_chips have enjoyed varying_degrees of success in identifying genes associated with complex_diseases or traits it has now been widely_accepted that standard gwas explains at most a small fraction of the population variation of most complex_traits recently deep resequencing is emerging as a new and potent means for mapping complex_trait genes resequencing delivers orders_of more variants than snp_chips and include both common_variants with minor_allele maf as well as rare_variants with maf availability of rare_variant information presents unique opportunities to evaluate the common disease rare_variants hypothesis this hypothesis states that a complex disease can be attributed to multiple rare_variants with relatively high risks and it has attracted_much in recent_studies attesting to this hypothesis a number of deleterious or protective rare_variants have been identified for low to whom correspondence should be addressed plasma levels_of hypertension and type i diabetes identifying disease associated rare_variants however is challenging because a particular rare_disease predisposing allele may be present in only a handful of patients henceforth traditional single marker tests that capture only marginal_effects are doomed to have low power a useful strategy to address this challenge is to effectively merge information in snp variants by some meaningful snp sets for instance genes or pathways and then to identify disease associated genes or pathways rather than disease variants following this idea several aggregation based association test approaches have been developed proposed a group wise test exploiting both multivariate and collapsing strategies that possess higher power than a simple multivariate test or simple collapsing madsen andextended the method by incorporating weights that depend on maf into the group wise statistics and approximating p values by permutations within each group both methods consider rare_variants with maf falling below a pre specified threshold and exclude common_variants from analysis this separate treatment seems counterproductive because in reality both common and rare_variants can be informative the pooling strategy ofcircumvents the issue of arbitrarily chosen frequency threshold by calculating a group wise statistic under a variety of thresholds however this strategy also has several limitations first environmental predictors are excluded from analysis even though they may contribute significantly to a disease second interactions among snps cannot be effectively detected third the solution is sensitive to the classification of variants if all types of variants deleterious protective or neutral coexist then various signals can cancel one another during the pooling and thus can potentially compromise statistical_power proposed a snp set genotype based statistic for rare_variants and declared that the common_variants and environment factors can be modeled together with the rare_variant statistic in a logistic_regression lr model however interactions between rare and common_variants still cannot be explicitly modeled in this way and the method handles only dichotomous traits the field of statistical dimension_reduction dr offers a useful and appealing means for genotype aggregation it is based on the belief that high_dimensional can be effectively summarized in a low dimensional_space and the subsequent modeling can concentrate on the reduced space the most commonly used dimension_reduction approach is principal_components pca applied pca to combine snp information within pathways generated the so_called eigen snps and used eigen snps in subsequent association_mapping however pca has at least two limitations first pca aggregates snps regardless of the phenotypic trait information since mapping traits to associated genes is of ultimate interest it is intuitively desirable to aggregate snps under the guidance of trait information such as disease status or quantitative_traits in statistical terms pca is an unsupervised dr solution whereas a supervised dr solution is preferred second the eigen snps or principle components are linear_combinations of the snps as a consequence such summary measures may fail to capture complex interacting effects among the individual snps and in turn reduce the power of subsequent association_mapping in this article we develop a powerful association mapping_approach based on next_generation data two key ingredients of the proposed method are a statistical dr that achieves supervised and nonlinear reduction and a new kernel that is based on markov_chain theory and particularly suitable for qualitative snp data our contributions are mainly folds first the proposed association mapping_approach simultaneously takes_into i both rare and common_variants ii both additive and interaction effect iii quantitative_traits as well as disease dichotomies and iv non genetic covariates second the commonly used kernels such as gaussian polynomial and spline work successfully with continuous attributes but may perform poorly for discrete genetic data the proposed new kernel is specially_designed for discrete attributes and can effectively capture the similarity between individual genotypes moreover the new kernel is novelly derived from powerful markov_chain theory and can benefit many kernel_based learning methods in general we compare our proposal with some state of the art aggregation and mapping solutions and find that our method clearly achieves superior power in a variety of different genetic model scenarios the remainder of the article is organized as follows section_describes our proposed association_mapping including kernel_based nonlinear dr and construction of new kernels section_presents numerical studies comparing various aggregation and association_mapping solutions section concludes the article with a discussion and suggests potential future extensions ideally an association test should be able to handle i high_dimensionality of genomic dataset which typically far exceeds the sample_size ii both rare and common_variants iii additive recessive and dominant models of gene action iv both quantitative_traits and disease dichotomies and v non genetic covariates most of existing solutions could not deliver across the board judged by all those criteria to bridge the gap we have proposed a strategy based on nonlinear supervised dr and a new kernel to effectively aggregate genotype_information such an aggregation increases the likelihood of detecting multiple causal_variants whereas nonlinear reduction permits complex interactive relationship among genetic_variants moreover the glm framework based on the aggregated features can naturally handle both quantitative and categorical traits and incorporate non genetic predictors and or environmental_variables finally the proposed wf kernel_based on markov_chain theory for genotype data has been proven useful compared with some existing kernels and can potentially benefit a wide_range of kernel methods such as kernel pca support_vector and nonparametric and semiparametric regressions
