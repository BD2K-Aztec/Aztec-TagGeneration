gene_expression inferring epigenetic and transcriptional_regulation during blood_cell with a mixture of sparse linear models_motivation blood_cell is thought to be controlled by a circuit of transcription_factors tfs and chromatin_modifications that determine the cell_fate through activating cell_type expression programs to shed light on the interplay between histone_marks and tfs during blood_cell we model gene_expression from regulatory_signals by means of combinations of sparse linear_regression results the mixture of sparse linear_regression was able to improve the gene_expression prediction in relation to the use of a single linear_model moreover it performed an efficient selection of regulatory_signals even when analyzing all tfs with known motifs the method identified interesting roles for histone_modifications and a selection of tfs related to blood development and chromatin_remodelling availability the method and datasets are available fromblood development in mammals is an ideal system to study cell_differentiation and proliferation all blood cells arise from a single multipotent hematopoietic_stem hsc this stem_cell can differentiate in lymphoid and myeloid_progenitors which will give rise to erythrocytes and immune_cells such as monocytes megakaryocytes b and t cells the different cell_types are distinguishable by specific cell_surface proteins and can readily be obtained from the blood of adult individuals through cell_sorting for the purified cell_populations cell_type expression_profiles and dnaprotein interactions can subsequently be obtained using microarrays and chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip assays blood_cell is thought to be controlled by a circuit of transcription_factors tfs that determine the cell_fate through activating cell_type expression programs to whom correspondence should be addressed in addition there is an increasing awareness of the role of chromatin_structure in regulating expression during development in particular the presence_or of posttranscriptional histone_modifications hms termed the histone code modulates the affinity of histones to dna and thus determines whether a dna region is accessible for the transcriptional_machinery for instance the histone_marks h_k h_k and h kac are known to be associated with genes that are either actively_transcribed or whose transcription is readily activated upon stimulus while promoters bearing the histone_marks h_k and h_k tend to be inactive understanding the interplay between particular hms and tf_binding is crucial for uncovering cell differentiation_processes to shed light on the interplay between histone_marks and tfs during blood_cell in this study we model gene_expression by means of combinations of linear_regression the main idea behind this approach is to combine all regulatory_signals to explain the expression pattern of the genes as tfs and hms can act in a multi_functional manner conveying both transcriptional_repression and activation depending on their location with respect to the transcription_start tss and the presence of other tfs in the surroundings the value of the regression_coefficients thereby indicates not only the importance of a particular regulatory signal but also whether a signal activates or represses_transcription we have recently shown that combining more than one regression_model in a mixture where each of the regression_models explains the expression of a particular group of genes improves the expression prediction and identification of important regulatory players previous_works were however based on the analysis of only a small subset of possible regulatory_signals as standard linear_regression suffers from over fitting on high dimensional_space in addition regulatory_signals tend to be correlated with a given subset of tfs and or hms being present on the same group of promoters although it is important that the model indicates all regulatory_signals that are important to a particular cell_type standard regression_models give arbitrary coefficients for correlated or co linear variables failing to give a proper interpretation of all important variables here we propose a novel methodology mixture of sparse linear_regression to describe the expression of genes sparse linear_models perform a time efficient selection of important features even in the presence of a high number of regression variables the sparse model is determined the elastic_net displays the so_called grouping effect that is co linear variables are simultaneously included in or excluded from the model and all grouped variables have equivalent regression_coefficients therefore our method is not only capable of analyzing all tfs with known motifs but also allows to identify all regulatory_signals co linear or not which play_an in a particular cell_type we have developed a novel method for predicting gene_expression that combines the use of linear mixture_models with an efficient way to select the relevant predictor_variables from a large set of regulatory_signals the approach is ideally_suited to integrate high_dimensional normally not applicable in standard linear_regression for instance when provided the full set of binding_affinities from vertebrate transfac matrices together with hm data to model gene_expression in blood cells the algorithm performed a sparse selection retaining only out of over input variables the resulting sparse linear mixture_models not only significantly_improved gene_expression predictions by capturing non linear relations with the retained regulatory_signals but also allowed to readily identify and characterize the relevant regulatory_signals in particular the model predicted known roles of hms and could select a small set of tfs related to development and hematopoiesis to particular developmental_stages the proposed method has three main parameters to be optimized k and and at the moment cannot make use of the regularization paths together with the em_algorithm further work will thus be required to develop efficient methods for optimizing the parameters in addition tf binding_affinities can accurately be predicted only for proximal promoters and well conserved upstream elements the addition of epigenetic_information which can further characterize distal enhancers and active promoters is likely to improve the tf_binding predictions and is current work in progress large consortia such as the epigenetic roadmap encode and blueprint epigenome are releasing expression epigenetic and binding data on an unprecedented scale although our approach offers a new way to integration such large_scale datasets it remains a big_challenge to further unravel the regulatory mechanisms_underlying the developmental_processes shaping the human_body
