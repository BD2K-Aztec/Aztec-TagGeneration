gene_expression direction pathway analysis of large_scale proteomics_data reveals novel features of the insulin_action pathway motivation with the advancement of high_throughput techniques large_scale profiling of biological_systems with multiple experimental perturbations is becoming more prevalent pathway analysis incorporates prior_biological to analyze genes proteins in groups in a biological_context however the hypotheses under investigation are often confined to a d space i e up down either or mixed regulation here we develop direction pathway analysis dpa which can be applied to test hypothesis in a high dimensional_space for identifying pathways that display distinct responses across multiple perturbations results our dpa approach allows for the identification of pathways that display distinct responses across multiple perturbations to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness we evaluated dpa under various simulated scenarios and applied it to study insulin_action in adipo cytes a major action of insulin in adipocytes is to regulate the movement of proteins from the interior to the cell_surface quantitative mass_spectrometry was used to study this process on a large_scale the combined dataset comprises four separate treatments by applying dpa we identified that several insulin responsive pathways in the plasma membrane_trafficking are only partially dependent on the insulin regulated kinase akt we subsequently validated our findings through targeted analysis of key_proteins from these pathways using immunoblotting and live_cell microscopy our results demonstrate that dpa can be applied to dissect pathway networks testing diverse hypotheses and integrating_multiple experimental perturbations availability_and the r package directpa is

interpreting omics scaled data generated from high_throughput techniques such as microarray rna_seq and quantitative mass_spectrometry ms based proteomics it has the advantage of leveraging high_dimensionality and limited replicates by organizing genes and proteins into groups and analyzing them in biological meaningful contexts to date numerous pathway analysis approaches have been proposed emmert and several taxonomies have been described to categorize them one of the popular categorization approaches is to classify pathway analysis methods as using an over representation approach or aggregate score approach the over representation approach exemplified by hypergeometric_test using gene_ontology go requires a preselected list of differentially_expressed de genes to be supplied before the test it could be sensitive to the cut_off applied to select de genes the aggregate score approach exemplified by gene_set gsea alleviates this requirement by considering statistics associated with all genes for testing pathway differential regulation there are several recent extensions on pathway analysis these include the extensions from univariate to multivariate statistics such as the use of hotellings t statistics and n statistics and from single analysis to meta_analysis such as combining results from multiple studies different platforms and or multiple methods nevertheless current pathway analysis methodologies are mainly designed for testing hypotheses in a d space and focus on identifying pathways that show up down either or mixed differential regulations due to the growing complexity of large_scale experiments where multiple_treatments are applied for example to dissect the signalling_networks a novel pathway analysis approach that can incorporate multiple perturbations into a single statistical_analysis is desirable to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the broad term experimental perturbations is used to describe any situation in which a cell has been agitated and its reaction quantified practically speaking when referring to multiple experimental perturbations we may be referring to quantifying the effects of a treatment versus control at various cellular levels dna rna protein we could also consider multiple experimental perturbations to refer to various treatment comparisons at the same cellular_level in this study we propose direction pathway analysis dpa for integrating_multiple perturbations in pathway analysis this method integrates multiple experimental perturbations by coupling coordinate rotation with p value combination techniques it extends on traditional pathway analysis in the following aspects the method increases statistical_power by integrating_multiple perturbations for testing in a high dimensional_space the method improves biological interpretability by translating a biological_question into a direction specific test broadening the hypothesis space and allowing many more biological_questions to be investigated the method is flexible and can be extended to n dimensions where n is the number of experimental perturbations to demonstrate the effectiveness of p value combination techniques at answering various alternative_hypotheses we designed and performed a set of simulation_studies these studies offer insight into the selection of an appropriate combination technique for dpa in integrating information on testing pathway enrichment to explore the utility of the method we applied this approach to ms based proteomics_data obtained from adipocytes aiming to identify insulin_action pathways under various treatments adipocytes are one of the major targets of insulin_action in mammals one of the major pathways downstream of the insulin_receptor is the phosphatidylinositol_kinase pi_k to date the majority of evidence points towards akt alone being sufficient to elicit the majority of insulins intracellular actions however there are pi k dependent akt independent pathways that are activated by insulin_stimulation and it is possible that such pathways may also regulate protein_trafficking events in response to insulin to dissect pi_k pathways and determine the contributions of akt independent and akt dependent_pathways we used various pharmacological_agents to target different signal_transduction nodes and subsequently performed plasma_membrane purification and silac based quantitative proteomic_profiling by analyzing the proteomic_profile using dpa we identified that several pathways were enriched in the plasma_membrane following insulin_stimulation and that these trafficking events were strongly_dependent pi k signalling however the translocation of these pathways was not fully blocked in the presence of an akt_inhibitor suggesting that there are akt independent pathways that promote membrane_trafficking events in response to insulin we validated these findings through targeted analysis of several key_proteins from these insulin regulated_pathways using immunoblotting and live_cell microscopy in this study we developed dpa for detecting biologically_relevant pathways under multiple experimental perturbations this method tests a hypothesis by rotating the test_statistics and combining across both proteins and multiple experimental perturbations using p value combination compared with traditional pathway analysis dpa allows many more biological_questions formulated as an alternative hypothesis and tested directly we subsequently applied dpa to identify pathways that are significantly_enriched at the plasma_membrane in response to insulin_stimulation and differentially inhibited by different inhibitors with the goal of dissecting insulin regulated processes and their dependence on pi k and akt kinases by examining a specific alternative hypothesis we identified several key regulatory_pathways to be plasma_membrane enriched in a pi k dependent and partial akt dependent way we then validated the key_proteins in these pathways using immunoblotting and live_cell microscopy_techniques collectively this study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed dpa approach to aid the analysis of global datasets generated from experiments consisting of multiple perturbations in this case dpa helped identify and dissect the key signalling nodes of insulin regulation in adipocytes microscopy of glut and tfr a and b are images of t l adipocytes expressing
