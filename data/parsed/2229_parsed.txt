structural_bioinformatics how significant is a protein_structure similarity with tm_score motivation protein_structure similarity is often measured by root_mean deviation global distance test score and template modeling score tm_score however the scores themselves cannot provide information on how significant the structural_similarity is also it lacks a quantitative relation between the scores and conventional fold classifications this article aims to answer two questions i what is the statistical_significance of tm_score ii what is the probability of two proteins having the same fold given a specific tm_score results we first made an all to all gapless structural match on non homologous single_domain in the pdb and found that the tm scores follow an extreme value distribution the data allow us to assign each tm_score a p value that measures the chance of two randomly_selected proteins obtaining an equal or higher tm_score with a tm_score at for instance its p value is which means we need to consider at least million random protein pairs to acquire a tm_score of no less than second we examine the posterior_probability of the same fold proteins from three datasets scop cath and the consensus of scop and cath it is found that the posterior_probability from different datasets has a similar rapid phase_transition around tm_score this finding indicates that tm_score can be used as an approximate but quantitative criterion for protein topology classification i e protein pairs with a tm_score are mostly in the same fold while those with a tm_score are mainly not in the same fold protein_structure comparison is essential in almost every aspect of modern structural_biology ranging from experimental protein structure_determination to computer based protein_folding and structure_prediction from protein topology classification to structure based protein_function and from proteinligand docking to new compound screening and drug_design the most to whom correspondence should be addressed commonly used means to compare protein_structures is to calculate the root_mean deviation rmsd of all the equivalent atom pairs after the optimal superposition of the two structures however because all atoms in the structures are equally weighted in the calculation one of the major_drawbacks of rmsd is that it becomes more sensitive to the local structure deviation than to the global topology when the rmsd value is big for example the rmsd of two protein_structures can be high if the tails or some loops have a different orientation even though the global topology of the core part is the same this cannot be distinguishable based on the rmsd value alone from the case where two structures have completely different topologies aiming at developing protein topology sensitive measures proposed a global distance test score gdt score which counts the number of c pairs which have a distance and after the optimal superposition proposed maxsub to identify the maximum substructures which have c pairs these measurements were extensively used in the community_wide casp and cafasp experiments for assessing the modeling accuracy of protein_structure predictions however the distance cutoffs in both gdt and maxsub scores are subjective and may need to be manually tuned for different categories of modeling targets moreover similar to rmsd the magnitude of the gdt and maxsub scores for random structure pairs has a power_law dependence with the protein length which renders the absolute value of the scores less meaningful some structural_alignment based scores e g the mammoth score and the dali z_score have also been often exploited to access the accuracy of protein_structure however these measurements neglect the alignment_accuracy of the structure modeling for example a structure model built on a template protein with a wrong alignment will have the same structural_alignment scores as the model on the same template but with a correct alignment these scores also have the drawback that the similarity of related proteins strongly depends on their length to address_these zhang and skolnick recently_developed a template modeling score tm_score which counts all residue pairs using the levittgerstein weight and therefore does not need discrete distance cutoffs since the short_distance in the levittgerstein matrix is weighted stronger than the long_distance the tm_score
