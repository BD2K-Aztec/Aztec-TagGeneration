systems_biology bridging the scales semantic integration of quantitative sbml in graphical multi cellular_models and simulations with episim and copasi motivation biological reality can in silico only be comprehensively represented in multi scaled models to this end cell behavioural models addressing the multi cellular_level have to be semantically linked with mechanistic molecular_models these requirements have to be met by flexible software workflows solving the issues of different time scales inter model variable referencing and flexible sub model embedding results we developed a novel software workflow episim for the semantic integration of systems_biology sbml based quantitative_models in multi scaled tissue models and simulations this workflow allows to import and access sbml based models sbml model species reactions and parameters are semantically integrated in cell behavioural models cbm represented by graphical process diagrams by this cellular_states like proliferation and differentiation can be flexibly linked to gene regulatory or biochemical_reaction for a multi_scale agent based tissue simulation executable code is automatically generated where different time scales of imported sbml models and cbm have been mapped we demonstrate the capabilities of the novel software workflow by integrating tysons cell_cycle model in our model of human epidermal tissue_homeostasis finally we show the semantic interplay of the different biological scales during tissue simulation availability the episim platform is available as binary executables for windows linux and mac os x atmany systems biological_models have been developed in the past_years the vast_majority of these models focus exclusively on the sub cellular or the cellular_level whereas only a minority are really multi scaled however semantic linking of systems biological scales with models on sub cellular cellular and tissue level is a we previously_introduced the episim platform as a graphical cell behavioural modelling and tissue simulation workflow here we extend our work towards a platform allowing direct semantic integration of sbml based sub cellular and graphical cell behavioural models i we implemented an sbml model importer for our graphical modelling system gms ii the gms was moreover extended by a graphical editor for sbml model species parameters and reactions any sbml model item can be directly referenced and manipulated in a graphical cell behavioural model cbm this allows building a conceptual semantic model link between the biological scales iii to realize the according technical link we built a code generator for automatic generation of a model connector software component mcc mcc connects a cells multi agent based cbm simulation with an imported sbml models time course simulation mcc handles multi directional dataflow and mapping of the different model time scales iv copasi was integrated in our simulation environment se for time course simulation of imported quantitative sbml based models we demonstrate the capabilities of the new software workflow by importing and semantically integrating tysons cell_cycle model in our model of human epidermal tissue_homeostasis we directly link cellular_states like proliferation and differentiation to the behaviour of tysons model finally we show the semantic interplay between the sub cellular and the cell behavioural model in the tissue simulation to demonstrate the capabilities of our newly_developed multi_scale tissue modelling and simulation workflow we semantically integrated tysons cell_cycle model in our in graphical cbm of epidermal homeostasis grabe and neuber the time t mapped is calculated based on the two time intervals t sem cbm and t sem sbml representing semantically equivalent periods from a biological_perspective in the given example these time periods as well as the atomic times differ hence h in the tissue simulation is mapped to h in the sbml model_simulation the time mapping as well as bi_directional data flow is facilitated by an automatically generated to this end we imported both the variable and the variable version of tysons model with our gms both versions of the sbml model files were obtained from biomodels_database the variable model version was semantically integrated in our graphical cbm we therefore completely remodelled our epidermal cbms cell_cycle sub model section and parts of our cell_differentiation sub model section the variable model version was imported to show the gmss automatic elimination of namespace conflicts section and the mccs capabilities section to handle multiple imported sbml models finally we ran a multi_scale agent based tissue simulation with the se to demonstrate the semantic interplay of sbml based sub cellular_models and graphical cbms in a multi cellular_context section the whole multi_scale workflow is illustrated by a series of supplementary movies supplementary movie m m the graphical modelling language is described in supplements s the software_tools and all modelling projects or simulation_data used in the movies can be downloaded from the supplements website we developed and introduced the first entirely graphical multi_scale cell behavioural modelling and simulation software workflow that semantically links the sub cellular and cellular_level in tissue simulations semantic linking comprises flexible mapping of time scales enabling of bi_directional model variable access and by this linking of general cellular_states like proliferation and differentiation to molecular_processes and vice_versa cellular behaviour is graphically modelled with process diagrams an unlimited number of quantitative sbml based models can be imported with the gms this enables a semantic integration of sub cellular in cell behavioural models we integrated copasi in the se for calculating deterministic time course simulations of the imported sbml models for each individual cell an automatically generated mcc handles the data flow between sub cellular and cell behavioural models during tissue simulation time course simulation states can be stored together with the overall tissue simulation state in a simulation snapshot based on such snapshot a tissue simulation can be fully resumed moreover this enables archiving re using and exchanging of tissue simulation_results among users of the se simulation snapshots allow rerunning a published tissue simulation that goes far beyond the information conveyed by a simulation movie however the lack of a commonly_accepted standard for representing cell_based as well as the according simulation_results hinders the exchange of both models and results between different existing modelling and simulation environments such a standard is in our view the prerequisite for realizing re usable and ready to run multi_scale models in a fashion that is comparable with sub cellular_models using sbml to demonstrate the applicability of our software workflow we imported the sbml version of tysons well known variable cell_cycle model with the gms in our model of epidermal homeostasis we linked the imported sub cellular model with the cellular_states proliferation and differentiation cell_division in proliferating keratinocytes is controlled by the active mpf concentration modelled on the sub cellular_level in turn the behaviour of tysons model is coupled to a keratinocytes differentiation_stage on the cellular_level by this we were able to demonstrate a bi_directional semantic link between the sub cellular and cellular modelling and simulation level additionally we demonstrated the automatic elimination of namespace conflicts by importing the variable version of tysons for both model versions the sbml model time units could be successfully mapped to the required cbm time steps this shows that with the developed workflow sbml models can be re used in a context requiring a different time scale without re parameterizing the sbml model one might argue that such a mapping of semantically equivalent periods should not be necessary but actually the necessity of directly manipulating parameters of an ode based model would contradict our initial requirement of re usability of sbml models moreover we see time mapping as a valuable_technique for model synchronization and simpler multi_scale model integration finally we demonstrated that the se is able to administer time course simulationsthe monitored ta cell differentiates to an early spinosum cell after one cell_division this corresponds on the sub cellular_level to a transition of tysons cell_cycle model from oscillating to steady_state behaviour of multiple imported quantitative sbml models the se successfully handled individual time course simulations per tissue simulation step in the d simulation the computation time per simulation step increases linearly for increasing cell_numbers independent of optimization by the modeller moreover this indicates the power of the episim code generator and the approach of automatically translating graphical cbms into highly_efficient and optimized executable code sutterlin our software workflow allows graphically building multiscaled models without any coding this is a unique approach compared with other available systems the available model elements supplements s of the graphical modelling language allow deterministic stochastic or hybrid modelling even continuous models can be manually integrated supplements s all control structures of a programming_language like branching based on conditions or values are available loops are automatically induced when neighbouring cells are referenced graphical cbms are linked to a hard coded biomechanical_model provided by the se this modularization into biomechanical and cell behavioural models is not necessarily a limitation moreover it allows re using one and the same cbm in d and d as demonstrated the integration of new biomechanical models in the se is explicitly intended furthermore the gms could be adopted and connected to other simulation environments like compucell d with manageable workload the gms as well as the se hides to a large extent the technical complexity of modelling and simulating cellular behaviour in a tissue context furthermore the separation of technical complexity and systems biological model_complexity is in our view a key requirement for building highly complex multi_scale models this is the main lesson learned from the field of software engineering where model driven architectures are analogous this complexity separation fosters the creation of more complex truly multi scaled models by not computer but rather biologically skilled scientists public_databases like biomodels provide complete ready to run sbml models hucka and lenov re with our novel software workflow we established a link to this large and up to now unexploited potential for building multi_scale models in a multi cellular_context to come up with more realistic and consequently more complex biological_models it is inevitable to rely on an existing ready to use model base instead of starting from scratch solely based on literature however this requires that increasingly sub cellular_models are developed with a focus on the functional behavioural change of cells such models could be models of cell decision for proliferation differentiation migration or apoptosis this currently in literature underrepresented aspect is in our view an essential prerequisite for building higher complexity models in this context our multi_scale workflow motivates the integration of existing_models or the creation of novel ones in consequence we expect this to be the route to more holistic models of larger biological_systems
