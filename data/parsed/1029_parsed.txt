data_and cobweb a java_applet for network exploration and visualisation cobweb is a java_applet for real_time network_visualization its strength lies in enabling the interactive_exploration of networks therefore it allows new nodes to be interactively added to a network by querying a database on a server the network constantly rearranges to provide the most meaningful topological view availability cobweb is available under the gplv and may be freely downloaded atnetwork based techniques are used today to tackle a wide_variety of scientific questions ranging from interaction mechanisms in protein networks to signalling_pathway analysis consequently there is a strong need to have tools to visualize and explore networks such as cytoscape gephi and proviz however these programs aim at visualizing large_networks and offer many features they cannot be integrated into web_sites and have a significant learning_curve therefore we have developed cobweb as a java_applet that has fewer features but can be easily used from any webpage cobweb offers uncomplicated real_time visualization of networks up to a few hundred nodes in contrast to earlier web based_approaches such as medusa and jsquid cobweb stresses interactive features thus it is possible to interactively add new nodes to the network at which time the network_topology changes to provide the most uncluttered view
