construction and completion of flux balance models from pathway_databases motivation flux_balance fba is a well known technique for genome_scale modeling of metabolic_flux typically an fba formulation requires the accurate specification of four sets biochemical_reactions biomass metabolites nutrients and secreted metabolites the development of fba models can be time consuming and tedious because of the difficulty in assembling completely accurate descriptions of these sets and in identifying errors in the composition of these sets for example the presence of a single non producible metabolite in the biomass will make the entire model infeasible other difficulties in fba modeling are that model distributions and predicted fluxes can be cryptic and difficult to understand results we present a multiple gap_filling method to accelerate the development of fba models using a new tool called metaflux based on mixed_integer milp the method suggests corrections to the sets of reactions biomass metabolites nutrients and secretions the method generates fba models directly from pathway genome_databases thus fba models developed in this framework are easily queried and visualized using the pathway tools software predicted fluxes are more easily comprehended by visualizing them on diagrams of individual metabolic_pathways or of metabolic maps metaflux can also remove redundant high flux loops solve fba models once they are generated and model the effects of gene_knockouts metaflux has been validated through construction of fba models for escherichia_coli and homo_sapiens flux_balance fba is a methodology for constructing genome_scale steady_state models of metabolic_networks it has a variety of applications from evaluation of potential growth_media for an organism to prediction of phenotypes of knockout mutants however current fba technology has a number of limitations the development of fba models is extremely time consuming requiring months once developed models are typically communicated using cryptic data_files that make the models difficult for other parties to comprehend and evaluate the fluxes calculated by a model are also difficult to comprehendinterpreting the long list of fluxes produced from an fba computation to understand the flux levels of reactions within the network can be very time consuming we present a new software technology for generating fba models that accelerates model development and produces models that are easier to inspect and comprehend our approach based on a new tool called metaflux couples fba with pathway_databases dbs via the pathway tools software environment of which metaflux is a part the first phase of model development is to infer a metabolic reaction list from an annotated genome_sequence although some groups appear to still perform this process in a manual fashion pathway tools has performed this process automatically for many years it maps the enzyme names ec numbers and gene_ontology found in an annotated genome to reactions in the metacyc db the resulting reaction list and predicted metabolic_pathways and pathway hole fillers are stored in the form of a pathway genome_database pgdb metaflux provides a novel completion method for accelerating the second phase of model development in which the reaction list plus associated nutrient secretion and biomass metabolite sets are converted to a functional fba model by completion we mean the software suggests components e g reactions and nutrients to add to a model to render the model feasible a model is feasible if the linear optimizer used to solve the system of equations of which an fba model is comprised can find a non zero solution to those equations intuitively for an fba model to be feasible it means that the metabolic_network can produce all compounds in the biomass equation from the nutrients the completion method reduces the time consuming work of meticulously refining the network of reactions the set of biomass metabolites and the selection of appropriate metabolites as nutrients and secretions e g byproducts toxins and signaling_molecules which are needed to produce a feasible fba model genome_scale models typically contain hundreds of reactions and are typically missing reactions in their early formulations since most genome_scale networks are derived from genome_annotations that are themselves incomplete similarly the initially formulated set of nutrient and secreted compounds may be incomplete any of the preceding omissions can result in an
