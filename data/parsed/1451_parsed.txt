genome_analysis dmeas dna_methylation entropy analysis software dmeas is the first user_friendly dedicated to analyze the distribution of dna_methylation for the quantification of epigenetic heterogeneity it supports the analysis of both locus specific and genome_wide bisulfite sequencing_data dmeas progressively scans the mapping results of bisulfite sequencing_reads to extract dna_methylation for contiguous cpg_dinucleotides it determines the dna methylation_level and calculates methylation entropy for genomic_segments to enable the quantitative assessment of dna_methylation variations observed in cell_populations dna_methylation is a crucial epigenetic_modification involved in many biological_processes from normal cellular_differentiation to disease genesis and progression traditionally dna_methylation analysis is limited to the determination and comparison of dna methylation_levels a number of computational_tools including bisma qdmr biq analyzer ht and cpg mps have been developed to analyze dna_methylation data derived from illumina beadchip or bisulfite sequence_reads recently great interest has been aroused in decoding dna_methylation patterning to understand the generation of cell diversity in addition to tracing the cell_lineage dna_methylation can be used as a measure of the epigenetic heterogeneity in cell_populations in particular with the emergence of next_generation techniques rapidly_accumulating deep bisulfite sequencing_data allow the securitization of dna_methylation on genome_wide scale however existing dna_methylation analysis tools mainly focus on the bisulfite sequencing_data mapping and the comparison at dna methylation_level no software has been developed to assess dna_methylation variations embedded in bisulfite sequencing_data here we present dmeas a c implementation of the algorithm for dna_methylation entropy calculation as an interactive tool to evaluate the variation in dna_methylation we have successfully developed dmeas the first software to enable the analysis of dna_methylation pattern and the quantification of epigenetic heterogeneity for bisulfite sequencing_data locus specific or genome_wide dmeas can automatically identify and determine the methylation_levels and entropies for all possible cpg segments the visualization of dna_methylation pattern of each segment is implemented and the descriptive statistical summary on segments including the distributions of methylation_level and entropy are provided in addition pearson_correlation was adopted to measure the correlation of the methylation_levels and entropies across samples we anticipate it will assist researchers to explore dna_methylation data in a new dimension funding this work was supported by grants from the natural_science of china the funders had no role in study_design data_collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript conflict of interest none declared
