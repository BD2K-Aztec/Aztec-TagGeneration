genome_analysis hd cnv hotspot detector for copy_number copy_number cnvs are a major source of genetic_variation comparing cnvs between samples is important in elucidating their potential effects in a wide_variety of biological_contexts hd cnv hotspot detector for copy_number is a tool for downstream_analysis of previously_identified cnv regions from multiple samples and it detects recurrent regions by finding cliques in an interval graph generated from the input it creates a unique graphical_representation of the data as well as summary spreadsheets and ucsc university of california santa_cruz genome_browser track files the interval graph when viewed with other software or by automated graph analysis is useful in identifying genomic_regions of interest for further study availability_and hd cnv is an_open code and is freely_available with tutorials and sample data from http a copy_number variant cnv refers to a large kb segment of the genome that is either duplicated or deleted cnvs are found between individuals and between tissues of the same organism because of germline_mutation and or somatic_mosaicism and can significantly impact genetic_variability gene_expression phenotypic_variability disease cancer evolution and adaptation they may also be referred to as copy_number abberations changes differences or polymorphisms depending on the discipline context and the level of specificity at the genome_scale cnvs can be detected using a variety of methods including microarray and next_generation analysis after detection finding cnvs present in many samples recurrent cnv regions can indicate commonly inherited cnvs or mutation hotspots generating cnvs finding unique cnv events can indicate potential candidate_mutations relevant to disease or other phenotypic variants we introduce hd cnv which takes any collection of cnv_calls as input detects recurrent regions based on percentage overlap and creates a unique graphical visualization of clusters of overlapping cnv regions across samples other software exists to analyse overlapping cnv_calls and find recurrent copy_number variable_regions among samples hd cnv is unique in that it analyses cnv events using interval graphs and gives a visual karyotype for quick identification of recurrent and unique cnvs across the genome hd cnv identifies recurrent cnv regions and allows for high_level visualization of the relative number of cnv events on each chromosome clusters of overlapping cnv events and isolated cnv events it can be used for qualitative exploratory_analysis on data from any organism and it does not require additional reference data or annotation statistical_analysis can be done up or downstream as appropriate for the dataset it can be used to compare cnv_calls from multiple programs for concordance or discordance as in for example tumour normal sample comparisons it has been tested on data from different species human and mouse and data from different cnv_calling platforms hd cnv generates various output_files including graph files can be used for large_scale visualization allowing quick identification of areas for further study cnv events or merged regions from the graph can be found in the track files ucsc_genome track files contain the merged regions and the original cnv events including base_pair locations which allows cross_referencing with other genomic_data and features we have used our program to analyse cnvs detected in humans from a diverse genetic_background the darker clusters indicate a cnv event that is recurrent in all samples which may indicate cnvs common among many human populations individual nodes and smaller clusters show rare cnv events that may be limited to certain individuals and sub populations
