data_and rxnfinder biochemical_reaction search_engines using molecular_structures molecular_fragments and reaction similarity biochemical_reactions play_a to help sustain life and allow cells to grow rxnfinder was developed to search biochemical_reactions from kegg reaction database using three search_criteria molecular_structures molecular_fragments and reaction similarity rxnfinder is helpful to get reference reactions for biosynthesis and xenobiotics metabolism availability rxnfinder is freely_available via http sdd diverse biochemical_reactions participate in various important biosynthesis and metabolic_pathways those reactions are manually_curated and stored in several widely used databases the kegg reaction database contains reactions the kegg reaction database_search include simcomp and subcomp reaction id name reactant entry pathway and enzyme in the present work rxnfinder three additional search_engines are developed to help researchers retrieve kegg reactions kegg provides two ways to search reactions with a molecule structure kegg mol a using compound id http www genome jp kegg compound and kegg mol b using subcomp http www genome jp tools subcomp or simcomp http www genome jp tools simcomp the results obtained by rxnfinder are the same as kegg mol a the difference is that the input in rxnfinder is molecular_structure however the input in kegg mol a is compound id when molecular_structure such as c ccccc br is input rxnfinder retrieves two reactions r and r with c ccccc br kegg mol a gets the same two reactions if the compound id c is input however users usually do not know the kegg id of a specific molecule for instance c for bromobenzene then if the molecule structure of bromobenzene is input to kegg search_engines kegg mol b using subcomp will retrieve reactions kegg mol b using simcomp will retrieve reactions in which most of them are similar to c ccccc br but not identical c ccccc br the reason might be that simcomp and subcomp are developed to search page similar molecules in kegg_database there are two reactions r and r containing bromobenzene c ccccc br for reaction search for a given molecular fragment the algorithm used is a substructure match method our method can support smart http www daylight com dayhtml doc theory theory smarts html smiles string search the implementations in kegg are based on subcomp algorithms rxnfinder will retrieve reactions with enamine fragment a smart smiles string for enamine kegg subcomp http www genome jp tools subcomp does not support smart smiles string search the novelty of this proposed reaction similarity is at least to our knowledge the first tool of its kind for retrieving biochemical_reactions the reaction similarity_search is based on the euclidean_distance measurement of two reactions after calculating reaction similarity between kegg reactions and an input reaction the kegg reactions are retrieved based on the similarity rank the distance values can range from to infinity theoretically the distance means the retrieved reaction holds the same chemical transformation to the input reaction the direct prediction_performance measurement of reaction similarity_search is to check if the retrieved reactions are with the same chemical transformation pattern of the input reaction regarding to the statistical rigorousness of reaction similarity we applied an indirect way to get raw similarity_scores and found distance is a good threshold the methodology is as follows i the reactions with the same chemical transformation have the same ec numbers ii take one reaction out as query reaction and use the most similar reaction to predict the ec_number of the query reaction iii by leave_one we found that similarity_scores in this case reaction euclidean_distance within will get satisfactory accuracy iv the analysis is shown in in rxnfinder distance is now used as a statistics threshold to select reactions similar to an input reaction rxnfinder presents a collection of searching engines to search biochemical_reactions from kegg reaction database with the engines at hand researchers can get reference reactions for further analysis rxnfinder also includes online tools to input molecules and reactions calculate molecular_fragments compute reaction difference fingerprints and measure reaction distance
