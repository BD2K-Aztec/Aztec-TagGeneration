phylogenetics gloome gain loss mapping engine the evolutionary_analysis of presence and absence profiles phyletic patterns is widely used in biology it is assumed that the observed phyletic pattern is the result of gain and loss dynamics along a phylogenetic_tree examples of characters that are represented by phyletic patterns include restriction_sites gene_families introns and indels to name a few here we present a user_friendly web_server that accurately infers branch specific and site_specific gain_and the novel inference methodology is based on a stochastic mapping_approach utilizing models that reliably capture the underlying evolutionary_processes a variety of features are available including the ability to analyze the data with various evolutionary_models to infer gain_and using either stochastic mapping or maximum_parsimony and to estimate gain and loss rates for each character analyzed numerous biological_characteristics are coded using binary characters to denote presence versus absence the matrix is termed a phylogenetic profile of presenceabsence or phyletic pattern and is equivalent to a gap free multiple_sequence msa in which rows correspond to species and columns correspond to binary characters phyletic pattern representation is useful in the analysis of various types of biological data including restriction_sites indels introns gene_families and morphological_characters interestingly even questions in fields other than biology can be addressed by this approach for example the evolution of human languages was studied by analyzing the phyletic patterns of lexical units following the development of realistic probabilistic_models describing the evolution of dna and protein_sequences the analysis of phyletic patterns data has progressed from the traditional parsimony to models in which the dynamics of gain and loss is assumed to follow a continuoustime markov_process probabilistic based analysis of to whom correspondence should be addressed phyletic patterns is currently available in programs such as restml mrbayes and count nevertheless for the inference of branch site_specific events the parsimony criterion is still the most commonly used methodology however the parsimony paradigm may be misleading especially in characters experiencing multiple recurrent_events along longer branches towards a more accurate inference of gain loss events we have recently integrated stochastic mapping approaches to accurately map gain_and onto each branch of a phylogenetic_tree the analysis is based on novel mixture_models in which variability in both the gain and loss rates is allowed among gene_families we have shown that our mixture_models are robust and accurate for the inference of gene_family evolutionary_dynamics here we developed the user_friendly gain and loss mapping engine gloome web_server the main novelties of our web_server are i we implement probabilistic_models that are not implemented elsewhere which better capture gain loss dynamics ii we provide accurate estimates of the expectations and probabilities of both gain_and using stochastic mapping and iii the interface via a user_friendly web_server should make analyses more accessible compared to other stand alone programs
