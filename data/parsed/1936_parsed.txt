systems_biology gaussian_process modelling for bicoid mrna regulation in spatio_temporal bicoid profile motivation bicoid protein molecules translated from maternally provided bicoid mrna establish a concentration_gradient in drosophila early embryonic_development there is experimental_evidence that the synthesis and subsequent destruction of this protein is regulated at source by precise control of the stability of the maternal mrna can we infer the driving function at the source from noisy observations of the spatio_temporal protein profile we use non parametric gaussian_process for modelling the propagation of bicoid in the embryo and infer aspects of source regulation as a posterior function results with synthetic data from a d diffusion model with a source simulated to model mrna_stability regulation our results establish that the gaussian_process method can accurately infer the driving function and capture the spatio temporal_dynamics of embryonic bicoid propagation on real_data from the flyex database too the reconstructed source function is indicative of stability regulation but is temporally smoother than what we expected partly due to the fact that the dataset is only partially observed to be in line with recent thinking on the subject we also analyse this model with a spatial gradient of maternal mrna rather than being fixed at only the anterior pole patterning during embryonic_development is thought to be regulated by a class of molecules known as morphogens which propagate spatially and establish concentration_gradients as early as hypothesized that a reaction diffusion_mechanism might form the basis of such differential concentrations further developed this view as a universal mechanism of spatial_pattern formation arising from positiondependent cell_fate subsequently driever and nsslein volhard a b discovered the role of the bicoid morphogen in early embryonic_development of the_fruit bicoid sets up a concentration_gradient along the anterior_posterior ap axis of the embryo and regulates several downstream gap genes including hunchback and krppel which are implicated in to whom correspondence should be addressed segmentation along the ap axis the bicoid mrna is maternal deposited at the anterior pole of the embryo and translation of this mrna is thought to begin immediately after egg deposition with the resulting protein propagating towards the posterior_end most of the computational and experimental work on the bicoid morphogen is concerned with the establishment of the steady_state concentration_gradient and the sensitivity with which a threshold on it may be sensed for downstream_gene systematic computational modelling of downstream gap gene_circuits and how their non linear interactions result in segment boundary formation have also been published in and include steady_state exponential bicoid expression_profiles as a regulating input in an alternate view of the dynamics of this system suggested that much of the desirable decoding properties of the steady_state profile can also be realized during the pre steady_state stages a particularly novel insight into the process of bicoid translation comes from the experimental work of surdej and jacobs lorena these authors suggested that the stability of the maternal mrna may be systematically regulated i e kept stable for a period of time during which mrna is translated and morphogen synthesized and subsequently rapidly killed off by some active processes this observation of course matches our natural expectation as there is no need for the organism to continue to produce bicoid protein beyond the point in time when it is decoded however to our surprise modelling literature over the years since the discovery of bicoid ignore this possibility and assume a constant production rate at the anterior pole we showed recently that it is possible to model bicoid production in a manner similar to surdej and jacobs lorena s experimental_findings and computationally extract the time at which mrna_decay begins and the rate at which it is killed off to match data measured on real fly embryos and archived in the flyex database we used an explicit model of mrna_stability regulation and a least_squares fitting procedure between model output and observed data bayesian_inference has been shown to be useful in a range of applications including systems_biology and bioinformatics successful examples range from the identification of gene_regulatory by dynamic bayesian networksin this contribution we have shown that the non parametric gp regression_model can be effectively applied to the problem of inferring biologically useful information from the spatiotemporal distribution of the bicoid morphogen in early drosophila embryogenesis discretization of the spatial_domain transforms the spatio_temporal problem into a dynamical system for which with a gp prior imposed on the source the solution can be obtained as a matrix exponential with synthetic data obtained from a linear spatio_temporal dynamical system our results show that the gp approach is able to accurately recover the driving input and model the bicoid distribution on real_world data our results also estimate a smoothed version of the driving input due to the data being available only during part of the developmental_process and yet the part of the source decay is fairly well estimated
