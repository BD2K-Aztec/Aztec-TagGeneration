amyload website dedicated to amyloidogenic protein_fragments analyses of amyloidogenic sequence_fragments are essential in studies of neurodegenerative_diseases however there is no one internet dataset that collects all the sequences that have been investigated for their amyloidogenicity therefore we have created the amyload website which collects the amyloidogenic sequences from all major sources the website allows for filtration of the fragments and provides detailed information about each of them registered users can both personalize their work with the website and submit their own sequences into the database to maintain database reliability submitted sequences are reviewed before making them available to the public finally we re implemented several amyloidogenic sequence predictors thus the amyload website can be used as a sequence_analysis tool we encourage researchers working on amyloid_proteins to contribute to our service availability_and the amyload website is freely_available comprec lin the mechanisms for development of amyloidogenic diseases such as the alzheimers or parkinsons diseases are still not completely known it has been proved that for these diseases to occur specific protein_fragments must become exposed in the structures these fragments are characterised by a high aggregation propensity which leads to the formation of fibres with a sterric zipper form soluble oligomers or amorphous_aggregates the amyloidogenic sequence_fragments are essential to understand the development of amyloid diseases several difficulties are encountered in studies of amyloidogenic fragments first there are a few internet data_sources which contain such fragments the most popular are amypdb waltz db amylhex with amylfrag and zipperdb or datasets used to validate analytical_methods such as tango or aggrescan none of these sources contains all available data the waltz db for instance is designed for hexapeptides while zipperdb collects amyloidogenic sequences obtained with computer modelling amypdb on the other hand includes amino_acid templates characteristic of specific amyloid protein_families rather than amyloidogenic fragments as such secondly most of the datasets do not provide a user_friendly way of data browsing and filtering to the best of our knowledge currently only waltz db enables its users to filter data finally various computational_methods have been developed to predict the occurrence of amyloidogenic fragments in protein_sequence most of these are based on empirical amino_acid features e g contact_sites density or hydrogen_bonding machine_learning or consensus methods to mention only a few as with the fragment data these tools are not collected together in one place on the internet therefore if a sequence is analyzed with several different predictors each method must be used separately to address these difficulties we present the amyload internet database which consolidates a great majority of the currently available amyloidogenic and non amyloidogenic sequences and several prediction_methods the amyload website allows a user to fully personalize their work with over unique_sequence database entries and implementedprediction methods and also to submit new data to the database links to other yet not implemented amyloid predictors are also available in our service
