fqtools an efficient software_suite for modern fastq file manipulation many next_generation analyses involve the basic manipulation of input sequence_data before downstream processing e g searching for specific sequences format conversion or basic file statistics the rapidly increasing data_volumes involved in ngs make any dataset manipulation a time consuming and error_prone process i have developed fqtools a fast and reliable fastq file manipulation suite that can process the full set of valid fastq_files including those with multi line sequences whilst identifying invalid files fqtools is faster than similar tools and is designed for use in automatic processing pipelines availability_and fqtools is open_source and is available at https github com alas tair droop fqtools the fastq format has become the de facto standard for storage of next_generation read data based originally upon the fasta sequence format fastq stores nucleotide_sequences and associated base qualities for multiple named reads in a fourfield human_readable ascii format although there is no defined standard for fastq_files provide a good overview of the format and provide as close to a standard as is available many analysis_pipelines involve initial data manipulation e g reformatting viewing or overview statistics before downstream processing e g quality_control adapter removal and alignment seemingly simple tasks like viewing the first few reads in a file or checking the distribution of read_lengths often require scripting or loading the data in tools that are quite slow for large_datasets these file manipulations are much more frequent when data are being reused in novel analyses frequently individual researchers will write scripts e g in python perl or awk to perform these tasks many tools are available for fastq processing such as the fastx toolkit bio awk fastq tools fast seqmagick and seq tk see the supplementary_materials for the urls of these tools none of these provide a comprehensive set of common manipulations that would be required for most analyses most fastq processing_tools fail to process reads with sequence_data split across multiple lines as read_lengths from modern sequencing_technologies are constantly increasing this is likely to become problematic as human readability is vastly reduced by extremely_long lines detecting invalid input is extremely_important as bioinformatics_pipelines are often automated thus significant computation and analysis time can be wasted if input errors are not detected early for this reason a trustworthy fastq manipulation tool should report invalid files similarly tools should be able to correctly process the full range of valid inputs the fqtools suite was written to address this need for efficient and reliable viewing manipulation and summarization of fastq data before it is pre processed with e g fastqc http www bio informatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc or cutadapt both compressed and plain fastq can be processed as can sam and bam formatted data paired_end sequence_data is handled either as file pairs or in interleaved format
