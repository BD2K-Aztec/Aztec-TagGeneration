genome_analysis an alignment_free test for recombination motivation why recombination is one of the central questions in biology this has led to a host of methods for quantifying recombin ation from sequence_data these methods are usually based on aligned dna_sequences here we propose an efficient alignment_free alternative results our method is based on the distribution of match lengths which we look up using enhanced_suffix by eliminating the alignment step the test becomes fast enough for application to whole bacterial_genomes using simulations we show that our test has similar power as established tests when applied to long pairs of sequences when applied to genomes of escherichia_coli we pick up the strongest recombination signal from a kb horizontal_gene engineered years_ago it is surprisingly difficult to account for the prevalence of sex and recombination in nature classical explanations for the evolution of sex are based on the realization that it can speedup adaptation in addition it removes deleterious_mutations from the population however recombination also leads to the breakup of coadapted genes which begs the question as to whether recombination has an evolutionary cause or is a mere consequence of molecular_mechanisms such as dna_repair perhaps both views are correct as the contemporary consensus is that sex and recombination would only be maintained in multicellular_organisms with high_mutation and largely negative fitness interactions between genes irrespective of this uncertainty about the function of recombination in unicellular organisms horizontal_gene in bacteria has attracted particular attention as it often underlies the emergence of virulent pathogens the enigma of recombination combined with its prevalence and clinical importance has inspired the development of numerous methods for assessing genetic_exchange these fall into two broad categories methods for detecting the presence of recombination and methods for estimating its rate we concentrate here on the simpler detection problem in the past this has been solved in two ways by looking for clustering of mutations or by identifying multiple mutations to the same nucleotide in distinct lineages such recurrent mutations are called homoplasies methods based on the detection of clustered polymorphisms include the widely used max method and the runs method implemented in the popular geneconv program both are based on the realization that the time to the most_recent varies along a recombining sequence because the number of mutations that affect a genomic_region is proportional to the time to the most_recent of the sampled sequences the number of mutations varies along the sequence as a result the mutations are clustered classical homoplasy based_methods rest on the assumption that any nucleotide mutates at most once thus generating three haplotypes between a pair of polymorphisms say and the missing fourth possible haplotype in our example can only be generated through recombination the detection of such haplotype quartets is used to determine the minimum number of recombination_events in an aligned sample of homologous_sequences more recently this diagnosis of either presence_or of a recombination event between a pair of polymorphisms was generalized to inferring possibly more than one recombination in samples of more than four sequences this has been formalized as the w statistic and implemented in phi a fast tool for detecting recombination like all homoplasy based tests w tends to have greater_power than its rivals based on polymorphism clustering the detection of recombination among a sample of homologous_sequences is thus a well understood problem as long as an alignment of the sequences is available however aligning genomes remains_challenging despite great advances in this field at the same time there is interest in analyzing recombination at the scale of bacterial_genomes if not greater fortunately the nucleotide wise assignment of homology that defines alignments is not necessary to test for recombination we show this by developing a fast alignment_free test for recombination like max and to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com geneconv our test is based on the detection of polymorphism clustering but instead of scoring single_nucleotide snps we record the lengths of exact_matches between pairs of sequences to a first approximation this corresponds to the distances between snps recombination leads to an increase in the fluctuation of match lengths when compared with no recombination because match lengths can be looked up efficiently using modern string algorithms our test scans a pair of escherichia_coli genomes totaling mb in only s on a contemporary laptop in the following we derive our test and demonstrate its sensitivity_and through simulation we also use simulations to compare it with two published tests max and w finally we apply our test to e coli genomes to search for horizontal_gene our fast method for detecting recombination from unaligned genomes is accurate when applied to simulated_data applied to bacterial_genomes it diagnoses recombination too frequently due to variation in mutation_rate across long_sequences this is a weakness d r shares with other methods to detect recombination based on identifying polymorphism clustering nevertheless using the recombination measure q we discovered the strongest signal for the pair of e coli genomes that had undergone an engineered kb horizontal_gene years_ago
