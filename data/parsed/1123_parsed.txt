data_and computer_assisted curation of a human regulatory core network from the biological_literature downloaded from motivation a highly interlinked network of transcription_factors tfs orchestrates the context dependent expression of human genes chip_chip experiments that interrogate the binding of particular tfs to genomic_regions are used to reconstruct gene_regulatory at genome_scale but are plagued by high_false meanwhile a large body of knowledge on high_quality regulatory_interactions remains_largely as it is available only in natural_language descriptions scattered over millions of scientific_publications such data are hard to extract and regulatory data currently contain together only regulatory relations between human tfs results we developed a text_mining assisted workflow to systematically extract knowledge about regulatory_interactions between human tfs from the biological_literature we applied this workflow to the entire medline which helped us to identify more than sentences potentially describing such relationships we ranked these sentences by a machine_learning approach the top sentences contained sentences that encompass relations already known in databases by manually curating the remaining top ranking sentences we obtained more than validated regulatory_relationships that were not present in a regulatory database before full text curation allowed us to obtain detailed information on the strength of experimental_evidences supporting a relationship conclusions we were able to increase curated information about the human core transcriptional_network by compared with the current content of regulatory databases we observed improved_performance when using the network for disease_gene compared with the state of the art availability_and web_service is freely_accessible at http fastforward sys bio net transcription_factors tfs influence the rates by which their target_genes are transcribed by binding to regulatory dna_segments like promoter or enhancer regions in vertebrates the relationship between tfs and genes is complex on one hand regulation of a specific gene often involves a variety of tfs acting in an independent cooperative or competitive manner on the other hand specific tfs often are involved in the co regulation of a multitude of target_genes furthermore tfs often also regulate other tfs these tf tf relationships can be considered as the core of the full human gene_regulatory grn that orchestrates many cellular_processes by inducing or repressing genes which function is specifically required for a given environment for a certain cell_type or at a certain point in time during development and cell_differentiation well studied parts of this grn are involved in wound_healing or in development and its dys regulation is associated with many diseases it also has a particularly important role in cancer where a highly interconnected regulatory core network mediates different aspects of the disease biological_research over the last decades has identified thousands of individual regulatory_interactions using specific time consuming and laborious experiments proving a direct regulatory relationship between a tf x and a gene y typically comprises three individual evidences e binding of x to a genomic location related to y e change in expression of y upon activation of x and e abrogation of regulation of y upon removal or alteration of the binding_site to date only some of these evidence types can be addressed in a high_throughput manner in particular binding of tfs to genomic_dna can be assessed on a genome_wide by chromatin immuno precipitation chip followed by sequencing as for example has been done on a large_scale by the encode_project however binding of tfs alone does not necessarily imply that downstream_genes are regulated by the tf and genome_wide measurements tend to be rather noisy consequently classical low_throughput mechanistic_studies are still considered the most reliable way of identifying regulatory_interactions and our knowledge on the topology of the regulatory_networks still remains rather sketchy a central problem in compiling regulatory_networks from highconfidence low_throughput mechanistic_studies is that these are scattered over the large body of scientific_literature accessing these data in a systematic manner is difficult as it requires finding articles discussing such relationships correctly identifying the involved genes and checking for each of the required evidences described earlier there are attempts to compile knowledge about grns in databases including the recently established tf encyclopedia that is a community curated repository of information about different aspects of tfs transfac trrd and oreganno are more established databases specifically focusing on regulatory_relationships however these databases do not attempt to comprehensively cover the core grn but rather focus on particular tfs or on specific binding_sites to compile binding_site motifs notably these three databases henceforth abbreviated as regdbs together contain only regulatory_relationships between two human tfs for an estimated number of at least tfs in the genome this situation is in stark_contrast to e g escherichia_coli for which the regulondb contains regulatory_relationships between the estimated tfs in the genome to enlarge the body of experimentally asserted information about the human core grn we set out to develop apply and evaluate a computer_assisted workflow for systematically finding and extracting experimental_evidence for direct regulatory_relationships between human tfs from the biological_literature this workflow comprises a state of the art software to identify and normalize gene names in text a machine_learning based_classifier to judge whether a sentence in which a pair of genes co occur describes a regulatory relationship between these two genes and an extensive phase of human curation to check the truthfulness of the classifiers output on the sentence level and to provide an assessment of the strength of supporting evidences described in the containing article we applied our workflow to all abstracts in pubmed altogether we identified more than million pairs of genes co occurring in the same sentence we automatically classified each of these sentences using a classifier trained on a manually_annotated gold_standard corpus of sentences describing regulatory_relationships and inspected in detail the top sentences mentioning a pair of human tfs of those sentences report transcriptional interactions that were already covered by regdbs by manual_curation we found that of the remaining sentences contained interesting information about gene regulatory relations and further sentences described co operation or competition in transcription domain_experts then studied all full text publications covering the sentences to assess the trustfulness of the relationship with respect to the three lines of independent evidence mentioned earlier this lead to the identification of relationships supported by all three evidences compared with only described in the regdbs relationships not previously covered by regdbs were identified that are supported by at least one of the three evidences compared with described in the regdbs we performed an initial characterization of the expanded network and found it to be considerably larger better connected and functionally different it also led to improved_performance when used for disease_gene in four different rna_seq
