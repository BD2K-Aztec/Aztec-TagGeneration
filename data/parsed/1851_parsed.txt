databases_and flowcl ontology_based cell_population labelling in flow_cytometry motivation finding one or more cell_populations of interest such as those correlating to a specific disease is critical when analysing flow_cytometry data however labelling of cell_populations is not well defined making_it to integrate the output of algorithms to external knowledge sources results we developed flowcl a software_package that performs semantic labelling of cell_populations based on their surface markers and applied it to labelling of the federation of clinical immunology societies human immunology project consortium lyoplate populations as a use case conclusion by providing automated labelling of cell_populations based on their immunopheno type flowcl allows for unambiguous and reproducible identification of standardized cell_types availability_and code r script and documentation are available under the artistic license through bioconductorboth flow_cytometry fcm and mass_cytometry are used to identify one or more cell_populations of interest such as those correlating with a disease phenotype cell_types can be grouped by their particular combinations of markers or immunophenotype despite progress made towards standardization of fcm assays the lack of a standard labelling strategy hampers data_integration when trying to match gating data resulting from various v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com manual or automated tools and heterogeneous sources the cell ontology cl was developed to represent cell_types relevant to biology a recent revision specifically focused on extending coverage of the cl by improving the representation of haematopoeitic cell_types asserting those cell_types in a single inheritance hierarchy and adding logical restrictions to describe their immunophenotypes however multiple issues arose when we attempted to use the cl for labelling of cell_types derived from fcm data the definition of mature t cell obo cl obo is an abbreviation for http purl obolibrary org obo mentions that it has plasma_membrane part some t cell receptor complex obo go which itself has part the cd marker obo pr requiring complex reasoning to infer that mature t cell has part some cd additionally when trying to identify cd cells fcm experimenters are in fact targeting cd epsilon obo pr which is itself a subunit of the cd_molecule described in the cl as a consequence while the cl encompasses information about surface markers its manual exploitation can be challenging and may require_multiple inferences along multiple axes which is neither optimal nor sustainable with the increase in size of datasets to address these challenges we developed flowcl a software_package that enables researchers to unambiguously label their cell_populations based on their immunophenotype using the cl we also improved cl to enhance its utility for automated labelling of cell_populations decoupling the knowledge representation and the software code allows for greater_flexibility for extension and updates as the cl development proceeds flowcl automatically remains up to date with the latest scientific_knowledge additionally the information added to the cl is immediately available for the scientific_community independently of the flowcl development or the hipc project by providing automated labelling of cell_populations based on their immunophenotype flowcl allows researchers to report results using cell_type labels future work includes validation on other datasets and extending the cl with an assay based representation of cell_types
