data_and msmspdbb providing protein databases of closely_related organisms to improve proteomic characterization of prokaryotic microbes the microbial proteomic resource mpr is a repository service that contains non redundant protein databases of related bacterial_strains which were generated through an in house developed software called multi strain mass_spectrometry prokaryotic database builder msmspdbb msmspdbb merges and clusters protein_sequences inferred from genomic_sequences and provide a protein list in fasta_format that covers for divergence in gene_annotation translational_start choice and presence of single_nucleotide and other mutations availability msmspdbb was developed in c using the qt libraries nokia and licensed under the gnu_general version msmspdbb is freely_available and its installation files instructions for use and additional documentation can be found at the mpr web_site org uib no prokaryotedb can also be found at proteomecommons org see supplementary methods for hash number there are currently completed bacterial genomic_sequences available and over ongoing genome_projects genomes online database gold for proteomic purposes there are often several relevant annotated genomic_sequences available and it may be difficult to select the best option for characterization of the experimental_data different bioinformatic approaches for annotation of genes are currently used and this affects the quality of annotated protein lists used in proteomics characterization of clinical bacterial_isolates with many specific genetic_variations is suboptimal if they are not represented in the selected database recent data suggest that microbial virulence can be related to single nucleotide to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as polymorphisms snps and information from more than one sequenced_genome can be relevant therefore it is crucial to provide protein databases that can compensate for annotation errors and cover genetic_variations among closely_related organisms and that provide readily_identifiable unique observations this limitation is acknowledged by the efforts of investigators to provide non redundant protein databases with high genomic coverage as for example the international protein index the software multi strain mass_spectrometry prokaryotic database builder msmspdbb can merge protein databases from several sources and be applied on any prokaryotic organism the clustering is performed so that sequences sharing high similarity are merged and reported only once and unique peptide_sequences observed in polymorphisms or with different translational_start tss choices are appended to the primary sequence in a ms friendly manner using non assigned characters as previously described by in short n_terminal tryptic_peptides from divergent predictions of the tss are appended to the main sequence and separated by the code o and polymorphic peptides are appended with the code j currently this can be applied only using an in house mascot server since the engine search tool need to be set up to recognize those two letters as a theoretical amino_acid of mass zero and also a new enzyme rule for trypsin can be created which will recognize j and o as cleavage_sites details of the database entry structure are described in supplementary methods ltq_orbitrap tandem_mass data from helicobacter_pylori data not shown or mycobacterium_tuberculosis h rv whole cell_lysate samples were used to test the new databases the data of m tuberculosis h rv were analyzed using the clustered database of annotated proteins from eight genomic_sequences of the m tuberculosis complex mtc see supplementary methods the original annotation of m tuberculosis h rv tuberculist was used as a reference we have previously shown that for analysis of m tuberculosis h rv proteins the tuberculist annotation performed better than a posterior annotation provided by the tigr institute not used in this work but some peptides only entered in the secondary annotation were also found the question is how much extra peptide information can be obtained from m tuberculosis h rv using all genomic_sequences with annotations from mtc organisms supplementarypage shows that the mtc database had more protein entries and more theoretical unique peptides amino_acids as compared with the tuberculist database supplementary_file lists all proteins and peptides from both databases a larger mtc database did not significantly compromise the statistical validation of the data with mascot by using maxquant for validation the number of identified ms_ms events were very similar at false_discovery the mtc database identified more peptides than the tuberculist database observed in high_quality spectra the higher number of peptides identified by the mtc database was expected to be caused by differences in the interpretation of coding_sequences for example illustrate an ms_ms pattern of ion m z identified as peptide mavdvdqwptvgqilpvvyspk from entry mt from the m tuberculosis cdc annotation with a mascot score of score indicated p p p m mass accuracy and a maxquant posterior error probability of e this protein entry is only annotated in the m tuberculosis cdc h ra and kzn genomes and it was identified with two peptides covering of the sequence however the gene coding_region is present in all eight genomes showing that the gene was simply not annotated in five of the genomes similar observations of previously_unrecognized gene_products in m tuberculosis h rv are between and amino_acids data not shown this shows that gene prediction_tools may fail to correctly annotate small genes additionally peptides with minor sequence_variations were also successfully identified using the mtc database for example the protein rv c contains a peptide insdisvgnyr with a snp that is specific to the m tuberculosis h rv and h ra genomes supplementaryshows the ms_ms pattern of the peptide with a mascot score of in the remaining genomes the aspartic_acid is replaced by tyrosine and we also identified this peptide in clinical_isolate samples of m tuberculosis data not shown peptides containing snps were also observed in the h pylori sample data not shown in conclusion multi strain proteomic databases allow for identification of sequence_variations between strains such as snps and divergent tsss in addition to cover limitations of gene_annotations without compromising peptide redundancy and peptide_identification rates the application of this type of databases for proteomic characterization of relevant clinical strains which have not been sequenced is of interest msmspdbb and its source_code are freely_available at the microbial proteomic resource at http org uib no prokaryotedb and can be modified to be used for other bacterial_species instructions about software usage are given in supplementary methods we have applied msmspdbb for many different species of clinical and industrial interest generating both full translations and annotated only clustered databases the full translation option from msmspdbb can also be used on individual_genomes in order to be able to identify unannotated proteins while full translation databases of merged genomes are often very large and could compromise statistical validation of the data a full translation of an individual genome can be used at almost no false_positive cost so_far we have available databases of species and updates are done on a weekly basis with further species being added already available databases are also updated when new genome_sequences are released on request msmspdbb users will also be allowed to upload their databases
