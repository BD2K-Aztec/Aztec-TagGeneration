databases_and the chemical translation service a web_based to improve standardization of metabolomic reports metabolomic publications and databases use different database_identifiers or even trivial names which disable queries across databases or between studies the best way to annotate metabolites is by chemical_structures the metabolomics standards initiative msi proposed the use of database_identifiers for publishing reports in peer_reviewed or in data_repositories but the msi did not specify best practice standards which identifier to use consequently metabolomic_data are presented by a wide_variety of identifiers mostly using publicly_available databases such as kegg hmdb or pubchem in other cases authors merely use compound names without referencing to databases compound names are very poor descriptors as names often cannot be unambiguously mapped to authentic chemical_structures either because of missing chiral information d l or because each chemical_structure is associated with many synonym names some of which may also be used for other structures in addition no database contains all identifiers of all other repositories for example kegg ligand is a popular biochemical_pathways database but it is incomplete for many compounds found in human organs as to whom correspondence should be addressed given in the human metabolome database hmdb although each database lists outlinks to other databases no single database provides comprehensive mapping options to other databases and rarely there are batch query options offered analytical chemists and biochemists may not be used to standard structure codes or lack expertise for downloading databases or installing software we here present a publicly_available tool that enables researchers to quickly convert lists of compound database_identifiers including the important inchi keys software the chemical translation service cts was implemented using the programming_languages groovy v and java v the open_source web_application framework grails and freely_available plugins were used for the development of web_services for data storage the postgresql database an opensource object relational_database management system was used easy access from other languages and platforms is provided via soap simple object access protocol web_services we recommend that users especially chemists and biologists use cts for standardizing metabolomic reports into msi compliant formats before publishing data single identifiers can be converted such as kegg identifier to pubchem id or smiles to kegg id importantly batch convert services are supported xml in order to empower researchers to sort compare and arrange properties of their lists in standard office software for example l valine and valine differ only in the description of stereoconfiguration sorting via the atom connectivity part of the inchi hash keys labeled red in facilitates recognition of isomers or detection of doublets it is apparent that databases deal differently with stereo configurations as lipidmaps does not provide valine in its regular l configuration whereas hmdb does and kegg provides both valine enantiomers other metabolites such as pyruvate the end_product of glycolysis is given by all databases whereas the achiral form of n carbamoylglutamate is not represented in any other database the chemical discovery service annotates chemicals from any given text submitted in ascii format by text_mining a hybrid_approach using word stop lists and fuzzy regular expression matching was used for detection of chemicals and a subsequent database matching was used for the output of all possible chemical identifiers for example chemical names were given in the supplementary_material of a published non msi compliant report these names could be read into structures via synonym queries e g for overlap analysis with other platforms or query of related studies misspelled compounds nonate did not retrieve hits in comparison to the chemical resolver identifier beta the cts software comprises more commonly used database compound identifier inputs and allows any combination of output identifiers importantly cts also enables batch queries a feature that is not given in other resources including the recently_published metmask tool metmask requires installation of in house databases and provides only limited services via web_based queries cts maintains high query speeds because all required data were downloaded from publicly_available databases except cas into a new in house db due to the proprietary nature of the chemical abstract services cas these database_identifiers are incomplete as only publicly_available cas numbers were downloaded at present the bullet access via soap simple object access protocol web_services enabling other programming_languages and platforms
