systems_biology identification of feedback_loops in neural_networks based on multi_step granger_causality motivation feedback circuits are crucial network_motifs ubiquitously found in many intra_and cellular regulatory_networks and also act as basic building_blocks for inducing synchronized bursting behaviors in neural network_dynamics therefore the system level identification of feedback circuits using time series measurements is critical to understand the underlying regulatory_mechanism of synchronized bursting behaviors results multi_step granger_causality method msgcm was developed to identify feedback_loops embedded in biological_networks using time series experimental_measurements based on multivariate_time analysis msgcm used a modified wald_test to infer the existence of multi_step granger_causality between a pair of network nodes a significant bi_directional multi_step granger_causality between two nodes indicated the existence of a feedback_loop this new identification method resolved the drawback of the previous non causal impulse_response component method which was only applicable to networks containing no co regulatory forward path msgcm also significantly_improved the ratio of correct identification of feedback_loops in this study the msgcm was testified using synthetic pulsed neural_network models and also in vitro cultured_rat neural_networks using multi electrode_array as a result we found a large number of feedback_loops in the in vitro cultured neural_networks with apparent synchronized oscillation indicating a close relationship between synchronized oscillatory bursting behavior and underlying feedback_loops the msgcm is an efficient method to investigate feedback_loops embedded in in vitro cultured neural_networks the identified feedback_loop motifs are considered as an important design principle responsible for the synchronized bursting behavior in neural_networks feedback circuits are key regulatory_motifs in many biological_systems previous_studies show that positive feedback_loops to whom correspondence should be addressed determine a variety of cellular_processes such as development cell_proliferation apoptosis and responses to stress and negative_feedback contribute to maintaining the homeostasis of biological_systems under internal and external interferences moreover many functional_modules in biological_systems are composed of multiple feedback_loops various nonlinear dynamic behaviors of biological_systems are generated by combination of positive_and interlinked fast and slow positive feedback_loops can form a dual time switch which is rapidly inducible and also resistant to noises propagated from the upstream signaling system coupled direct and indirect positive feedback_loops induce robust synchronized bursting behaviors identifying the existence of an intra or inter cellular feedback circuit in biological_networks is an important systems biological issue a variety of network motif search tools such as mfinder fanmod and mavisto were proposed to find small vertex induced subgraphs occurring more frequently than those in random networks from a network with known topology but such methods cannot be used to identify hidden feedback_loops in a network with unknown topology from timeseries measurements on the other hand time series measurements of dynamical responses are now increasingly available e g real_time pcr microarray immunofluorescence and multi electrode_array and various types of biological_networks can be investigated using such data so there is a pressing need to develop an efficient method to identify feedback_loops from multi_channel dynamical response data based on timeseries analysis and system identification theory several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem for instance proposed the likelihood_ratio method lrtm based on the minimum phase spectral factor mpsf which is a canonical representation of the power_spectral matrix of the joint stochastic_process of input and output data in lrtm the feedback effect between two partitioned node sets was investigated with a priori_knowledge on the system order and structure although lrtm can identify a feedback_loop between two partitioned node sets it cannot identify a feedback_loop between two individual nodes in the network developed a direct coherence method in the frequency_domain to detect feedbacks in the centralin this study we investigated the problem of identifying feedback_loops embedded in intra or inter cellular biological_networks using time series measurements based on multivariate_time analysis our proposed msgcm can simultaneously analyze all network variates in the process of identifying the feedback_loops from complicated biological_networks msgcm can completely decouple the correlations between a pair of examined variates and the remaining variates in the network this makes msgcm overcome the shortcoming of nircm since co regulatory forward paths always cause an inputoutput noise correlation in this regard msgcm is more advanced than nircm and suitable for complex multivariate systems like biological_networks the application of msgcm and nircm to the same synthetic pulsed neural_networks showed that the correct identification ratios of msgcm are always significantly_higher than those of nircm although msgcm can identify feedback_loops of multivariate networks more accurately its computational_complexity is higher than nircm however the nodes and their corresponding micro electrodes were numbered according to their locations on the mea the feedback_loops were denoted by bi_directional arrows for culture feedback_loops were found corresponding to a synchronized oscillatory_behavior while for culture only feedback_loops were found related to a nearly random behavior such complexity issues can be alleviated as high performance computation devices become more available in this study we showed that msgcm can successfully_identify feedback_loops in synthetic neural_network models and in vitro cultured neural_networks we also found that synchronized oscillatory bursting behaviors were closely_related to the existence of feedback_loops from this finding we infer that a feedback_loop might be an important network motif for the synchronized oscillatory_behavior in pulsed neural_networks in fact the experiments using in vitro cultured neural_networks showed that the adjustment of synaptic_connections was highly_correlated with the development of neuronal_network behaviors characterized by the evolvement of spontaneous electrical activities of the network an interesting phenomenon was that the visibility of synchronized bursting behaviors was dependent on the developing phase of the tested in vitro neuron cultures in vitro cultured neural_networks showed spontaneous and uncorrelated bursting activities in the beginning but after about six divs they exhibited abruptly a synchronized bursting activity then a question arises as to what triggered such an emergent property in the cultured neural_networks the feedback identification method proposed in this study provides a very useful tool to infer a network motif responsible for this emergent property previous_studies indicated that developing_neurons showed their maximum synchronized activities at the nd or rd week of the brain development and after that neuronal_circuits reached an optimal connectivity by pruning their connections i e undergoing an overall decline in the number of synapses we can also find such a development trend by tracing the variation of feedback_loop abundance in the number of feedback_loops for div as the networks are considered to be randomly connected it would be reasonable to presume that the abundance of feedback_loops is positively correlated with the whole network_connectivity thus identifying feedback_loops using msgcm can also be validated from this comparison although we showed in this article the identification of feedback_loops in cultured neural_networks and investigations into the relationship between the structure of a network and its dynamical_behavior the presented approach can also be applied to studying other biological_networks based on time series measurements using for example real_time immunofluorescence and microarray if the dynamical response of a biological_network can be measured and obtained in the form of multivariate_time data msgcm can be used to investigate the underlying causal feedback connections in the network for instance recent_advances in neural imaging_devices have provided enormous time course data from the brain examples_include macroscopic electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography signals recorded from the scalp invasive electrocorticography from the cortical_surface and mesoscopic local_field with electrodes inserted deep inside the brain these data have opened a new era for experimental_studies on the detailed wiring structure of a functional neural_network most of the studies to date however have dealt with the functional_connectivity of a brain using simple correlation or effective_connectivity of a local brain_region msgcm enables us to construct a functional feedback network covering the whole brain_regions and to further project a brain_network to a more precise interaction map compared with previous_studies our method can also be used as a useful tool for examining the functional_connectivity anomalies occurring in patients with psychiatric_disorders
