databases_and rna_seq atlas a reference_database for gene_expression in normal_tissue by next_generation motivation next_generation enables an entirely new perspective for clinical research and will speed up personalized_medicine in contrast to microarray based_approaches rna_seq analysis provides a much more comprehensive and unbiased view of gene_expression although the perspective is clear and the long_term success of this new technology obvious bioinformatics resources making these data easily available especially to the biomedical research_community are still evolving results we have generated rna_seq atlas a web_based repository of rna_seq gene_expression and query tools the website offers open and easy access to rna_seq gene_expression and tools to both compare tissues and find genes with specific expression_patterns to enlarge the scope of the rna_seq atlas the data were linked to common functional and genetic databases in particular offering information on the respective gene signaling_pathway analysis and evaluation of biological_functions by means of gene ontologies additionally data were linked to several microarray gene profiles including biogps normal_tissue profiles and nci cancer cell_line expression data our data search interface allows an integrative detailed comparison between our rna_seq and the microarray information this is the first database providing data_mining tools and open_access to large_scale rna_seq expression_profiles its applications will be versatile as it will be beneficial in identifying tissue_specific genes and expression_profiles comparison of gene_expression among diverse tissues but also systems_biology approaches linking tissue function to gene_expression changes availability_and http medicalgenomics org rna_seq atlas contactover the next years the availability of next_generation ngs_data will offer an entirely new perspective for clinical research and help usher in personalized_medicine so_far several databases offer storage or download of ngs_data however to access the valuable information of this promising new technique the user has to manually download the data and be familiar with their analysis to extract the valuable information this is currently not the case for most biomedical_researchers we therefore created the rna_seq atlas a database and user_interface ui providing easy access to ngs_data currently rna_seq atlas holds gene_expression on eleven human healthy_tissues and can be accessed over an intuitive web_interface to further increase the utility of the rna_seq atlas the data were linked to multiple microarray gene profiles representing normal_and furthermore various query tools were designed to offer a great variability of individual analysis in this work we present rna_seq atlas an easily_accessible database and ui offering access to ngs gene_expression furthermore to enhance the bioinformatics integration the data is linked to a wide_variety of commonly used and established databases and knowledge repositories to further enlarge the very broad scope of rna_seq atlas and to facilitate the analysis of gene_expression of several pathological_conditions the data were linked to cancer cell_line expression_profiles finally the implementation of a wide_variety of querying tools allows the user to start individual analysis enabling for both bioinformaticians and experimental researchers
