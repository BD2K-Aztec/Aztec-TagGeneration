sequence_analysis mapdamage fast approximate bayesian estimates of ancient dna_damage parameters motivation ancient_dna adna molecules in fossilized bones and teeth coprolites sediments mummified specimens and museum collections represent fantastic sources of information for evolutionary_biologists revealing the agents of past epidemics and the dynamics of past populations however the analysis of adna generally faces two major_issues firstly sequences consist of a mixture of endogen ous and various exogenous backgrounds mostly microbial secondly high nucleotide misincorporation rates can be observed as a result of severe post_mortem dna_damage such misincorporation patterns are instrumental to authenticate ancient sequences versus modern contaminants we recently_developed the user_friendly mapdamage package that identifies such patterns from next generation sequen_cing ngs sequence_datasets the absence of formal statistical mod eling of the dna_damage process however precluded rigorous quantitative comparisons across samples results here we describe mapdamage that extends the original features of mapdamage by incorporating a statistical_model of dna_damage assuming that damage events depend only on sequencing position and post_mortem deamination our bayesian statistical_framework provides estimates of four key features of adna molecules the average length of overhangs nick frequency and cytosine de amination rates in both double_stranded regions d and overhangs s our model enables rescaling base quality_scores according to their probability of being damaged mapdamage handles ngs_datasets with ease and is compatible with a wide_range of dna_library protocols availability mapdamage is available at ginolhac github io mapdamage as a python_package and documentation is maintained at the centre for geogenetics web_site geogenetics ku dk publications mapdamage dna in historical samples is subject to a plethora of environmental_conditions and degradation reactions abasic_sites strand_breaks interstrand_cross and a wide_diversity of atypic nucleotidic bases are formed following oxidative and hydrolytic_degradation even in the most favorable preservation conditions post_mortem dna_damage limits our ability to access ancient_dna adna sequences and increases the risk of exogenous modern contamination as undamaged dna_molecules are more prone to enzymatic manipulation nucleotide misincorporation patterns which are mostly driven by deaminated forms of cytosines uracils have been suggested as a powerful approach to authenticate adna sequences generated on nextgeneration_sequencing ngs_platforms and motivated the creation of the mapdamage package such patterns could vary according to the specific molecular approach used for constructing and or amplifying second generation dna libraries for instance for one of the most popular protocols we observe inflated cytosine deamination rates at overhangs an increase in c t substitution_rates toward sequencing starts and complementary increase in g a rates toward reads ends conversely a novel procedure targeting single_stranded templates has shown elevated c t substitution_rates at both ends statistical_modeling of such patterns has been developed bywith strand break overhangs and cytosine deamination as key_factors using read_alignment to reference_genomes and maximum_likelihood optimization this approach has delivered the first quantitative estimates of damage parameters however the likelihood framework originally implemented scales poorly with the size of ngs_datasets and extensive running_times have prevented common usage here we present an extension of mapdamage which implements a fast approximation of the dna_damage model using a bayesian_framework mapdamage opens the possibility of comparing dna_damage levels across temporal and environmental gradients posterior distributions of damage parameters also enable penalizing the quality_score of likely damaged bases reducing noise in downstream single_nucleotide snp_calling procedures we applied mapdamage on a series of adna sequence_datasets generated from a range of periods source materials and environments supplementary section posterior predictive intervals and empirical frequencies are in general agreement as shown for the ancient plague dataset supplementaryand supplementary figs s s demonstrating the adequacy of our method we observed a ratio of cytosine deamination rates for double and singlestranded regions orders_of greater than estimates based on in vitro experiments in aqueous_solution in lindahl versus for schuenemann et_al in supplementary this suggests that tissue and sample specific micro environmental_characteristics drive different dna_damage kinetics in situ we also found a significant rank correlation between the posterior mean for single_stranded cytosine deamination and sample age supplementary in agreement with sawyer et_al however remains of similar age and location showed diverse parameter_estimates supplementary suggesting a prominent role of micro environmental_characteristics over age in diagenesis we also applied our quality rescaling scheme to the sequence_data of an australian aboriginal individual who died in s this increased the overlap of genotype_calls to dbsnp v suggesting that lower false_positive snp calls were achieved supplementary we have developed a computational_method for inferring adna damage parameters from ngs sequence_datasets with minimal changes to the dna_damage model presented by our model is compatible with the specificities of different sequencing and library building protocols we believe that downscaling quality_scores of likely damaged bases is the first from a long list of possible applications for damage parameter posterior distributions limiting the impact of nucleotide misincorporations in downstream sequence analyses the knowledge of such distributions could also be instrumental for improving mapping procedures to reference_genomes
