dream a webserver for the identification of editing sites in mature_mirnas using deep sequencing_data dream detecting rna_editing associated with micrornas is a webserver for the identification of mature microrna editing events using deep sequencing_data raw microrna sequencing_reads can be provided as input the reads are aligned against the genome and custom scripts process the data search for potential editing sites and assess_the of the findings the output is a text_file with the location and the statistical description of all the puta tive editing sites detected availability_and dream is freely_available on the web atdeep sequencing has many possible applications one of them is the identification and quantification of rna_editing the most common type of rna_editing is adenosine to inosine a to i editing catalyzed by enzymes of the adenosine_deaminase that act on rna family a prerequisite for this editing process is a double_stranded dsrna structure such dsrnas are formed as part of the microrna mirna maturation process and it is therefore expected that mirnas are affected by a to i editing indeed dozens of editing sites were found in mirnas a to i editing of primary mirna pri mirna was shown to affect the processing of the pri mirna to precursor mirna premirna or the processing of the pre mirna to mature mirna pri mirna and premirna editing events may lead to an edited version of the mature_mirnas mature_mirnas can bind to partially complementary targets located in the untranslated_region of specific_mrnas and block the translation or trigger degradation of the target_mrnas editing at the seed_region bases at the end of the mature mirna that are critical for target_recognition is expected to change the set of target_genes a striking example is mouse mir in which editing in the recognition_site alters the target_specificity of the mirna and profoundly_affects cellular_processes deep sequencing_data analysis may unravel the full extent of a to i editing in mirnas as well as other types of rna_editing however technical_problems in the analysis of deep sequencing_datasets may result in a false detection of mirna modification events we have previously described a protocol which utilizes deep sequencing_data to characterize rna_editing in mature_mirnas from human and mouse_brain while avoiding technical data analysis problems other groups have also detected mirna editing events in the mouse_brain during development in drosophila and in c elegans demonstrating that editing can add complexity to the mirna gene_regulation pathway however so_far there is no tool allowing researchers to detect mature mirna editing sites without extensive use of data analysis procedures the dream webserver is expected to make the editing detection procedure accessible to the large
