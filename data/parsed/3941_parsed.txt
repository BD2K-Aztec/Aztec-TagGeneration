databases_and redoxdb a curated database for experimentally_verified protein oxidative_modification redox_regulation and signaling which are involved in various cellular_processes have become one of the research focuses in the past_decade cysteine thiol_groups are particularly susceptible to post_translational and their reversible oxidation is of critical role in redox_regulation and signaling with the tremendous improvement of techniques hundreds of redox_proteins along with their redox_sensitive cysteines have been reported and the number is still fast_growing however until now there is no database to accommodate the rapid accumulation of information on protein oxidative_modification here we present redoxdba manually_curated database for experimentally_validated redox_proteins redoxdb version consists of two datasets a and b for proteins with or without verified modified cysteines respectively and includes redox_proteins containing cysteine_residues with oxidative_modification for each modified cysteine the exact position modification type and flanking_sequence are provided additional information including gene name organism sequence literature references and links to uniprot and pdb is also supplied the database supports several functions including data search blast and browsing bulk download of the entire dataset is also available we expect that redoxdb will be useful for both experimental_studies and computational_analyses of protein oxidative_modification oxidative_stress represents an imbalance between the reactive_oxygen ros and a biological_systems ability to detoxify the reactive_intermediates or to repair the resulting damage many diseases including type_ii cancer neurodegenerative_diseases and cardiovascular_disease are associated with oxidative_stress ros has been previously regarded as unwanted by products of aerobic_metabolism however under normal condition ros can regulate the structure and function of proteins and act as important signaling_molecule in various cellular_processes and many key cellular_processes are indicated to be redox_sensitive with the rapid development of redox proteomics that enables high_throughput detection of redox_proteins redox_regulation and signaling have become the research_focus in recent_years cysteine thiol_groups are particularly susceptible to oxidation by ros reactive_nitrogen and other electrophilic molecules these thiol_groups can be reversibly oxidized to intra and intermolecular disulfide_bonds s s sulfenic_acid intermediate soh sulfinic acid so h s nitrosothiols s no and s glutathione s sg those oxidative products can be reduced back by cellular reductants such as thioredoxin trx and glutathione grx under certain conditions this reversible oxidation plays critical roles in redox_regulation and signaling and represents another common type of protein post_translational apart from phosphorylation protein oxidative_modification events are traditionally identified by case by case studies which usually accompanied by site_directed experiment with the development of proteomics techniques in the past_decade it becomes possible to identify hundreds of redox_sensitive proteins in one single experiment currently hundreds of redox_proteins have been identified and the number is still fast_growing for many of these redox_proteins the corresponding cysteines undergoing oxidative_modification have also been experimentally_determined meanwhile several computational studies for cysteine oxidative_modification began to emerge in recent_years however to our knowledge until now there is no database to accommodate the rapid accumulation of information on protein oxidative_modification here we describe redoxdb a manually_curated database of experimentally_verified protein oxidative_modification annotations are provided at both sequence and residue levels the database supports several functions including data search blast browsing and bulk download which enables users to search and retrieve data easily the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions com derived from different species including mammals plants bacteria viruses and others annotations at both sequence and residue levels if available are provided redoxdb provides annotations including the exact position modification type and flanking_sequence amino_acids for each modified cysteine additional information such as gene name organism sequence as well as literature references with the pubmed links is supplied cross reference to the uniprot protein_sequence database is also available moreover links to pdb database are also provided when the d structure data are available redoxdb includes cysteines undergoing different types of oxidative modifications such as reversible disulfide formation sulphenation sulphination s glutathionylation and s nitrosylation cysteines that could form reversible disulfides or be s nitrosylated constitute the major part of data as summarized in redoxdb is the first extensive database that provides information about protein oxidative_modification verified by experimental_studies redoxdb not only includes data from case by case studies but also integrates high_throughput data from proteomics_studies we expect that redoxdb will be useful for both experimental_studies and computational_analyses of protein oxidative_modification
