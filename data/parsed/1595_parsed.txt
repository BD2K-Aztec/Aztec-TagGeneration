sequence_analysis epicombflu exploring known influenza epitopes and their combination to design a universal influenza_vaccine the influenza costs half a million lives annually despite availability of vaccines there is always a threat of pandemic from newly_emerging virulent_strains current influenza_vaccines i e trivalent inactivated_vaccine and live_attenuated provide moderate protection which is either greatly_reduced or absent in some seasons pandemics of flu in the past have indicated that these vaccines were not efficient against new virulent_strains the trivalent inactivated_vaccine and live_attenuated influenza_vaccines provide protection by producing neutralizing_antibodies against surface structural glycoproteins hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na but frequent_mutations in these surface proteins result in escape of many virulent_strains from antibody mediated immunity the flu pandemic in and development of resistance strains to ribavirin and oseltamivir drugs reignited the hunt for a universal influenza_vaccine uiv which can effectively counter the epidemic and pandemics caused by the influenza_virus in recent_years epitope based_vaccines have shown their effectiveness against hiv hepatitis_b and influenza_viruses in clinical studies current approaches have been focusing on b cell epitope bce and or t cell epitope tce mediated immune_responses to develop a uiv single conserved ectodomain epitope of m m e protein was developed as a uiv against the influenza_virus but mutations in the middle part of the ectodomain eliminated its potential as a uiv a vaccine produced from a single conserved tce or bce may not provide broad specific protection but a vaccine developed from a cocktail of few conserved epitopes can take it closer to a uiv multimeric a vaccine developed by biondvax and containing a trimeric combination of nine epitopes from the influenza_virus has provided broad protection and is currently in phase_ii recent positive outcomes of epitopes based_vaccines have provided an opportunity that available enormous information epitope and protein_sequences immunogenic data strains etc on known epitopes tces in public_databases may be explored for the selection of epitopes and or their combinations to design a potential uiv therefore a web_resource named as epicombflu has been developed which consists of the epitope information resource and the epitope combination explorer the former is a database containing epitopes strain coverage and their immunogenic data whereas the latter explores combinations of epitopes for maximum strains coverage using forward selection_algorithm fsa web_resource epicombflu provides compiled information on epitopes strain coverage epitope type host type literature references etc so that user can evaluate the prospective epitope s for developing a uiv the web_resource also provides an analysis facility that adds epitopes automatically on the basis of maximum strain coverage the inclusion of information on strain and population coverage and both humoral_and features in epicombflu is crucial for epitopebased broad_spectrum vaccine ben yedidia and arnon
