gene_expression non linear classification for on the fly fractional mass filtering and targeted precursor fragmentation in mass_spectrometry experiments motivation mass_spectrometry ms has become the method of choice for protein peptide_sequence and modification analysis the technology employs a two step approach ionized peptide precursor masses are detected selected for fragmentation and the fragment mass_spectra are collected for computational_analysis current precursor selection schemes are based on data or information dependent acquisition dda ida where fragmentation mass candidates are selected by intensity and are subsequently included in a dynamic exclusion list to avoid constant refragmentation of highly abundant species dda ida methods do not exploit valuable information that is contained in the fractional mass of high_accuracy precursor mass measurements delivered by current instrumentation results we extend previous contributions that suggest that fractional mass information allows targeted fragmentation of analytes of interest we introduce a non linear random_forest classification and a discrete mapping_approach which can be trained to discriminate among arbitrary fractional mass patterns for an arbitrary number of classes of analytes these methods can be used to increase fragmentation efficiency for specific_subsets of analytes or to select suitable fragmentation technologies on the fly we show that theoretical generalization error estimates transfer into practical_application and that their quality depends on the accuracy of prior_distribution estimate of the analyte classes the methods are applied to two real_world proteomics datasets current mass_spectrometry ms technologies_provide unpreceded mass accuracy and resolution yielding detailed qualitative and to whom correspondence should be addressed quantitative insight into a sample under investigation in fields including but not limited to proteomics glycomics lipidomics and metabolomics ms is now an established workhorse methodology and high_resolution ms data_acquisition have become the norm the accurate observed mass of a chemical compound carries more information than the mere molecular_weight it can be used to distinguish between peptides and non peptides cysteine_rich and or highly_acidic peptides glycopeptides and non polar peptides between peptide oligonucleotide cross_links and dna_fragments between unmodified and posttranslationally modified peptides and between target precursors and interference peptides and it can pinpoint mass defect calibrants in quantitative ms accurate_mass enable on the fly analysis decisions that formerly required time intensive off line analytical procedures mass defect mass excess and fractional mass the driving principle behind accurate_mass based decisions is the concept of nuclear mass defect defined as the difference between the sum of the masses of the constituent nucleons and the measured exact mass of an atom this difference is an instance of einsteins special theory of relativity stating that mass and energy are interchangeable the nuclear mass defect accounts for the nuclear binding_energy and is always non negative the concept of mass excess is a direct consequence of the nuclear mass defect it is defined as the difference d m obs m nom between the observed mass m obs and the nominal mass m nom of an element or compound in particular the mass excess of c is defined as zero and mass excesses of other elements can either be positive e g h and n or negative e g o s p and i however in practical experiments there is generally no prior_knowledge about the chemical_composition of an observed mass and as a consequence the nominal mass cannot directly be observed instead high_resolution ms instruments provide the fractional mass m m m i e the fraction of mass after the decimal point of a mass measurement m the fractional mass is confined to the interval m and for mass excess larger than one it wraps around to zero theoretical fractional mass filtering performance_measures hold in practical_application the results from experiment cf and c show that theoretical and practical performance_estimates are close if the training and real_world modification state distributions are equal in this case the theoretical error estimates_obtained for fractional mass classifiers trained on in silico datasets can be transferred to practical_application and are valid estimates for the unknown and unobservable experimental_errors the required degree of modification state distribution similarity depends on the difficulty page and c as well as inall real_world aucs are larger than and for the phosphorylation and iodination problem respectively a random_assignment to the associated classes according to the class priors would correspond to an auc of illustrating that fractional mass based classification yields effective precursor selection consequently there is a benefit in the combination of i learning discrimination functions based on theoretical ground_truth and ii applying the resulting classifiers to characterize observations in practical ms experiments more detailed efficiency analyses depend on the experiment at hand for the phosphorylation data we also calculated the positive_and ppv and npv see supplementary in the context of targeted fragmentation the ppv can be understood as a measure of efficiency the ratio of true_positives among those reported as fragmentation candidates and npv describes the miss rate the ratio of false_negatives among those reported as non candidates for the modification distributionadjusted phosphorylation experiments optimal values of ppv and npv are between and providing further evidence that the fractional mass classification is beneficial although the underlying classification_problem is non trivial on the fly classification is feasible and equally accurate the numbers inindicate that the impact of discretizing the neutral mass domain is marginal for the two datasets used in this study theoretical auc values for the random_forest and the discrete mapping classifier are within a single sd of each other this observation also holds for all real_world classification experiments with the exception of the modification state distribution adjusted sus scrofa thyroglobin classification here the random_forest outperforms the discrete mapping_approach quite significantly evidence from other thyroglobulin iodination datasets data not shown suggests that this is related to the comparatively_small number of iodinated peptides present in the real_world dataset which causes significant changes in the auc with only very few contradicting classifications between the methods classification_performance depends on modification state prior_distribution accuracy real_world classification_performance is influenced by two factors i the complexity difficulty of the underlying classification_problem and ii the discrepancy between the modification state prior distributions used for training and present in the real_world dataset the former can easily be illustrated by comparing the theoretical rocs and aucs for the phosphorylation and iodination problems shown in because the fractional mass shift for phosphorylation is smaller than for iodination the classes representing the different phosphorylation states exhibit a larger overlap cf consequently their discrimination is more difficult and the area under the theoretical roc_curve for the phosphorylation problem is smaller than for the iodination problem if the correct modification state distribution is used in the training step the theoretical and realworld rocs and aucs are very similar and c if not the cross_validated performance estimate reported for the theoretical data may overestimate the true error_rates attained in real_world application it is important to realize that this is an observation that focuses on the theoretical error estimate with respect to its validity in real_world application although more detailed sampling of masses of less prevalent modification states may yield improved_performance there is no guarantee that the error estimates are sufficiently conservative under such circumstances in the phosphorylation dataset the influence of imperfect prior distributions of the modification states had a huge influence on the accuracy of the theoretical auc estimates but only little impact on the classification_performance on real_world data supplementary in cases where the classification_problem is comparatively simple due to clear_cut large mass defects the performance predictions are relatively stable with respect to the class prior distributions i e roc_curves and aucs change only marginally for different prevalence_settings this is illustrated by the iodination rocs in panels c and d in the reason for this behavior is that false_positives are costly in terms of ms sampling efficiency and it is necessary to jointly optimize true_positives and true_negatives for the optimization of the joint criterion the unknown ratio between true_positives and true_negatives needs to be considered causing a dependency on the modification state prior_distribution however in many proteomics experiments the peptide modification state prior_distribution is unknown or in itself a subject of ongoing investigation in such cases available ms datasets can be used to estimate a lower_bound of ptm rates but the applicability of such ground_truth is heavily influenced by the bias introduced through sample_preparation the specific chemical enrichment protocols used and dda manually_curated ptm databases suffer from the same drawbacks and are not available for all organisms of interest a potential approach to circumventing this problem is to include a data dependent retraining scheme where modifications identified by mascot search as well as protein sequence_databases serve as ground_truth and the classifier undergoes constant iterative re training consequently with a growing knowledge_base the classifier performance can iteratively adapt to the true modification prevalence and converge towards optimality such a procedure is computationally_expensive and should thus only be applied to standardized stable protocols
