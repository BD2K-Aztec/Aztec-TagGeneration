genetics_and association analysis using next generation sequence_data from publicly_available control_groups the robust variance score statistic motivation sufficiently powered casecontrol_studies with next generation sequence ngs_data remain prohibitively_expensive for many investigators if feasible a more efficient strategy would be to include publicly_available sequenced controls however these studies can be confounded by differences in sequencing_platform alignment single_nucleotide and variant_calling read_depth and selection thresholds assuming one can match cases and controls on the basis of ethnicity and other potential_confounding and one has access to the aligned_reads in both groups we investigate the effect of systematic_differences in read_depth and selection threshold when comparing allele_frequencies between cases and controls we propose a novel likelihood_based method the robust variance score rvs that substitutes genotype_calls by their expected_values given observed sequence_data results we show theoretically that the rvs eliminates read_depth bias in the estimation of minor_allele we also demonstrate that using simulated and real ngs_data the rvs method controls type_i and has comparable power to the gold_standard analysis with the true underlying genotypes for both common and rare_variants availability_and an rvs r script and instructions can be found at strug research sickkids ca and at https github com strug lab rvs contact genome_wide casecontrol association studies with single_nucleotide snps can incorporate publicly_available genome_wide control data for comparison to disease group allele_frequencies the wellcome_trust case control this convenient strategy not only increases statistical_power by using larger numbers of controls but also allows precious resources to be focused on data_collection from diseased individuals publicly_available genome_wide nextgeneration sequence ngs_data exist e g genomes_project however it has generally been used as a tool to identify novel or rare_variants in individual studies rather than as a control_group for association analysis one explanation for this underutilization of ngs genotypes for association may be the bias that results from sequencing cases and controls with different genomic platforms and protocols these biases tend to be less of a concern when using microarray_data if properly accounted for a more commonly implemented design for association with ngs_data is to use sequenced cases for variant discovery and then genotype the identified_variants in a larger sample of cases and controls such two step sampling designs can be cost_effective and can ensure there is no type_i inflation however this approach cannot detect protective variants that are present only in the discovery sample and in general are overly conservative here we develop statistical methodology for a design in which publicly_available sequenced controls are used for association studies with in study ngs sequenced cases to prioritize variants for further investigation public controls could augment instudy sequenced controls or in the case that we consider here public controls could be the only control_group used for analysis possible confounders that could influence findings when using an external ngs control_group in genetic_association can be divided_into two general_categories i those that can be controlled by design considerations such as appropriately matched control_groups on ethnicity i e basic epidemiologic principles unrelated to the type and production of genetic data and ii factors directly related to the sequencing and variant_calling technology base_calling procedures e g various sequencing_platforms alignment e g algorithm and reference_genome read_depth snp_detection and genotype_calling for example large publicly_available datasets that were sequenced at low read_depth lrd can result in biased estimation of allele_frequencies this bias diminishes with increasing read_depth however if allele_frequencies are compared from variants sequenced with different read_depth in case and control cohorts false associations may be generated and true ones masked even when average read_depth is similar coverage could vary in individual regions across platforms samples and experiments this would likewise bias results in regions with low coverage in one group by chance and preclude comparison between cases and controls in regions completely lacking sequence in one group or the other lastly differences in snp discovery and variant_calling can also lead to spurious association findings as a consequence of these shortcomings statistical methodology designed to assess association in sequence_data has generally required both cases and controls to be sequenced together using a common platform depth and design here we focus on the technical_aspects of comparing allele_frequencies between cases and controls that were sequenced as part of different projects with different experimental_designs when the matched case and control_groups with their aligned ngs_data e g binary version of sequence_alignment bam_files are available we can apply the variant_calling algorithm to the combined data so that the resulting case and control data would be well matched with the exception of design_parameters such as enrichment strategy sequencing_platform read_depth and resulting coverage it is well documented that differences in read_depth between cases and controls have large effects on estimation of minor_allele maf and can lead to inflated_type in association studies less attention has been paid to the selection threshold used in genotype_calling genotypers such as those implemented in samtools and genome_analysis gatk these genotypers provide confidence quality_scores for a genotype call e g gq scores and based on these scores and a predetermined threshold low_confidence quality calls are filtered out to address variant call differences that can occur even within a study_design that sequences cases and controls one could incorporate read_depth or quality_score differences into the association analysis by using a logistic_regression with read_depth as a covariate or by weighting each variant call by quality_score however in the setting where cases and controls are distinguishable by read_depth these approaches are not applicable because they would be confounded by casecontrol status and the corresponding parameters would not be estimable another approach to account for differential read_depth is implemented in the gatk toolkit http www broadinstitute org gatk gatkdocs org broadinstitute sting gatk walkers printreads html which randomly downsamples bam_files for the higher read_depth group this approach is a less powerful strategy in comparison with methodology that incorporates all observed data as we show in section when cases and controls are sequenced as part of the same experimental_design skotte et_al suggest substituting genotype_calls by their expected_values given the observed sequence_data this can result in higher power and better control of type_i than methods based on called genotypes while taking_into uncertainty in the calls without requiring filtering by arbitrary quality_score thresholds this approach incorporates read_depth by constructing the joint likelihood of observed phenotypes and observed sequence_data and significance testing is conducted using a score statistic this approach however would not control type_i when there are case control differences in read_depth because these differences may produce inflated estimates of the score statistic variance especially for rare_variants in section we propose the robust variance score rvs which repurposes and extends the approach by in section we illustrate analytically and by simulation how differences in read_depth and variant screening parameters affect type_i in association studies using called genotypes we then present simulation_results under the null and alternative_models for association with single and multiple_variants using the rvs method in section we show that analysis using the rvs has comparable power to an analysis with the true genotypes in section we apply the rvs to analysis of several studies using ngs_technology and we compare our findings with those from association studies using genotype_calls with quality_score thresholds publicly_available genome_wide microarray_datasets have been widely used as controls in genome_wide the wellcome_trust case here we provide a new method the rvs to test for association in studies that use ngs from external control_groups confounding_factors associated with ngs data_processing such as snp and genotype_calling read_depth and selection parameters can all contribute to spurious or masked findings here we focus on statistical adjustment for the bias in maf estimation and consequently type_i introduced by differential read_depth between cases and controls and the selection threshold in the absence of a unified study_design for sequencing cases and controls using theoretical and empirical investigations we show that the rvs is a useful tool to incorporate external control_groups in genetic_association with ngs_data in an effort to prioritize sequence_variants for follow_up the rvs can be used for single_variant or joint rare_variant and does not require arbitrary selection of parameter_values for filtering but rather analyzes all observed data the type_i associated with the rvs is well controlled by the use of robust variance estimates and the power is comparable to analyses using genotypes called without error our theoretical and simulation_results indicate that systematic_differences between cases and controls lead to spurious_results in association analysis using genotype_calls from ngs_technology the degree of deviation in p value distribution from expected under the null_hypothesis depends on maf difference in readdepth and the applied selection threshold particularly when r genotype call based association_analyses can be applied for some variants even when there is a significant_difference in read_depth between cases and controls and provides lower bounds on maf at which point maf estimates from low read_depth data remain close to the true value however using these theoretical_predictions to justify analysis at certain mafs would perforce preclude analysis at the remaining variants because the biased allele frequency_estimation for the remaining data would remain unaccounted for a hrd control_group with ample coverage to allow a selection threshold i e r can be used to avoid this bias however this does not ensure that there is ample read_depth in cases and controls at every locus to address systematic difference in read_depth the gatk toolkit http www broadinstitute org gatk gatkdocs org broad institute sting gatk walkers printreads html proposes to randomly downsample bam_files for the higher read_depth group this approach is a less powerful strategy in comparison to methodology that incorporates all observed data as we show in section other methods that use logistic_regression with read_depth as a covariate or by weighting each variant call by quality_score as well as methods that substitute genotype_calls by their expected_values are only applicable if both groups are not distinguishable by read_depth and sequencing_error we implement the rvs in a casecontrol study with hrd cases and lrd controls the top_ranked variants are in agreement with an association study based on genotype_calls from the hrd cases and hrd controls however as was the case in the present study if one has access only to genotype_calls as opposed to the aligned bam_files or the raw_data only variants with genotype_calls present in both datasets can be analyzed this could potentially be restrictive for example rs inwas sequenced in the genomes_project controls and epilepsy cases but calls at this snp in the complete genomics control_group are absent without additional information about locus specific coverage in the complete genomics control set we are not able to determine_whether the missing variant is monomorphic in the sample or there was simply no sequencing_coverage coverage_information is integrated into the rvs analysis of the aligned_reads currently the rvs cannot accommodate covariate_adjustment and this will be an area of future development the rvs is easily extendable to accommodate a design in which a subset of controls is sequenced alongside the cases in addition to incorporating an external control_group this type of study_design may prove preferable to assess the comparability of the external control_group this more costly approach however requires a formal evaluation ensuring the comparability of the case and control_groups on the basis of epidemiologic principles is paramount this assumption requires_careful before moving_forward with any statistical_analysis ideally cases and controls would also be matched on sequencing_platform and enrichment strategy however our results indicate that this is not necessary because the rvs adjusts for differences in variability and missing rates because of platform enrichment differences we suggest that when cases and controls are sequenced using different technologies conducting association analysis with a second control_group can provide confidence that systematic_bias due to platform enrichment differences is not driving the observed signals different alignment_algorithms are implicitly accounted for by the rvs because the unit of analysis is the genotype probability rather than the genotype_calls in the association analysis whole_genome of large samples remains cost prohibitive for many investigators using external control_groups in ngs association studies to augment a smaller set of sequenced controls or as the only control set for comparison can reserve precious resources for the sequencing of cases therefore if ngs service_providers or other public initiatives make control samples available to customers or the public then the rvs makes it feasible to use external control_groups in association studies with ngs_data
