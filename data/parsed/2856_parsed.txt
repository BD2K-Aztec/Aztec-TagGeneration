membplugin studying membrane complexity in vmd computer simulations are giving way to more complex and accurate studies of biological_membranes by molecular_dynamics md_simulations the analysis of md trajectories comprises the bio physical characterization of membrane_properties or the study of pro teinlipid interactions and dynamics however there is a lack of automated tools to analyse md_simulations of complex membrane or membrane_protein systems here we present membplugin a plugin for the visual molecular_dynamics package that provides algorithms to measure a host of essential biophysical_properties in simulated membranes membplugin features are accessible both through a user_friendly graphical_interface and as command_line procedures to be invoked in analysis scripts availability_and membplugin is a vmd extension written in tcl multi_platform source_code documentation and tutorials are freely_available membplugin sourceforge net although membrane_lipids were previously_thought to only play a passive role in cellular_processes it is now known that they actively modulate key cell_membrane complexes such as lipid_rafts as a result some lipids can regulate protein functionality and some are involved in severe diseases the experimental and computational study of membrane_lipids is an emergent field of research van thanks to the refinement of lipid force_field modern membrane simulations and analysis tools supplementary are able to yield accurate biophysical_properties close to experimental values and observables that would otherwise be out of reach of experimental_techniques here we describe membplugin an extension to the free molecular_visualization program visual molecular_dynamics vmd to study the biophysical_properties of membranes and membraneprotein interactions via molecular_dynamics md_simulations
