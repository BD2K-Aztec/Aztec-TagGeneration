databases_and fypo the fission_yeast phenotype ontology motivation to provide consistent computable descriptions of phenotype data pombase is developing a formal ontology of phenotypes observed in fission_yeast results the fission_yeast phenotype ontology fypo is a modular ontology that uses several existing ontologies from the open biological and biomedical_ontologies obo collection as building_blocks including the phenotypic quality ontology pato the gene_ontology and chemical_entities of biological interest modular ontology development facilitates partially automated effective organization of detailed phenotype descriptions with complex relationships to each other and to underlying biological_phenomena as a result fypo supports sophisticated querying computational_analysis and comparison between different experiments and even between species availability fypo releases are available from the subversion repository at the pombase sourceforge project page https sourceforge the fission_yeast is a eukaryotic model_organism that has been used since the s to study diverse_biological including the cell_division genome_organization and maintenance cell_morphology and cytokinesis signaling and stress_responses chromatin gene_regulation and meiotic differentiation a large and active research_community uses a wide_variety of molecular_genetic cell biological and biochemical_techniques to study s pombe with the completion of its genome_sequence in fission_yeast has also become amenable to genome_scale experimentation and has emerged as a reliable model for studying processes involved in human disease and cell_biology pombase http www pombase org has recently been established as a comprehensive model_organism database that provides centralized access to information relevant to s pombe pombase encompasses a core of manual literature curation that provides detailed accurate curation of phenotypes gene_ontology go annotations genetic and physical_interactions protein_modifications and many other types of data_describing genes and their products manually curated_data are supplemented by automatic gene_annotation and large_scale datasets and information about additional sequence feature_types we define a phenotype as an observable characteristic or set of characteristics of an organism that results from the interaction of its genotype with a given environment extensive genetics research has been carried_out using s pombe over several decades and a comprehensive set of high_quality curated phenotype data is in high_demand in the s pombe research_community a survey of s pombe researchers conducted in identified phenotype annotation as the most requested feature not then available in a fission_yeast database in response to community demand we have developed the fission_yeast phenotype ontology fypo a formal ontology of phenotypes observed in fission_yeast that will allow pombase to provide consistent computable descriptions of phenotype data using fypo we have begun to curate accurate and detailed annotations of mutant_allele phenotypes with the aim of providing comprehensive coverage of phenotypes reported in the fission_yeast literature fypo annotations are available on pombase gene pages and we envisage that the availability of genome_scale phenotype datasets will make new types of data analysis possible facilitated by the formal structure of fypo phenotype annotations can be shared and integrated with additional data including other types of data obtained in fission_yeast as well as phenotype data from other species we have developed a formal ontology of phenotypes observed in fission_yeast which now includes over terms to support phenotype curation in pombase
