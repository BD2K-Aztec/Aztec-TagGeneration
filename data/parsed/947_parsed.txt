structural_bioinformatics chembioserver a web_based pipeline for filtering clustering and visualization of chemical_compounds used in drug_discovery chembioserver is a publicly_available web_application for effectively mining and filtering chemical_compounds used in drug_discovery it provides researchers with the ability to i browse and visualize compounds along with their properties ii filter chemical_compounds for a variety of properties such as steric clashes and toxicity iii apply perfect match substructure search iv cluster compounds according to their physicochemical_properties providing representative compounds for each cluster v build custom compound mining pipelines and vi quantify through property graphs the top ranking compounds in drug_discovery procedures chembioserver allows for pre_processing of compounds prior to an in silico screen as well as for post_processing of top_ranked molecules resulting from a docking exercise with the aim to increase the efficiency and the quality of compound selection that will pass to the experimental test phase a rate_limiting in computer_aided drug_design cadd is often the need for a computational chemist expert to postprocess compounds that result from a virtual_screening docking exercise before selecting which ones should be tested_experimentally this post_processing step entails identifying and discarding docking poses that result in intra ligand steric clashes as well as compounds with undesirable or toxic moieties and unwanted physicochemical_properties cheminformatics web_applications play_an for searching filtering and clustering chemical_compounds for drug_discovery in recent_years several chemical compound databases have been developed including zinc chemdb pubchem and many others nevertheless although knowledge integration can drastically increase the power and the predictive_capability of large_scale computational comparisons of chemical_structures online open_access web_applications for compound mining are limited in number and importantly in pipeline integration level namely in the edinburgh university ligand selection system eduliss either similarity or pharmacophore search of compounds is performed on commercially_available molecules based on a proposed ultrafast shape recognition algorithm or by calculating interatomic distances in the similar compound and substructure matching of compounds web_application chemical similarity and substructure searches are computed by means of the maximum common induced subgraph using an atom based_approach and the maximum common edge subgraph or by a bond based_approach nevertheless in both web_applications advanced filtering criteria such as lipinski rule of five or custom made filters are not available by using the faf drugs web_application users are able to process their own compound collections through simple absorption distribution metabolism excretion and toxicity filtering rules to aid the drug_discovery however the user is not able to apply sub graph search with a custom made structure data format sdf file moreover van_der vdw energy or geometric criteria are not taken into consideration in the filtering section to discard docking poses with steric clashes also no clustering technique of compounds with similar characteristics is available to any of the previously mentioned web_applications chemmine tools is a web_service for structure visualization and comparison similarity searching and compound clustering however the user can select only two compounds to compare each time which is limiting considering the need for massive similarity_searches through the compounds of a library thus the process does not facilitate large_scale filtering procedures furthermore neither vdw energy or radii restrictions nor toxicity checking is available to the user as a filtering service finally the service does not provide the user with the most representative compound for each cluster to overcome all previously mentioned limitations we have developed chembioserver as a free web_based application aimed to assist hit selection arising from cadd chembioserver is a web_application that automates pre post_processing tasks during virtual_screening through a customized workflow molecules are discarded by evaluating parameters such as vdw energy geometry physicochemical_properties and undesired toxic moieties the web_application is implemented so that the post_processing procedure can be tailored to the specific needs of the user as every compound query is unique it also features a clustering section with two clustering_methods the hierarchical as well as the modern affinity propagation ap clustering_algorithm grouping together to whom correspondence should be addressed and proposing a representative compound for each cluster additionally visualization of clusters and graphical_representations of molecular_properties are also available which provide insights into the compounds physicochemical similarity level
