systems_biology ibbig iterative binary bi clustering of gene_sets motivation meta_analysis of genomics data seeks to identify genes associated with a biological phenotype across multiple datasets however merging data from different platforms by their features genes is challenging meta_analysis using functionally or biologically characterized gene_sets simplifies data_integration is biologically intuitive and is seen as having great_potential but is an emerging field with few established statistical_methods results we transform gene_expression into binary gene_set profiles by discretizing results of gene_set enrichment_analyses and apply a new iterative bi clustering_algorithm ibbig to identify groups of gene_sets that are coordinately associated with groups of phenotypes across multiple studies ibbig is optimized for meta_analysis of large_numbers of diverse genomics data that may have unmatched samples it does not require prior_knowledge of the number or size of clusters when applied to simulated_data it outperforms commonly used clustering_methods discovers overlapping clusters of diverse sizes and is robust in the presence of noise we apply it to meta_analysis of breast_cancer studies where ibbig extracted novel gene setphenotype association that predicted tumor_metastases within tumor_subtypes availability implemented in the bioconductor_package ibbiggenomic studies have generated vast quantities of data including gene_expression copy_number and single_nucleotide tens_of of gene_expression experiments are stored in public_repositories and are increasingly studied in aggregate the aim of these studies is typically to discover a set of genes that participate in a pathway and are robustly predictive of a biological phenotype in a meta_analysis of multiple studies gene_set gsa was developed to identify such gene_sets whose expression distinguishes biological conditions even if single gene analysis fails to find significant associations with the phenotype the method takes_advantage of a priori defined gene_sets published in gene_set databases gene_ontology kegg and msigdb or resulting from differential_expression studies msigdb and genesigdb gsa has been successfully_applied to the analysis of microarray_experiments and has been extended beyond transcriptomics to other areas such as analysis of genome_wide when compared to traditional single gene analysis that ranks differential_gene between two conditions gsa produced more consistent biological results across studies even when some genes in a gene_set were absent or poorly represented in a dataset although gsa naturally extends to integrated meta_analysis surprisingly few studies have applied meta gsa to integration of multiple datasets most meta gsa approaches are designed for the limited case where datasets have matched_samples or features these either create a merged dataset of features genes common to all datasets and perform a gsa or apply gsa on each individual_datasets and then combine the resulting gsa statistics or p values to produce a ranked_list of gene_sets while a single ranked_list of gene_sets may capture the biological_complexity of a simple cellular system it is insufficient when applied to the study of complex disease or meta_analysis of large_numbers of studies where different pathways are active in different subsets of samples these limitations can be addressed using bi clustering a simultaneous similarity based clustering of features and conditions resulting in modules subsets of features that exhibit consistent_patterns over subsets of conditions numerous bi clustering_approaches have been applied to continuous and discretized gene_expression however these methods have not been applied in meta gsa we introduce iterative binary bi clustering of gene_sets ibbig a new bi clustering_algorithm to perform meta gsa that addresses the shortcomings of ranked_list meta gsa approaches it scales well when applied to hundreds of datasets is tolerant to noise characteristic of genomics data and when applied on simulated_data outperforms clustering and bi clustering_methods including hierarchical and k_means fabia coalesce and bimax to perform meta gsa we first transform noisy gene_expression to to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

medium provided the original_work simple binary gene_set profiles which simplifies the conjoint study of different studies as it negates the need to match probes across platforms we then apply ibbig to extract clusters or modules of groups of phenotypes whose gene_expression are enriched in similar gene_sets supplementary an attractive feature of ibbig is that it does not require prior_knowledge or limit the number or size of clusters a non trivial requirement in cluster_analysis of most large biological_datasets the results of ibbig are easy to parse ibbig modules are ranked by an information score and within each module gene_sets are ranked by a fitness score that measures its weight in the module it uses a genetic_algorithm to maximize the size and entropy of each bi cluster producing a small number of bi clusters whose functional and phenotypic associations can be easily interpreted eight modules were associated with known breast_cancer clinical_covariates in meta gsa of breast_cancer gene_expression and we detected modules prognostic both within and across breast_cancer molecular_subtypes using a cluster discovery approach which ignored a priori sample knowledge the ibbig bi clustering_algorithm is optimized for module discovery in sparse noisy binary genomics data and can be used for c weighted score of the first eight modules the weighted score is the log k ms where m is the total number of phenotypes modules m m are highlighted in d an image of the matrix in which rows and columns have the same order as the eighth module m contains the residues of other modules which is reflected in a low weighted scorebi clustering of binary_data meta gsa of multiple genomics datasets to discover modules groups of phenotypes whose differential gene_expression are enriched in the same gene_sets data_integration is made tractable by transformation of continuous noisy gene_expression data with different probes genes in each study into profiles of differentially enriched_gene which are common to all studies we examined two gsa approaches gsealm which tests for enrichment of gene_sets in genes that are differentially_regulated between conditions and gsva which is single sample gsa the former can be applied to identifying gene_sets or pathways associated with known clinical_covariates the latter is a pure discovery approach that ignores prior sample knowledge we designed ibbig to have high_specificity and thereby minimize the false_positive when discovering new classes but the iterative_approach employed in ibbig ensures it is sufficiently sensitive to discover weak signals even if they are potentially masked by stronger ones when applied to simulated_data it outperforms widely used global clustering_approaches kmeans hierarchical_cluster and newer bi clustering_approaches bimax fabia and coalesce and is able to find overlapping gene_set modules of varying sizes ibbig was able to identify all clusters in a simulated meta gsa dataset with high levels of specificity and sensitivity an advantage of ibbig relative to other methods is that it does not require a priori_knowledge of the true number of clusters following the application of ibbig the number of true clusters can be estimated from the weighed scores of the extracted modules in some cases we observed that a module may represent the residue or remaining signal of a stronger previously extracted module this residue remains because ibbig only removes information from the data matrix that is actually used for the entropy based score in a module however we do not consider these residual modules to be a shortcoming of the method as their existence facilitates discovery of the true overlap between modules and further these modules can be easily detected by looking at the overlap of phenotypes and gene_sets although ibbig includes several parameters we have shown that most impact only computation time and do not effect cluster discovery the only parameter that had an impact on cluster discovery was which regulates the weighting between cluster homogeneity and the number of phenotypes this parameter is useful in fine adjustment of the sensitivityspecificity ratio one major advantage of ibbig is its robustness in the presence of noise and its tolerance of missing_data it can tolerate high levels of noise as the entropy derived fitness score add members to a bi cluster once the number of associations exceeds we demonstrate that ibbig performs well even in the presence of false_positive associations and noise in both signal and background second ibbig does not require a gene_set to be associated with all phenotypes in a bi cluster which is a attractive feature in complex biological data were biological_processes maybe redundant or regulated by multiple factors concurrently many other bi clustering_algorithms including bimax and the recently described bibit discover only homogenous bi clusters and have low tolerance to noise and missing_data bimax identified a large number of mini bi clusters and was unable to identify large_clusters in our simulated dataset in practice application of bimax to genomics data requires post_processing of bi cluster results in order to either join or visualize overlapping bi clusters we applied ibbig to discovery of new modules among primary breast_tumors and discovered modules in an ibbig gsva analysis each module contained samples from multiple studies demonstrating successful data_integration while the largest highest confidence modules m m discovered breast_cancer molecular_subtypes known to be important in breast_cancer the smaller modules represented sub sets of these subtypes supporting recent evidence that there are subtypes within each of the principal breast_cancer molecular_subtypes the module m was characterized by gene_sets associated with angiogenesis in response to hypoxia or hif a degregulation and was a strong_predictor of recurrence inup regulation of proliferation genes and down_regulation of cell_adhesion genes in high_grade breast_tumors although they had insufficient numbers of patients to establish statistical_significance they observed that high levels of immune genes were an indicator of good prognosis in high_grade breast_cancer patients our analysis also suggests b immune_response is associated with better outcome when we examined which genes that most frequently appeared in module b genesigdb gene_signatures we found several chemokines including ccl rantes a key_regulators of t cell immune_response highly_expressed in breast_cancer and reported to be associated with metastases and progression however our analysis does not fit this prevailing hypothesis and suggests ccl is associated with good prognosis in high_grade breast_cancer patients in this study we have used ibbig to discover clusters in matrices of discretized p values from gsa of gene_expression data however the method can also be easily applied to gsa of other different data types including snp data ibbig can be applied to non geneset data for example to demonstrate the application of ibbig to an extremely sparse matrix in which small_clusters are expected ibbig was applied to discretized data from the nhgri genome_wide gwas catalog as the weighted scores were low for modules identified we averaged results over runs of ibbig and chose robust modules only genes and traits that occured in at least runs were included supplementary these modules are provided in supplementary table s it discovered a possible link between triglyercides hdl_cholesterol and waist_circumference with genes gckr lpl bud and znf although lpl bud and znf has been implicated previously this module suggested a new link with an expanding waistline and gckr while gsa requires input gene_sets it is not restricted to databases of curated gene_sets and can use gene_sets deduced through text_mining from the published_literature we anticipate ibbig will be useful in integrated data analysis of multiple data types ibbig can be performed on any binary matrix and could be applied to binary proteinprotein_interaction or rnai data we would like to extend it to other data types including categorical_data an attractive feature of ibbig compared to others methods such as the recently described logistic_regression meta gsa approach is its ability to perform integrative_analysis using dozens of datasets in summary ibbig provides a simple robust rapid and scalable method for meta gsa when applied to simulated_data it outperforms commonly used clustering and bi clustering_approaches and iteratively discovers gene_set modules made up of both strong and weaker signals meta gsa using ibbig constitutes a new approach for discovery of pathway and gene_set behavior across multiple studies and provides a higher_level understanding of gene and cellular function expertise and generous
