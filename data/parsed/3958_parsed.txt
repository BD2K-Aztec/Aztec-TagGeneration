regulatory_network inferred using expression data of small_sample application and validation in erythroid system downloaded from motivation modeling regulatory_networks using expression data observed in a differentiation process may help identify context specific interactions the outcome of the current_algorithms highly depends on the quality and quantity of a single time course dataset and the performance may be compromised for datasets with a limited number of samples results in this work we report a multi_layer graphical_model that is capable of leveraging many publicly_available time course datasets as well as a cell lineage_specific data with small_sample to model regulatory_networks specific to a differentiation process first a collection of network_inference are used to predict the regulatory_relationships in individual public datasets then the inferred directional relationships are weighted and integrated together by evaluating against the cell lineage_specific dataset to test the accuracy of this algorithm we collected a time course rna_seq dataset during human erythropoiesis to infer regulatory_relationships specific to this differentiation process the resulting erythroid specific regulatory_network reveals novel regulatory_relationships activated in erythropoiesis which were further validated by genome_wide tr binding studies using chip_seq these erythropoiesis specific regulatory_relationships were not identifiable by single dataset based_methods or context independent integrations analysis of the predicted targets reveals that they are all closely associated with hematopoietic lineage differentiation availability_and the predicted erythroid regulatory_network is available atin the past_decades significant research_efforts have been devoted to infer gene_regulatory grns in the bioinformatics field the challenge lies in that inferring regulatory_network is an ill posed problem because the number of interactions to be inferred exceeds the number of independent experiments today the standard solution to these p n problems p is the number of parameters and n is the number of training samples is different regularization techniques adopting or modifying the method tikhonov developed almost years_ago when pn i e an extremely limited set of experimental_observations are available it is often challenging to find a stable solution in this article we show a method to utilize both small context specific expression data and large non specific datasets to infer regulatory_networks the essence of this method is to intrinsically increase the p by giving a weight to non specific datasets according to their relevance to the contextspecific dataset and accuracy this technique has been used in non directional networks but hasnt been applied to regulatory_networks with time course data current methods for modeling regulatory_networks based on expression data can be divided_into two categories the first category utilizes a single time course dataset over a development process or under certain environmental_perturbations methods in this category focus on predicting regulatory_networks corresponding to the same context of input_data which includes context likelihood of relatedness clr dynamic_bayesian dbn smoothing spline clustering ssc and learning module networks lemone and semi_supervised regulatory_network discoverer serend intensive research_efforts have been devoted to these methods with community_based assessments e g the dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods challenges identifying several well performed algorithms including ours numerous great methods have been derived from these crowd sourcing efforts this category of methods may capture the cell lineage_specific and other context specific information however the accuracy of these algorithms is expected to be heavily affected by the input time course data and subject to fluctuation due to experimental_observation errors methods in the second category generate regulatory_networks by integrating_multiple genomic_datasets such as supervised inference of regulatory_networks sirene multilevel integrated inference and analysis of regulatory_networks combinatorial algorithm for expression and sequence_based cluster extraction system coalesce and simultaneous genome_wide inference of multiple types of interactions including regulatory ones by leveraging multiple datasets these algorithms are expected to be more accurate in predicting a global non specific network however the context specificity of such integrative methods is limited due to the lack of contextspecific input_data the complementary nature of the two categories motivated us to develop difmine a novel multi_layer graphical_model that leverages multiple non specific time course expression datasets as well as a single context specific yet small_scale dataset to infer regulatory_networks that are specific to a differentiation process in this multi_layer model the regulatory_networks of individual non specific genomic_datasets are inferred using network_inference developed for a single dataset for this step we tested state of the art algorithms identified in previous community_based blind assessments next the relevance of these non specific networks against the context specific dataset is evaluated using bayesian rules and integrated into a single network the resulting network intends to reveal the context specific regulatory_relationships on the whole genomic_scale in contrast to other state of the art regulatory_network prediction_methods our approach benefits from both the large number of publicly_available functional genomic_datasets and the small_scale cell lineage_specific dataset that defines the context we applied our algorithm to a cell lineage_specific expression rna_seq dataset of human erythropoiesis we demonstrated that we could significantly improve the performance of the network_inference based on a single limited dataset compared with one of the most cited the state of the art single dataset methods such as clr and dbn additionally we compared the performance of our algorithm against context insensitive integration without the information from the cell lineage_specific dataset and found that the former successfully identifies regulatory_relationships activated during erythropoiesis finally we used a recently generated chip_seq for tr an important transcription_factor involved into erythropoiesis and validated our prediction of regulatory_relationships using this data
