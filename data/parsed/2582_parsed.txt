data_and isomir bank a research resource for tracking isomirs next_generation ngs_technology has revealed that micrornas mirnas are capable of exhibiting frequent differences from their corresponding mature reference_sequences generating multiple_variants the isoforms of mirnas isomirs these isomirs mainly originate via the imprecise and alternative cleavage during the pre mirna processing and post_transcriptional that influence mirna stability their sub cellular_localization and target_selection although several tools for the identification of isomir have been reported no bio informatics resource dedicated to gather isomirs from public ngs_data and to provide functional analysis of these isomirs is available to date thus a free online database isomir bank has been created to integrate isomirs detected by our previously_published algorithm cpss in total samples small_rna ngs_data downloaded from arrayexpress from eight species arabidopsis_thaliana drosophila_melanogaster danio_rerio homo_sapiens mus_musculus oryza_sativa solanum lycopersicum and zea_mays are analyzed at present isomirs from mature_mirnas are collected into isomir bank in addition isomir bank provides target prediction and enrichment_analysis to evaluate the effects of isomirs on target_selection availability_and isomir bank is implemented in php perl mysql r format and can be freely accessed atmicrornas mirnas with average length of nucleotides are ubiquitously_expressed and regulate many essential_biological mainly via post transcriptional_silencing of genes through mrna_decay and or translational_repression during this process the primary mirna transcripts pri mirnas are mainly cleaved by previously mirnas were only annotated as the canonical sequences however extensive application of highthroughput sequencing_technology to detect expression_profile of mirna has revealed that mirnas can frequently exhibit differences from their corresponding canonical mature sequences generating multiple_variants known as isoforms of mirnas isomirs generally the reference mirbase mirna having the canonical sequence often differs from the most abundant isomir there are two main processes that lead to the production of isomirs these isomirs mainly originate via the imprecise and alternative cleavage not completely random during the pre mirna processing and post_transcriptional that have influence on mirna stability their sub cellular_localization and target_selection on the other hand mirna editing is the process that generates isomirs by post_transcriptional enzymatic editing of the mirna genome it has also been reported recently that isomirs can significantly affect the half_life of mirna as well as their sub cellular_localization and their target specification here we have established a database isomir bank to support and facilitate the ongoing isomirs research our database contains isomirs detected from samples small_rna ngs_data downloaded from arrayexpress database of eight species arabidopsis_thaliana drosophila_melanogaster danio_rerio homo_sapiens mus_musculus oryza_sativa solanum lycopersicum and zea_mays with manually_curated metadata for each sample organism sex tissue development stage age experiment condition treatment and sequencing_platform isomir bank also has a_user allowing researchers to quickly find and navigate the isomirs of their interest and related annotation along with the functional analysis that can help in evaluating the effects of isomir on target_selection and downstream pathways our database is not only a collection of isomirs from ngs_data but also a tool to find out the candidate functional isomirs for further experimental_studies range from to and other statistical_analysis for isomirs in isomir bank are provided in supplementary_information we analyzed a number of isomirs shared between any two species among the eight species in the database interestingly many isomirs are conserved in animals or plants but a specific isomir of animals could not be found in plants and vice_versa supplementary this observation is consistent_with showing few mirnas were known to be structurally or functionally conserved between plants and animals moreover we observed that more conserved isomirs could be found within two species having closer genetic evolutionary_relationship supplementary
