data_and an adaptive workflow coupled with random_forest algorithm to identify intact n glycopeptides detected from mass_spectrometry motivation despite many attempts for algorithm development in recent_years automated identification of intact glycopeptides from lc_ms spectral_data is still a challenge in both sensitivity and precision results we implemented a supervised machine_learning algorithm random_forest in an automated workflow to identify n glycopeptides using spectral_features derived from ion_trap based lc_ms data the workflow streamlined high confident n glycopeptide spectral_data and enabled adaptive model optimization with respect to different sampling strategies training sample_size and feature_set a critical evaluation of the features important for glycopeptide identification further facilitated effective feature_selection for model improvement using split sample testing method from high confident n glyco peptide spectral_data we demonstrated that an optimal true_positive precision and false_positive of and respectively can be attained for overall n glycopeptide identification availability_and the workflow developed in this work and the application suite sweetheart that the workflow supports for n glycopeptide identification are available for download at http sweet heart glycoproteomics protein_glycosylation is a prevalent post_translational which involves intricate sets of glycan biosynthesis pathways to modify specific sites of the protein_sequence with attached oligosaccharide chains unlike other post_translational such as phosphorylation ubiquitination and methylation protein_glycosylation is structurally and compositionally diverse as glycan moiety on the protein_sequence affects the physicochemical_properties of proteins through the change of structural conformation and binding_motif glycan heterogeneity endows glycoproteins with graduated functional versatilities in many biological_processes for example different glycoproteins on the membrane of immune_cells are responsible for triggering immune_responses to different antigens glycoproteins can also modulate cell_adhesion and signaling by differentiating the receptors on cell_surface or binding to specific lectins moreover the spatial and temporal_dynamics of glycoproteins highly regulate the development of organisms flanagan and aberrant glycoproteins during growth or development could cause diseases given the significant roles of glycosylation in mediating the biological_functions of glycoproteins and thus their clinical_implications there is currently a growing awareness and increasing demand for highly_efficient and precise protein_glycosylation profiling recent_advances in mass_spectrometry ms technology have enabled compositional structural and quantitative profiling of the glycomes and glycoproteomes owing to the relatively large glycan size and compositional diversity high_throughput glycopeptide identification with intact glycan moiety attached is precluded from the conventional approach of bottom up database_search with tandem_mass ms data consequently current ms based glycoproteomics technologies relie mostly on separate analysis of released glycans and deglycosylated peptides instead of intact glycopeptides as it should be however by doing so the valuable information on site_specific glycosylation and its associated heterogeneity which is important for delineating the function and activity of the glycoprotein is lost in the process recognizing the need to automate the laborious and often manually impossible process of mining the intact glycopeptide ms and ms data computational_tools including glycominer glypid glycopep grader peptoonist glydb medicel integrator protein n glycosylation suite glycopeptidesearch byonic and glycopeptide finder have been developed in recent_years to facilitate site_specific glycosylation analysis each of these tools differs by the computational strategies and algorithms and was often optimized for handling datasets from only one or two of the several available liquid_chromatography lc_ms platforms in general however all share the same common approach for realizing the prospect of intact glycopeptide identification the essential steps are i accurate_mass in precursor ms spectra ii deducing possible glycan composition and peptide_backbone sequence from the lc_ms spectra iii pattern matching the marker fragment_ions for peptide_backbone and glycan against theoretical spectra from protein and glycan database or attempt to de_novo sequencing the glycan moiety and iv scoring for best matches for example using collision_induced cid on a quadrupole time offlight q tof mass_spectrometry the diagnostic sugar oxonium ions sequential neutral losses of glycosyl residues and the y ion which is the peptide_backbone plus one hexnac attached to asn can usually be detected in the lc_ms spectra of glycopeptides these are particularly useful for n glycopeptide analysis because all n glycosylations comprise a common pentasaccharide core of hex hexnac by matching for monosaccharide mass difference and peptide database_search based on y ion with precursor mass measured at high_accuracy possible glycopeptides can be deduced more recently higher_energy collision dissociation and electron_transfer modes of fragmentation have been introduced as alternatives or in combination with the ion_trap based cid mode on the ltq_orbitrap hybrid platform to improve the sensitivity and confidence of glycopeptide identification in all automated data analysis scoring_scheme is crucial to find the best glycopeptide from multiple candidates derived from ms spectra especially for unknown protein with multiple glycosylation_sites or complex sample most of the computational_tools do provide this functionality either using probability based function such as binominal distribution or deterministic statistics such as weighted_average of important features associated with glycan composition and peptide backbones recently we have developed a computational suite called sweet heart which implements a novel scoring_scheme based on a supervised machine_learning algorithm to first identify the glycosylation of intact n glycopeptides and then to further deduce the mass values of respective peptide backbones for further sequencing by either targeted multi_stage mass_spectrometry ms or electron_transfer experiments sweet heart requires no prior_knowledge of glycan or peptide mass input and was shown to outperform currently available tools in its ability to process iontrapbased cid data at higher sensitivity_and especially in global proteomic applications supervised machine_learning allows for systematic pattern identification from a large set of features in the training_dataset and minimizes manual tuning for optimal model generalization which is well suited for an unbiased analysis of ms data and has been widely_applied for identification of protein_sequences phosphorylation modification metabolite fingerprinting and biomarkers machine_learning such as linear support_vector and logistic_regression have been used to facilitate glycosyl compositional annotation and scoring of released glycans at ms level based on known glycan compositions but not yet adapted to distinguish the correct isomeric or isobaric entities from all possible peptide and glycan combinations which requires tandem_ms analysis for instance the mass of hexoseneuac is identical with fucoseneugc deamidation on peptide also confuses the assignment between fucose and neuac or between fucosehexose and neugc because of introduction of isobaric mass difference the obstacle for intact glycopeptide identification using supervised machine_learning on lc_ms data is insufficient number of high confident spectral_data for model training as ion fragmentation_patterns of glycopeptides vary in different ms instrument ionization and fragmentation techniques it is not easy to obtain enough training data with comparable ms technologies from public domains for model_building here we describe a strategy to dynamically improve the supervised machine_learning algorithm random_forest implemented in sweet heart through the increment of high confident n glycopeptide spectral_data collected from previous model_predictions with reciprocal model improvement we aim for the flexibility of model optimization to enhance automated glycopeptide discovery with high_sensitivity and precision
