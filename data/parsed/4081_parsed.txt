rseqflow workflows for rna_seq we have developed an rna_seq analysis workflow for single ended illumina_reads termed rseqflow this workflow includes a set of analytic functions such as quality_control for sequencing_data signal tracks of mapped_reads calculation of expression levels identification_of and coding snps calling this workflow is formalized and managed by the pegasus workflow management system which maps the analysis modules onto available computational_resources automatically executes the steps in the appropriate order and supervises the whole running process rseqflow is available as a virtual_machine with all the necessary software which eliminates any complex configuration and installation steps with the recent technological breakthroughs in the study of the whole transcriptome rna_seq have been generated to decipher characterize and quantify the set of all rna_molecules produced in cells readalignment tools and gene_expression estimation tools have been developed to analyze millions of reads generated from mrna sequencing and to determine the expression_level however the majority of these tools have focused on single functions resulting in the frequent incompatibility of data interfaces among different tools therefore integrating these tools into an overall computation or a workflow is critical for downstream rna_seq recent works on rna_seq analysis_pipelines include ingap rseqtools and arrayexpresshts each of them offers a subset of common rna_seq analytical functions that are organized
