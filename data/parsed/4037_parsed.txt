gene_expression rna_seq analysis in mev rna_seq is an exciting methodology that leverages the power of high_throughput to measure rna_transcript counts at an unprecedented accuracy however the data generated from this process are extremely_large and biologist friendly tools with which to analyze it are sorely lacking multiexperiment viewer mev is a java_based desktop_application that allows advanced analysis of gene_expression data through an intuitive graphical_user here we report a significant_enhancement to mev that allows analysis of rna_seq with these familiar powerful_tools we also report the addition to mev of several rna_seq specific functions addressing the differences in analysis requirements between this data type and traditional gene_expression data these tools include automatic conversion functions from raw count_data to processed rpkm or fpkm values and differential_expression detection and functional_annotation enrichment detection based on published_methods availability mev version is written in java and is freely_available for download under the terms of the open_source artistic license version the website_http mev tm org hosts a full user_manual as well as a short quick start guide suitable for new users rna_seq profiles the transcriptome the complete set of transcripts in a cell using high_throughput deep_sequencing this technique compares_favorably to previously used methods for gene_expression measurement such as dna_microarrays because of its higher sensitivity lower background and ability to detect previously_unknown transcripts however the base_pair level resolution of this sequencing based method generates volumes of data that are difficult to process and analyze on desktop computers this massive scale of data output presents a problem for biologists with little access to big iron computer resources and the programming_skills required to use them the first part of this problem already in large part addressed by the bioinformatics community is that of processing storing and retrieving vast_amounts of raw_sequencing quantifying it and mapping it to the genome applications such as bowtiecounts per transcript are converted to rpkm values automatically and vice_versa using the rpkm method described in the application framework makes it easy to add other data_formats as the community develops new standards for rna_seq once the data have been loaded and annotated it can be analyzed using both existing_tools and new modules that address rna seqspecific issues such as transcript length and abundance biases there are three differential_expression methods based on the bioconductor_packages deseq dgeseq and edger that analyze differential_expression using rna_seq specific statistics for the user the transition from array to sequence_data analysis is seamless as these modules are built on the same user_interface that has made mevs methods widely accessible since most scientists are interested in understanding the functional differences in gene_expression between experimental_groups we also created a module based on goseq a bioconductor_package that tests for enrichment of gene_lists these algorithms allow mev to account for rna_seq specific data biases such as transcript length bias in which more reads are mapped to longer transcripts and selection_bias the overdetection of highly_expressed transcripts in addition users can apply the now standard analysis functions in expression analysis such as hierarchical_clustering k_means t tests analysis_of anova ease the david algorithm and many others heatmap displays gene_expression graphs and tabular listings are all included in the standard mev data displays gene level annotation is linked to appropriate online_databases such as entrez and gene_ontology and can be accessed with simple hyperlinks genes of interest can be labeled and compared with one another and stored as basic gene identifier lists or as tab_delimited files containing expression data for analysis in other applications
