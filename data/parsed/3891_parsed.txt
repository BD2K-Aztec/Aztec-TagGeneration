raxml version a tool for phylogenetic_analysis and post analysis of large phylogenies motivation phylogenies are increasingly used in all fields of medical and biological_research moreover because of the next_generation revolution datasets used for conducting phylogenetic_analyses grow at an unprecedented pace raxml randomized axelerated maximum_likelihood is a popular program for phylogen etic analyses of large_datasets under maximum_likelihood since the last raxml paper in it has been continuously maintained and extended to accommodate the increasingly growing input datasets and to serve the needs of the user community results i present some of the most notable new features and extensions of raxml such as a substantial extension of substitution models and supported data types the introduction of sse avx and avx vector intrinsics techniques for reducing the memory_requirements of the code and a plethora of operations for conducting post analyses on sets of trees in addition an up to date page user_manual covering all new raxml options is available raxml randomized axelerated maximum_likelihood is a popular program for phylogenetic_analysis of large_datasets under maximum_likelihood its major strength is a fast maximum_likelihood tree search algorithm that returns trees with good likelihood scores since the last raxml paper it has been continuously maintained and extended to accommodate the increasingly growing input datasets and to serve the needs of the user community in the following i will present some of the most notable new features and extensions of raxml
