fishingcnv a graphical software_package for detecting rare copy_number in exome_sequencing rare copy_number cnvs are frequent causes of genetic_diseases we developed a graphical software_package based on a novel approach that can consistently identify cnvs of all types homozygous_deletions heterozygous deletions heterozygous duplications from exome_sequencing without the need of a paired control the algorithm compares coverage depth in a test sample against a background distribution of control samples and uses principal_component to remove batch_effects it is user_friendly and can be run on a personal computer availability_and the main scripts are implemented in r and the gui is created using java it can be run on all major operating_systems a non gui version for pipeline implementation is also available the program is freely_available online https sourceforge net_projects fishingcnv many sporadic and mendelian_disorders are caused by exonic mutations that alter the amino_acid of the affected gene exome_sequencing has so_far shown great utilty in elucidating single_nucleotide that contribute to these diseases however using exome_sequencing to detect rare copy_number cnvs that contribute to diseases remain a challenge we developed fishingcnv a graphical software_package for comprehensive analysis of cnvs in exome_sequencing we included a matched case_control feature adapted from exomecnv but more importantly we implemented a new cnv_detection algorithm that prioritizes rare_variants for nonmatched sample analysis many sequencing centers have by now accumulated large internal sets of exome samples that can be used as controls for cnv_detection in new unmatched samples our method relies on pooling such a control set comparing the exonic read_depth of the test sample against the distribution of read_depths in the control set to remove batch to batch variations in the control set we applied principal_component pca and removed the top contributing principal_components from the data we bundled gatk into our program to extract coverage_information read depth_information is then converted to reads per kilobase per_million rpkm and the test sample is segmented into regions of similar rpkm ratios using circular_binary cbs before comparison against the control distribution the output is a file that contains segmented cnv_calls ranked by statistical confidence see supplementary_materials for details on method we tested our algorithm on simulated and actual exome data and show that it is effective in identifying homozygous as well as heterozygous cnvs of varying length we also show that principal component removal is effective in reducing false_positives a summary of the program workflow is presented in we compared our algorithm against exomecnv and conifer and show that fishingcnv consistently outperforms previous_approaches see supplementary_materials for data we believe that looking for rare cnvs in exome_sequencing can be a powerful way of detecting new disease_causing
