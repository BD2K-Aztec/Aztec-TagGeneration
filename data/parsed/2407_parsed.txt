genome_analysis improving translation_initiation and stop_codon recognition by using more than two classes motivation the recognition of translation_initiation sites and stop_codons is a fundamental part of any gene recognition program currently the most successful methods use powerful classifiers such as support_vector with various string kernels these methods all use two classes one of positive instances and another one of negative instances that are constructed using sequences from the whole_genome however the features of the negative sequences differ depending on the position of the negative samples in the gene there are differences depending on whether they are from exons introns intergenic_regions or any other functional part of the genome thus the positive class is fairly homogeneous as all its sequences come from the same part of the gene but the negative class is composed of different instances the classifier suffers from this problem in this article we propose the training of different classifiers with different negative more homogeneous classes and the combination of these classifiers for improved accuracy results the proposed_method better accuracy than the best state of the art method both in terms of the geometric mean of the specificity and sensitivity and the area_under and precision_recall curves the method is tested on the whole human_genome the results for recognizing both translation_initiation sites and stop_codons indicated improvements in the rates of both false_negative fn and false_positive fp on an average for translation_initiation recognition the false_negative ratio was reduced by and the fp ratio decreased by for stop_codon prediction fp were reduced by and fn by availability_and the source_code is licensed under the general_public and is thus freely_available the datasets and source_code can be obtained from http cib uco es site recognition the recognition of translation_initiation sites tiss and stop_codons is one of the most critical tasks for gene structure_prediction most successful current gene recognizers first implement a step of site recognition which is followed by a process of combining the sites into meaningful gene structures this first step is of the utmost_importance because the program cannot find genes whose functional sites are not identified furthermore a large number offp results might inundate the second step of the programs making_it to predict accurate gene structures the best current approaches use powerful classifiers namely support_vector svms and moderately_large sequences around the functional site in accordance with common practices in machine_learning these methods construct a positive instance set using sequences that contain true tiss or stop_codons and a negative instance set in the negative instance set the sequences centered around an atg triplet are not tiss and the sequences centered around tag taa or tga triplets are not stop_codons the negative sequences are obtained from all the available information or are randomly_selected when sampling is used thus negative sequences can be part of intergenic_regions introns exons utrs etc however the negative sequences from these different regions have different features therefore the negative class which the classifier must learn is highly non homogeneous this inhomogeneity is an unnecessary difficulty that the learning algorithm must face and that might damage its performance in this article we show how the performance of the classifier can be actually improved if the negative instances are divided_into different classes based on their position in the gene subsequently different classifiers are learned for each pair of positive_and instance sets some previous_works have also considered the idea of differentiating between functional sites before proceeding to their recognition tritisa is a method for detecting tiss in microbial_genomes that classifies all candidate tiss into three categories based on evolutionary properties and characterizes them in terms of markov_models also other methods have developed different models depending on the structure and composition of the sequences to recognize however these approaches are different from ours as these models are trained and used separately instead of combined as in our proposal in this article we presented a new approach for tis and stop_codon recognition this approach uses more than one classifier divides the negative class into four different groups and trains one classifier for each type of negative class this approach was applied to the recognition of tis and stop_codons in five human_chromosomes the approach was compared with the best current method for tis and stop_codon prediction the proposed approach also has the advantage of its simplicity which makes it easily applicable to any program for tis or stop_codon recognition the reported results show that the proposed method shows improved_sensitivity specificity auroc and auprc compared with svmwd the results show a remarkable improvement in the ratio of fn and fp achieved over those of svmwd because state of the art annotation systems rely heavily on the accurate prediction of the functional sites of the gene the proposed method is an effective way of improving current gene recognizers the table shows the values
