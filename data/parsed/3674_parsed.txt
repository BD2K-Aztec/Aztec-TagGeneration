prediction of novel pre micrornas with high_accuracy through boosting and svm high_throughput deep sequencing_technology has generated an unprecedented number of expressed short_sequence presenting not only an opportunity but also a challenge for prediction of novel micrornas to verify the existence of candidate micrornas we have to show that these short_sequences can be processed from candidate pre micrornas however it is laborious and time consuming to verify these using existing experimental_techniques therefore here we describe a new method mird which is constructed using two feature selection_strategies based_on svms and boosting method it is a high_efficiency tool for novel pre microrna prediction with accuracy up to among different species availability mird is implemented in php perl mysql r and can be freely accessed atmicrornas short rnas nt that perform their functions by guiding mrna transcriptional degradation or translational suppression have various functions in organ_development for example they mediate switching of chromatin_remodeling in neural_development and participate in transcriptional circuits that control skeletal_muscle gene_expression and embryonic_development increasingly evidencepage mird has two applications in pre microrna prediction i giving the probability of a candidate pre microrna to be a real one and ii extracting the probable pre micrornas from deep sequencing_data to demonstrate how to use the mird web_server we submitted a sample data in fasta_format as an example the default_parameters for feature selecting strategy minimal free_energy of the secondary_structure and paired nucleic_acid number were selected as shown in the prediction results contain the probabilities of submitted candidate sequence to be real pre microrna information such as the secondary_structure and the minimum_free users can also submit files containing shortread sequences or information of read locations on the genome the candidate pre mirna sequences will be extracted from the submitted data mird will then analyze these candidate pre mirna sequences and return results as shown in
