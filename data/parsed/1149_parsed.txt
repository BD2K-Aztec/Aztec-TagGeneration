gene_expression contamde differential_expression of rna_seq for contaminated tumor_samples motivation accurate detection of differentially_expressed between tumor and normal samples is a primary approach of cancer related biomarker identification due to the infiltration of tumor surrounding normal cells the expression data derived from tumor_samples would always be contaminated with normal cells ignoring such cellular contamination would deflate the power of detecting de genes and further confound the biological_interpretation of the analysis results for the time being there does not exists any differential_expression approach for rna_seq in literature that can properly account for the contamination of tumor_samples results without appealing to any extra_information we develop a new method contamde based on a novel statistical_model that associates rna_seq expression levels with cell_types it is demonstrated through simulation_studies that contamde could be much more powerful than the existing_methods that ignore the contamination in the application to two cancer studies contamde uniquely found several potential therapy and prognostic_biomarkers of prostate_cancer and non_small availability_and an r package contamde is freely_available atthe primary goal of the ordinary differential_expression de analysis methods is to distinguish biological_variation between various conditions from technical effects and random noises since the clinical tumor_samples obtained from patients are usually infiltrated with surrounding normal cells the traditional de analysis cannot distinguish the expression variability resulting from the shifts in cell_specific versus the cell proportion variation if the cellular contamination is ignored ignoring the cellular contamination could also greatly lower the power of de analysis several experimental methods aiming at dissecting multiple distinct cell_types have been developed to eliminate the effects caused by contamination such as laser_capture and cell_sorting however these methods are expensive time consuming and may introduce new confounders computational_approaches addressing the contamination issue could avoid such problems thus are much desired the following linear equation is commonly used to model the microarray expressions of contaminated tumor_cells where t t c and t n represent the expression_profile of the contaminated tumor_cells obtained by experiments and those of the underlying tumor component and normal component respectively w is the pure tumor_cell proportion in each contaminated tumor sample shared by all genes while is the random error rna_seq are inherently different from microarray_data and there is very limited work in literature focusing on the contamination issue for rna_seq with a couple of exceptions li and xie used an online expectationmaximization algorithm to quantify the expression levels of purified tumor transcripts in a probabilistic fashion for better understanding the abundance of the tumor transcripts gong and szustakowski developed a quadratic_programming method to obtain sub cell proportions by utilizing significantly_differentially of homogeneous samples as a prior the above methods are subject to several limitations if they are used in de analysis first it is hard to account for the variability of the purified expression_profiles in the downstream de analysis second requiring extra_information in the above methods greatly limits their applicability since the extra_information is expensive to obtain in practice third additional bias could be introduced if the extra_information is not accurate to our best knowledge there is no statistical_method in literature that can properly account for the contamination of tumor_samples in de analysis using rna_seq and we aim to fill this gap in this article we propose a new method contamde which is based on a novel statistical_model for associating gene_expression and cell_types based on this model a rigorous and efficient statistical_method is developed for de analysis using rna_seq from contaminated tumor_samples and normal samples in contamde the normalized proportions of tumor_cells in contaminated tumor_samples are estimated and de analysis can be consequently carried_out the new method contamde has several unique features first contamde does not require any extra_information that might be expensive to obtain in practice second the developed algorithm is computationally_efficient third contamde provides a unified procedure for de analysis which avoids the necessity of accounting for the variability of purified expression_profiles required in the existing_methods the rest of this article is organized as follows the technical_details of the new method contamde are described in section some simulation_studies and five real_data applications are provided in section and section respectively to demonstrate the advantage of contamde over the existing_methods some concluding_remarks and future_research topics are presented in section in this article we present a rigorous and efficient de detection method contamde using rna_seq from contaminated tumor_samples where the tumor_samples could be either matched or unmatched with normal samples unlike most existing_methods contamde does not require extra_information the normalized proportions reflect relative contamination intensities of the contaminated tumor_samples and the true proportions can be estimated if some pathology information or dna_sample is available the proposed normalized proportion estimator was evaluated through both simulation_studies and experimental numerical mixture data through both simulation_studies applications undo an existing deconvolution algorithm originally designed for arraybased data without using additional information performed well only when the samples were pure and d or the two samples used for deconvolution were perfectly_matched undo in in more practical situations undo either greatly overestimated the proportions undo in figs and a or had a much larger variance than contamde in the presence of contamination contamde were shown through simulations to greatly outperformed the benchmarks edger and deseq that ignored the contamination in terms of both powers and false_discovery in the absence of contamination contamde performed comparably with edger and deseq in the application to a prostate_cancer study and a lung_cancer study contamde returned more biologically_meaningful de genes that were closely_related to cancers compared with edger and deseq an r package implementing contamde can be downloaded from http homepage fudan edu cn zhangh softwares which can be used to estimate the normalized contamination proportions of contaminated tumor_samples to conduct pseudo likelihood_ratio for detecting de genes between tumor_samples and normal samples and to estimate fold changes using a desktop computer with a ghz cpu it took contamde no more than minutes to analyze all considered real_datasets revealing that the computational_burden of contamde was quite acceptable
