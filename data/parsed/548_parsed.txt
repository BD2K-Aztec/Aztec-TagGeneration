a statistical physics perspective on alignment independent protein_sequence comparison motivation within bioinformatics the textual alignment of amino_acid has long dominated the determination of similarity between proteins with all that implies for shared structure function and evolutionary descent despite the relative success of modern day sequence_alignment so_called alignment_free approaches offer a complementary means of determining and expressing similarity with potential benefits in certain key applications such as regression_analysis of protein structure_function where alignment base similarity has performed_poorly results here we offer a fresh statistical physics based perspective focusing on the question of alignment_free comparison in the process adapting results from first passage probability distribu tion to summarize statistics of ensemble averaged amino_acid propensity values in this article we introduce and elaborate this approach determining the similarity between macromolecules is central to bioinformatics while comparison of dimensional macromolecular structures remains an active area most work focuses on macromolecular sequences from sequence_similarity devolves much of our understanding of evolutionary homology and probable structural and functional relatedness allowing sequences to be grouped in a meaningful way it is the basis of inherited or inferred functional_annotation allowing us to deduce the broad function of proteins in newly_sequenced similarity is determined almost exclusively through the alignment of sequences as text textual sequence_similarity is taken as a surrogate for common_ancestry and by extension functional and structural_similarity most approaches to protein_sequence use models of sequence_evolution and compare amino_acid strings searching for linear conservation of sequence sequence_alignment where equivalent or near equivalent symbols are brought into register has been investigated intensely for many decades and thus an enormous associated literature has accumulated typically substitution matrices specify a score for aligning pairs of nucleotides_or in such matrices different amino_acids or nucleotides score differently according to the potential likelihood that one will replace the other in a sequence for amino_acids many matrices have been published based on many rationales including the genetic_code and amino_acid physicochemical_properties most commonly used matrices are typically derived empirically from exhaustive comparison of known sequences or structures the log odds matrices derived from the pam model of protein evolution was for many years the most widely used statistical results indicate such matrices adopt an implicit log odds form with a specific target distribution for aligned residue pairs the sensitivity of protein_sequence searching depends on the selection of appropriate substitution matrices blosum and other commonly used matrices constructed from particular sets of related proteins are tailored to target frequencies reflecting implied standard background amino_acid the analysis of sequence_similarity is the cornerstone upon which much of bioinformatics is built hitherto alignment based_approaches have completely dominated work in this area while other approaches of which there are several have been examined with much less thoroughness yet the need for effective approaches able to transcend the limitations of text matching is clear if not widely_appreciated the protocol described here takes propensity plots produced from the scales in aaindex averages them and generates a single value characteristic of a whole sequence our implementation is in essence an out of the box application of existing results with immense potential for future refinement we have applied here a well understood statistical_method from stochastic mathematics using it to interpret and identify independent clusters in protein sequence_data our approach introduces a fundamentally new way to represent sequences which is nonetheless founded on the long_standing concept of propensity scales and capitalizing on features of this representation we have used it to power a novel approach to clustering this method is able to capture much of the overall structure of a propensity plot in a single but discriminatory and self consistent value many properties of a protein are encoded within its sequence in a subtle and recondite manner not amendable to direct identification through sequence_alignment or the recognition of characteristic sequence_motifs likewise the discovery of functionally_similar but sequence distinct proteins may be frustrated by a lack of ostensive similarity to proteins of known provenance in such a situation alignment dependent approaches may produce ambiguous results or fail completely there are many examples where structural or functional_similarities are readily apparent experimentally yet are difficultif not impossibleto detect from textual sequence_alignment perhaps the most obvious are the so_called twilight and midnight zones most protein_sequences will fold into unique dimensional structures and similar sequences will typically have similar structures sequence_alignments can routinely distinguish between sequence pairs known to have similar or non similar structures when the sequence_identity is greater than this unequivocal signal becomes lost at sequence_identity the so_called twilight zone alignment_methods often fail to align paired amino_acids correctly even with identity structural_alignment has revealed many many examples of so_called structural superfamilies where proteins with less than identity nonetheless retain structural propinquity the average identity between all sequence pairs of related structures is and this marks the midnight zone which is predominantly populated by protein_structures that have become similar by convergent_evolution thus we need to apply our approach to a variety of both solved and unsolved_problems to explore its value solved problems_include searching within and beyond the twilight zone and to classify and identify structural and functional_relationships within it effectively it is imperative to explore alternative_approaches to pairwise similarity and blast statistics unsolved problems_include clustering whole genomes where the result is unknown and is complicated by the presence of multi_domain internal repeats etc the development of regression_models using our order parameter_values as descriptors and a surrogate of sequence searching using order values to define similarity_measures in protein design there is a need to move beyond making piecemeal changes to extant sequences to identify wholly new sequences with new functions and structures effective alignment_free approaches should allow us to address such issues particularly through the development of properly grounded regression approaches to protein sequence_analysis there are many examples of such approaches the proteochemometric analysis of protein_sequences van the prediction of candidate_vaccines b and the successful assignment of bacterial_proteins to various subcellular_locations regression approaches typically require three viable components an induction engine based on multivariate statistics such as pls or a machine_learning algorithm data to be modeled which can be quantitative or categorical in nature and an appropriate data representation data modeling_methods have reached sufficient maturity and data_quality is constrained by its availability on a case by case basis so increasingly it is the choice of data representation that is the crucial arbiter of success this is especially true for protein regression which lags far behind equivalent work for small_molecules alignment independent similarity_measures such as our representation offer an interesting and seemingly productive avenue for achieving progress in this endeavor to go beyond sequence_motifs and profiles hmms and like methodologyand thus identify common function structure and evolutionnew distinct yet complimentary methods must be devised alignment_free that can work with textual alignment to identity similarity manifest as shared structure and function in this article we have used results from statistical physics to address alignment_free comparison adapting results from first passage probability_distribution to derive a single summary value able to differentiate sequence groups with high_accuracy at several levels of granularity this approach is potential highly_robust being largely independent of fluctuation in the tunable parameters we anticipate that this approach will ultimately take its place alongside textual alignment as a strongly complimentary method for sequence_analysis with many advantages compared to conventional techniques
