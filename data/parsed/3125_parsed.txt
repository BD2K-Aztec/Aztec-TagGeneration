systems_biology msprep summarization normalization and diagnostics for processing of mass_spectrometry based metabolomic_data motivation although r packages exist for the pre_processing of metabolomic_data they currently do not incorporate additional analysis steps of summarization filtering and normalization of aligned data we developed the msprep r package to complement other packages by providing these additional steps implementing a selection of popular normalization algorithms and generating diagnostics to help guide investigators in their analyses availability http www sourceforge net_projects msprepthe primary goal of the msprep package is to prepare metabolomics_data for advanced statistical_analysis by automating the processing of datasets and generating diagnostic graphs the initial processing of liquid_chromatography coupled_with lcms data is covered by a variety of software_packages provided by instrument manufacturers and a number of open_source packages such as xmsanalyzer xcms and mzmine while these manage the initial data pre_processing of peak_detection chromatogram building alignment and quantification they often lack functions for further processing we designed the msprep package to complement existing software by providing additional processing_tools and statistical and graphical tools for evaluation of different methods as there are no universally_accepted procedures the package provides implementation of a variety of novel and previously_published the primary functions of the msprep package are summarization of replicates filtering imputation of missing_data normalization and or batch_effect adjustment and dataset diagnostics an operator difference dataset was generated by the reisdorph mass_spectrometry laboratory at national jewish health three technicians performed all steps of sample prep for profiling of a base human_plasma sample containing six spiked in control compounds at concentrations of x x and x and two negative controls at x in all samples pre_processing was performed in agilents mass hunter software for summarization the cv cutoff was set at there were compounds of compounds that were present in all replicates but above this cutoff of these all but one fit the pattern of two consistent observations and one outlier the data were filtered at present in all subjects which resulted in compounds the bpca imputation was used to maintain a gaussian_distribution and allows application and evaluation of all normalization_methods owing to the design we expect compounds to be consistently measured between subjects with the only detected differences occurring in the six compounds that were spiked into the datasets thus all other differences are due to the batch operator effect as shown in the sva normalization method was the most effective at controlling false_positive while reducing the operator effect for this dataset based on a linear_model of the log abundances while the operator effect is still apparent in the pca plot of the sva adjusted data in supplementary the lower percentages and rmse inrepresents an improvement over the other methods the msprep package is designed to help investigators prepare their datasets for analysis while reducing the amount of manual processing of datasets and generating useful diagnostic aids our package complements existing pre_processing methods such as xmsanalyzer and the output is in a format ready for input to leading software such as metaboanalyst to perform clustering and other downstream_analyses the sva routine provided the best performance when applied to the dataset presented but it is important to note the strengths_and of each routine and in our experience no single method is best in all circumstances we encourage users to examine the diagnostic plots generated by the package to compare different methods for their datasets
