sequence_analysis compmap a reference based compression program to speed up read_mapping to related reference_sequences exhaustive mapping of next_generation data to a set of relevant reference_sequences becomes an important task in pathogen discovery and metagenomic classification however the runtime and memory_usage increase as the number of reference_sequences and the repeat content among these sequences increase in many applications read_mapping time dominates the entire application we developed compmap a reference based compression program to speed up this process compmap enables the generation of a non redundant representative sequence for the input_sequences we have demonstrated that reads can be mapped to this representative sequence with a much reduced time and memory_usage and the mapping to the original reference_sequences can be recovered with high_accuracy availability_and compmap is implemented in c and freely_available atin pathogen discovery or metagenomic classification applications curating databases that correspond to a certain taxonomic rank e g species or genus and assign next_generation ngs_reads to these taxa are fundamental tasks the number of redundant reference_sequences strains or contigs corresponding to different taxa varies largely as the result of different a priori research_interests for example there are sequences corresponding to the species of salmonella_enterica that causes salmonellosis whereas only one reference_genome is available for bradyrhizobium sp ors generating a non redundant representation of each taxon would alleviate this bias and by aligning_reads to this non redundant sequence memory_usage and runtime could be largely reduced in particular in applications where exhaustive read placements to highly_similar strains or species are required and the multi mapped_reads could reach of the overall input read_mapping time dominates the entire application genomemapper was an early attempt to reduce redundant read_mapping to multiple homogenous sequences relying on the existing knowledge of polymorphism information without the external_information and the assumption of homogeneity we developed a program compmap that relies on compression although compression techniques have been widely used on ngs_data transmission and storage there is a lake of bioinformatic programs like compmap that can directly use the compressed data and recover the original results if necessary compmap is a reference based compression program designed to reduce redundancies in a given set of related reference_sequences either heterologous or homogenous by identifying recording and eliminating repetitive subsequences a reduced sequence was obtained to serve as a non redundant representation of the original input ngs_reads are then mapped to this reduced sequence and if needed the original mapping results can be recovered compmap shows good performance in the experiment of ngs read_mapping to bacterial_genomes the case studies show that compmap allows researchers to speed up ngs short_read while maintaining comparable accuracy the saving of time and space is in proportion to the size of ngs files and the similarity among reference_sequences compmap is simple yet efficient it can be readily used along with other tools for ngs_data analysis with no or few modifications
