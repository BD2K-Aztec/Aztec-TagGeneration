databases_and fungifun a comprehensive online resource for systematic analysis of gene_lists from fungal_species systematically extracting biological meaning from omics_data is a major_challenge in systems_biology enrichment_analysis is often used to identify characteristic_patterns in candidate lists fungifun is a user_friendly web_tool for functional_enrichment of fungal genes and proteins the novel tool fungifun uses a completely revised data management system and thus allows enrichment_analysis for currently available fungal_strains published in standard databases fungifun offers a modern web_interface and creates interactive tables charts and figures which users can directly manipulate to their needs availability_and fungifun examples and tutorials are publicly_available at https elbe hki jena de fungi form an extremely diverse kingdom of organisms with different lifestyles and interesting human applications fungi are not only important to produce food but also produce bioactive_compounds known as secondary_metabolites which are important for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries on the other hand there are many pathogenic_fungi that destroy crops and infect humans the growing amount of omics_data from the fungal community will help to identify virulence_factors as well as interesting bioactive_compounds enrichment_analysis is often applied along with omics_data analysis here candidate_genes proteins are assigned to categories from structured vocabularies ontologies afterward statistical_tools help to identify those categories that are significantly_enriched with the given candidates these enriched categories may represent molecular_functions pathways or cellular locations most affected by the experiment a number of easy to use online tools exist e g yeastmine and are reviewed in however no user_friendly online tool for the systematic analysis of long candidate lists existed for most fungal_species our group implemented the tool fungifun supporting enrichment_analysis for species with a focus on fungal_pathogens in this article we present the novel tool fungifun which allows the systematic analysis of candidate lists from all the currently available fungal_strains published in standard databases users can choose from strains of species for data_collection fungifun uses a semi_automatic procedure which downloads gene to category associations and annotations names and functions from online_databases this procedure allows the database to be kept up to date and simplifies the addition of further species in comparison to the previous version which worked with flat files for annotations fungifun parses annotation into a standardized database allowing higher data connectivity and flexibility e g alternative input identifiers ids gene_annotation and complex search queries finally fungifun offers a modern and user_friendly interface illustrates the three functional ontologies that are integrated into fungifun i e gene_ontology go kyoto_encyclopedia kegg and functional catalogue funcat r upp et_al funcat gene to category associations were downloaded from mips through the pedant database for go several data source have been used candida genome_database cgd aspergillus genome_database aspgd saccharomyces genome_database sgd uniprot goa project at european_bioinformatics ebi and ensembl fungi additionally we included go gene to category associations by applying blast go to do so proteomes were obtained from broad ncbi or in house data finally kegg gene to pathway associations were obtained from the kegg ftp server with the help of a semi_automatic procedure all available strains in the used databases are listed each strain may have different data_sources where the preferred version needs to be manually selected afterward flat files are automatically downloaded and parsed into a mysql_database using python and r scripts these scripts guarantee that the database stays upto date with only small effort currently ontologies formed by funcat kegg and go were downloaded from nine different sources primarily obtained from ebi go gene protein to category association is available for strains funcat gene protein to category association is available for strains finally kegg_pathway association is available for strains to whom correspondence should be

user_interface to run fungifun users need to chose a strain select an ontology supply the tool with a list of candidate ids and choose a p value cutoff after strain selection the user may check for available alternative ids only those ontologies can be used for which annotation is currently available advanced options allow for alternative p value calculations and multiple test corrections for upload of a background list for in exclusion of categories and for the selection of go evidence codes illustrates main aspects for the calculation of enriched categories as well as results graphs and tables on the server side a php script parses user input controls calculations of statistics graphs and tables and finally creates data for the result page p values indicating the significance of the enrichment are calculated with fishers_exact or hypergeometric_test multiple test correction may be performed e g via fdr the r package ramigo is used to visualize significantly_enriched go categories within the go hierarchy bar pie and column charts are created with help of the javascript_library highcharts whereas customizable result tables are created with javascript_library datatables illustrates parts of the results of a fungifun run each output can be customized directly in the web_interface as well as downloaded in commonly used formats the number of enriched categories as well as the number of genes within enriched and non enriched categories give an overview of the results specific pie and bar charts allow users to visualize the number of genes in the significant categories compared with the number of genes in the input list finally graphs highlighting enriched categories within the hierarchies of the ontologies are available results are displayed in tables focusing on categories or genes which can be interactively rearranged and filtered funding j l and s p were supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft dfg crc transregio pathogenic_fungi and
