genetics_and hitwalker variant_prioritization for personalized functional cancer_genomics determining the functional_relevance of identified sequence_variants in cancer is a prerequisite to ultimately matching specific_therapies with individual patients this level of mechanistic_understanding requires integration of genomic_information with complementary functional_analyses to identify oncogenic targets and relies on the development of computational frameworks to aid in the priori tization and visualization of these diverse data types in response to this we have developed hitwalker which prioritizes patient variants relative to their weighted proximity to functional assay results in a proteinprotein_interaction it is highly extensible allowing incorporation of diverse data types to refine prioritization in addition to a ranked_list of variants we have also devised a simple shortest_path based_approach of visualizing the results in an intuitive manner to provide biological_interpretation availability_and the program documentation and example data are available as an r package from www biodevlab org hitwalker html the advent_of technology such as that available from illumina provides an unprecedented ability to interrogate individual_genomes accompanying technologies such as the ability to multiplex samples as well as efficient sequence capture technologies further enable targeted_regions of the genome to be re sequenced at a reasonable cost per sample in this manner specific genes or whole exomes can be interrogated to identify variants potentially having a deleterious impact on protein_coding efficacy of this approach for clinical research has been shown through the discovery of variants underlying simple mendelian_disorders as well as more complicated variants mutations involved in cancer and potentially complex_traits because many variants are produced for a given sample mechanistic and population_genetic assumptions are often used to reduce the set of variants for instance limiting attention to non_synonymous variations as well as using the use of variant databases such as dbsnp and the genomes_project the genomes_project enables researchers to focus on lowfrequency variants that are potentially_damaging however even after these filters it is relatively infrequent that a researcher is left with a manageable set of variants for biological_validation for cancer_cells derived from a given patient functional_assays can be performed that allow researchers to determine the relevance of genes to cell_viability such as through the use of targeted sirna screens these gene_targets can be scored using a binary or quantitative encoding that indicates outlier status relative to other samples similarly screens that measure the sensitivity of a patients cells to a panel of small_molecules can be scored relative to genes using the known gene_targets of each compound these functional_assays by themselves provide some information to researchers on the identity of the signalling_pathways that are required for cancer growth and survival however they do not necessarily indicate the mutated gene s leading to dysregulation of these signalling_pathways as the true causative variant s could be found in any gene with capacity to regulate the pathway to prioritize variants detected in our cohort of leukaemia patients relative to our functional assay results we have devised the r and sql framework hitwalker using a proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network as a backbone in addition to a ranked_list of variants hitwalker also allows for simple visualization of the relevant subnetwork as well as overlaying relevant meta_data our software provides a flexible framework for prioritizing variants relative to functional assay outcomes and a ppi_network or other association graph using an rwr algorithm in addition we include visualization of key subnetwork members to aid in biological_interpretation prioritized variants can then be followed up using sanger_sequencing as well as additional experiments to categorize their phenotypic effect software_developers can easily modify queries and r functions for their in house databases and functional_assays although mysql is our database of choice any other r dbi supported database would work with minor modifications to the r code
