structural_bioinformatics nmre a web_server for nmr protein_structure refinement with high_quality structure validation scores protein_structure refinement is a necessary step for the study of protein_function in particular some nuclear_magnetic nmr structures are of lower_quality than x_ray here we present nmre a web_based server for nmr_structure refinement the previously_developed knowledge based energy function stap statistical torsion_angle potential was used for nmre refinement with stap nmre provides two refinement protocols using two types of distance_restraints if a user provides noe nuclear_overhauser data the refinement is performed with the noe distance_restraints as a conventional nmr_structure refinement additionally nmre generates noe like distance_restraints based on the inter hydrogen distances derived from the input structure the efficiency of nmre refinement was validated on nmr structures most of the quality_assessment scores of the refined nmr structures were better than those of the original structures the refinement results are provided as a three_dimensional structure view a secondary_structure scheme and numerical and graphical structure validation scores availability_and nmre is available at http psb kobic re kr nmre the determination of three_dimensional d protein_structures is an important challenge in structural_biology because structure is closely_related to function nmr nuclear_magnetic is one method of protein structure_determination and it also provides information about the dynamics of proteins however protein_structures determined_by are of lower_quality than x_ray structures thus refinement is a necessary step in nmr_structure study three nmr_structure refinement databases have been constructed dress a database of refined solution nmr structures recoord recalculated coordinates database and stap statistical torsion_angle potential nmr_structure refinement using the noe nuclear_overhauser distance data obtained by nmr is performed in many refinement studies however noe distance data exist in various formats such as cyana cns and xplor therefore noe data manipulation is difficult for general researchers another problem in improving nmr structures is the ambiguity and sparseness of noe data the nmre web_server provides simple and fast nmr_structure refinement with noe like distance data using thenmre refinement was tested on structures obtained from pdb that have both nmr and x_ray structures supplementary the x_ray structures were used as a reference for measuring backbone similarity the structure quality was measured using backbone similarity noe violation and structure validation scores supplementary tables s and s and supplementary in the nmre dist the tm_score was increased from to and three energy scores dope ndope and ddfire were stabilized the clash score was also improved from to the ramachandran score and several parameters of the what check z_score were significantly_improved in the nmre noe in particular the procheck ramachandran score was improved from to in supplementary table s comprehensive noe restraint violations were reported the number of violated noe root_mean rmsd and maximum noe violation were improved in nmre noe however nmre dist has a slightly_increased noe restraints violation in comparison with original because the experimental measurement of noe distance may have a distance error of a these results are not regarded as a serious defect additionally we demonstrated that dihedral_angle restraints do not contribute much in this protocol supplementary one of example target l s and comparison of the performance between the nmre and other known refinement protocols are described in supplementary_information
