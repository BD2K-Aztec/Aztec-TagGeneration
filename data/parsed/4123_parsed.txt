sbml tikz supporting the sbml render extension in l a t e x motivation the sbml render extension enables coloring and shape_information of biochemical_models to be stored in the systems_biology sbml rendering of this stored graphical information in a portable and well supported system such as t e x would be useful for researchers preparing documentation and presentations in addition since the render extension is not yet supported by many applications it is helpful for such rendering functionality be extended to the more popular celldesigner annotation as well results sbml tikz supports automatic generation of graphics for biochemical_models in the popular t e x typesetting system the library generates a script of t e x macro commands for the vector_graphics languages pgf tikz that can be compiled into scalable_vector described in a model availability source_code documentation and compiled binaries for the sbml tikz library can be found at http www sbml tikz org in addition a web_application is available at http www sys bio org layoutthe systems_biology sbml is an extensible format for storing biochemical_models sbml promotes model exchange and longevity and has become widely supported by numerous software_tools in order to augment model data stored in sbml with graphical information a render extension specification was proposed to enable the storing of coloring and shape_information the sbml render extension is currently supported by a collection of libraries written by frank bergmann which can generate images in png bmp and pdf format http sbmllayout sf net in addition to exactly rendering sbml render extension information these libraries are also capable of assigning systems_biology styles sbgn to existing model layout and rendering information sbgn is an increasingly popular standard notation for representing models such support is similarly seen in tools such as arcadia and celldesigner that automatically render sbgn in addition to the png bmp and pdf formats supported by bergmanns libraries the svg format is supported as well to whom correspondence should be addressed via a stylesheet written by ralph gauges http otto bioquant uniheidelberg de sbml sbml tikz extends existing support for the sbml render extension to t e x by generating a script of macros for pgf tikz pgf tikz are a pair of languages for creating vector_graphics through t e x macros http tug ctan org tex archive graphics pgf base doc generic pgf pgfmanual pdf these macros are translated by the pgf tikz interpreter into images in the pdf or ps format the benefit of having a t e x intermediate is the ease it allows graphics to be integrated with text within a t e x document instead of relying on imported images a graph can be embedded within a document as a t e x script that is converted to a resolution independent image during document compilation once the image is compiled it can be used in other documents as well the ubiquity of t e x support and extensive documentation on pgf tikz syntax http www texample net tikz makes it possible for users to quickly edit rendering information post file generation this adds a layer of flexibility to graphics generation since users can now modify their graphics outside of whichever modeling environments were used to create the sbml file at the same time less experienced t e x users are insulated from the pgf tikz commands since sbml tikz performs all essential rendering functions such as scaling page size_selection and accurate graph generation automatically sbml tikz enables rapid and automatic generation of t e x encoded graphics from sbml files with layout and rendering information a variety of examples and tutorials as well as downloads for the application and its source_code available under the new bsd_license can be found at http sbml tikz org
