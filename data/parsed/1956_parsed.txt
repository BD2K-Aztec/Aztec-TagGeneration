genome_analysis gene and translation_initiation prediction in metagenomic_sequences motivation gene prediction in metagenomic_sequences remains a difficult problem current_sequencing do not achieve sufficient coverage to assemble the individual_genomes in a typical sample consequently sequencing runs produce a large number of short_sequences whose exact origin is unknown since these sequences are usually smaller than the average length of a gene algorithms must make predictions based on very little data results we present metaprodigal a metagenomic version of the gene prediction program prodigal that can identify genes in short anonymous coding_sequences with a high degree of accuracy the novel value of the method consists of enhanced translation_initiation identification ability to identify sequences that use alternate genetic codes and confidence values for each gene call we compare the results of metaprodigal with other methods and conclude with a discussion of future improvements metagenomes from environmental_samples can contain thousands of species and often cannot be sequenced to sufficient coverage to assemble each individual genome even with enough coverage the correct binning and assembly of the various sequences still present many challenges making it likely that at least for the immediate future metagenomic_sequencing will continue to produce a large number of small contigs assessing the performance of metagenomic gene prediction_tools remains a difficult_task due to the lack of experimentally_verified gene_sets tools such as metagene annotator metagenemark orphelia and fraggenescan have compared their predicted results with genbank annotations by using this method complete_genomes from refseq are sampled to a certain level of coverage at various fragment sizes either with or without simulated errors and the predicted results are compared with the positions of the genbank annotated_genes in the fragments unfortunately this methodology has one significant drawback since the gene calls in refseq have not been experimentally_verified it is likely some of them are incorrect error_rates have been shown to be greater in genomes containing high_gc in addition some translation_initiation predictions are likely to be incorrect as well which could have an impact on gene predictions as fragment sizes become smaller nonetheless the chosen genomes represent a good cross_section across bacteria archaea and all levels of gc_content therefore we decided to analyze the results of metaprodigal on the genome set from the metagenemark publication according to the same standards described previously
