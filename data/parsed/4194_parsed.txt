genetics_and seqchip a powerful method to integrate sequence and genotype data for the detection of rare_variant associations motivation next_generation greatly_increases the capacity to detect rare_variant complex_trait associations however it is still expensive to sequence a large number of samples and therefore often small_datasets are used given cost constraints a potentially more powerful two step strategy is to sequence a subset of the sample to discover variants and genotype the identified_variants in the remaining sample if only cases are sequenced directly combining sequence and genotype data will lead to inflated type i errors in rare_variant analysis although several methods have been developed to correct for the bias they are either underpowered or theoretically invalid we proposed a new method seqchip to integrate genotype and sequence_data which can be used with most existing rare_variant tests results it is demonstrated using both simulated_and that the seqchip method has controlled type i errors and is substantially more powerful than all other currently available methods availability seqchip is implemented in an r package and is available atthere is solid_evidence that rare_variants play_an in the etiology of complex_traits the development and implementation of next_generation in genetic_studies of complex_traits have made possible the detection of rare_variant associations however it is still very expensive to sequence a large number of samples at high coverage depth which is necessary to accurately detect rare_variants for association studies instead of sequencing all samples a two stage strategy can be applied where a subset of the sample is sequenced to discover variants and the identified_variants are then genotyped in the remaining sample genotyping currently is considerably less to whom correspondence should be addressed expensive than sequencing therefore given a fixed budget a twostage design can be much more powerful than a one stage design where only sequencing is used this is because for the same financial expenditure genetic_information from a much larger number of samples can be extracted and analyzed in a two stage study in fact the two stage study_design has been widely_applied many rare_variant associations were identified for a number of clinically_important traits including colorectal_adenomas age_related lipids level and inflammatory_bowel in a two stage study candidate_genes that were previously implicated in the etiology of complex_trait through genome_wide or functional studies may be sequenced to identify rare_variants it was demonstrated that sequencing cases can uncover variants that can explain over of the locus population_attributable when more sophisticated methods are used for selecting samples e g calculating expected number of causal_variants for each individual and sequencing the individuals with the maximal counts it is potentially possible to enrich for causal_variants using a smaller sample_size than if samples are randomly_selected to make the two stage design cost_effective for large_scale studies the commercially_available exome chip can also be customized and up to variants can be added alternatively custom genotyping_arrays can also be developed for the two stage study_design integrating sequencing and genotyping it was shown that for a fixed number samples sequenced sequencing only cases can be more powerful than sequencing a balanced number of cases and controls for detecting associations with causal_variants that are enriched in cases this is because a larger portion of low_frequency causal_variants can be identified by sequencing only cases however it has also been shown that type i errors will be inflated for two stage studies where only cases are sequenced to discover variants and nave analysis is implemented which directly integrates sequence and genotype data and compares aggregated variant frequencies between cases and controls a straightforward correction is to exclude the sequence_data used for variant discovery and use only the genotyped samples in the downstream association analysis gso genotype samples only however this approach does not make full use of the available data and is underpowered especially when a large portion e g of affected_individuals are sequenced for variant discovery in the authors suggested removing one variant carrier from thein this article we developed a data_integration method for twostage case_control where a portion of cases are sequenced to discover variants and the identified_variants are genotyped in the remaining sample the seqchip method performs a correction on the variant genotypes observed in sequenced cases such that the corrected sequence genotypes follow approximately the same distribution as that of the genotyped samples the integrated dataset can be analyzed by all existing rare_variant tests that can handle genotypes with uncertainties e g imputed genotypes seqchip can also be used with regression based_methods for detecting primary_or traits associations lin and zeng where confounders such as population substructures can be controlled through extensive simulations we demonstrate that when seqchip is used to integrate sequence and genotype data all rare_variant tests have controlled typei errors the power can be substantially improved compared with using other data_integration strategies i e rops and gso the method is mainly developed for combining sequence and genotype data when only cases were sequenced for variant discoveries a popular alternative two stage study_design is to sequence a combination of selected cases and controls for variant discovery and genotype the identified_variants in the rest of the samples under this study_design sequenced and genotyped samples can be separately analyzed and combined using standard metaanalyses methods which will have controlled type_i when both cases and controls are sequenced protective variants for the disease phenotype may be uncovered with higher probability for a two stage study that combines sequence and genotype data given a small fixed number of samples that are sequenced sequencing only cases can be more powerful for detecting causal_variant associations than sequencing a balanced number of cases and controls in practice it is of interest to know the optimal fraction of cases to sequence to maximize power although sequencing a larger number of samples allows discovering a higher number of variant sites it does not necessarily lead to improved power this is because the frequencies of very rare_variants identified in sequenced cases can be slightly underestimated by rops and seqchip methods which reduces power the optimal number depends on the underlying_disease model the size of the cohort and the proportion of the cases that are sequenced which will need to be examined on a case by case basis although the cost of sequencing is quickly dropping genotyping still has a clear cost advantage the two stage study_design of sequencing cases and genotyping the remaining sample allows extracting genetic_information from a much larger number of samples which can be more powerful than one stage study_design given a fixed cost constraint seqchip is a very useful method for integrating data in a two stage study_design and will greatly accelerate the process of identifying variants involved in complex_trait etiologies
