data_and apcluster an r package for affinity propagation clustering affinity propagation ap clustering has recently gained increasing_popularity in bioinformatics ap clustering has the advantage that it allows for determining typical cluster members the so_called exemplars we provide an r implementation of this promising new clustering technique to account for the ubiquity of r in bioinformatics this article introduces the package and presents an application from structural_biology availability the r package apcluster is available via cranthe comprehensive_r http cran r project org_web apcluster contactaffinity propagation ap is a relatively new clustering_algorithm that has been introduced by ap clustering determines a so_called exemplar for each cluster that is a sample that is most representative for this cluster like agglomerative clustering ap has the advantage that it works for any meaningful measure of similarity between data samples unlike most prototypebased clustering_algorithms like e g k means ap does not require a vector space structure and the exemplars are chosen among the observed data samples and not computed as hypothetical averages of cluster samples these characteristics make ap clustering particularly suitable for applications in bioinformatics i many similarity_measures used in bioinformatics cannot be linked to explicit vectorial descriptions e g sequence or structure alignment scores ii the opportunity to identify a small set of exemplars provides new potentials for exploratory_analysis of biological data ap clustering has been used successfully for clustering microarray_gene in structural_biology biological network_analysis and sequence_analysis to date no r implementation has been available in order to leverage affinity propagation for bioinformatics applications we have implemented affinity propagation as an r package along with visualization_tools for analyzing the results to whom correspondence should be addressed
