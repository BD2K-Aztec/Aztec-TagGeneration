inter functional analysis of high_throughput phenotype data by non parametric clustering and its application to photosynthesis motivation phenomics is the study of the properties and behaviors of organisms i e their phenotypes on a high_throughput scale new computational_tools are needed to analyze complex phenomics data which consists of multiple_traits behaviors that interact with each other and are dependent on external_factors such as genotype and environmental_conditions in a way that has not been well studied results we deployed an efficient framework for partitioning complex and high_dimensional phenotype data into distinct functional_groups to achieve this we represented measured phenotype data from each genotype as a cloud of points and developed a novel non parametric clustering_algorithm to cluster all the genotypes when compared with conventional clustering_approaches the new method is advantageous in that it makes no assumption about the parametric form of the underlying data distribution and is thus particularly suitable for phenotype data analysis we demonstrated the utility of the new clustering technique by distinguishing novel phenotypic patterns in both synthetic data and a high_throughput plant photosynthetic phenotype dataset we biologically verified the clustering_results using four arabidopsis chloroplast mutant_lines the plummeting cost of genome_sequencing has ushered genomics into a new era however using genomics data alone is insufficient to answer most major questions in biology because genomics data cannot explain how genes control complex behaviors the next wave in biology will be to phenotype organisms and then integrate genomes with phenomes to identify genes that may govern phenotype and responses to the varying environment especially progress in phenotyping technologies is required to accelerate genetic_mapping and gene_discovery in genome_wide for dissecting the genetic_architecture of important traits underlying phenotypes it thus is important to develop computational_methods to examine potentially interacting phenotypes i e measurable traits behaviors of a genetically diverse_population for a given species in order to identify meaningful differences in biological_function the database phenomicdb has been built to collect phenotypes of multiple species in free_text format with the goal to gain insights into the genetic_origin of diseases phenoclustering was then v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com proposed to perform meta_analysis on phenomicdb using advanced natural_language methods resulting in clusters of genes by the similarity of their phenotypes that can be further explored for genotypephenotype interaction analysis however since high_throughput phenotyping quantitatively assesses multiple_phenotypes of many traits simultaneously it often generates a large amount of data rather than qualitative descriptions new approaches to analyze quantitative phenomics data are needed one application is in bioenergy research where computational_techniques have been developed to detect collect and study photosynthesis and related traits such as growth under non laboratory conditions and in high_throughput in general photosynthesis phenotypes can be altered in two ways either through the changes of peripheral processes of the photosynthesis regulatory_network or the modification of central components of the network changes in peripheral processes tend to preserve regulatory_relationships within the network in contrast altering the central components of photosynthesis is likely to perturb the relationships between key regulatory_processes leading to a different correlation among photosynthesis phenotypes in this study we focus on data analysis for the second case to which we refer as inter functional analysis for photosynthesis phenotypes data by taking_advantage of the systematic knockout of genes_encoding chloroplast targeted proteins in arabidopsis_thaliana a model plant we have conducted a large_scale phenotype screen on the single knockouts and the references to understand the underlying molecular_functions of the knockout genes in plant photosynthesis in our experiment plants with single gene_knockouts have been profiled by non_invasively measuring three key photosynthetic parameters i e ii q e and q i that reflect photosynthesis efficiency in photosystem_ii active energy_dissipation and photoinhibition respectively in response to fluctuating light conditions resulting in a large_volume of plant phenotyping data that allow us to determine the downstream_effects of the knockout genes on photosynthesis in dynamic conditions more specifically multiple fluorescence_images are taken for every plant as the light_intensity is varied over time and the photosynthesis parameters are derived from each image as a result each plant is characterized by a sequence of three_dimensional vectors with each dimension corresponding to a different photosynthesis parameter the objective of this study is to automatically identify gene groups with their photosynthesis phenotypes significantly different from reference based on the collected data a natural first step is to examine the extremes i e mutant_lines that exhibit significantly different photosynthesis characters from the wild_type in all of the three photosynthesis parameters although this simple technique has been shown to be effective for identifying potential biomarkers and drug_targets it is not an effective approach for exploiting the full potential of experimental_results in this work we take a holistic_approach for inter functional photosynthesis data analysis we develop an efficient workflow to effectively_identify novel phenotypes based on mutant_lines sharing similar measurements of photosynthesis parameters the identified gene groups and their associated phenotypes are used to derive insight into the functions of and interactions between related genes based on existing annotations and literature for the well studied genes we can associate biological_processes with each phenotype pattern which in turn can be used to reveal the functions for the poorly_characterized genes although numerous clustering_algorithms have been developed most of them require vector representation of data and thus cannot be applied directly to our problem where each plant is represented by a sequence of vectors one simple way to handle the challenge is to run standard clustering_algorithms e g k means and hierarchical_clustering against all the vectors measured for different plants and determine the cluster member for each plant by taking the major vote among the measured vectors another approach is to concatenate the sequence of vectors measured for each plant into a single vector and apply standard clustering_algorithms to the derived vectors the main_problem with these two approaches is that they are unable to effectively explore the correlation among different photosynthesis parameters revealed by the set of vectors measured for each plant this is particularly important for photosynthesis data analysis because it is the correlation between photosynthesis parameters that helps understand the regulatory_role of the mutated genes on the photosynthesis processes we propose to address the above challenges of phenotype data analysis by developing a novel clustering technique named non parametric modeling or npm for short we introduce a the process of extracting data from photosynthesis phenotype experiment a a series of fluorescence_images b the derived photosynthesis parameters ii light q e q i for two genotypes i e mutant_line at g and the wild_type used as reference under dynamic environmental_conditions c the photosynthesis parameters of the same plants in d space ii light refers to a more advanced photosynthesis parameter named linear electron flux cloud of points representation for each mutant_line with each point corresponding to a vector in the sequential phenotype measurements taken for the mutant_line where the correlation among photosynthesis parameters is captured by the shapes of clouds based on the theory of kernel_density kde we then apply a nonparametric clustering technique to group plants into the same cluster if their clouds share similar shapes when compared with the existing clustering_algorithms the key_advantage of npm is that it does not make any assumption about the underlying data distribution and thus is particularly suitable for phenotype data analysis our empirical study shows promising results of the proposed clustering technique on both synthetic and real photosynthesis datasets we have biologically verified the clustering_results using four arabidopsis mutant_lines for nuclear_encoded chloroplast proteins the experimental_results demonstrate that npm is able to generate testable_hypotheses which lead to new biological discoveries we emphasize that although our empirical study is limited to photosynthesis data the non parametric clustering_algorithm developed in this work is general and can be applied to other domains e g gene_expression sophisticated phenomics measurements are becoming increasingly important for the discovery of important_biological and genes due to the complexity of phenomics datasets the conventional clustering_approaches often fail to identify genes of distinguished functions because they have to make parametric assumptions about the underlying data distribution there is thus an urgent need for new tools to analyze large and complex phenomics datasets the npm method presented here represents an important advance over existing clustering_algorithms because it avoids the parametric assumption of data distribution a demonstration of our method on plant photosynthesis data shows that the proposed technique is effective in capturing mutant_lines with similar photosynthesis profiles in comparison to the conventional clustering_algorithms such as k means and hierarchical_clustering in the future we plan to further improve our analysis by i conducting biochemical_experiments to validate novel genes with the new phenotypes and experimental_verification of
