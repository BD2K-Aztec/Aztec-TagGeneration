pep scaffolder using homologous_proteins to scaffold genomes motivation recovering the gene structures is one of the important goals of genome_assembly in low quality assemblies and even some high_quality assemblies certain gene regions are still incomplete thus novel scaffolding approaches are required to complete gene regions results we developed an efficient and fast genome scaffolding method called pep scaffolder using proteins to scaffold genomes the pipeline aims to recover protein_coding structures we tested the method on human contigs using human uniprot proteins as guides the improvement on n size was increase with an accuracy of pep scaffolder improved the proportion of fully covered proteins among all proteins which was close to the proportion in the finished genome the method provided a high_accuracy of using orthologs of distant_species tested on simulated fly contigs pep scaffolder outperformed other scaffolders with the shortest running time and the highest_accuracy identifying genes is a major_goal of genome_sequencing for downstream functional study and evolutionary_analysis although large insert libraries or long single_molecule reads improve the genome n size it remains difficult to complete all gene structures thus new scaffolding approaches are needed to recover the gene regions many methods have been developed to increase the continuity of gene regions using transcripts or proteins as guides utilized paired rna_seq to scaffold caenorhabditis nematode contigs nevertheless the accuracy of this strategy and the improvement in the proportion of complete genes were not estimated previously we developed l rna scaffolder using long single_end rna_seq for genome scaffolding which was highly_accurate however these strategies require rna_seq and genes that are not detected by rna_seq will not be re built different from using transcripts esprit and swips used proteins to link contigs based on the predicted genes using augustus esprit identified split protein_coding and linked unassembled genomic_segments the accuracy of esprit depends on that of predicted genes the time consuming nature of de_novo gene prediction also limits its application swips determined coding contigs and exonic_regions using tblastn and genewise and then scaffolded contigs by optimization of the overall protein to contig mappings swips integrated multiple_steps to refine the precise protein contig mapping consequently it has long running time herein we present a novel and fast method to scaffold contigs using homologous_proteins the pep scaffolder has high scaffolding accuracy and is much faster than previous scaffolders the improved proportion of fully covered genes is close to that of the finished genome the performance of pep scaffolder was measured using the n size using human swiss_prot proteins as test guides the n sizes were saturated when the mpi was the mlc and the mil kb supplementary figures s s and s using these optimal parameters the final n sizes were bp a increase and bp a increase for human swiss_prot proteins and trembl proteins respectively supplementary tables s and s using human swiss_prot and trembl proteins as guides the contig number was reduced from to the improvement on n size was increase at an accuracy of which demonstrated the good performance of pep scaffolder in a revised assembly where the scaffolds were split at error points the corrected n size had an improvement of increase the proportion of fully covered proteins in the pep scaffolder assembly was higher than the proportion in the contigs and nearly equal to that for hg in particular the proportion of fully covered proteins over amino_acids showed a larger improvement from to a increase than did shorter proteins indicating that pep scaffolder greatly_improved the proportion of complete genes pep scaffolder was able to scaffold human contigs using orthologs of distant_species using rodent swiss_prot proteins mammal swissprot proteins rodent trembl proteins and mammal trembl proteins we obtained improvements on n size of and respectively supplementary tables s and s the accuracy was as high as indicating that pep scaffolder could utilize orthologs to scaffold a target_genome with high_accuracy more genome_regions covered by proteins would generate longer scaffolds to examine the improvement on n size with increasing numbers of proteins we constructed multiple sets of proteins by combining human proteins mammal proteins and rodent proteins together the n size and corrected n size were improved to and bp a increase and increase respectively using all proteins as guides supplementary indicating that an enlarged proteome could increase the proportion of recovered genes we scaffolded fly contigs using swips esprit and pep scaffolder respectively pep scaffolder produced the most connections with the highest_accuracy and the shortest running time minutes and supplementary suggesting that pep scaffolder is superior to the other scaffolders we demonstrated that pep scaffolder is an efficient and fast scaffolder that improves the proportion of complete genes the performance of pep scaffolder could be improved in several ways protein variations between species might influence the accuracy of pep scaffolder we observed higher accuracy using proteins from the target species compared with proteins from close species supplementary tables s and s the annotations of swiss_prot proteins are created by manual_analysis whereas trembl proteins are predicted automatically without manual_annotation therefore swiss_prot proteins are more credible than trembl proteins our results showed that using swiss_prot proteins the accuracy of pep scaffolder was higher than using trembl proteins supplementary tables s and s to overcome the above limitations werecommend that more supporting proteins are used to construct more accurate scaffolds supplementary methods and as shown in supplementary scaffolding performance is significantly correlated with genome_coverage therefore increasing the number of homologous_proteins would improve the performance pep scaffolder could be useful for the genome_analysis of nonmodel species which lack high_quality genome_assemblies
