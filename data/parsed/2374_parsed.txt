improved sequence_based prediction of disordered_regions with multilayer fusion of multiple information_sources motivation intrinsically_disordered play_a in numerous regulatory_processes their abundance and ubiquity combined with a relatively low quantity of their annotations motivate research toward the development of computational_models that predict disordered_regions from protein_sequences although the prediction quality of these methods continues to rise novel and improved predictors are urgently_needed results we propose a novel method named mfdp multilayered fusion based disorder predictor that aims to improve over the current disorder predictors mfdp is as an ensemble of support_vector specialized for the prediction of short long and generic disordered_regions it combines three complementary disorder predictors sequence sequence_profiles predicted_secondary solvent_accessibility backbone dihedral torsion_angles residue flexibility and b factors our method_utilizes a custom_designed set of features that are based on raw predictions and aggregated raw values and recognizes various types of disorder the mfdp is compared at the residue_level on two datasets against eight recent disorder predictors and top performing methods from the most recent casp experiment in spite of using training chains with similarity to the test sequences our method consistently and significantly_outperforms the other methods based on the mcc index the mfdp outperforms modern disorder predictors for the binary disorder assignment and provides competitive real valued predictions the mfdps outputs are also shown to outperform the other methods in the identification of proteins with long disordered_regions the intrinsically_disordered idps also referred to as unstructured proteins lack stable tertiary_structure under physiological_conditions in vitro the idps play_a in transcriptional_regulation translation and cellular_signal their prevalence was also implicated in various human_disorders including the neurodegenerative_diseases such as huntington parkinsons and alzheimers_disease however the functional role of idps is not as well understood when compared with the well packed proteins importantly the annotations of the disorder lag behind the rapidly_accumulating number of known to whom correspondence should be addressed protein_chains to compare the curated disprot database includes little over chains the pdb database that allows finding unstructured segments in the solved tertiary_structures which are assumed to be equivalent to disordered segments includes proteins while the overall number of known protein_chains is million the disorder is frequently observed in regions with low sequence complexity and with low content of hydrophobic amino_acids which would often form a core of a folded globular protein these and other sequence characteristics can be used to differentiate between disordered and ordered regions which in turn implies that disorder is predictable from the sequence the past_decade observed development of a number of computational_models for the prediction of the disordered_regions these methods allow for high_throughput annotations of protein_chains which provide a viable solution to close the annotation gap these predictors could be categorized into four groups i methods based on relative propensity of amino_acids to form disorder ordered regions which include globplot iupred foldindex and ucon ii methods built utilizing machine_learning such as dispro disopred disopred prdos poodles poodle l poodle w spritz dispssmp dispssmp iup norsnet and ond crfs iii methods based on a metaapproach which combines predictions from multiple base predictors including recent md metaprdos gs metadisorder j bujnicki unpublished_data and multicom and iv methods based on analysis of predicted d structural_models such as disoclust since the sequence_based disorder predictors are biannually assessed and compared during the critical assessment of structure_prediction casp experiments although the prediction quality continues to rise as shown in the most recent casp improved prediction_methods are still urgently_needed we propose a novel architecture named mfdp multilayered fusion based disorder predictor that aims to improve the overall quality of the prediction when compared with modern_methods we analyze and quantify improvements provided by mfdp for a generic prediction of all disordered segments and also for the prediction of long disordered segments the latter is motivated by recent results that show that long disordered_regions are useful for target_selection for structure_determination of integral_membrane punta they are implicated in proteinprotein recognition and were found helpful in prediction of protein crystallization propensity the mfdp is based on four novel ideas first motivated by the observation that combining orthogonal predictors is helpful we fuse four complementary disorder predictors this is in contrast to earlier ensemble based_solutions that combined predictors selected in an ad_hoc manner when compared to the recently_proposed orthogonal ensemble based md predictor we consider different aspects to judge dissimilarity md combines four predictors that tackle different types of disorder while we combine three methods that differ in their approach to perform predictions we use a machine_learning predictor disopred residue propensity based iupred and a recent disoclust that is based on tertiary_structure predictions i e prediction based on the sequencederived tertiary_structure the usage of the d based predictor is the novel aspect of our ensemble we select disopred since it was demonstrated to provide high_quality predictions and to be orthogonal to other machine_learning based_methods the iupred provides two models that specialize in prediction of long and short disordered_regions respectively the disoclust utilizes a premise that ordered residues should be conserved in d space in multiple models whereas residues that vary or are consistently missing are correlated with the disorder it predicts per residue error in multiple fold_recognition models which is followed by an analysis of the conservation of the per residue errors across all models second we use the most comprehensive selection of the input information_sources when compared with the recent methods similar to md dispro and multicom we use the sequence_profiles the most widely used inputs predicted_secondary ss disordered_regions are characterized by lack of ss and solvent_accessibility unstructured regions have a large solventaccessible area we also utilize sequencebased predictions of backbone dihedral torsion_angles b factor which are associated with disordered_regions and the sequence terminus indicator similarly to prdos the usage of the backbone angles is motivated by their usefulness in building scoring_function for fold_recognition and d structure_prediction and by the success of the d based disoclust that ranked fourth in casp we tried predictions of signal_peptides but we did not find them useful third we aggregate the predictions before feeding them into a classifier using a sliding_window to facilitate predictions of longdisordered regions the aggregation utilizes neighboring predictions to perform averaging to find maximal and minimal prediction value probability and to analyze local ss conformations which helps the classifier to find longer stretches of disordered residues fourth we use two layered architecture where the first layer includes three predictors one designed for all disordered residues one for short residues and one for long segments these predictors use different inputs encoded using numerical descriptors derived from the abovementioned sources the second layer combines their outputs to generate our disorder predictions mfdp is capable of recognizing various types of disorder since it is trained using a dataset that includes residues from disordered_regions of all sizes and that combines proteins from the disprot database and x_ray structures from the pdb
