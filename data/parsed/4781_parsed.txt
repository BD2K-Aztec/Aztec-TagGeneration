uncovering the co evolutionary network among prokaryotic genes motivation correlated events of gains_and enable inference of co evolution relations the reconstruction of the co evolutionary interactions network in prokaryotic species may elucidate functional_associations among genes results we developed a novel probabilistic methodology for the detection of co evolutionary interactions between pairs of genes using this method we inferred the co evolutionary network among clusters of orthologous_genes cogs the number of co evolutionary interactions substantially differed among cogs over were found to co evolve with at least one partner we partitioned the network of co evolutionary relations into clusters and uncovered multiple modular assemblies of genes with clearly defined functions finally we measured the extent to which co evolutionary relations coincide with other cellular relations such as genomic proximity gene_fusion propensity co expression proteinprotein_interactions and metabolic connections our results show that co evolutionary relations only partially overlap with these other types of networks our results suggest that the inferred co evolutionary network in prokaryotes is highly informative towards revealing functional_relations among genes often showing signals that cannot be extracted from other network types availability_and available under gpl license as open_source prokaryotic_genomes are highly_variable in their size comparative genomic_analyses revealed that variability in gene content among genomes is a major factor contributing to this size variability this substantial variability is mainly the result of gene acquisition via horizontal_gene hgt and gene loss e g as a result of reductive evolution gene content across genomes is compactly represented by phyletic patterns also known as phylogenetic profiles in which the presence_or of each cog clusters of orthologous_genes in each genome is represented as a binary character seefor details genes can have correlated evolutionary_histories this may reflect mutual dependency constraints e g when these genes correspond to proteins that are part of a complex detecting such co evolutionary interactions is important for understanding genome_evolution as a to whom correspondence should be addressed coordinated process rather than as a collection of single evolutionary descriptions of each gene for protein and rna evolutionary_studies a great_deal of effort was invested in developing tools that can detect co evolving sites e g the most accurate of these explicitly account for the phylogenetic_tree that generated these sequences these approaches in essence search for correlated evolutionary_events among sites i e at two co evolving positions the substitutions occur in a pattern that is different from that expected by chance for two independently evolving sites a similar approach can be used for the detection of co evolving genes in which gains_and tend to co occur in the same lineages accordingly perfectly correlated genes are co gained and co lost during their entire history methods to search for co evolving genes were previously_developed phylogeny based examples_include methods that employ the maximum_parsimony framework e g and methods that rely on explicit evolutionary_models of co evolution e g however using the maximum_parsimony criterion may be misleading in particular when there is substantial variability in branch_lengths furthermore we have previously shown that maximum_parsimony is less accurate for the inference of gain and lost events compared with model based_approaches ideally methods that rely on models that explicitly take into account co evolution among genes rather than methods that only use models to test for deviation from the independence_assumption should preferably be used however explicit modeling of co evolutionary interactions is currently too computationally extensive to allow the analysis of large_datasets such as those studied in this work here we present a novel probabilistic methodology to detect co evolutionary interactions from phyletic patterns we apply our methodology to analyze hundreds of genomes and thousands of cogs and provide novel insights into the co evolutionary_dynamics of genes across the bacterial domain
