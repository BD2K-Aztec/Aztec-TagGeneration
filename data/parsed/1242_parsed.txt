systems_biology cytospade high performance analysis and visualization of high_dimensional cytometry data motivation recent_advances in flow_cytometry enable simultaneous single_cell measurement of surface and intracellular_proteins cytospade is a high performance implementation of an interface for the spanning tree progression analysis of density normalized events algorithm for tree based analysis and visualization of this high_dimensional cytometry data availability source_code are freely_available cytospade org and via bioconductor version onwards for linux osx and windows cytospade is implemented in r c and java recent_advances in flow_cytometry enable simultaneous single_cell measurement of surface and intracellular_proteins with such instruments it is possible to measure in a single experiment enough markers to identify and compare functional immune activities across nearly all cell_types in the hematopoietic lineage however practical approaches to analyze and visualize cytometry data at this scale are only now becoming available proposed a novel algorithm termed spanning tree progression analysis of density normalized events spade which organizes cells into hierarchies of related_phenotypes the resulting hierarchies or trees facilitate visualization of developmental lineages identification of rare cell_types and comparison of functional markers across stimuli the spade algorithm has four phases density_dependent downsampling to increase representation of rare cell_types agglomerative clustering to identify related cells minimum_spanning construction to link those clusters and upsampling to assign previously removed cells to clusters spade has been successfully_applied to fluorescent and mass_cytometry data to single graphic as opposed to hundreds and to do so in the context of the underlying cytometry data alongside interactively gating researchers can use the cytoscape_plugin to manipulate the tree by moving nodes and changing the node color and size mappings create nested nodes that collapse uniform phenotypes into a single_node interactively view statistical_tests of parameter significance for groups of nodes and apply other visual or quantitative operations to the spade tree a researcher might use these various capabilities to identify different cell_types e g t cells and b cells and visually organize them in a familiar pattern as performed in then overlay various surface and functional parameters to quickly visually identify differential cell_populations or behavior that may be associated with a particular disease and explore the underlying flow_cytometry data for populations of interest to generate hypotheses for follow_up experiments or for analyses with other tools such as gemstone or flowclust the cytospade r package is a faithful implementation of the spade algorithm that also incorporates substantial performance_improvements and alternative optional implementations for specific components e g clustering cytospade builds on top of the widely used flowcore r package and thus incorporates the many different data transforms and visualization modalities it provides the r package is modular in design so that users can run the standard spade workflowdensity dependent downsampling clustering and tree construction and upsamplingor individual phases as needed examples of alternative workflows currently in use include assigning newly collected data to previously generated clusters or incorporating additional parameters such as time in tree construction the computationally_demanding components of the spade algorithm are implemented in c using openmp to enable multi_threaded execution as shown in the combination of a careful c implementation and multi_threaded execution results in a substantial speedup relative to the prototype implementation users can run cytospade on most datasets in just minutes if openmp is not available as is often the case on the windows platform cytospade will default to using a single core however even in single threaded mode the c implementation offers a significant performance improvement for spade users additional information about enabling openmp is available in the online documentation cytospade is a high performance modular and cross_platform implementation of the spade algorithm and an accompanying graphical_user source_code for cytospade are available under the gpl license from http cytospade org and as part of bioconductor release onwards documentation including the package
