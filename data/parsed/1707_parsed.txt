exploring the structure and function of temporal networks with dynamic graphlets motivation with increasing availability of temporal real_world networks how to efficiently study these data one can model a temporal network as a single aggregate static network or as a series of time specific snapshots each being an aggregate static network over the corresponding time window then one can use established methods for static analysis on the resulting aggregate network s but losing in the process valuable temporal_information either completely or at the interface between different snapshots respectively here we develop a novel approach for studying a temporal network more explicitly by capturing inter snapshot relationships results we base our methodology on well established graphlets subgraphs which have been proven in numerous contexts in static network research we develop new theory to allow for graphlet based analyses of temporal networks our new notion of dynamic graphlets is different from existing dynamic_network approaches that are based on temporal motifs statistically_significant subgraphs the latter have limitations their results depend on the choice of a null network model that is required to evaluate the significance of a subgraph and choosing a good null_model is non trivial our dynamic graphlets overcome the limitations of the temporal motifs also when we aim to characterize the structure and function of an entire temporal network or of individual nodes our dynamic graphlets outperform the static graphlets clearly accounting for temporal_information helps we apply dynamic graphlets to temporal age specific molecular_network data to deepen our limited knowledge about human_aging networks or graphs are powerful models of complex systems in various domains from biological cells to societies to the internet traditionally due to limitations of data_collection techniques researchers have mostly focused on studying the static network representation of a given system however many realworld systems are not static but change over time with new technological_advancements it has become possible to record temporal changes in network_structure or topology corresponding to arrival or departure times of nodes or edges examples of temporal networks include cellular functional brain person toperson communication online social or citation networks the increasing availability of temporal real_world networks while opening new opportunities has also raised new challenges for researchers namely despite a large arsenal of powerful_methods that already exist for studying static networks these methods cannot be directly applied to temporal networks instead the simplest approach to deal with a temporal network is to completely discard its time dimension by aggregating all nodes and edges from the temporal data into a single static network while this would allow to directly apply to the resulting aggregate network the existing and well established methods for static network_analysis such an aggregate or static approach loses all important temporal_information from the data to overcome this one could model the temporal network as a series of snapshots each of which is a static network that aggregates the temporal data observed during the corresponding time interval then with such a snapshot based network representation one could use a static temporal approach to study each snapshot independently via the existing_methods for static network_analysis and then consider time series of the results however this strategy treats each network snapshot in isolation and discards relationships between the different snapshots clearly both static and static temporal approaches overlook temporal_information that is important for studying a dynamic system therefore proper analysis of temporal networks requires development of novel strategies that can fully_exploit the temporal_information from the data this is the focus of our study as susceptibility to diseases increases with age studying human_aging is important however doing so experimentally is hard due to long lifespan and ethical constraints network research can be used to deepen current limited knowledge about human_aging that has been obtained mainly via other computational_methods e g analyses of gene_expression or sequence_data here we aim to complement existing static or static temporal faisal and milenkovic milenkovic network efforts to study human_aging with our new temporal approach constrained dynamic graphlets we already used a static graphlet based node centrality measure along with six other centrality_measures to study human_aging section faisal and milenkovic milenkovic because it is hard to experimentally obtain large_scale temporal molecular_network data due to limitations of biotechnologies for data_collection we integrated the current static proteinprotein_interaction of human with aging related gene_expression data to computationally infer temporal age specific network data then we predicted as agingrelated those genes whose network centralities significantly_changed with age in that study we computed centrality of each node in each snapshot and analyzed the time series of the results hence that was a static temporal approach the study resulted in the set of aging related gene_candidates which we called dynetage and which we validated in a number of ways here we use the same temporal age specific network data and apply our dynamic graphlets to this dataset to see whether we can improve the prediction quality i e gain additional aging related predictions compared with the static temporal dynetage approach also since the latter is quite different than our graphlet approaches from this study as it is based on the notion of changing node centralities and on multiple_measures of network_topology we also compare our dynamic graphlets to the static and static temporal graphlet approaches from the previous sections this allows for a fair evaluation of the effect on prediction_accuracy of the amount of temporal_information that each graphlet approach can consider
