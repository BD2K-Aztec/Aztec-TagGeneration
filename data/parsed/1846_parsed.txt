'flatten plus' a recent implementation in wsxm for biological_research scanning_probe spm is already a relevant tool in biological_research at the nanoscale we present flatten plus a recent and helpful implementation in the well known wsxm free software_package flatten plus allows reducing low_frequency noise in spm images in a semi_automated way preventing the appearance of typical artifacts associated with such filters since the introduction of scanning_tunneling stm byand later atomic_force afm scanning_probe spm the general denomination for these techniques has become a very relevant tool for the life_sciences research spm can be used to obtain atomically resolved images in different media including ultrahigh vacuum ambient_air and liquids spm allows the possibility to study biological_systems even in their native environment with unprecedented results spm is best known for its ability to acquire images but in reality spm also allows many other features as for instance manipulation of matter at the atomic nanometer_scale spectroscopy measurement of tipsample interactions or the characterization of mechanical_properties of relevant biological_entities including proteins cells and virus_particles spm images are acquired by scanning a very sharp tip on a region of interest the distance between the tip and the sample_surface is in the nanometer range as in many other techniques there are a number of artifacts that are commonly present even in the best acquired images noise due to different sources mechanical electrical environmental etc visible slopes in the main plane of an image or tipsample dilations thus the development and improvement of the available processing_tools becomes of great_importance to ease the visualization and interpretation of spm images biological_samples studied by spm typically consist of the biological_specimens immobilized to an atomically flat texture free_surface the way an spm is operated can make variations from scan line to scan line difficult to be avoided changes in the average height tilts or low_frequency noise thus processing filters such as plane and flatten filters are very common when analyzing spm images plane filters fit the raw_data image to a general plane or parabolic surface which is then subtracted from the original image however some issues in spm images such as vertical scanner drift scanner non linearities areas with different slopes or very different heights etc cannot be adequately corrected by plane filters flattenfeatures and therefore different heights if a line is basically flat and its average is subtracted the whole line will change the same way therefore it will remain uniform for example area within the gray rectangle in when a line contains very different heights and the average is subtracted the originally lower parts will be even lower this causes artificial negative contrast regions shadowing effects around the higher parts of the filtered image area within the black rectangle in there are some standard_tools to avoid these effects discard regions draw master paths etc however these processes can be tedious for images with a large number of features or are hard to put to practical use there are a good number of high impact journal publications where without discussing here the quality of the results there presented some of the published images show these shadowing effects some very recent_examples can be found in the following references wsxm is a free software devoted to the control of spm systems and processing of images and data acquired with such microscopes it was initially created at the new microscopies lab in the universidad autonoma de madrid uam then it continued growing at nanotec electronica sl and now it is maintained and developed by wsxm solutions www wsxmsolutions com a detailed view of wsxm can be found in here we explain in some detail the features of flatten plus an option recently_developed in wsxm that is particularly beneficial for biological data enabling in a semi_automated way to remove typical artifacts when applying common filters to process spm images we have introduced a relevant implementation in software techniques for spm flatten plus provides a semi_automated filter to eliminate low_frequency noise reflected as slopes bows and or bands in images preventing the appearance of undesired shadowing effects which is common in conventional flatten procedures
