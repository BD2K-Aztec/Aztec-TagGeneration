novel applications of multitask_learning and multiple output regression to multiple genetic trait prediction given a set of biallelic molecular_markers such as snps with genotype values encoded numerically on a collection of plant animal or human samples the goal of genetic trait prediction is to predict the quantitative trait_values by simultaneously modeling all marker effects genetic trait prediction is usually represented as linear_regression in many cases for the same set of samples and markers multiple_traits are observed some of these traits might be correlated with each other therefore modeling all the multiple_traits together may improve_the in this work we view the multitrait prediction_problem from a machine_learning angle as either a multitask learning_problem or a multiple output regression_problem depending on whether different traits share the same genotype matrix or not we then adapted multitask_learning algorithms and multiple output regression algorithms to solve the multitrait prediction_problem we proposed a few strategies to improve the least square error of the prediction from these algorithms our experiments show that mod eling multiple_traits together could improve_the for correlated_traits whole_genome prediction of complex phenotypic_traits using highdensity genotyping_arrays has attracted lots of attention as it is relevant to the fields of plant and animal breeding and genetic_epidemiology given a set of biallelic molecular_markers such as snps with genotype values typically encoded as on a collection of plant animal or human samples the goal is to predict the quantitative trait_values by simultaneously modeling all marker effects the problem is called genetic trait prediction or genomic_selection more specifically the genetic trait prediction_problem is defined as follows given n training samples each with m n genotype values we use feature marker genotype snp interchangeably and a trait value and a set of n test_samples each with the same set of genotype values but without trait value the task is to train a predictive_model from the training samples to predict the trait value or phenotype of each test sample based on their genotype values let y be the trait value of the training samples the problem is usually represented as the following linear_regression where x i is the ith genotype value m is the total number of genotypes and b i is the regression_coefficient for the ith genotype e l is the error term there have been lots of work on predicting genetic trait_values from genotype data such as rrblup ridge_regression blup elastic_net lasso ridge_regression bayes a bayes b bayes c p and bayesian_lasso as well as other machine_learning most of the work assumes that for each set of samples there is only one trait and therefore a single regression is conducted to predict the trait value however in reality it is quite often the case that we could observe and measure multiple_traits rather than one especially for crops and animals for example for plant dataset once we obtain a fruit we could measure its weight size etc this will give us multiple_traits obviously some v c the author published_by
