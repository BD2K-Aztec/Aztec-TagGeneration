genetics_and a quality_control algorithm for filtering snps in genome_wide the quality_control qc filtering of single_nucleotide snps is an important step in genome_wide to minimize potential false findings snp qc commonly uses expert guided filters based on qc variables e g hardyweinberg equilibrium missing proportion msp and minor_allele maf to remove snps with insufficient genotyping quality the rationale of the expert filters is sensible and concrete but its implementation requires arbitrary thresholds and does not jointly consider all qc features results we propose an algorithm that is based on principal_component and clustering analysis to identify low quality snps the method minimizes the use of arbitrary cutoff_values allows a collective consideration of the qc features and provides conditional thresholds contingent on other qc variables e g different msp thresholds for different mafs we apply our method to the seven studies from the wellcome_trust and the major_depressive study from the genetic_association information network we measured the performance of our method compared to the expert filters based on the following criteria i percentage of snps excluded due to low quality ii inflation_factor of the test_statistics iii number of false associations found in the filtered dataset and iv number of true associations missed in the filtered dataset the results suggest that with the same or fewer snps excluded the proposed algorithm tends to give a similar or lower value of a reduced number of false associations and retains all true associations genome_wide gwas have been shown to be a powerful and successful strategy in identifying genetic_variants to whom correspondence should be addressed that influence common and complex_diseases prior to the advent of gwas in there were only a few robust replicated associations identified such as nod for crohns_disease cd and pparg kcnj and capn for type_diabetes t d mellitus with gwas there are now more than loci identified for cd and almost loci for t d to date there are over published studies_reporting genetic_variants responsible for more than common diseases http www genome gov gwastudies gwas interrogate millions of single_nucleotide snps and the large_scale genotype_calling which translates probe hybridization intensities into actual genotypes must fully resort to automated clustering procedures ideally snp_genotyping yields three clusters of signals and a subjects genotype can be assigned according to cluster membership in reality the clustering_methods are unavoidably prone to error as imperfect clusters of signal clouds can arise due to experimental variation dna quality and nonspecific hybridization issues common error_patterns include missing calls for snps with overlapping genotype clusters homozygote heterozygote miscalls false homozygote calls in heterozygous individuals due to allelic dropout and erroneous assessment of monomorphic snps as polymorphic snp quality_control qc is commonly safeguarded by supervised i e expert guided filters to exclude low quality snps the supervised expert filters aim to remove snps that fall into the extremes of qc variables including hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe missing proportion msp and minor_allele maf the rationale is clear extreme deviation from hwe is typically used to identify gross genotyping error a high msp indicates poor genotype probe performance and low genotyping accuracy snps with low maf are more prone to error as fewer samples would be within a genotype cluster and most clustering based calling algorithms do not perform well with rare alleles however the implementation of expert filters tends to require arbitrary determination of cutoff_values for the qc variables and does not jointly consider all qc features for example in gain studies the minimum snp_genotyping quality_standards are hwe p value average msp page ensuring the quality of genotype data is essential for drawing accurate and replicable conclusions in this work we have introduced a qc algorithm to identify snps with low qc features using criteria determined through pca and dbscan the proposed filter is in essence an unsupervised i e algorithmdetermined version of the supervised expert filter to classify snps and it aims to account for multiple qc variables provides adaptive cutoff_values and automates thresholding decisions specifically we use pca to jointly_model the potentially highly_correlated qc page variables and use dbscan to identify the borders of good snp clusters that have arbitrary shapes the boundary of the good snp cluster can be translated directly to meaningful thresholds for the original qc variables the proposed algorithm retains the rationale of the expert filter to identify qc outliers avoids arbitrary decisions on cutoff_values and gives contingent msp thresholds for different maf values the data applications show that with the same or fewer snps discarded due to bad quality the proposed algorithm has comparable or better performance than the expert filter for all diseases the underlying rationale of our algorithm is that the majority of genotyped markers have sufficient genotyping quality and hence low quality snps can be treated as outliers and be identified by looking for snps with distinct qc features to facilitate the implementation of the idea we use pca on the original qc variables pca consolidates the information from the many correlated qc variables and projects snps onto a two_dimensional pc plane where good snps clump together into a corner of desirable qc values whereas bad snps fan out in all directions it is expected that the pc biplot may differ from one study to another in our exploration we have seen different patterns in the biplots for wtccc datasets and for the mdd dataset yet all biplots have good snps lumped into a corner that corresponds to good qc features we wish to point out that when using the proposed algorithm it is important to monitor the features of the retained good snps and tune the neighborhood radius r to safeguard the basic qc criteria this is because the thresholds for outliers are determined relative to the majority of the data the tuning becomes particularly crucial if a big proportion of data_points are of low quality for example in the mdd dataset there were about of snps with msp and our algorithm with the initial change_point r kept snps with msp up to almost tuning of r was thus continued until the maximum msp dropped to in practice the smaller r is the more stringent the qc criteria for good snps will be as a smaller r makes it harder to form a cluster in dbscan we suggest starting with a value of r determined by fitting a change_point model to the sorted fourth nearest distances and then further to adjust r until the specific goal is reached so as to assure the value the maximum msp or the percentage of snps removed within reasonable ranges in our explorations we found that the change_point r often suggests a reasonable value e g in cad cd ht t d and t d or is at least a good upper_bound e g in bd ra and mdd judging by the resulting values or the retained maximum msp given the change_point r one can reduce its value if a more stringent filter is needed and increase its value if one wishes to remove only extreme outlier snps when selecting which qc variables to include in the algorithm we intend to avoid using mafcs and mafcn because they may obfuscate the true associations for the rest of the qc variables it is possible to make other choices for inclusion exclusion e g to exclude mspall from the proposed qc variable set i e to use five variables or to include mspall mafall to the proposed qc variable set i e to use seven variables while we expected that the performance would not change much we carried_out sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of using different qc variables in the proposed algorithm the results are given in supplementary tables and for comparability we tuned the r values so that each analysis removed a similar proportion of snps to the original variable analysis as expected the and variable analyses performed very similarly to the proposed variable analyses indicating the robustness of the proposed filter to the different choices of qc variables
