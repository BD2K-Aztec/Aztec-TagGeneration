inference of patient specific pathway activities from multi_dimensional cancer_genomics data using paradigm motivation high_throughput data is providing a comprehensive view of the molecular changes in cancer tissues new technologies allow for the simultaneous genome_wide assay of the state of genome copy_number gene_expression dna_methylation and epigenetics of tumor_samples and cancer_cell analyses of current data_sets find that genetic_alterations between patients can differ but often involve common pathways it is therefore critical to identify relevant pathways involved in cancer_progression and detect how they are altered in different patients results we present a novel method for inferring patient specific genetic activities incorporating curated pathway interactions among genes a gene is modeled by a factor graph as a set of interconnected variables encoding the expression and known activity of a gene and its products allowing the incorporation of many types of omic_data as evidence the method predicts the degree to which a pathways activities e g internal gene states interactions or high_level outputs are altered in the patient using probabilistic_inference compared with a competing pathway activity inference approach_called spia our method identifies altered activities in cancer related pathways with fewer false_positives in both a glioblastoma multiform gbm and a breast_cancer dataset paradigm identified consistent pathway level activities for subsets of the gbm patients that are overlooked when genes are considered in isolation further grouping gbm patients based on their significant pathway perturbations divides them into clinically_relevant subgroups having significantly different survival_outcomes these findings_suggest that therapeutics might be chosen that target_genes at critical_points in the commonly perturbed pathway s of a group of patients availability source_code available ata central premise in modern cancer treatment is that patient diagnosis prognosis risk_assessment and treatment response prediction can be improved by stratification of cancers based on genomic transcriptional and epigenomic characteristics of the tumor alongside relevant clinical information gathered at the time of diagnosis e g patient_history tumor_histology and stage as well as subsequent clinical follow_up data e g treatment_regimens to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as and disease_recurrence events while several high_throughput have been available for probing the molecular_details of cancer only a handful of successes have been achieved based on this paradigm for example of breast_cancer patients presenting with a particular amplification or overexpression of the erbb growth_factor receptor_tyrosine can now be treated with trastuzumab a monoclonal_antibody targeting the receptor however even this success story is clouded by the fact that of patients with erbb positive breast_cancers actually achieve any therapeutic_benefit from trastuzumab emphasizing our incomplete understanding of this well studied oncogenic pathway and the many therapeutic resistant mechanisms intrinsic to erbb positive breast_cancers this overall failure to translate modern advances in basic cancer_biology is in part due to our inability to comprehensively organize and integrate all of the omic features now technically acquirable on virtually any type of cancer despite overwhelming evidence that histologically_similar cancers are in reality a composite of many molecular_subtypes each with significantly different clinical behavior this knowledge is rarely applied in practice due to the lack of robust signatures that correlate well with prognosis and treatment_options cancer is a disease of the genome that is associated with aberrant alterations that lead to disregulation of the cellular system what is not clear is how genomic changes feed into genetic_pathways that underlie cancer phenotypes high_throughput functional_genomics investigations have made tremendous_progress in the past_decade however the challenges of integrating_multiple data_sources to identify reproducible and interpretable molecular_signatures of tumorigenesis and progression remain_elusive recent pilot_studies by tcga and others make it clear that a pathway level understanding of genomic perturbations is needed to understand the changes observed in cancer_cells these findings demonstrate that even when patients harbor genomic_alterations or aberrant expression in different genes these genes often participate in a common pathway in addition and even more striking is that the alterations observed e g deletions versus amplifications often alter the pathway output in the same direction either all increasing or all decreasing the pathway activation approaches for interpreting genome_wide cancer data have focused on identifying gene_expression that are highly_correlated with a particular phenotype or disease_state and have led to promising results methods using analysis_of false discovery and non parametric methods have been proposed page i i i to assess the quality of the em training_procedure we compared the convergence of em using the actual patient data relative to a null dataset in which tuples of gene_expression and copy_number e c were permuted across the genes and patients as expected paradigm converged much more quickly on the true dataset relative to the null as an example we plotted the ipas for the gene akt as a function of the em iteration one can see that the activities quickly converge in the first couple of iterations em quickly converged to an activated level when trained with the actual patient data whereas it converged to an unchanged activity when given random data the convergence suggests that the pathway structures and inference are able to successfully_identify patterns of activity in the integrated patient data we next ran paradigm on both breast_cancer and gbm cohorts we developed a statistical simulation procedure to determine which ipas are significantly different than what would be expected from a negative distribution we constructed the negative distribution by permuting across all of the patients and across the genes in the pathway empirically we found that permuting only among genes distinguishing decoy from real pathways with paradigm and spia decoy pathways were created by assigning a new gene name to each gene in a pathway paradigm and spia were then used to compute the perturbation of every pathway each line shows the receiveroperator characteristic for distinguishing real from decoy pathways using the perturbation ranking in breast_cancer the areas under the curve aucs are and for paradigm and spia respectively in gbm the aucs are and respectively in the pathway was necessary to help correct for the fact that each gene has a different topological context determined by the network in the breast_cancer dataset ipas of the total were found to be significantly_higher or lower than the matched negative controls on average nci pathways had significant entities per patient and out of pathways had at least one entity altered in or more of the patients in the gbm dataset ipas of the total were found to be significantly_higher or lower than the matched negative controls on average nci pathways had significant entities per patient and out of pathways had at least one entity altered in or more of the patients as another control we asked whether the integrated activities could be obtained from arbitrary genes connected in the same way as the genes in the nci pathways to do this we estimated the false_discovery and compared it with spia because many genetic_networks have been found to be implicated in cancer we chose to use simulated decoy pathways as a set of negative controls for each nci pathway we constructed a decoy pathway by connecting random genes in the genome together using the same network_structure as the nci pathway we then ran paradigm and spia to derive ipas for both the nci and decoy pathways for paradigm we ranked each pathway by the number of ipas found to be significant across the patients after normalizing by the pathway size for spia pathways were ranked according to their computed impact_factor we found that paradigm excludes more decoy pathways from the top most activated pathways compared with spia for example in breast_cancer paradigm ranks decoy in the top in the top and in the top in comparison spia ranks decoys in the top in the top and in the top the overall distribution of ranks for nci ipas are higher in paradigm than in spia observed by plotting the cumulative distribution of the ranks p kolmogorovsmirnov test we sorted the nci pathways according to their average number of significant ipas per entity detected by our permutation analysis and tabulated the top in breast_cancer and gbm several pathways among the top have been previously implicated in their respective cancers in breast_cancer both spia and paradigm were able to detect the estrogen and erbb related pathways in a recent major meta_analysis study authors fromfound that estrogen_receptor and erbb status were two of only three key prognostic signatures in breast_cancer paradigm was also able to identify an akt related pi k signaling_pathway as the top most pathway with significant ipas in several samples the anti_apoptotic akt serinethreonine kinase is known to be involved in breast_cancer and interacts with the erbb pathway in gbm both foxm and hif_alpha transcription_factor networks have been studied extensively and shown to be overexpressed in high_grade glioblastomas versus lower grade gliomas for each node er_status ipas expression data and copy_number data are displayed as concentric circles from innermost to outermost respectively the apoptosis node and the erbb erbb neuregulin complex node have circles only for er_status and for ipas as there are no direct observations of these entities each patients data is displayed along one angle from the circle center to edge the paradigm method integrates diverse high_throughput genomics information with known signaling_pathways to provide patient specific genomic inferences on the state of gene activities complexes and cellular_processes the core of the method uses a factor graph to leverage inference for combining the various data_sources the use of such inferences in place of or in conjunction with the original high_throughput datasets improves our ability to classify samples into clinically_relevant subtypes clustering the gbm patients based on the paradigm integrated activities revealed patient subtypes correlated with different survival profiles in contrast clustering the samples either using the expression data or the copy_number data did not reveal any significant clusters in the dataset paradigm produces pathway inferences of significantly altered gene activities in tumor_samples from both gbm and breast_cancer compared to a competing pathway activity inference approach_called spia our method identifies altered activities in cancer related pathways with fewer false_positives for computational_efficiency paradigm currently uses the nci pathways as is while it infers hidden quantities using em it makes no attempt to infer new interactions not already present in an nci pathway one can imagine expanding the approach to introduce new interactions that increase the likelihood_function while this problem is intractable in general heuristics such as structural em can be used to identify interactions using computational search_strategies rather than searching for novel connections de_novo one could speed up the search significantly by proposing interactions derived from proteinprotein_interaction maps or gene_pairs correlated in a significant number of expression datasets the power of the pathway based_approach is that it may provide_clues about the possible mechanisms_underlying the differences in observed survival informative ipas may be useful for suggesting therapeutic_targets or to select the most appropriate patients for clinical_trials for example the erbb amplification is a wellknown marker of particular forms of breast_cancer that are treatable by the drug trastuzumab however some patients with the erbb amplification have tumors that are refractory to treatment inspection of a circlemap display could identify patients with erbb amplifications but have either inactive or unchanged ipas as inferred by paradigm patients harboring the erbb amplification but without predicted activity could be considered for alternative treatment as more multidimensional datasets become available in the future it will be interesting to test whether such pathway inferences provide robust biomarkers that generalize across cohorts
