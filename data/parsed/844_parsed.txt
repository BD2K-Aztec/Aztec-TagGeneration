calculating and scoring high_quality multiple flexible protein_structure alignments motivation calculating multiple protein_structure alignments msas is important for understanding functional and evolutionary_relationships between protein_families and for modeling protein_structures by homology while incorporating backbone flexibility promises to circumvent many of the limitations of rigid msa algorithms very few flexible msa algorithms exist today this article_describes several novel improvements to the kpax algorithm which allow high_quality flexible msas to be calculated this article also introduces a new gaussian based msa quality measure called m score which circumvents the pitfalls of rmsd based quality_measures results as well as calculating flexible msas the new version of kpax can also score msas from other aligners and from previously aligned reference datasets results are presented for a large_scale evaluation of the homstrad sabmark and sisy benchmark sets using kpax and matt as examples of state of the art flexible aligners and dcomb as an example of a state of the art rigid aligner these results demonstrate the utility of the m score as a measure of msa quality and show that high_quality msas may be achieved when structural flexibility is properly taken into account availability_and kpax may be downloaded for academic use at http kpax calculating multiple structure alignments msas of proteins is an important step towards understanding the evolutionary and functional_relationships between different proteins and protein_families calculating high_quality structural_alignments can be crucial for the accurate modelling of three_dimensional d protein_structures by homology and can improve the generation of msa based sequence_profiles for protein fold prediction many algorithms for calculating protein_structure alignments sas have been described and reviewed in recent_years and several of these can calculate msas some examples of multiple structural aligners are ssap musta ce mc multiprot posa mammoth multi vorolign mustang promals d blomaps salign mistral dcomb mapsci smolign mstali and mulpba most of the above approaches first use dynamic_programming dp to align pairs of structures and they then progressively merge the pair_wise alignments to make a msa a few approaches subsequently optimize the resulting msa using distance based e g cemc and mammoth multi or energy based e g mistral minimization techniques however when aligning many structures the progressive alignment approaches can become computationally_expensive because they require an initial set of all against all pair_wise alignments to build a guide_tree which means that the computational_cost scales as o n in the number of structures n in order to avoid such computational costs the mapsci and mulpba algorithms build a multiple_alignment with respect to a given pivot structure which leads to a computational_cost of o n but this requires prior_knowledge of which structure should serve as the pivot an effective alternative to conventional row first multiple alignment_algorithms is dcomb which uses a column first approach to identify highly_similar fragment blocks to guide the calculation of msas while dcomb has been shown to give excellent msas the complexity of its column first algorithm also appears to scale as o n in the number of structures because it is difficult to optimize simultaneously the number of aligned residues and their c a root_mean deviation rmsd different structure aligners make different number rmsd trade_offs which can lead to producing locally different alignments even within proteins that share_common motifs thus current sa algorithms can introduce errors or inconsistencies even in pairwise_alignments and these errors can accumulate considerably in msa algorithms that progressively merge multiple pair_wise alignments furthermore such effects can confound efforts to compare different msa algorithms against reference sas because the programs used to calculate the reference sas are themselves subject to the same number rmsd trade_off problem incorporating backbone flexibility offers one way to tackle such problems although some flexible sa algorithms have been described such as flexprot fatcat posa flexsnap matt and rapido still only a very few algorithms can flexibly align multiple structures furthermore other flexible aligners such as vorolign and gr align maloddognin and pr zulj can align pairs of structures that cannot be completely superposed rigidly but they do not perform superpositions to my knowledge the only aligners that can calculate multiple superpositions flexibly are posa matt and smoalign posa essentially extends the pair_wise fatcat approach to msas both posa and smolign calculate partial order alignment graphs i e lists of locally aligned segments which are common to all structures but which are not necessarily sequential in the primary protein_sequences in contrast both matt and kpax calculate strictly sequential msas which do not allow non sequential permutations of residues unfortunately posa is publicly_available only as a web_server which makes it infeasible for large_scale studies and smolign is no longer available for download while the original kpax pair_wise alignment algorithm is sufficiently fast to be able to search large d structural_domain databases in just a few seconds the first version was limited to performing only rigid_body superpositions of entire protein_structures this article_describes several extensions to the earlier kpax algorithm which allow pairs of proteins of arbitrary size including multi_domain to be aligned flexibly and which allow multiple proteins to be assembled into a msa using a pivot based_approach it seems obvious that a pre requisite for calculating high_quality msas is to begin with an algorithm that can calculate high_quality pair_wise sas however there does not yet exist an accepted standard for assessing the quality of pair_wise alignments or msas dcomb calculates its msa quality measure from the pair_wise tm_score taken over all fully aligned columns on the other hand for columns with an occupancy of or more mulpba uses a quality measure based on a weighted_average of the numbers of residues whose pairwise_distances fall within certain given distance ranges this may be considered as an extension of the local global_alignment lga scoring_method which calculates a weighted_average over several number rmsd bins of a pair_wise alignment more recently the stovca program has been proposed to compare the quality of structural superpositions calculated by other pair_wise aligners but this program is limited to evaluating pair_wise superpositions using its own internal pair_wise alignment algorithm proposed a method for measuring sa quality based on information compression but this approach is also limited to pair_wise alignments thus there exists a need for a simple and general way to compare the quality of both the alignments and the corresponding superpositions of different msa algorithms to try to address the problem of comparing different sa algorithms this article proposes a novel atomic gaussian based msa scoring_function called m score which circumvents the number rmsd trade_off problem in previous_studies showed that dcomb gives highly_competitive rigid msas compared to mapsci mamoth matt blomaps mustang and multiprot when applied to the large homstrad and sabmark benchmark sets andshowed that matt gave the best overall performance on a sub set of their challenging sisy benchmark therefore a similar large_scale comparison using these datasets is presented here to compare kpax with dcomb as an example of a state of the art rigid multiple aligner and with matt as the best available flexible multiple aligner
