more challenges for machine_learning protein interactions motivation machine_learning may be the most popular computational_tool in molecular_biology providing sustained performance_estimates is challenging the standard cross_validation protocols usually fail in biology park and marcotte found that even refined protocols fail for proteinprotein_interactions ppis results here we sketch additional problems for the prediction of ppis from sequence alone first it not only matters whether proteins a or b of a target interaction ab are similar to proteins of training interactions positives but also whether a or b are similar to proteins of non interactions negatives second training on multiple interaction_partners per protein did not improve performance for new proteins not used to train in contrary a strictly non redundant training that ignored good data slightly_improved the prediction of difficult cases third which prediction method appears to be best crucially depends on the sequence_similarity between the test and the training_set how many true interactions should be found and the expected ratio of negatives to positives the correct assessment of performance is the most complicated task in the development of prediction_methods our analyses suggest that ppis square the challenge for this task
