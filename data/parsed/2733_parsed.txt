systems_biology localali an evolutionary based local_alignment approach to identify functionally conserved modules in multiple_networks motivation sequences and protein interaction data are of significance to understand the underlying_molecular of organisms local_network is one of key systematic ways for predicting protein functions identifying functional_modules and understanding the phylogeny from these data most of currently existing_tools however encounter their limitations which are mainly concerned with scoring_scheme speed and scalability therefore there are growing demands for sophisticated network evolution models and efficient local alignment_algorithms results we developed a fast and scalable local_network tool called localali for the identification of functionally conserved modules in multiple_networks in this algorithm we firstly proposed a new framework to reconstruct the evolution history of conserved modules based on a maximum_parsimony evolutionary model by relying on this model localali facilitates interpretation of resulting local_alignments in terms of conserved modules which have been evolved from a common ancestral module through a series of evolutionary_events a meta heuristic_method simulated_annealing was used to search for the optimal or near optimal inner nodes i e ancestral modules of the evolutionary tree to evaluate the performance and the statistical_significance localali were tested on real_datasets and randomly_generated datasets the results suggest that localali outperforms all existing algorithms in terms of coverage consistency and scalability meanwhile retains a high_precision in the identification of functionally coherent subnetworks a functional module is by definition a discrete entity whose function is separable from those of other modules they are usually separated based on spatial localization e g a ribosome or chemical specificity e g a signal_transduction system and composed of many types of molecules such as proteins dna rna and small_molecules a deficiency of a comprehensive chart of functional_modules within organisms becomes an obstacle to unravel the general design principles that govern the structure and behavior of modules and understand the evolutionary_constraints they must obey thus the problem of identifying functional_modules attracts many researchers in the fields of computational_biology and systems_biology to come up to this problem network_alignment based on evolutionary cross_species comparison provides a valuable framework despite the existence of many network_alignment tools such as pathblast networkblast nb natalie and alignmcl the developments of faster and more efficient tools are of significance to cope with the rapidly_growing biological data network_alignment aims at finding one to one or manyto many node mapping tables by comparing networks based on information from sequence_similarity topology conservation co expression co evolution etc nodes that are grouped into a same cluster in a node mapping table constitute an equivalence class each equivalence class must bear at most one protein from each species in one to one tables whereas it might receive more than one node from a same species in many to many tables generally network_alignment are categorized into pairwise and multiple network alignments according to the number of compared species and into local and global network alignments according to its target_regions of interest pairwise approaches align two networks and multiple approaches three and more networks local_alignment approaches detect node mapping tables for conserved subnetworks which are usually independent and high_scoring local_regions each implying a putative_functional module such as a protein complex or metabolic_pathway global_alignment approaches determine an optimal global node mapping table for the compared networks each set of matched nodes i e proteins implying a putative_function oriented ortholog group typically pairwise global alignment_methods attempt to provide one to one mapping tables including netal mi_graal h graal spinal and magna multiple global_alignment and pairwise multiple local_alignment attempt to give many to many mapping tables such as smetana and netcoffee the scope of this paper focuses on the problem of multiple local_alignment to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comboth in silico and in vivo studies suggest that functional_modules of organisms tend to be conserved during the evolution history grounded on this hypothesis local_network provides a general computational framework that searches for high_scoring conserved subnetworks to detect functionally conserved modules the developments of local_alignment tools or web_servers have become a quite active field in the last decade the most notable pairwise local_alignment tools include pathblast mawish mw networkblast alignnemo an and netaligner just a few multiple local_alignment tools have been developed the currently existing multiple local_alignment tools include graemlin cappi and networkblast m nbm in addition there are also some works trying to detect functionally conserved modules by using a combination of clustering_algorithms and global alignment_algorithms such as pinalog see more information about existing local and global_network tools in the supplementary_material the currently existing multiple local_alignment tools are concerned with three major_issues the first one is the scalability to date cappi has been applied to the analysis of three networks and only compatible with particularly designed data nbm is unable to run on networks containing nodes with a large vertex degree thus the scalability of these tools is at a modest level another issue is the evolutionary relevance of the reported hits to answer the question of how conserved modules of descendants have been evolved from their origin the scoring_schemes shall be more strongly rooted in an evolutionary model but neither the evolution history nor a probabilistic_model of network growth was considered by graemlin and nbm the third issue is speed the problem of aligning multiple_networks is computationally_intractable parallelization techniques can largely speed up local alignment_algorithms because each target of interest can be searched by a single thread yet none of the existing multiple local_alignment tools support parallel_computing to remedy these limitations we developed a fast and scalable alignment_tool localali la for the identification of functionally conserved modules in multiple_networks a new framework was firstly proposed for the inference of the evolution history of functional_modules based on a maximum_parsimony evolutionary model by relying on this model la facilitates the interpretation of resulting local_alignments in terms of conserved modules that have been evolved from a common ancestral module through a series of evolutionary_events to evaluate the performance la and four previous_algorithms were tested on real_datasets and random datasets we assessed the quality of the alignment results in terms of coverage consistency prediction of protein functions and prediction of protein_complexes the results show that la outperforms all previous_algorithms in terms of coverage consistency and scalability meanwhile retains a high_precision in predicting functionally coherent subnetworks fcs moreover la is also preferable to the state of the art algorithm nbm in predicting protein functions and protein_complexes
