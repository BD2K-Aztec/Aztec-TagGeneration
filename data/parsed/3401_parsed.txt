oxbs_mle an efficient method to estimate methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine in paired bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite treated dna motivation methylcytosine mc and hydroxymethylcytosine hmc are important epigen etic regulators of gene_expression mc and hmc levels can be computationally inferred at single_base using sequencing or array data from paired dna samples that have undergone bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite_conversion current estimation methods have been shown to produce irregular estimates of hmc level or are extremely computation intensive results we developed an efficient method oxbs_mle based on binomial modeling of paired bisul fite and oxidative bisulfite data from sequencing or array analysis evaluation in several datasets showed that it outperformed alternative_methods in estimate accuracy and computation speed availability_and oxbs_mle is implemented in bioconductor_package enmix contact methylcytosine mc is an essential epigenetic mark that regulates cell_differentiation and gene_expression mc can be oxidized to hydroxymethylcytosine hmc by activity of the ten_eleven tet enzyme hmc can function_differently from mc in transcriptional_control and is prevalent in embryonic stems cells thus it is desirable to separately quantify mc and hmc levels at single_base traditional bisulfite bs treatment commonly used in genomewide methylation studies cannot distinguish mc from hmc both are protected from conversion while unmodified cytosines are converted to uracil u selective oxidation of hmc to formylcytosine fc can be achieved by treatment with potassium perruthenate kruo and fc converts to u following bisulfite_treatment hmc level can be estimated using paired experiments on a dna_sample bisulfite_converted can be used to estimate the proportion of mc hmc and oxidative bisulfite oxbs converted dna can be used to estimate the proportion of mc measurement can be done in a genome_wide using sequencing_techniques e g oxbs seq or for specific_loci using array techniques e g oxbs k and oxbs array be non negative to overcome the limitation a statistical_approach oxybs was proposed to estimate hmc and mc levels by assuming beta distributions for the two measurements a limitation of this approach is that it is too computationally_intensive for large studies here we propose a computationally_efficient method oxbs_mle mle stands for maximum_likelihood estimate to jointly estimate mc and hmc levels from the paired experimental_data evaluations in real_datasets show that it outperforms oxybs and the navenave method oxbs_mle has been implemented in the bioconductor_package enmix to evaluate oxbs_mle and compare it with alternative_methods we applied the oxbs_mle oxybs and the navenave subtraction method to the methylation k array data geo accession_number gse from which have undergone the correction for infinium i and ii probe design bias using subset quantile with array normalization swan by the data consist of eight arrays for four replicates of a single cerebellum sample two arrays bs or oxbs treated for each replicate the qpcr measurements of hmc level for cpg_sites on the array were also available and thus can be used as gold_standard to evaluate the accuracy of the hmc estimates from array data with different methods evaluations showed that methods oxbs_mle and oxybs provided almost identical hmc estimates with maximum absolute_difference of across all cpg_sites and all four replicates while the navenave method produced a significant portion of negative hmc estimates in each replicate to evaluate the accuracy of hmc estimates we first averaged the four replicate estimates with each method at the cpg_sites and then calculated the absolute_difference between the averages and the corresponding qpcr measurements the results showed that oxbs_mle and oxybs estimates are almost identical and both outperformed the navenave method student paired_t p for either comparisons method oxbs_mle and oxybs also produced similar estimates of mc at majority of the cpg_sites with only of the estimates having absolute_difference greater than between the two methods however when the beta value from bs experiment is smaller than that from the corresponding oxbs experiment oxbsmle and oxybs tend to produce different mc estimates with maximum_difference of in the evaluation especially when bs measurement is very small oxybs method can result in irrational estimates of no matter what the oxbs measurement is supplementary we observed the similar phenomenon in other datasets data not shown we also noticed that for most cpg_sites out of the oxbs_mle estimates of mc are closer to the measurements from oxbs experiment oxidative bisulfite experiments aim to measure mc level than the oxybs estimates the percentage of such cpg_sites in infinium i probes is similar to that in infinium ii probes we note that oxbs_mle is times_faster than oxybs when both methods were applied to the above geo data second versus minutes for eight arrays on a machine with ghz cpu this is because that oxybs uses an iterative_method to find mle while oxbs_mle calculates mle using an explicit analytical form the computation in the method oxybs is done sample by sample and thus the computing time will increase_linearly with sample_size the computing time for samples arrays is expected to be h for oxybs while oxbs_mle takes only minutes it is easy to see that the oxbs_mle method assumption is even more suitable for sequencing_data however we were not able to find oxbs sequencing_data with additional qpcr pyrosequencing validation in summary oxbs_mle is an efficient and accurate method to jointly estimate mc and hmc levels in paired bs and oxbstreated experiments
