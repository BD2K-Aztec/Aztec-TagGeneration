markophylo markov_chain analysis on phylogenetic_trees continuous_time chain models with finite state_space are routinely used for analysis of discrete character data on phylogenetic_trees examples of such discrete character data include restriction_sites gene_family presence absence intron presence absence and gene family_size data while models with constrained substitution_rate matrices have been used to good effect more biologically_realistic models have been increasingly implemented in the recent_literature combining e g site rate variation site partitioning branch specific rates allowing for non stationary prior root probabilities correcting for sampling bias etc to name a few here a flexible and fast r package is introduced that infers evolutionary_rates of discrete characters on a tree within a probabilistic_framework the package markophylo fits maximum_likelihood models using markov_chains on phylogenetic_trees the package is efficient with the workhorse functions written in c and the interface in user_friendly r availability_and markophylo is available as a platform independent r package from the comprehensive_r at https cran r project org_web marko phylo a vignette with numerous examples is also provided with the r package a markov_chain framework is frequently adopted to estimate evolutionary_rates of discrete characters on phylogenetic_trees some examples of previously investigated data using such models_include restriction_sites gene family_size data gene_family presence absence patterns intron presence absence data etc a good introduction to such models can be found in omeara and yang it has been noted before that many variants of such models are just restrictions of more general models for investigation of specific hypotheses or different kinds of data o hence there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient software to provide a unified interface that would allow fitting of varied discrete character datasets recently kim and hao put forward a unified r r core package namely discml that provided users the option of biologically_realistic features like gamma rate variation estimation of character prior root probabilities correcting for ancient characters being lost from all examined extant taxa cf etc as noted in kim and hao while many of these features are found in existing programs like bayestraits cafe badirate and gloome the sum total of these above_mentioned desirable features was not available in a single flexible software however discml is not computationally inexpensive moreover discml does not currently allow for partition analyses or for accounting for sampling bias arising due to multiple unobserved phyletic patterns see_supplementary here we present markophylo an r package that is both fast and flexible the markophylo package allows for estimating evolutionary_rates using a user specified i e hypothesis driven substitution_rate matrix in a continuous_time chain model on phylogenies the package is computationally_efficient with the workhorse functions written in c using the rcpp and rcpparmadillo packages the package is flexible capable of modelling a myriad array of processes described below in section here a flexible and efficient r package named markophylo for estimating evolutionary_rates of discrete characters is introduced when compared with existing packages like discml markophylo is at least an order of magnitude faster moreover markophylo implements a wide_variety of features increasingly seen in more biologically_realistic markov_chain models run on discrete character datasets
