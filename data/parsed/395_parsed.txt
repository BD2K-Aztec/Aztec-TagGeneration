a novel network based method for measuring the functional relationship between gene_sets motivation in the functional genomic era a large number of gene_sets have been identified via high_throughput genomic and proteomic_technologies these gene_sets of interest are often related to the same or similar disorders or phenotypes and are commonly presented as differentially_expressed gene_lists co expressed gene_modules protein_complexes or signaling_pathways however biologists are still faced by the challenge of comparing gene_sets and interpreting the functional_relationships between gene_sets into an understanding of the underlying_biological results we introduce a novel network based method designated corrected cumulative rank score ccrs which analyzes the functional communication and physical_interaction between genes and presents an easy to use web_based toolkit called gsnetcom to quantify the functional relationship between two gene_sets to evaluate the performance of our method in assessing the functional_similarity between two gene_sets we analyzed the functional coherence of complexes in functional catalog and identified protein_complexes in the same functional catalog the results suggested that ccrs can offer a significant advance in addressing the functional relationship between different gene_sets compared with several other available tools or algorithms with similar functionality we also conducted the case study based on our method and succeeded in prioritizing candidate leukemia associated protein_complexes and expanding the prioritization and analysis of cancer related complexes to other cancer_types in addition gsnetcom provides a new insight into the communication between gene_modules such as exploring gene_sets from the perspective of well annotated protein_complexes numerous systematic biological studies have revealed that cellular function in a biological system normally involves the participation and interaction of multiple genes in the functional genomic era a large number of gene_sets have been identified through the application of highthroughput genomic proteomic_technologies such as microarray mass_spectrometry and chip on chip assays and next_generation gene_sets of interest may be related to disorders or disease_phenotypes and the biological_interpretation of gene_set data may therefore be of great_importance during the past several years an increasing number of computational_tools has been developed and played_an in helping biologists explore these gene_sets of interest of the tools contributing to the functional analysis of gene_sets most are enrichment tools and as reviewed by a significant portion of these bioinformatic enrichment tools is based on gene_ontology go and only allow users to submit a single gene_set and identify over represented go terms in interesting gene_set compared with the background through statistical_analysis examples of such tools include gostat go termfinder and goeast recently some new tools and improved versions of previous tools which integrate diverse and heterogeneous data content e g kegg_pathways gene_expression data have been released for the comprehensive functional analysis of single gene_set examples of which include gazer genetrail david and gsea within a biological system no gene_set functions in an isolated manner even in fairly complete pathways one gene_set is interconnected with other gene_sets through complex mechanisms and these relationships may affect related_disorders and phenotypes therefore a common challenge faced by experimental biologists is to gain a better understanding of the functional_relationships between different gene_sets a few computational_tools have been developed to compare gene_sets most of which are based on go such as fatigo and profcom some go based semantic_similarity methods can also be used to compare two gene_sets by averaging the pairwise_distances between the elements currently most of the go terms have been assigned apage via the application of various technologies biologists often identify gene_sets of interest which may be involved with related_disorders or phenotypes however comparing two gene_sets and determining the functional_relationships between them remains a challenging and daunting task several computational_tools have been developed to compare gene_sets however these tools generally found go terms or keywords that are significantly over represented in one set of genes versus a second reference_set to compare two gene_sets to remedy these problems we developed a novel networkbased method designated ccrs which takes_into the functional communication and physical_interaction of genes and presented an easy to use web_based toolkit called gsnetcom http bioinfo hrbmu edu cn gsnetcom the gsnetcom software quantifies the functional_relationships between gene_sets and performs statistical_tests on the analysis results based on the protein complex database corum we evaluated the performance of the ccrs method in comparison to other available tools or algorithms ccrs provides a significant advance in exploring the functional relationship between gene_sets in the context of ppi_network and performs statistical_tests on the analysis results also in the case study of cancer associated protein_complexes ccrs successfully prioritized cancer associated complexes in addition gsnetcom provides a new insight into the communication from gene_modules such as exploring gene_sets from the perspective of well annotated protein_complexes in its current version the ccrs method computes the shortest_path of any two genes between two gene_sets as the function distance however function distance could more effectively be modeled using edge capacitance or optimization of edge constraints in the near further we plan to improve gsnetcom by incorporating edge capacitance or optimization of edge constraints and some other biological_information to comprehensively address the functional_relationships between two gene_sets furthermore the annotation of gene_sets could be improved by the supplementation of protein complex data
