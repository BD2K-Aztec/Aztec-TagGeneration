fourcseq analysis of c sequencing_data circularized chromosome_conformation c is a powerful technique for studying the spatial interactions of a specific genomic_region called the viewpoint with the rest of the genome both in a single condition or comparing different experimental_conditions or cell_types observed ligation frequencies typically show a strong regular dependence on genomic_distance from the viewpoint on top of which specific interaction peaks are superimposed here we address the computational task to find these specific peaks and to detect changes between different biological conditions results we model the overall trend of decreasing interaction frequency with genomic_distance by fitting a smooth monotonically decreasing_function to suitably transformed count_data based on the fit z scores are calculated from the residuals and high z scores are interpreted as peaks providing evidence for specific interactions to compare different conditions we normalize fragment counts between samples and call for differential contact frequencies using the statistical_method deseq adapted from rna_seq analysis availability_and a full end_to analysis_pipeline is implemented in the r package fourcseq available at www bioconductor org circularized chromosome_conformation c couples the low_throughput chromosome_conformation c technique for studying chromatinchromatin interactions with high_throughput c detects the contacts of a chosen viewpoint with in principle the entire_genome the c protocol consists of six main steps first the chromatin is cross_linked with formaldehyde to fix dna protein_complexes thereby capturing dna_sequences that are in close spatial_proximity in the next step the cross_linked chromatin is digested with a restriction_enzyme in the third step the fragment ends from the digestion treatment are ligated under dilute conditions to favor intra complex ligation ligating dna_sequences that have been in close spatial_proximity after this the cross_linking is reversed followed by a second round of digestion with a different restriction_enzyme to obtain smaller dna_molecules these molecules are then circularized and amplified_by pcr the resulting library is sequenced the possibility to multiplex several viewpoints in one sequencing library further increases the throughput as result the distribution of reads from a c sequencing library throughout the genome provides an estimate of the contact frequencies of the viewpoint with the rest of the genome overall the c signal decreases with genomic_distance from the viewpoint and reaches a constant level of noise for large_distances specific interactions of dna elements sit on top of this overall trend one task is to identify positions that stand out from the general trend moreover if c has been performed on samples with different cell_types developmental_stages or experimental_treatments a second task is the detection of changes in interaction frequencies between the sample groups to illustrate our approach we use a c dataset of developing drosophila_melanogaster embryos in this dataset viewpoints were selected throughout the d melanogaster genome with a focus on cis_regulatory crms samples were taken from embryos at h and h after fertilization either using whole embryos or mesoderm specific cells
