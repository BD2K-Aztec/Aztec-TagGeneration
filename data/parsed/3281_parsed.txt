normal accurate nucleosome_positioning using a modified gaussian_mixture motivation nucleosomes are the basic elements of chromatin_structure they control the packaging of dna and play_a in gene_regulation by allowing physical access to transcription_factors the advent of second generation sequencing has enabled landmark genome_wide studies of nucleosome_positions for several model_organisms current methods to determine nucleosome_positioning first compute an occupancy coverage profile by mapping nucleosome enriched sequenced_reads to a reference_genome then nucleosomes are placed according to the peaks of the coverage profile these methods are quite accurate on placing isolated nucleosomes but they do not properly handle more complex configurations also they can only provide the positions of nucleosomes and their occupancy level whereas it is very beneficial to supply molecular_biologists additional information about nucleosomes like the probability of placement the size of dna_fragments enriched for nucleosomes and or whether nucleosomes are well positioned or fuzzy in the sequenced cell sample results we address_these by providing a novel method based on a parametric probabilistic_model an expectation_maximization is used to infer the parameters of the mixture of distributions we compare the performance of our method on two real_datasets against template filtering which is considered the current state of the art on synthetic data we show that our method can resolve more accurately complex configurations of nucleosomes and it is more robust to user_defined parameters on real_data we show that our method detects a significantly_higher number of nucleosomes availability visitthe study of the processes governing gene_regulation is a central problem in molecular_biology one of the key factors_influencing gene_expression is the complex interaction between chromatin_structure and transcription_factors the fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome composed of bp of dna wrapped turns around a protein complex of eight histones to elucidate the role of the interactions between chromatin and transcription_factors it is crucial to determine the location of the nucleosomes along the genome in general the more condensed the chromatin the harder it is for transcription_factors and other dna_binding to access dna and carry out their tasks to whom correspondence should be addressed the more accessible is the dna the more likely surrounding genes are actively_transcribed the presence or the absence of nucleosomes directly_or affects a variety of other cellular and metabolic_processes like recombination replication centromere formation and dna_repair a handful of experimental_techniques have been developed for genome_wide mapping of nucleosomes for instance one can enrich for genomic_regions that are either bound to histones typically via chromatin immuno precipitation or chip or for genomic_regions that are free of nucleosomes linkers for instance maines mnase assisted isolation nucleosomal elements isolates the portions of the dna that are attached to nucleosomes because mnase preferentially digests linker regions then microarrays chip_chip or sequencing chip_seq mnaseseq are applied to the enriched dna in this article we concentrate on the analysis of sequencing_data given the prevalence of mnase chip_seq in the recent_literature the computational_analysis of the sequencing_data usually consists of two main steps i a nucleosome_occupancy coverage is computed from the process of mapping nucleosomeenriched sequenced_reads to a reference_genome followed by some normalization steps and ii nucleosomes are placed according to the peaks of the coverage profile approaches based on peak_calling are computationally fast and quite accurate in resolving isolated stable or arrayed nucleosomes however they are not entirely reliable when more complex nucleosome configurations are present observe that while it is physically impossible for two nucleosomes to be overlapping on the same location on a dna_strand it is quite common that the population of cells from which the enriched dna was obtained had nucleosomes slightly off sync at a given genomic coordinate transient interaction as a consequence the resulting coverage profile will exhibit a blurring of the peaks molecular_biologists distinguish the case of overlapping nucleosome from fuzzy nucleosomes or fuzzy regions see for overlapping nucleosomes the overlap is relatively small in the fuzzy case several nucleosomes are mutually overlapping for a significant fraction of their size see zhang and pugh for a review by introducing a threshold parameter on the allowed overlap one can define precisely the line between fuzzy and overlapping another shortcoming of peak_calling approaches is that they can only report nucleosome_positions and or occupancy level molecular_biologists however need additional information about nucleosomes for instance they are interested in the level of fuzziness in certain genomic_locations with respect to coding_regions i e well positioned for all the cells in the sample orblurred or how strong is the binding between nucleosomes and dna to address these shortcomings we propose a method that determines the accurate position of the nucleosomes independently from the amount of overlaps in the nucleosomes this method can also extract other important statistics about nucleosomes e g the probability that a nucleosome is actually present a measure of nucleosome fuzziness and the size of dna_fragments enriched for nucleosomes here we propose a parametric probabilistic_model for nucleosome_positioning which we called normal for nucleosome mapping algorithm normal uses expectation_maximization em to infer its parameters to demonstrate the performance of our method we report experimental_results on maine seq data for plasmodium_falciparum and saccharomyces_cerevisiae we compare the performance of our method against the template filtering tf algorithm which is considered the current state of the art in terms of accuracy and ability to estimate sizes of the dna_fragments bound to nucleosomes we also discuss a fundamental limitation of greedy peak_calling approaches in the case of overlapping nucleosomes and how our method addresses this issue we described a parametric probabilistic_model for nucleosomes positioning framed in the context on a modified gaussian_mixture our method directly addresses the challenges imposed by overlapping and fuzzy nucleosomes their detection and the inference of their characteristics we demonstrated with a synthetic example that the current state of the art method does not properly handle complex overlapping configurations we have also shown that normal is significantly more robust to user_defined parameters on real_data our method detects a higher number of nucleosomes although our method is currently slower than tf the processing time is still modest compared to other steps in the sequencing pipeline and we believe the efficiency of normal can be improved
