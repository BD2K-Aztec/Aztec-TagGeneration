data_and wave spec a preprocessing package for mass_spectrometry data wave spec is a pre_processing package for mass_spectrometry ms data the package includes several novel algorithms that overcome conventional difficulties with the pre_processing of such data in this application note we demonstrate step_by use of this package on a real_world maldi dataset availability the package can be downloaded at http www vicc org biostatistics supp php a shared mailbox wave spec vanderbilt edu also is available for questions regarding application of the package this paper demonstrates how the wave spec package works as an application note designed to complement a wave spec method paper published_previously the rest of this paper is organized as a step_by demonstration on real maldi_tof data and follows the procedure presented in supplementary
