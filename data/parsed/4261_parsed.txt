sequence_analysis simultaneous alignment and clustering of peptide data using a gibbs_sampling approach_motivation proteins recognizing short peptide_fragments play_a in cellular_signaling as a result of high_throughput peptide binding_protein specificities can be studied using large peptide_libraries at dramatically lower cost and time interpretation of such large peptide_datasets however is a complex task especially when the data contain multiple receptor binding_motifs and or the motifs are found at different locations within distinct peptides results the algorithm presented in this article based on gibbs_sampling identifies multiple specificities in peptide data by performing two essential tasks simultaneously alignment and clustering of peptide data we apply the method to de convolute binding_motifs in a panel of peptide_datasets with different degrees of complexity spanning from the simplest case of pre aligned fixed_length peptides to cases of unaligned peptide_datasets of variable_length example applications described in this article include mixtures of binders to different mhc_class and class_ii distinct classes of ligands for sh_domains and sub specificities of the hla a molecule availability the gibbs clustering method is available online as a web_server at http www cbs dtu dk services gibbscluster peptides are short amino_acid occurring ubiquitously in biological_processes such as metabolism signal_transduction and immune_response they are also extensively used in research to mimic functional or linear structural_aspects of proteins and protein interactions the advantage of using peptides lies in the relative_ease in generating large_libraries of sequences such as in phage_display technologies more recently developments in high_throughput peptide microarrays have allowed producing large_scale datasets of peptide ligand interactions and have been applied to various problems including antibodyantigen interactions peptidemhc binding kinase binding_motifs and other receptor_ligand identifying receptor_ligand binding_motifs within peptide_datasets is a highly challenging_task for at least two major reasons which we term alignment and poly specificity the alignment problem arises because most receptor motifs are weak and short making identification of the binding register within the ligands not trivial the poly specificity problem arises because receptor_ligand datasets often contain multiple motifs either owing to the experimental_setup or to the actual poly specificity of the receptor several bioinformatics_methods have been developed attempting to deal with these challenges and detect subtle sequence signals in peptide_datasets including motif alignment gibbs_sampling hidden_markov and artificial_neural in particular artificial_neural have shown a high performance on this kind of data significant correlations between residues have been found in peptide interaction_domains although positional correlations can be accurately captured by artificial_neural the specificities of such domains can in many cases more intuitively be represented by multiple position_specific pssm multiple pssms allow visualizing poly specificities as sequence_logos of the different binding_modes although the above methods attempt to deal with the challenges involved in motif identification in peptide_datasets they all suffer from the limitations of only dealing with single specificities or requiring the input_data to be pre aligned to a common motif in this article we describe a novel approach for effective alignment and clustering of peptide data going beyond these limitations in the gibbs clustering method alignment and specificity clustering are performed_simultaneously by sampling the space of possible solutions using a gibbs_sampling strategy each cluster is represented by a pssm and the method aims at maximizing the information content of individual matrices while minimizing the overlap between distinct clusters the gibbs clustering_algorithm performs two essential tasks simultaneously alignment and clustering of peptide data here we use the method to de convolute binding_motifs in a panel of different peptide_datasets with different degrees of complexity spanning from the simplest case of pre aligned fixed_length peptides to cases of unaligned peptide_datasets of variable_length more details about the datasets are given as supplementary_material we proposed an efficient algorithm to identify multiple specificities in peptide_datasets the applications of the method are numerous ranging from the deconvolution of poly specificities contained in a dataset to the analysis of sub specificities within a known binding_motif the algorithm aims at identifying the solution the set of clusters and corresponding alignments that optimally fits the peptide dataset the optimal_solution is automatically selected and the identified binding_motifs are visualized as individual sequence_logos using a panel of benchmark_datasets we have demonstrated the power of the gibbs clustering method in deconvoluting poly specificities contained both in pre aligned and unaligned peptide_datasets covering the mhc_class mhc_class and human sh_domain systems gibbs_sampling is a powerful approach to explore large spaces of possible solutions in the case of amino_acid there are immense possible ways of aligning and clustering them as soon as the number of sequences becomes bigger than a handful the probabilistic nature of gibbs_sampling allows efficient sampling of the search_space and convergence towards a state of high fitness of the system compared with other motif identification methods gibbs clustering is unique in that it incorporates alignment and clustering in a set of alternative sampling moves allowing for simultaneous identification of clusters and optimal sequence_alignment this property makes the method capable of identifying subtle and relatively weak binding_motifs as demonstrated for the case of mhc_class binding_motifs but it comes at the price of computational speed analysing the peptides in the mhc_class binding dataset takes a little min using gibbs clustering this running time is reduced to s using the musi algorithm yet at the cost of a dramatic and significant drop in accuracy in a general situation it is not known a priori how many motifs are contained in a dataset when presented with a set of experimental_data the investigator ideally wants a definitive answer to the question how many motifs are contained in my data unfortunately the answer is not unambiguous not so much for a fault of mathematical and computational_methods rather for the ambiguity of the question the answer depends on the level of resolution that is expected for the particular problem at hand if the goal is a rough classification of sequences based on global differences then the resulting number of clusters will be small conversely more partitions would be produced if we were searching for subtler distinguishing sequence characteristics the true number of clusters is therefore not an objective answer but depends on the kind of biological_question that is being asked in the gibbs clustering_algorithm we introduce a parameter that aims to modulate the degree of resolution required by the user high penalizes overlap between clusters and tends to create coarser clusters whereas low results in smaller and specialized clusters for example we showed that for a certain value of we could accurately identify the number of mhc_class contained in a dataset of mixed specificities in another example we split one of these very same specificities into sub motifs and looked for subtle differences in a rather homogenous population of peptides these are not the extremes one could conceive partitioning the data further into more specialized sub populations as well as obtaining a coarser picture of similarities between alleles the same data may have different levels of resolution depending on the aim of the analysis and the investigator should keep this in mind when using a classification_method like the one presented here the gibbs clustering method in its current form is limited to handle situations where motifs are of uniform length likewise the method can only handle amino_acid input_data the reason for this limitation is that most of its unique features like pseudo count estimates from blosum substitution matrices and sequence weighting of are specific for amino_acid data in conclusion we believe the gibbs clustering method to be both a highly_accurate and very user_friendly that will allow researchers to interpret peptide_datasets in terms of receptor specificities in a highly intuitive manner therefore we expect it to become an important tool as large_scale peptide chip sub motifs of hla a binding_specificity the peptides in the two clusters have similar affinity but differ significantly in stability the sequence_logo in the left panel is composed mainly of stable peptides th h whereas peptides in the second group have lower stability th h technologies grow to be a cost_effective and accessible platform for investigation of protein_ligand the method is highly customizable and publicly_available as an online web_server at http www cbs dtu dk services
