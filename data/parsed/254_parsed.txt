sequence_analysis advance_access ampa an automated web_server for prediction of protein antimicrobial regions ampa is a web_application for assessing the antimicrobial domains of proteins with a focus on the design on new antimicrobial_drugs the application provides fast discovery of antimicrobial patterns in proteins that can be used to develop new peptide based drugs against pathogens results are shown in a user_friendly graphical_interface and can be downloaded as raw_data for later examination availability ampa is freely_available on the web atthe widespread use of antibiotics has promoted the emergence of antibiotic_resistant that often pose serious health_problems many efforts have been directed toward finding alternative antibiotics unaffected by resistance_mechanisms antimicrobial_peptides amps are regarded as one of the most promising alternatives in this regard amps usually act through membrane permeation receptorindependent mechanisms that greatly reduce the risk of inducing resistance in microorganisms moreover many amps are active against a wide_diversity of pathogens including gram_negative fungi and parasites all these features make amps attractive candidates for fighting microbial_infection a growing interest therefore exists for identifying natural amp leads that can be developed into novel antibiotics an increasing number of proteins and peptides with antimicrobial_effects have been identified in many organisms many of such proteins belonging to the innate_defense system but others are unrelated to immune_response the design of new amps based on these proteins is hampered by the fact that the mechanisms of their
