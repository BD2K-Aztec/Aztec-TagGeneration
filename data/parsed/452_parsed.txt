genome_analysis a probabilistic_approach to explore human mirna targetome by integrating mirna overexpression data and sequence_information motivation systematic identification of microrna mirna_targets remains a challenge the mirna overexpression coupled with genome_wide is a promising new approach and calls for a new method that integrates expression and sequence_information results we developed a probabilistic scoring_method called targetscore targetscore infers mirna_targets as the transformed fold changes weighted by the bayesian posteriors given observed target features to this end we compiled datasets from gene_expression corresponding to human tissue or cells and distinct transfected mirnas comparing with other methods targetscore achieves significantly_higher accuracy in identifying known targets in most tests moreover the confidence targets from targetscore exhibit comparable protein downregulation and are more significantly_enriched for gene_ontology using targetscore we explored oncomironcogenes network and predicted several potential cancer related mirnamessenger rna interactions availability_and targetscore is available at bioconductor micrornas mirnas repress protein production in animal_species by forming watsoncrick base_pairing to the untranslated_regions of the target messenger_rnas mrnas the binding primarily occurs at the nt positions from the end of the mirna which is termed as the seed and the binding as the seed match mirna regulations have been implicated in numerous developmental and pathogenic processes functional characterization of mirnas depends on precise identification of their targets however it has proved difficult to experimentally identify mirnamrna interactions to date according to mirtarbase only interactions between mirnas and target_genes in human have been confirmed using high_confidence low_throughput assays such as western_blot on the other hand computational_prediction provides a rapid alternative method to identify putative mirna_targets that can be subsequently validated however accurate prediction of mirna_targets remains a challenge with the current state of the art algorithms achieving specificity and having poor agreement among them most of these prediction programs are based on sequence complementarity evolutionary_conservation free_energy and or target_site accessibility although it is shown that evolutionary_conservation can improve signalto noise ratios the conservation approach is limited as not all of the functional target_sites are conserved e g lineage and species specific target_sites and vice_versa in particular the performance of conservation based_methods drops drastically when restricted to only mammalian_genomes because of short evolutionary time similarly the energy or accessibility based_methods rely on secondary_structure prediction_tools such as rnafold which itself has room for improvements these limitations also underscore the historical lack of genome_wide functional data that measure the in vivo impact of mirna regulation which was alleviated by the recent_developments of transcriptomic and proteomic_profiling methods particularly overexpression of mirna coupled with expression_profiling of mrna by either microarray or rna_seq has proved to be a promising approach consequently genome_wide comparison of differential_gene holds a new promise to elucidate the global impact of a specific mirna regulation without solely relying on evolutionary_conservation to improve the prediction of relative repression of mrna several studies have proposed a series of additional determinants including seed match type mer seed mer ta mer m and mer number of target_sites site relative location on the untranslated_region local au content supplementary paring seed pairing stability and target_site abundance which are combined together in a single value termed as the context score made available from targetscan web_site accordingly we hypothesize that target prediction can be improved by integrating expression change and sequence_information such as context score and to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com other orthogonal sequence_based features such as conservation into a probabilistic score the proposed model differs from most of the previous expression based target prediction_methods in three important aspects first our model is specifically_designed for mirnaoverexpression experiments to interrogate targets of a particular mirna in a specific cell condition to our knowledge only a few methods are suitable for such task most existing_methods such as genmir and groupmir are based on global mirna_target expression correlation which requires a large set of expression_profiles of both mrna and mirna measured across various distinct conditions and may miss targets that are specific to only a subset of the input samples second the proposed model is unsupervised such that it infers mirna_targets solely based on their distinct high_dimensional patterns of expression fold changes and sequence_features however the existing_methods are mostly regression_based frameworks by treating gene_expression as response and mirna_expression as input variables or supervised_learning by explicitly operating on a training_dataset of confidence positive_and targets which are incomplete and difficult to obtain third our method operates on the entire gene_set to more closely model the overall likelihood rather than only on a subset of genes prefiltered by targetscan score or sample variance most of recently_developed mirna_target prediction_methods exhibit a paradigm_shift from rule_based binary_classification to a more context dependent quantitative and probabilistic_approach the momentum of this shift is largely facilitated by the increasing amount of expression_profiling data of mrnas and mirnas across various experimental_conditions however most of these expression based_methods are based on correlation and thus require a large set of expression_profiles of mrnas and mirnas across various tissues cell_lines or patients which limit their applications to only a general survey of the robust mirna_targets rather than condition specific mirna_targets on the other hand expression_profiling following specific mirna transfection knockin provides the most direct clue to identify in vivo functional mirna_targets however expression data measured by either microarrays or rna_seq are noisy and it is known that changes in expression can be caused by indirect regulatory effect by mirnas which is not easily distinguishable from direct effects without the aid of sequence_based information to our knowledge few programs are specifically developed for transfection based mirna_target among them sylamer is the earliest work developed to identify enriched k_mer motifs which are the seed regions among the top_ranked targets based on p values obtained from t test van thus the method does not model the distribution of fold changes or sequence_features instead sylamer is mainly designed to visually inspect the enrichment of k_mer patterns rather than predicting specific targets in this article we introduce targetscore a bayesian probabilistic scoring_method taking_into both the fold_change due to mirna overexpression and sequence_based information the proposed method is similar to expmicro however expmicro requires training data to calculate the sequence_based scores using svmicro and used only a twocomponent gmm to model the fold changes in contrast targetscore models the distributions of multiple sets of precomputed or user supplied sequence_based scores and fold changes using respective two and three component vb gmm we complied to our knowledge the largest set of overexpression data compendium and demonstrated the utilities of targetscore in extensive tests targetscore achieved superior roc and pr performances and s the cumulative protein outputs for mir as a function of the top rankings from targetscore reveals the second deepest protein downregulation comparing with the top targets from other methods thus the relative overall trends at the protein level are consistent with the predictions at the mrna_level where targetscore dominates most of the tests moreover targetscore targets are more enriched for meaningful bp when compared with targets predicted by other methods and supplementary using targetscore we constructed an oncomironcogene regulatory_network and hypothesized that our predicted oncomironcogene interactions may provide further insights into cancer network the success of our method underlines the importance of integrating preferably independent informative predictors into a unified_framework on the other hand the absolute pr performances are generally poor among all tested methods perhaps because of the limited number of validated targets and or the limitations of the methods although targetscore compares_favorably with the published_methods there are a few issues that remain to be addressed in future work several studies have shown that the expression fold_change also depends on the initial abundance and the natural decay or turnover_rate of the corresponding mrna_species presumably a future target prediction algorithm will benefit from the use of this information in a cell specific context additionally targetscore assumes that the mrna_targets are independent of each other however have shown that mirnas that have a higher number of available target_transcripts will downregulate each individual target_gene to a lesser extent than those with a lower number of targets although the context score from targetscancs has incorporated the static target abundance information as the total number of target_sites that can be recognized by the same mirna it would be more realistic to consider the underlying expression_level of the co targeted mrna to infer the actual available target_sites comprises oncomironcogene interactions where are validated predicted with targetscore involving oncomirs yellow and oncogenes white the red solid and blue dash edges are the validated and predicted interactions respectively the size of the node is proportional to the connection degree edge widths are proportional to the targetscore
