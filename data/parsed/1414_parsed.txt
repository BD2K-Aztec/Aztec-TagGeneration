discriminating precursors of common fragments for large_scale metabolite_profiling by triple_quadrupole motivation the goal of large_scale metabolite_profiling is to compare the relative concentrations of as many metabolites extracted from biological_samples as possible this is typically accomplished by measuring the abundances of thousands of ions with high_resolution and high_mass mass_spectrometers although the data from these instruments provide a comprehensive fingerprint of each sample identifying the structures of the thousands of detected ions is still challenging and time intensive an alternative less comprehensive approach is to use triple_quadrupole qqq mass spec trometry to analyze predetermined sets of metabolites typically fewer than several hundred this is done using authentic_standards to develop qqq experiments that specifically_detect only the targeted metabolites with the advantage that the need for ion identification after profiling is eliminated results here we propose a framework to extend the application of qqq mass_spectrometers to large_scale metabolite_profiling we aim to provide a foundation for designing qqq multiple_reaction mrm experiments for each of the metabolites in the metlin metabolite database first we identify common fragmentation products from the experimental fragmentation data in metlin then we model the likelihoods of each precursor structure in metlin producing each common fragmentation product with these likelihood estimates we select ensembles of common fragmentation products that minimize our uncertainty about metabolite identities we demonstrate encouraging performance and based on our results we suggest how our method can be integrated with future work to develop large_scale mrm experiments availability_and our predictions supplementary results and the code for estimating likelihoods and selecting ensembles of fragmentation reactions are made available on the lab website at http pattilab wustl edu fragpred large_scale metabolite_profiling aims to compare the relative concentrations of as many metabolites as possible between two or more groups of biological_samples this is generally done using high_resolution high_mass quadrupole time offlight qtof or orbitrap mass_spectrometers to measureabundances of thousands of ions the rate_limiting when using these instruments is establishing metabolite identifications obtaining fragmentation data are often necessary for metabolite_identification but there are challenges with both acquiring a breadth of high_quality fragmentation data on targeted precursor ions and with identifying structures given the resulting fragmentation data as such very few of the thousands of ions detected in large_scale metabolite_profiling experiments are structurally identified several frameworks exist for using fragmentation data collected with qtof or orbitrap instruments to structurally identify detected ions the most robust approach is to match the fragmentation spectrum of a research sample to the fragmentation spectrum of an authentic standard this can be done in cases where an experimental_spectrum matches a reference spectrum in a database or when the correct reference spectrum can be generated in the lab when there is no matching reference spectrum computational_methods can be applied to prioritize the structures most likely to have generated the experimental fragmentation spectrum these methods fall into two categories those that first precompute a spectrum for every structure in a database and then match the experimental_spectrum against the in silico generated spectra and those that predict the structural_features that likely generated the observed spectrum and then prioritize putatively matched database structures on the basis of structural_similarity an alternate widely used approach for metabolite_profiling relies on triple_quadrupole qqq mass_spectrometers metabolite_profiling with qqq mass_spectrometers is accomplished by performing targeted analysis on a relatively small number of compounds this can be employed in a discovery context to assay whether the concentration of a targeted list of metabolites changes between biological_samples although qqq based metabolite_profiling provides information about only a limited number of compounds a major advantage of this approach is that metabolite identifications can be made efficiently once qqq methods are established to design a qqq method researchers generally purchase commercial standards and use them to identify precursor to product ion transitions that can be readily measured by using the qqq in either multiple_reaction mrm or fragmentation product scanning mode the objective is to identify combinations of precursor fragment pairs that are specific to the metabolite being profiled although the specificity is often not assessed explicitly to date qqq based_methods have not been applied to profile more than several hundred metabolites here we explore the possibility of extending the use of qqq based experiments to analyze the portion of the thousands of detected ions that match a precursor mass in the metlin metabolite database first we identify common fragmentation products from the experimental_data in metlin then we model the likelihoods of each precursor structure in metlin producing each common fragmentation product with these likelihood estimates we select ensembles of common fragmentation products that minimize our uncertainty about metabolite identities on the basis of these results we suggest how our method can be integrated with future work to develop large_scale mrm experiments
