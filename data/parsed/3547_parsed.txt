sequence_analysis phylogenomic analysis of bacterial and archaeal sequences with amphora with the explosive_growth of bacterial and archaeal sequence_data large_scale phylogenetic_analyses present both opportunities and challenges here we describe amphora an automated phylogenomic inference tool that can be used for high_throughput high_quality genome tree reconstruction and metagenomic phylotyping compared with its predecessor amphora has several major enhancements and new functions it has a greatly expanded phylogenetic marker database and can analyze both bacterial and archaeal sequences it incorporates probability based sequence_alignment masks that improve the phylogenetic accuracy it can analyze dna as well as protein_sequences and is more sensitive in marker identification finally it is over faster in metagenomic phylotyping although the small_subunit ssu_rrna is the gold_standard in microbial_diversity studies it has its limitations for one it has been shown that the gc compositional bias in rrna could cause misleading phylogenetic artifacts for another rrna makes up only a tiny fraction of any given genome therefore the organismal phylogeny based on rrna alone needs to be corroborated with the analyses of other phylogenetic markers thirdly there are large variations in the rrna copy_number in different bacterial and archaeal species which prevents the use of rrna for accurate estimation of the relative_abundance of species in a population protein_coding such as ef_tu rpob reca and hsp have been used as alternative phylogenetic markers to complement rrna based analyses because their sequences are conserved at the amino_acid level protein_coding offer at least two advantages over rrna i their protein_sequences are less sensitive to gc compositional bias ii their fast evolving nucleotide_sequences have more power to resolve the relationships to whom correspondence should be addressed between closely_related organisms in the past the use of proteincoding_genes in phylogenetic_analyses has been hindered largely by the lack of available protein_sequences recent explosive_growth of microbial genomic_sequences however has transformed the way we study microbial_diversity for example now many genes can be combined to make robust genome trees which could serve as a framework for genome based bacterial and archaeal classification the use of dozens of protein marker_genes in addition to rrna also greatly_increases the power of metagenomic phylotyping furthermore many of the protein marker_genes are single_copy gene in the genome therefore the species_composition estimated from these markers should be more accurate than that estimated based on rrna the promise of phylogenomics comes with new challenges first we need to select a set of robust marker_genes that are universally distributed and are relatively recalcitrant to lateral gene transfers second we need an efficient way of identifying their orthologs and not just homologs from genomic_scale sequences and of rapidly aligning them with the reference_sequences third to make high_quality trees we need to filter out the unreliable alignment regions prior to the phylogenetic_inference the original amphora package was designed to overcome these bottlenecks for automated high_throughput high_quality phylogenomic analyses however several issues remain to address_these we redesigned amphora made significant enhancements and incorporated new algorithms and functions we named it amphora and describe it below
