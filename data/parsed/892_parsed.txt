systems_biology cddapp a cytoscape app for accessing the ncbi conserved_domain motivation cddapp is a cytoscape extension that supports the annotation of protein networks with information about domains and specific functional sites from the national center for biotechnology informations conserved_domain cdd cdd information is loaded for nodes annotated with ncbi numbers or uniprot identifiers and optionally protein_data structures cddapp integrates with the cytoscape apps structureviz and enhancedgraphics together these three apps provide_powerful to annotate nodes with cdd domain and site information and visualize that information in both network and structural contexts availability_and cddapp is written in java and freely_available for download from the cytoscape app store http apps cytoscape org documentation is provided atthe functional_annotation of proteins is critical to understanding biology in most proteins units of biological_function are domains that contain key active_sites critical structural_components or interaction sites a single protein may contain one or more domains and the acquisition of domains can provide new interaction_partners or new functions one approach to inferring basic protein_function is to characterize the functional_domains that the protein contains the national center for bioinformatics informations ncbi conserved_domain cdd is a repository of manually_curated and computationally derived protein domain_family models that are searchable through a web_interface or web_services the conserved domains cds in the cdd database are organized into families of cds related by common evolutionary ancestry structurally and functionally_important regions of the domain are annotated based on literature and structural evidence wherever possible in each of the cd this resource is a valuable_tool for researchers looking to identify or assign functions of individual proteins another commonly used tool for inference and analysis of biological_function is cytoscape cytoscape is an open_source desktop_application for the visualization and analysis of biological_networks including pathways protein_protein and proteinprotein similarity networks cytoscape includes an extension mechanism that allows developers to add apps to cytoscape that enhance its analytical or visualization capabilities cytoscape and the cdd are complementary but no mechanism exists to allow using these tools together we embarked on a collaborative_effort to link cytoscapes network_visualization and analysis features with the cdd domain annotations to support researchers interested in exploring functional_annotation of proteins in a network context will only appear if the structureviz app is also loaded the cdd domains panel also has checkboxes to use the enhancedgraphics app if loaded to paint pie charts for domains and features onto nodes all cdd annotations are stored in cytoscapes default node table and are saved as part of the session
