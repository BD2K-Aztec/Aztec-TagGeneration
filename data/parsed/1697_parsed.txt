exploring classification strategies with the coepra contest motivation in silico methods to classify compounds as potential drugs that bind to a specific target become increasingly important for drug_design to build classification devices training_sets of drugs with known activities are needed for many such classification_problems not only qualitative but also quantitative information of a specific property e g binding_affinity is available the latter can be used to build a regression scheme to predict this property for new compounds predicting a compound property explicitly is generally more difficult than classifying that the property lies below or above a given threshold value hence an indirect classification that is based on regression may lead to poorer results than a direct classification_scheme in fact initially researchers are only interested to classify compounds as potential drugs the activities of these compounds are subsequently measured in wet_lab results we propose a novel approach that uses available quantitative information directly for classification rather than first using a regression scheme it uses a new type of loss function called weighted biased regression application of this method to four widely_studied datasets of the coepra contest comparative_evaluation of prediction_algorithms http coepra org shows that it can outperform simple classification methods that do not make use of this additional quantitative information availability a stand alone application is available at the webpage http agknapp chemie fu berlin de agknapp index php menu software page peptideclassifier that can be used to build a model for a peptide training_set to be submitted molecular classification_problems are common in many fields of chemistry biochemistry pharmacy medicinal diagnostics and other applications in modern life_sciences in an empirical regression or classification_problem one considers objects that possess a specific common relationship characterized by object specific target values for drug molecules these target values may relate to a property that characterizes binding in a regression_problem these target values vary continuously in an interval these can for instance be binding_affinities of drugs that bind to the same receptor for a classification_problem the objects are labeled according to the group to whom correspondence should be addressed they belong to using discrete target values to solve a classification or regression_problem we need to correlate the individual objects with their respective target values target values for a two class classification_problem are for instance t that can be used to characterize objects of the positive negative class to construct an empirical device regressor or classifier to predict unknown target values one needs a training_set of related objects with known target values such molecular regression and classification_problems are addressed in the comparative_evaluation of prediction_algorithms coepra competition http www coepra org the coepra competition can be seen in analogy to casp critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure that focuses on protein_structure while coepra deals with regression and classification_problems of biological active_molecules on an average research groups participated in the four coepra classification contests to solve the classification tasks different approaches were used by the participating groups ranging from applications of support_vector svm artificial_neural naive bayesian_decision least square optimization decision_trees random_forest methods and new classification methods such as kscore coepra considers exclusively oligopeptides from which the sequences and alternatively physico_chemical descriptors comprising many different features were provided at the coepra webpage in a way a classifier regressor observes the objects molecules through eyes that are defined by the features used as descriptor other sets of features considering global physicochemical and sterical properties of the whole peptide such as volume molecular_weight or solvent_accessible or evolutionary residue similarities such as blosum matrices can be used alternatively since the number of peptides for each classification and regression task of coepra is very small the number of descriptors has to be small as well to avoid over parameterization this was solved by the participants in different ways some used small feature_sets like the peptide sequence_based features others massively reduced the number of physico chemical_features by applying principal_component genetic_algorithms ant colony optimization or simple filters this wide_range of methods applied by different groups makes the coepra contest an ideal test ground to explore different training and prediction schemes when predicting a certain property of a molecule researchers are often just interested whether the value of this property is below or above a certain threshold thus one can classify candidate molecules from a large set of molecules for the most interesting molecules the property values are subsequently measured in wet_lab however when building predictors the exact property or target values are often available this information is routinely used when building a regressor which tries to predict the property values for new molecules but predicting property values is more demanding than to predict just the classes to which the molecules belong to hence predicting a property value by regression with subsequent classification is expected to introduce larger uncertainties than solving the classification_problem directly but the additional information of the specific property values could be of use to solve the classification_problem more reliably the classification methods used in this study consider such quantitative information of the target value directly that is normally only used for regression thus improving classification results considerably
