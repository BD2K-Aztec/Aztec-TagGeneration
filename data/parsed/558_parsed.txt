gene_expression a sub pathway based_approach for identifying drug response principal network motivation the high redundancy of and high degree of cross_talk between biological_pathways hint that a sub pathway may respond more effectively or sensitively than the whole pathway however few current pathway_enrichment methods account for the sub pathways or structures of the tested pathways we present a sub pathway based enrichment approach for identifying a drug response principal network which takes into consideration the quantitative structures of the pathways result we validated this new approach on a microarray experiment that captures the transcriptional_profile of dexamethasone dex treated human prostate_cancer pc_cells compared with genetrail and david our approach is more sensitive to the dex response pathways specifically not only pathways but also the principal_components of sub pathways and networks related to prostate_cancer and dex response could be identified and verified by literatureit is increasingly important to understand the effects of treatment drugs on cellular_pathways and networks microarrays provide a novel way to investigate the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously with a view to dissecting the molecular_pathways with the availability of biological pathway_databases such as the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg or biocarta www biocarta com several resources have been developed to visualize and analyze microarray_data in the context of known biological_networks pathways a number of statistical_tests combined with known biological_databases for detecting significant pathways are available for data interpretation including genmapp to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as chipinfo david gominer gsea p onto tools and genetrail these functional analysis tools are valuable but are unsuitable for the detection of drug response pathways due to a number of limitations first most traditional strategies use only pre selected gene_lists often the differentially_expressed to compute the statistic that tests the enrichment of each pathway common statistical_methods such as chi_square fishers_exact binomial probability and hypergeometric_distribution are used to compare number of genes in the list that coincide with a given pathway by random chance neglecting less relevant_genes and merely counting the number of pathway members contained in the reduced list leads to loss of information such as gene_order in the pathways second while the prevalent gene_set gsea does account for gene_order the effect of the gene_set size the influence of other gene_sets and normalization procedures may lead to inaccurate assessment of statistical_significance in some instances third the correlation_structure of pathways is not considered a pathway extracted from biological_databases is the collection of specific sub pathways or modules that perform certain functions different sub pathways may perform the same function in the same pathway and different pathways may use the same sub pathways in similar roles testing the whole pathway is too universal to determine which individual sub pathways respond to a particular biological condition fourth drug_induced cell microarray_experiments usually contain few samples typically a treated sample and a control sample thus the pathway significance_test is limited to the traditional strategies mentioned above to overcome_these we propose a framework of sub pathway based strategy to identify the drug response pathways network the framework consists of the generation of a large number of relative sub pathways sub graphs of the pathways obtained from the kegg public database mapping of the unfiltered expression data onto them and statistically scoring for identification of the principal component of sub pathways pcss that is most perturbed by two stage designs pcss are then combined into a larger drug response network on which topological and biological analyses are performed in an analysis of the dexamethasone dex dataset we found that this approach can enhance the biological_interpretation of drug effect page
