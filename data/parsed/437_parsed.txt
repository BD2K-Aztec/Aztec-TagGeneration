structural_bioinformatics application of asymmetric statistical_potentials to antibody protein_docking motivation an effective docking algorithm for antibodyprotein anti gen complex prediction is an important first step toward design of biologics and vaccines we have recently_developed a new class of knowledge based interaction potentials called decoys as the reference_state dars and incorporated dars into the docking program piper based on the fast_fourier correlation approach although piper was the best performer in the latest rounds of the capri protein_docking experiment it is much less accurate for docking antibodyprotein antigen pairs than other types of complexes in spite of incorporating sequence_based information on the location of the paratope analysis of antibodyprotein antigen_complexes has revealed an inherent asymmetry within these interfaces specifically phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine_residues highly populate the paratope of the antibody but not the epitope of the antigen results since this asymmetry cannot be adequately modeled using a symmetric pairwise potential we have removed the usual assumption of symmetry interaction statistics were extracted from antibodypro tein complexes under the assumption that a particular atom on the antibody is different from the same atom on the antigen protein the use of the new potential significantly_improves the performance of docking for antibodyprotein antigen_complexes even without any sequence_information on the location of the paratope we note that the asymmetric potential captures the effects of the multi body interactions inherent to the complex environment in the antibodyprotein antigen interface availability the method is implemented in the cluspro protein_docking server available at http cluspro proteinprotein_docking methods have significantly_improved in the last few years according to the last round of the blind protein_docking experiment capri automated protein_docking servers performed comparably well with the top human predictor groups without the use of biological_information in particular our protein_docking server cluspro was the top protein_docking server as well as within the top of all predictors despite these improvements the docking of an antibody to its protein antigen an important first step toward computational_design of biologics and vaccines remains particularly challenging for both cluspro and other methods we note that although we focus on interactions between antibodies and proteins for simplicity we define the problem as antibody antigen docking it is no doubt that the relatively weak performance represents the state of art in protein_docking in fact found cluspro to better predict epitopes than methods that have been specifically developed for such predictions although they used an earlier and less accurate version of the server it is easy to see why docking antigenantibody pairs is much more difficult than docking inhibitors to enzymes enzymeinhibitor complexes generally exhibit excellent surface complementarity with the convex inhibitor matching the concave binding_site of the enzyme most of the native enzymeinhibitor interfaces also have favorable hydrophobic and polar interactions which facilitate docking and scoring in contrast the interfaces in antibodyantigen complexes are mostly flat and less hydrophobic the flat interface implies that searching for surface complementarity provides little help in docking in addition the polar interactions are more sensitive to atomic positions than the hydrophobic ones and hence scoring based on molecular_mechanics energy_functions including electrostatics becomes less reliable due to the inevitable conformational_differences between free and bound protein_structures thus it is very important to develop scoring_functions that account for these specific properties of the interface and can help finding near native complex structures it was shown by several groups that the inclusion of structure based potentials in the energy function used for the docking can significantly improve performance here we describe the development and testing of an accurate pairwise interaction potential specific to antibodyantigen complexes based on statistical_mechanics structure based potentials are traditionally derived from the inverse boltzmann principle assuming that frequently observed structural states are low_energy states in the first order approximation to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as molecular_interactions can be decomposed as the sum of pairwise atomatom interactions the energy of interaction can be written as where k is the boltzmann constant t the temperature p obs ij the probability of interactions between atoms of types i and j in an observed set e g crystal_structures and p ref ij is the probability of atoms of types i and j being within the interaction distance in a state without any atom_type specific interactions the reference_state we have recently reported a pairwise interaction potential called decoys as the reference_state dars the idea of dars is generating a large set of docked conformations with good shape_complementarity but without accounting for atom types and using the frequency of interactions extracted from these dars in principle the resulting potential is ideal for finding near native conformations among structures obtained by docking and can be combined with other energy_terms to be used directly in docking_calculations accordingly we incorporated dars into the energy function used by our docking program piper based on the fast_fourier fft correlation approach piper can perform global docking of unbound protein_structures without any a priori information on the structure of the complex and was the best performing method in the latest round of the capri protein_docking experiment dars improved the docking_results for all classes of complexes for enzymeinhibitor pairs dars provides both excellent discrimination and docking_results even with very small decoy_sets with a few exceptions the dars docking_results are also good for complexes that occur in signal_transduction however for antibodyantigen pairs results were substantially worse than for other types of complexes although dars performed slightly better than some earlier interaction potentials the results were poor even when the location of the complementarity_determining cdrs on the antibody was determined based on sequence_information and the search was constrained to include the cdrs in the interface analyzing the potential sources of poor_performance for antibodyantigen pairs we arrived at the conclusions that the main_problem is the inherent asymmetry of the interface in these types of complexes we recall that the pairwise structure based potentials to model proteinprotein_interactions automatically assume the symmetry of interactions between atoms on the two sides of the interface i e that irecjlig jrecilig where i rec j rec are atom types on the receptor and i lig j lig are atom types on the ligand however it is easy to show that the assumption of symmetry limits the performance of the potential in antibodyantigen docking as shown in there is usually a large hydrophobic region on the paratope of the antibody containing a large number of tyrosines tryptophans and phenylalanines thus these three residues occur with high_frequency in the interface this is supported by residue interaction statistics gathered on the antibodyprotein interaction dataset as shown in supplementary table s based on these statistics interactions between the atoms of these residues and any other atom on the other side of the interface appear to be favorable resulting in a large negative pairwise energy term addition of this term will improve the location of the interface and thus the near native_conformation if these residues are on the paratope of the antibody however the tyrosines tryptophans and phenylalanines on the antigen side are not found in the epitope with any higher frequency than on any other part of the protein thus a favorable interaction_term for these residues on the antigen leads to false_positives incorrectly predicting that any region of the antigen rich in these residues is likely to be part of the epitope which is generally not the case the concept of symmetry is generally_accepted for pairwise potentials because interaction_forces between two isolated atoms or molecules are symmetric most structure based potentials have been derived from folded protein_structures where the symmetric pairwise assumption ignoring multi body interaction_terms was the natural first choice these potentials proved to be successful for folding and later on for docking so the assumption of symmetry has not been questioned as discussed antibodyantigen interactions clearly do not fit this framework although the deviation from symmetry may be surprising it is important to note that interactions between atoms are not pairwise and the latter assumption is just a convenient approximation thus the the antibody fragment is shown as the white solid model with magenta patches representing the regions with maximum hydrophobicity the hpr antigen is shown as a gray cartoon with dark red patches as regions of maximum hydrophobicity in the figure the antibody cdr is oriented upward showing that the cdr region includes strongly hydrophobic patches but these do not interact with regions of maximum hydrophobicity on the hpr antigen pairwise energy_terms extracted from the frequency of specific interactions observed in protein_structures or complexes represent an empirical measure of interaction_strength rather than real physical_forces developing multi body interaction potentials would be a more rigorous approach than restricting consideration to pairwise interaction but we have far from enough data for the parameterization of such potentials here we suggest an alternative approach simply removing the requirement of interaction symmetry the resulting potential preserves the general form and computational simplicity of statistical_potentials but to a certain degree accounts for the local environment of an atom and thus introduces some elements of multi body potentials to our knowledge no asymmetric potentials have been previously_reported for predicting proteinprotein_interactions we describe the development of the asymmetric dars type potential called adars based on a nonredundant dataset of antibodyantigen complexes extracted from the protein_data pdb adars has been integrated into the energy function used in the docking program piper and tested on an antibodyantigen docking benchmark we demonstrate significant improvements in the docking_results when compared with earlier symmetric potentials the resulting antibodyantigen docking protocol is included in our cluspro protein_docking server which is freely_available antibodyantigen complexes present a challenge for protein protein_docking due to their less favorable desolvation free_energies and more planar interfaces when compared with enzyme inhibitor_complexes the less favorable desolvation free_energies are due in part to their less hydrophobic interfaces interestingly there are a number of hydrophobic atoms in the interface but mostly on the antibody side whereas the epitope on the antigen may be less hydrophobic in fact this should be the case as antibodies can be developed against almost any surface of a given protein in spite of some of these surfaces being fairly polar to take advantage of these properties we have developed an aadars potential this potential shows that the atom types yc and fc from tyr trp and phe residues have a high_probability of being in the paratope and favorably contribute to the interaction_energy regardless of the type of the atoms of the epitope they interact with to test our newly_developed potential we have performed a docking test on the antibodyantigen complexes of the protein protein_docking benchmark our results demonstrate that this potential is generally quite successful in discriminating near native structures of antibodyantigen complexes in fact the potential is able to discriminate the paratope of the antibody using only biophysical_methods i e adding a priori information on the location of the cdr regions did not improve the docking_results we believe that more data i e more resolved crystal_structures of antibodyantigen complexes would improve the potential even further as we noted there were relatively few contacts for a number of the atom types more structures would ameliorate this problem possibly allowing for the introduction of additional atom types and thus enabling the development of more detailed antibodyantigen potentials we note that the asymmetric properties of interfaces are not constrained to antibodyantigen complexes in particular many signal_transduction complexes of the docking benchmark set exhibit similar features this is a topic of our current research another direction of research in docking antibodies which needs improvement is the ability to work with the models rather than experimental_structures despite the fact that antibody models are usually extremely precise the quality of docking_results tends to drop drastically when using models rather than real structures accordingly capri targets that involve docking based on homology_models are not modeled well the reason for this drop in performance can be explained by the fact that standards for modeling proteins and the quality of the structures needed for docking are very different for example we know that side_chains placement is extremely_important for protein_docking and it is totally ignored in assessment of quality for protein models also side chain placement strongly depends on the backbone and slight deviation of the backbone which will be unnoticeable in the protein model quality will strongly_affect side chain distribution and hence the docking_results masking of non cdr of the antibody
