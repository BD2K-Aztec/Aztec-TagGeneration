genome_analysis genome_wide pipeline gwaspi a desktop_application for genome_wide snp analysis and management motivation genome_wide gwas based on single_nucleotide snp_arrays are the most widely used approach to detect loci associated to human traits due to the complexity of the methods and software_packages available each with its particular format requiring intricate management workflows the analysis of gwas usually confronts scientists with steep learning curves indeed the wide_variety of tools makes the parsing and manipulation of data the most time consuming and error_prone part of a study to help resolve these issues we present gwaspi a user_friendly multiplatform desktop able application for the management and analysis of gwas data with a novel approach on database technologies to leverage the most out of commonly available desktop hardware gwaspi aims to be a start to finish gwas management application from raw_data to results containing the most common analysis tools as a result gwaspi is easy to use and reduces in up to two orders_of the time needed to perform the fundamental steps of a gwas availability freely_available on the web at http www gwaspi org implemented_in apache derby and netcdf with all major operating_systems supported genome_wide gwas have come to be the choice method to detect loci associated with human hereditary traits especially diseases the number of studies published yearly based on these arrays has constantly increased from in to in in parallel reference_databases such as hapmap hgdp and the genomes_project are being released together with an ever growing range of analytical_methods and software_packages the most common freely_available tools in the field however leave it to the user to tackle the jungle of formats and the bulk of raw to whom correspondence should be addressed data generated by gwas also learning how to apply the methods commonly used in gwass takes significant time extending an already lengthy and arduous data_gathering phase thus the steep learning_curve and the burden of manipulation of the raw_data still makes the access to gwas a costly endeavour for researchers or institutions without bioinformatics personnel to contribute to solve this problem and make gwas an achievable effort for smaller teams as well as for the sake of speeding up raw_data management in a consistent self contained way for the general researcher community we have developed the gwas pipeline gwaspi gwaspi has not been designed to replace other well established applications insofar as it does not offer the whole breadth of statistical_analysis methods used in gwas instead the current version of gwaspi focuses in casecontrol_studies and offers a solution for teams in need of concise and quickly obtained results as well as compact comprehensive and agile dataset management to complement existing analysis packages some basic quality_control features are also integrated in gwaspi the integration of key pre_processing quality_control data management analysis and reporting steps within a single application is a distinctive advantage we present in gwaspi with this application we want to offer a solid and scalable platform even if the current version focuses in basic casecontrol designs new qualitycontrol and analysis methods as well as new formats are scheduled to be added into gwaspi high_quality charts and reports sorted by relevance are generated automatically delivering the results visually and in tables reference_databases and chart navigation tools are integrated in the application providing an agile starting_point for continuing_research for the user gwaspi simplifies drastically the cumbersome workflows so common in gwas pipelines and the many intermediate data_files to be generated checked and reprocessed the learning_curve for gwaspis usage is very accessible as all available operations are documented in an online contextual help page
