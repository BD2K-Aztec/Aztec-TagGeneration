allerdictor fast allergen prediction using text classification_techniques motivation accurately identifying and eliminating allergens from biotechnology derived_products are important for human_health from a biomedical_research perspective it is also important to identify aller gens in sequenced_genomes many allergen prediction_tools have been developed during the past_years although these tools have achieved certain levels of specificity when applied to large_scale al lergen discovery e g at a whole genome_scale they still yield many false_positives and thus low precision even at low recall due to the extreme skewness of the data allergens are rare moreover the most accurate tools are relatively slow because they use protein sequence_alignment to build feature_vectors for allergen classifiers additionally only web_server implementations of the current allergen prediction_tools are publicly_available and are without the capability of large batch submission these weaknesses make large_scale allergen discovery ineffective and inefficient in the public_domain results we developed allerdictor a fast and accurate sequence_based allergen prediction_tool that models protein_sequences as text documents and uses support_vector in text classification for allergen prediction test results on multiple highly_skewed datasets demonstrated that allerdictor predicted allergens with high_precision over high recall at fast speed for example allerdictor only took min on a single core pc to scan a whole swiss_prot database of sequences and identified of them as allergens availability_and allerdictor is implemented in python and available as standalone and web_server versions atallergy is one of the most important chronic_diseases worldwide it is also one of the main causes of asthma and asthma_exacerbations which has been an increasing health issue in developed_countries allergic hypersensitivity ige type response in sensitized individuals is elicited by allergens the allergenige interaction often results in mast_cells and or basophils releasing multiple inflammatory_mediators such as histamine leukotrienes cytokines and chemokines these mediators can cause a variety of symptoms from mild to severe including sneezing itching rashes hives difficulty in breathing and asthma attacks that can lead to death it is important to identify and eliminate potential allergens from biotechnology derived_products such as genetically_modified crops vaccines and therapeutics as well as identifying allergens from sequenced_genomes however ige_mediated allergenicity is costly and difficult to assess without human data because no single factor has been recognized as a primary identifier for allergenicity therefore bioinformatics approaches have been widely used to prescreen novel sequences the fao who guideline to assess allergenicity of genetically_modified crops uses relaxed sequence_similarity criteria a protein is identified as a potential allergen if it harbors identity with a known allergen over a window of amino_acids or has six contiguous amino_acids that are also found in a known allergen fao these criteria are implemented in most of the allergen databases and tools however the fao who guideline focuses on sensitivity to prevent potential new allergens entering the food market rather than accurate prediction therefore these criteria yield high falsepositive fp rates such that their application is limited the current codex guideline does not recommend the use of the six contiguous amino_acid match criterion many methods for allergen prediction have been developed and are more accurate than the fao who pure sequence_similarity based_approach the majority of these methods is based on supervised machine_learning and differs in ways to extract useful features from amino_acid most of them rely on sequence_similarity to allergen specific peptides or motifs including stadler and stadler weballergen evaller and sortaller or to known ige epitopes such as algpred or with known allergens and putative non allergens such as allerhunter other methods use physicochemical representation of protein_structure such as appel and the structural database of allergen proteins sdap or amino_acid dipeptide composition such as algpred although current methods are significantly more accurate than the fao who approach large_scale allergen prediction using these methods is still ineffective and inefficient on large_scale to whom correspondence should be addressed data where non allergens are naturally more abundant the number of fp often exceeds the number of true_positives tp that lowers the precision and thus the usefulness of the prediction moreover the most accurate methods are relatively slow as they rely on homology and use sequence_alignment to construct feature_vectors additionally current allergen prediction_methods come pretrained in the form of web_servers without the capability of large batch submission making large_scale allergen prediction even more difficult in this article we propose a new sequence_based allergen prediction method allerdictor that can run in linear time of sequence_length and is capable of producing high_precision over high recall even on highly_skewed data allerdictor models sequences as text documents in which words are represented as overlapping k_mers generated from the sequences we found that the k_mer approach is particularly effective in allergen prediction feature construction is much faster than sequence alignmentbased methods and can be performed in linear time of sequence_length allerdictor was implemented with both naive_bayes nb and support_vector svm classifiers svm outperformed nb on more difficult datasets where the level of sequence_similarity between allergens and non allergens is higher thus we will mostly discuss results for the svm based version the advantages of allerdictor make it practical for large_scale allergen prediction in applications such as whole genome_annotation biotechnology derived gene_product screening and allergen discovery from large public sequence_databases this article presented an accurate sequence_based allergen protein prediction method allerdictor that is much faster than the current most accurate methods while still maintaining comparable or better predictive_performance when compared with allerhunter the main idea is the use of the k_mer feature representation of sequences and thus linear prediction time is achieved for both feature construction and prediction using a linear svm model moreover the k_mer approach is particularly effective for allergen prediction because supervised_machine such as svm can learn the k_mers shared by many allergens such as the one found in ige epitopes and assign higher weights to these k_mers the prevalence of asthma has been an increasing human_health issue approximately million people worldwide were diagnosed with asthma with annual deaths of the majority of asthmatic patients have allergic_asthma in which allergic_reactions caused by allergens exacerbate asthmatic symptoms to facilitate our understanding and prevention of this disease it is important to identify potential allergens from massive_amounts of protein_sequences produced every day via both genome_sequencing and sequence synthesis because experimental allergenicity assessment is still expensive and difficult especially at large_scale computational allergen identification is an alternative first step allerdictor addresses the shortcomings of the current allergen prediction_tools with high_precision over high recall and fast speed allerdictor is not only useful for general sequence allergenicity assessment in applications such as screening of novel proteins introduced to genetically_modified crops but also particularly suitable for allergen discovery on a large_scale in applications such as whole genome_annotation and quick screening of synthesized sequences
