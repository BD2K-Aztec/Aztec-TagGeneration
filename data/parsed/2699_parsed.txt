leveraging input and output structures for joint mapping of epistatic and marginal eqtls motivation as many complex disease and expression phenotypes are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular_networks underlying gene_regulation resulted from interdependent genome variations association_mapping of causal qtls or expression_quantitative must consider both additive and epistatic_effects of multiple candidate genotypes this problem poses a significant challenge to contemporary genome_wide association gwa mapping technologies because of its computational_complexity fortunately a plethora of recent_developments in biological_network community especially the availability of genetic_interaction networks make it possible to construct informative priors of complex interactions between genotypes which can substantially reduce the complexity and increase the statistical_power of gwa inference results in this article we consider the problem of learning a multitask regression_model while taking_advantage of the prior information on structures on both the inputs genetic_variations and outputs expression levels we propose a novel regularization scheme over multitask regression called jointly structured inputoutput lasso based on an norm which allows shared sparsity patterns for related inputs and outputs to be optimally estimated such patterns capture multiple related single_nucleotide snps that jointly influence multiple related expression traits in addition we generalize this new multitask regression to structurally regularized polynomial_regression to detect epistatic_interactions with manageable complexity by exploiting the prior_knowledge on candidate snps for epistatic_effects from biological_experiments we demonstrate our method on simulated and yeast eqtl datasets availability software is available atone of the fundamental problems in computational_biology is to understand associations between genomic_variations such as single_nucleotide snps and phenotypic variations complex phenotypes e g disease syndromes or pathological signatures usually consist of a large number of quantitative_traits such as clinical and molecular e g gene_expression signals differences between these phenotypes involve the complex_interplay of a large number of snps that perturb the function of diseaserelated genes in the context of a regulatory or interaction_network rather than these snps acting individually thus unraveling the causal genetic_variations and understanding the to whom correspondence should be addressed mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic and marginal_effects of genomic_locations that affect the phenotypic variations specifically genomic_locations that influence the expression levels of genes or mrnas are called expression_quantitative eqtls previously linear marginal_effects of eqtls have been studied extensively in the past_decade to increase the power of detecting causal genetic_variants reliably many different approaches have been proposed that take advantage of the correlation structures in the form of either physical or inferred molecular_networks in the genome and phenome and other prior_knowledge of such structures from previous_studies for example graph guided fused_lasso analyzed multiple_traits simultaneously by considering a network of multiple_traits to find genetic_markers with pleiotropic_effects that affect multiple correlated_traits jointly another approach lirnet was proposed to make use of prior_knowledge on regulatory_features such as conservation scores for a more informed search of association snps unlike linear effects of eqtls detecting non linear snpsnp interactions is still in its infancy due to a very large number of possible interactions between snps we refer readers to for the meanings of snpsnp interactions or epistasis for example a typical association analysis often involves up to millions of snps with j snps the number of candidates of snp_pairs for pairwise interactions becomes j which is clearly pushing the limit of practical computing_resources more importantly it also carries a serious statistical issue that is the multiple_testing if we test all snp_pairs to find epistatic_effects only a handful of snp_pairs may be left after correcting for multiple_hypothesis to cope with the problem previous methods attempted to reduce the number of snp_pairs for hypothesis_testing in various ways for example proposed a two step approach it first fits a linear_regression with only marginal_effects and then considers only the snps with significant marginal_effects for epistatic_interactions this approach reduces the candidate interaction pairs but it significantly limits the scope of the analysis since genetic_loci with epistatic_effects may not show any marginal_effects the two step approach will completely miss such interactions another proposed approach is sequential search it chooses a primary snp by finding the snp with the largest marginal_effect and then the secondary snp is selected in such a way that residual sum of squares is minimized in a regression setting with the two chosen snps even though it has been shown that this approach is more powerful than exhaustive d search it still suffers from the cases where interacting snps do not have significant marginal_effects furthermore proposed a different approach where the candidates of snp_pairs for epistatic_effects are chosen using biology networks in particular under the guidance of proteinprotein_interaction
