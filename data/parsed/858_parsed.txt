structural_bioinformatics capito a web_server based analysis and plotting tool for circular_dichroism data motivation circular_dichroism cd_spectroscopy is one of the most versatile tools to study protein_folding and to validate the proper fold of purified_proteins here we aim to provide a readily_accessible user_friendly and platform independent tool capable of analysing multiple cd datasets of virtually any format and returning results as high_quality graphical output to the user results capito cd anaylsis and plotting tool is a novel web_server based tool for analysing and plotting cd data it allows reliable estimation of secondary_structure content utilizing different approaches capito accepts multiple cd datasets and hence is well suited for a wide_application range such as the analysis of temperature or ph_dependent un folding and the comparison of mutants availability the past_years have witnessed a dramatic growth of the number of high_resolution protein_structures deposited in the protein_data pdb the progress in structural_biology has been driven by developments in recombinant_protein expression technology as well as by advances in methodology data analysis and bioinformatics escherichia_coli is so_far the most widely used host for structural studies which in turn require significant amounts of recombinant_protein before resource_intensive detailed_structural and functional studies it is extremely_helpful if not essential to validate the proper fold of purified recombinant_proteins and one of the most versatile tools to study protein fold ing constitutes circular_dichroism cd_spectroscopy compared with x_ray and nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy the structural_information obtained from cd is limited however cd_spectroscopy carries a number of advantages it is a wellestablished label_free technique requiring comparably small amounts of material and a short time is necessary for assessing structural_parameters of proteins like secondary_structure conformational changes un folding and interactions a broad range of mathematical_methods have been devised to extract structural_information from cd_spectra to provide for an estimate of the secondary_structure composition of proteins via multilinear regression singular_value ridge_regression principal_component pribicpribic convex constraint analysis neural_network based analysis and the self consistent method respectively all these methods are based on the assumption that the cd_spectrum of a given protein represents a linear combination of basis spectra different secondary_structural give rise to bands characteristic in wavelength and intensity the cd_spectrum of a given protein can be represented by the molar ellipticity l as a function of wavelength l where f n is the fraction of each secondary_structure n and s ln is the ellipticity at each wavelength of each nth secondary structural_element the sum of all fractional weights p f n is equal to in constrained fits the quality of the output of the aforementioned methods relies on the availability of a reference_database of cd_spectra of proteins whose d structure is known with the advent of the protein circular_dichroism data bank pcddb a public repository for far ultraviolet far uv and synchrotron_radiation cd spectral_data and their associated experimental metadata the number of publicly_available cd_spectra increased enormously in the pcddb each entry contains sequence and experimental information for the respective protein and includes the pdb code for proteins of which d structures are available during the recent_past different web_services or programmes for analysing of cd data and estimating secondary_structure content became available recently janes and co workers launched the tool dichromatch for matching spectra against reference data here we describe a novel web_server based tool combining different methods for estimating secondary_structure content and analysing far_uv data based on a selected set of far_uv data as available from the pcddb we have developed capito a novel web_server based analysis tool for interpreting cd_spectra it allows the simultaneous evaluation of multiple datasets hence it is suitable for the investigation of a protein in question under different conditions temperature ph buffer solvent and mutations our approaches basis spectra and matching based method to extract secondary_structure information from a cd_spectrum take advantage of a recent significant increase in the availability of well calibrated far_uv spectra linked to available tertiary_structures the accuracy of our methods in predicting helical strand or irregular content is reliable compared with other frequently used programmes or web_services in summary we here provide a freely_accessible user_friendly and robust tool for the analysis of cd_spectra
