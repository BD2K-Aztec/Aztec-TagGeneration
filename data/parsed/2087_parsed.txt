genome_analysis gobe an interactive web_based for comparative_genomic visualization gobe is a web_based for viewing comparative genomic_data it supports viewing multiple genomic_regions simultaneously its simple text format and flash based rendering make it an interactive exploratory research tool gobe can be used without installation through our web_service or downloaded and customized with stylesheets and javascript callback functions availability gobe is a flash application that runs in all modern web_browsers the full source_code including that for the online web_application is available under the mit_license atas more genomic_data and data_formats are created there is an increasing demand for a tool that accepts a simple text_based format and renders an interactive view of the data that can then be used to develop hypotheses and convey_information a web_based application has the advantage of being more accessible and easily deployable allowing users to quickly visualize and share data existing genome visualization_tools such as gbrowse genomegraphs and genoplotr generate useful static images but require installation use in a specific programming_language environment and do not provide interactivity browsers such as anno j http www annoj org and the ucsc_genome are interactive but more difficult to set up and do not easily support comparison of multiple genomic_regions other stand alone viewers such as genomeview http genomeview org and tablet excel in displaying next generation sequence_data but are less customizable while tools such as vista do offer a comparative view deletions inversions and transpositions are not visible given that representation we introduce gobe a customizable language agnostic tool that can be run locally or used from an existing web_service in either case all data and styling are specified through a simple text format optional javascript callbacks allow interactivity for web developers to whom correspondence should be addressed
