streamlining the construction of large_scale dynamic_models using generic kinetic equations motivation studying biological_systems not just at an individual component level but at a system wide level gives us great_potential to understand fundamental functions and essential biological_properties despite considerable advances in the topological_analysis of metabolic_networks inadequate knowledge of the enzyme kinetic_rate laws and their associated parameter_values still hampers large_scale kinetic modelling furthermore the integration of gene_expression and protein levels into kinetic_models is not straightforward results the focus of our research is on streamlining the construction of large_scale kinetic_models a novel software_tool was developed which enables the generation of generic rate_equations for all reactions in a model it encompasses an algorithm for estimating the concentration of proteins for a reaction to reach a particular steady_state when kinetic_parameters are unknown and two robust_methods for parameter_estimation it also allows for the seamless_integration of gene_expression or protein levels into a reaction and can generate equations for both transcription and translation we applied this methodology to model the yeast glycolysis pathway our results show that the behaviour of the system can be accurately described using generic kinetic equations availability_and the software_tool together with its source_code in java is available from our project_web atthe current availability of annotated genomes and detailed omics_data makes it possible to construct stoichiometric genome_scale that include all reactions metabolites and proteins systems_biology aims to examine the properties and dynamics of cellular_processes as a whole rather than in isolated parts of a cell or an organism integrating cellular_components is essential for our understanding of how interactions to whom correspondence should be addressed between these components influence cellular_functions one aspect of this integration is the need to integrate proteins and other cellular_components into metabolic_networks for example frster and palsson manually reconstructed a genome_scale integrative model of gene_expression and metabolism of saccharomyces_cerevisiae metabolic_reactions metabolites and open_reading stoichiometric models which describe the topology of a metabolic_network provide limited insights into the functioning of cellular_processes to understand the detailed dynamics of cellular_functions and their regulation it is necessary to advance toward kinetic_models where the behaviour of a system can be perturbed the construction of a genome_scale kinetic_model of a biological cell requires the integration of genomic proteomic metabolomic and fluxomic data along with thermodynamic information attempts for building such large_scale kinetic_models are now starting to emerge provided a systematic method for constructing large_scale kinetic metabolic_models and addressed the problem of estimating kinetic_parameters described a framework for building and analysing large_scale kinetic_models and presented the mathematical challenges associated with the construction of such models in a cell scale model the number of reactions metabolites and proteins can reach several thousands making it time consuming and costly if not impossible to accurately measure individual concentrations of metabolites fluxes and kinetic_parameters there is often inadequate knowledge of enzymatickinetic laws and their associated parameter_values and usually parameters obtained from the literature are dependent on specific in vitro or in vivo experimental_conditions yet there is growing awareness that exact rate_equations and parameters are often not crucial in determining the dynamic_properties of large systems this principle has been illustrated by the development of methods for bridging the gap between structural and kinetic modelling proposed a method that aimed to give account of the dynamical capabilities of metabolic systems without requiring explicit_information about the rate_equations and they showed that it was possible to acquire a detailed quantitative representation of metabolic systems without explicitly referring to a set of differential_equations presented a method for building kinetic_models solely based on reaction stoichiometries of a network using linlog kinetics their results showed good agreement between the real dynamics and their approximation in a yeast glycolysis model also acknowledged that the scarcity of experimental_data for rate_equations and parameters is a majorin this section we present a generic model of yeast glycolysis generated by grape and compare its properties to a model developed by which was based on an experimental determination of kinetic_parameters and rate_equations the comparison is aimed at determining whether the behaviour of such a metabolic system can be predicted without accurately measuring the rate_equations and detailed kinetics of every enzyme
