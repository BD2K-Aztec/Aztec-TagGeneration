structural_bioinformatics fast large_scale clustering of protein_structures using gauss integrals motivation clustering protein_structures is an important task in structural_bioinformatics de_novo structure_prediction for example often involves a clustering step for finding the best prediction other applications include assigning proteins to fold families and analyzing molecular_dynamics trajectories results we present pleiades a novel approach to clustering protein_structures with a rigorous mathematical underpinning the method approximates clustering based on the root_mean by first mapping structures to gauss integral vectorswhich were introduced by rgen and co workersand subsequently performing k_means conclusions compared to current methods pleiades dramatically improves on the time needed to perform clustering and can cluster a significantly_larger number of structures while providing state of the art results the number of low_energy structures generated in a typical folding study which is in the order of structures can be clustered within seconds to minutes predicting the d fold for a given amino_acid remains one of the greatest challenge in computational_biology today while many of the driving_forces behind the folding_process are understood in principle their calculation in the context of a folding study is still challenging most de_novo prediction_methods rely on sampling a large number of decoy structures from an approximate force_field due to the effects of configurational entropy and of the folding_pathway the native_structure is not necessarily the structure with the lowest energy even with a perfect physical force_field point out that decoy clustering is the correct way to select the final prediction since the native_structure is typically located near the bottom of a broad well in the energy_landscape they showed that selecting the centroid structure of the largest cluster readily results in structures that are closer to the native_structure than the structure with the lowest energy here the centroid is the structure with the lowest average distance to all other structures in the cluster modern computer hardware allows to generate tens of to whom correspondence should be addressed thousands of low_energy decoys in a few hours these developments underline the demand for software that is able to clusters tens_of of structures in seconds or minutes there are several clustering programs available in the public_domain they usually rely on an atomic representation of the decoys and subsequently cluster based on the pairwise root_mean rmsd a standard measure of structure similarity the most popular programs calibur durandal scud and spicker follow the rosetta itasser procedure and perform exact clustering the structure with the most neighbors within a given cutoff is chosen as the first centroid the selected structure along with all neighbors is then removed from the set and the procedure is repeated to find the next largest cluster calibur applies pruning to exclude a large part of the decoy set from the costly pairwise_comparison using auxiliary grouping with upper and lower bounds durandal similarly avoids large_amounts of the pairwise calculations in the initial step of filling the distance_matrix by propagating the information gained in the exact measurement knowing the rmsd values of structure pairs a b and a c allows to infer information about the rmsd value of b c both methods are substantially faster than spicker which evaluates all pairwise_distances scud also applies exact clustering but uses a reference root_mean distance to calculate the pairwise_distances here all structures are aligned to a randomly_selected reference structure the approximate rmsd between two structures is then calculated based on their respective rmsd values with that reference structure thereby avoiding the cost of an explicit superposition with the exception of spicker the number of structures that can be clustered is not limited by any of the programs however extensive memory_consumption becomes a limiting_factor with growing numbers of decoys as reloading the structures from the hard_disk leads to a significant drop in performance currently with a common desktop computer to structures can be clustered depending on the amount of main_memory available here we present pleiades a novel approach to protein_structure clustering that uses gauss integrals to represent a proteins d structure gauss integrals allow to represent structures by dimensional vectors whose pairwise euclidean_distances correlate well with the rmsd of the corresponding structures using this efficient representation pleiades is able to quicklypage in this article we present pleiades a novel approach to protein_structure clustering using the git representation pleiades is able to quickly cluster a very large number of protein_structures a task that is highly_relevant in the context of protein_folding simulations using the efficient git representation we were able to successfully cluster up to million decoys resulting from protein_folding studies on a common desktop computer in a few hours one of the main advantages of pleiades is its computational speed the program is able to cluster the output of a regular folding simulation up to structures in a matter of seconds runtime while maintaining an accuracy comparable to state of the art programs in order to use the convenient git representation of the protein fold some preprocessing is necessary all structures must first be converted to git vectors folding studies usually run for extended periods of time occasionally saving structures to disk the conversion of a single structure takes fractions of a second and can be performed in parallel with the actual folding simulation the benefits of pleiades are fold the increased efficiency and reduced memory_consumption pleiades redefines the limits of how many protein_structures can be clustered routinely dealing with several hundred thousand structures in minutes run time at the same time conventional clustering tasks involving only tens_of of structures can be performed in a few seconds while maintaining an accuracy on par with state of the art clustering_methods because of these features and the availability of an implementation under an open_source pleiades timely addresses a current bottleneck in structural_bioinformatics
