systems_biology parameter_estimation of kinetic_models from metabolic_profiles two phase dynamic decoupling method motivation time series measurements of metabolite_concentration have become increasingly more common providing data for building kinetic_models of metabolic_networks using ordinary_differential odes in practice however such time course data are usually incomplete and noisy and the estimation of kinetic_parameters from these data is challenging practical limitations due to data and computational aspects such as solving stiff odes and finding global optimal_solution to the estimation problem give motivations to develop a new estimation procedure that can circumvent some of these constraints results in this work an incremental and iterative parameter_estimation method is proposed that combines and iterates between two estimation phases one phase involves a decoupling method in which a subset of model_parameters that are associated with measured metabolites are estimated using the minimization of slope errors another phase follows in which the ode model is solved one equation at a time and the remaining model_parameters are obtained by minimizing concentration errors the performance of this two phase method was tested on a generic branched metabolic_pathway and the glycolytic_pathway of lactococcus_lactis the results showed that the method is efficient in getting accurate parameter_estimates even when some information is missing advancements in biological techniques have made time series measurements of metabolite_concentration more readily available providing data for the creation of kinetic metabolic_network models in the form of ordinary_differential odes time course data contain information about the structure and dynamics of the metabolic_pathways but such information is implicit and must be extracted using an inference_method this inverse modeling task has motivated the creation of various methods for parameter_estimation and structure identification as summarized in a recent review however the inverse modeling of biological_systems is often complicated by the lack of complete data to whom correspondence should be addressed poor data_quality noise and the computational difficulty in solving model equations and optimization_problems existing techniques often fail to yield accurate parameter_estimates due to one or a combination of these reasons time series datasets for metabolites are usually incomplete and noisy due to two roadblocks complexity and technology the high_complexity of metabolic_networks with a large number of metabolites means that the complete measurement of all relevant metabolites is not practically feasible in addition in order to accurately capture the dynamic behaviors of metabolites the timecourse data should be measured frequently enough which often challenges the limit of the available techniques furthermore in experiments several time points of metabolites could be missing because of various reasons e g human_error while the issue of missing time points can be partly addressed by data interpolation the complete loss of data from metabolites poses a more challenging_problem in parameter_estimation and is the focus of the present work in few instances it may be possible to obtain missing metabolite measurements by analyzing the convex basis of the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix which gives the sets of metabolites whose total weighted concentration is time invariant among canonical ode_models of metabolic_networks power_law models within the biochemical systems_theory bst such as s system have drawn much attention due to many advantages the generic form of an s system model is given by where x is an n dimensional metabolite_concentration vector and the parameter vector p consists of the rate_constants i i and kinetic orders g ij h ij the sign of the kinetic orders indicates the nature of the connectivity among metabolites where a positive value represents a substrate or activation and a negative numberthe performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in applications to a generic branched pathway and the glycolytic_pathway of lactococcus_lactis the proposed iterative parameter_estimation method builds on the strengths of the decoupling method and the ode decomposition method by decoupling the odes this method is significantly_faster than other methods that require integrating complete coupled odes at each objective_function evaluation while still giving good fit to measured concentration data in addition like the ode decomposition method the combined approach does not require complete measurements of all metabolites and has much reduced parameter search_space as shown in the applications to the two cases the proposed method was superior to the two methods from which it was developed when metabolite measurements were incompletely available the decoupling method could not be applied compared with the ode decomposition method the proposed method_gave more accurate parameter_estimates and better data fit slope and concentration at a much lower computational_cost while the fit to missing concentration measurement had an offset it is noteworthy that the dynamic trend can be captured the combination of slope and concentration fitting had also been used in several existing parameter_estimation methods for example wang and liu had developed a method where kinetic
