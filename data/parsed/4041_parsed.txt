gene_expression rnaseqexpressionbrowser a web_interface to browse and visualize high_throughput expression data motivation rna_seq techniques generate massive_amounts of expression data several pipelines e g tophat and cufflinks are broadly applied to analyse these datasets however accessing and handling the analytical output remain challenging for non experts results we present the rnaseqexpressionbrowser an open_source web_interface that can be used to access the output from rna_seq expression analysis packages in different ways as it allows browsing for genes by identifiers annotations or sequence_similarity gene_expression information can be loaded as long as it is represented in a matrix like format additionally data can be made available by setting up the tool on a public server for demonstration purposes we have set up a version providing expression information from the barley genome availability_and the source_code and a show case are accessible at http mips helmholtz muenchen de plant rnaseqexpressionbrowser contactcurrent high_throughput such as rna_seq allow researchers to generate massive_amounts of gene_expression data in short time however data analysis and intuitive visualization often remain a bottleneck for making the efficient use of generated data for biologists with limited programming experience accessing data output from rna_seq pipelines in a meaningful manner poses a challenge manual_search for genes of interest is time intensive if feasible at all and generating non automated visualizations for a list of genes of interest is a painstaking task this task has become even more challenging for highly repetitive genomes like barley the international barley sequencing consortium or wheat where de_novo transcriptome_assemblies result in hundred thousands of transcripts the tophat and cufflinks workflow presents one of the standard workflows for analysing rna_seq and is broadly applied in life_sciences research packages to analyse data from these workflows that help to reduce the efforts for accessing the output data are available e g cummerbund robina or star however accessing genes by sequence_information or annotations still requires some programming_skills additionally most tools work only locally which makes sharing of the results difficult in cooperative research_projects in this article we present the rnaseqexpressionbrowser a web_based that can be used to easily access the results of expression analysis
