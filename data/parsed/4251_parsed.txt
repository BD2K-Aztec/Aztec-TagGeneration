genome_analysis simple high_throughput annotation_pipeline shap shap simple high_throughput annotation_pipeline is a lightweight and scalable sequence annotation_pipeline capable of supporting research_efforts that generate or utilize large volumes of dna sequence_data the software provides grid capable analysis relational storage and web_based full text searching of annotation results implemented_in shap recognizes the limited resources of many smaller research groups availability source_code is freely_available under gplv at https sourceforge net_projects the development of shap began in early after it became apparent that the needs of our environmental genomics metagenomics program would not be satisfied by available annotation tools of the day automated pipelines were focused primarily on the analysis of single microbial_genomes http manatee sourceforge net and often pursued analysis strategies that became impractical when the volume of sequencing_data grew substantially beyond their original design scope shap was designed around five primary requirements relational storage scalable high_throughput analysis a simple extensible core platform independence and free availability requirements that were not met by any program evaluated at the time recently ergatis and the derived annotationspecific server isga have become available streamlining the capacity of ergatis isga addresses many of the issues that motivated the creation of shap however the ambitious nature of the system makes it complex and demanding to deploy as a monolithic application as the name implies shap provides a relatively simple_means of annotating high_throughput dna sequencing_datasets while at the same time allowing for customization and expansion shap does not expect any prerequisite analysis tools be installed or any particular analyser be defined prior to use but does provide a set of example definitions in this way shap can be considered both a framework and a skeletonized pipeline ready to be fleshed out by the user although shap was designed to employ an external database provider and web_server both are capable of being embedded within the application itself this fully self contained version requires little to no configuration by the end_user and demonstrates the value of shaps layered design its simplicity is a major advantage compared with other similar software_packages when custom or new tools need to be incorporated in the pipeline in comparison isga requires subordinate tools to be installed as part of the installation process which although no doubt offering a comprehensive analysis remains a daunting task a nave sloc source lines of code size metric applied to the core codebases of shap and isga finds that isga comprises physical and logical lines of perl whereas shap comprises and lines of java respectively ignoring a possible further normalization to account for the relatively higher_level nature of perl to java there remains a reduction in codebase size this comparative reduction could be greater still if isgas dependence on the larger ergatis framework physical loc for workflow support was included in the metric however the shap and ergatis frameworks should not be compared as simplicity of purpose brings forth a feature disparity particularly in the subtly of process from the outset of development the goal was to build a system that could deal with large volumes of data scale both in the persistence domain and analysis throughput not become overly complex or difficult to adapt in a developing field of research and allow migration between platforms through a layered design the areas of greatest_change are isolated from the rest of system andthereby insulated from their changing habits shaps web_interface provides simple and expedient access to the annotation results presenting users with a familiar means of access shap has been in active use within the group having supported recent research_activities deployed on our in house core cluster the running system has accumulated over years of computational time in days analysing million dna contigs billion bases producing million orf predictions million amino_acids and recording million significant annotation results future development may involve converting shap to osgi dynamic modules to further enhance platform independence and ease of deployment
