genetics_and topiaryexplorer visualizing large phylogenetic_trees with environmental metadata motivation microbial_community profiling is a highly_active area of research but tools that facilitate visualization of phylogenetic_trees and associated environmental data have not kept up with the increasing quantity of data generated in these studies results topiaryexplorer supports the visualization of very large phylogenetic_trees including features such as the automated coloring of branches by environmental data manipulation of trees and incorporation of per tip metadata e g taxonomic labels microbial_community profiling using marker_genes such as the s rrna greatly expanded our knowledge of the diversity of the microbial world phylogenetic_trees are key to our understanding of the microbial world and provide an important view into microbial data software such as qiime has kept pace with the increasing rate of sequence acquisition to allow statistical_analysis of these data but tools to visualize and manipulate phylogenetic_trees and corresponding metadata www phylosoft org archaeopteryx http tree bio ed ac uk software figtree which worked well on datasets that were characteristic a few years_ago are less suitable for datasets containing millions of sequences a key_question in microbial_ecology is which portions of a phylogenetic reference tree are differentially represented in specific groups of samples to address_this users should be able to load trees with thousands of tips assign taxonomic labels to the tips and color the branches based on data about each sample here we present topiaryexplorer a software_package that facilitates visual_exploration of large phylogenetic_trees including information about each sample and each tip this integration of what is often called sequence metadata is crucial to understanding how sequences and their source organisms are distributed across to whom correspondence should be addressed environments and the processes underlying the observed patterns topiaryexplorer additionally allows display and revision of the taxonomy including multiple taxonomies for the same tree facilitating taxonomic comparisons and integration with databases that contain sample tree information an example database is provided to assist users in creating their own see below it also provides key user_interface improvements including the ability to dynamically collapse or expand the whole tree using several different tree layout algorithms allowing rapid visual_exploration of which lineages are shared among or unique to specific_subsets of environments the ability to spawn new windows for investigation of specific subtrees and to view multiple trees at the same time control over labels and layout features critical for producing publicationquality graphics the ability to export results in any of several graphical and machine_readable formats for further analysis and the ability to handle datasets of hundreds of thousands of tips which can easily be created from larger datasets by otu_picking with uclust or related tools topiaryexplorer metadata is provided as tab separated text and trees are provided as newickformatted strings these standard file_formats allow data generated with different tools to be easily imported into topiaryexplorer topiaryexplorer is written in java using processing which allows for rapid tree visualization and pdf export using opengl the tree layout rendering algorithms in topiaryexplorer were adapted from pycogent several strategies were applied to efficiently visualize large trees and associated metadata including caching node lookups rather than running multiple lookups of the same node and using sparse table representations for storing and accessing metadata
