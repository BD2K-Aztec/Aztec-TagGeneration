motif comparison based on similarity of binding_affinity profiles measuring motif similarity is essential for identifying functionally_related transcription_factors tfs and rna_binding and for annotating de_novo motifs here we describe motif similarity based on affinity of targets mosbat an approach for measuring the similarity of motifs by computing their affinity profiles across a large number of random_sequences we show that mosbat successfully associates de_novo chip_seq motifs with their respective tfs accurately identifies motifs that are obtained from the same tf in different in vitro assays and quantitatively reflects the similarity of in vitro binding_preferences for pairs of tfs availability_and mosbat is available as a webserver at mosbat ccbr utoronto ca and for download at github com csglab mosbat contact the sequence_preference of a transcription_factor tf or an rnabinding protein rbp is most commonly represented using a motif which refers to the matrix of the probabilities of occurrence of any given nucleotide at any given position of the binding_site measuring the similarity of motifs is fundamental to several aspects of studying tfs and rbps such as elucidating the relationship between sequence and function of these factors assigning known tfs and rbps to de_novo discovered motifs and measuring performance of in silico motif prediction_approaches the majority of motif comparison approaches are based on alignment of two motifs where the similarity measure is defined as the score of the best alignment a few other methods use binding_site predictions to identify overlapping sites in random_sequences allowing derivation of a motif similarity_score and alignment here we introduce an alignmentindependent approach for measuring the similarity of two motifs the method is based on measuring the similarity of the affinity profiles of tfs or rbps across a large number of random_sequences with the affinity profiles predicted using the associated motifs we show that our approach for measuring motif similarity based on affinity of targets mosbat can accurately identify similar motifs that are derived from different experimental methods e g in order to identify tfs associated with de_novo motifs derived from chip_seq motif similarity_scores reported by mosbat also closely reflect independent sequence_preference similarity_measures derived directly from in vitro measurements
