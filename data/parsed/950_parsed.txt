gene_expression chemical_structure informing statistical_hypothesis in metabolomics motivation metabolomics has been shown as an effective tool to study various biological and biomedical phenotypes whereas interrogating the inherently noisy metabolite_concentration data with limited sample_size remains_a accumulating_evidence metabolites structures are relevant to their bioactivities results we present a new strategy to boost the statistical_power of hypothesis_testing in metabolomics by incorporating quantitative molecular_descriptors for each metabolite the strategy selects potentially informative summary molecular_descriptors and outputs chemical_structure informed false_discovery the effectiveness of the proposed_strategy is demonstrated by both simulation_studies and a real application in a metabolomic study on alzheimers_disease the posterior inclusion probability for summary molecular_descriptors reaches by incorporating the structure data our approach uniquely identifies multiple alzheimers_disease signatures which are consistent with existing_evidence these results evidently suggest the value of the proposed approach for metabolomic hypothesis_testing problems availability_and a code package implementing the strategy is freely_available at https github com hongjiezhu cima git over the last decades major advances in analytical_chemistry have resulted in the emergence of metabolomics it enables simultaneous quantifying of hundreds to thousands of metabolites present in a set of biological_samples e g plasma urine and cerebrospinal_fluid to report on metabolic_pattern associated with conditions of interest such as disease or drug_exposure the identities and concentrations of metabolites or the so_called metabotype reflect net interactions between gene and environment providing information that can possibly bridge a gap between genotype and phenotype attesting to this belief metabolomics has been widely used to understand disease_pathogenesis and drug effects as well as to predict variation in drug response among many other applications these studies typically involve identifying metabolomic signatures among the measured metabolites examples are metabolites that are influenced by an environmental stimulus e g drug treatment and metabolites that are associated with a phenotype of interest e g a disease status or drug response common metabolomics_data analysis practice uses conventional statistical_inference tools such as students t tests and regression techniques to identify the signatures these methods as well as many multivariate chemometrics and statistics tools that are frequently used essentially treat metabolites as individual variables instead of biological_entities of which rich prior_knowledge has been accumulated and is accessible from literatures and or databases a variety of methodologies have been developed recently to take advantages of such information to facilitate statistical_inference on omic_data some incorporate network relationships among the biological_entities based on a general assumption that the connected ones on the network tend to share similar behavior whereas others perform selection at the level of pathways acknowledging the modularity of biological_networks a distinctive attribute of metabolites is that each of them can be characterized by its unique chemical_features these features can be quantified by a variety of molecular_descriptors md which transform chemical_structures into numbers supplementary different types of mds can be obtained from existing software e g dragon talete srl milan italy ranging from simple molecular_properties e g molecular_weight and polarity to elaborative spatial formulations e g d autocorrelations and atom pairs to complex molecular fingerprints e g daylight http www daylight com and unity d fingerprints http www tripos com it has been acknowledged that many physicochemical or pharmacological_properties of metabolites could be revealed by their structure information for instance medicinal chemists use the structureactivity relationships carbo carbo identified from a series of compounds targeting a specific binding_protein to design new drugs with better bioactivity toxicologists predict a specific toxicity profile of a to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as compound based on its similar key structural moiety with known toxins it has also been observed that the levels of metabolites sharing the same or similar key chemical_structures are more likely to be affected together under certain environmental stimulus for example serotonin ht and dopamine da are both monoamine neurotransmitters structurally_similar to each other but belong to different pathways under the stimulus of methylenedioxymethamphetamine which interacts with both ht and da receptors the levels of these two metabolites are both upregulated in the brain leading to the hallucinogenic effect because the function and bioactivity of metabolites are closely_tied to their structure we hypothesize that integrating the structure information into the analysis of metabolite_concentration data can significantly improve the discovery of metabolomic signatures to evaluate this hypothesis we build a regression normal mixture rnm model that can merge information from the two data_sources metabolites concentration data and their chemical_structure data into the estimation of false_discovery fdr which is nowadays routinely used to control for multiple testing in metabolomics_studies as an illustrative example suppose a total of m metabolites are measured for a cohort of patients and healthy_controls to evaluate the following null_hypotheses h i level of the i th metabolite is not different between patients and controls i m depending on the actual statistical_method being used to test the hypotheses different types of summary_statistics can be derived for each metabolite e g a t statistic from a parametric two sample t test or a sum of ranks from a non parametric wilcoxon_rank along with a p value to control for multiple testing the summary test_statistics can be fitted to a mixture_model the model estimates for each metabolite a bayesian posterior_probability of its null_hypothesis being true based on which various types of fdrs can be calculated a standard mixture_model assumes the same prior belief probability of each metabolite being null variations have been proposed to incorporate additional information into the specification of the prior probabilities one example is the class of mixtures of experts models in which the prior probabilities are modeled as functions of some covariates used a spatially_correlated mixture_model that incorporates network relationships among genes into the specification of prior probabilities for microarray_studies the rnm model in our strategy uses several summary molecular_descriptors smd to estimate metabolite specific prior probabilities we further perform variable_selection on the smds which can suggest how likely they are informative for a particular metabolomic study in general the selected structural_information and the test results based on the concentration data are jointly used to output chemical_structure informed fdr for the evaluation of the importance of metabolites based on the rnm model we propose an integrated chemical_structure informed metabolomic hypothesis testing_strategy simulation_studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the rnm model both in identifying informative smd s and in improving the identification of metabolomic signatures with the smds as proof_of we applied the proposed_strategy to a metabolomic study of alzheimers_disease ad a high posterior inclusion probability of the first smd being selected and the comprehensive biological evidence that supports the identified ad signatures unique to our approach both suggest the potential benefit of incorporating structure information into the analysis of metabolomic_data we evaluated the proposed chemical_structure informed hypothesis testing_strategy at two levels first we performed simulation_studies to examine the effectiveness of the rnm model on identifying potentially informative smd s and non null metabolites second we applied the strategy to a real study seeking new metabolomic signatures for ad
