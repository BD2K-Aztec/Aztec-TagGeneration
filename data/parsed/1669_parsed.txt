genetics_and ew_dmgwas edge weighted dense module search for genome_wide and gene_expression we previously_developed dmgwas to search for dense modules in a human protein_protein ppi_network it has since become a popular tool for network assisted analysis of genome_wide gwas dmgwas weights nodes by using gwas signals here we introduce an upgraded algorithm ew_dmgwas to boost gwas signals in a node and edge weighted ppi_network in ew_dmgwas we utilize condition specific gene_expression for edge_weights specifically differential gene co expression is used to infer the edge_weights we applied ew_dmgwas to two diseases and compared it with other relevant methods the results suggest that ew_dmgwas is more powerful in detecting disease associated signals availability_and the algorithm of ew_dmgwas is implemented in the r package dmgwas and is available at http bioinfo over the past_decade genome_wide gwas have successfully uncovered many susceptibility_loci for common diseases however the identified loci only explain a small portion of the genetic_risk it is challenging to uncover the remaining risky loci as their association_signals are likely to be moderate or weak one potential solution to this challenge is to incorporate other functional information such as proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks to investigate joint association_signals beyond single markers we previously_developed a network assisted approach dmgwas to address this problem dmgwas applies a greedy_algorithm to search for dense modules in a ppi_network in which nodes are weighted by using gwas signals after its initial release dmgwas received much attention from the research_community and has become quite popular for network assisted analysis of gwas signals motivated by the strong demand we enhanced dmgwas by integrating and enabling gene_expression to assign edge_weights and denoted the new algorithm ew_dmgwas differential gene co expression dgce which measures the change of gene co expression between case and control samples is one important feature of transcriptional information reflecting cellular_dynamics and contributing to pathogenesis thus we utilize dgce to infer the weight of each edge and combine the association_signals of its two nodes to assess the overall disease risk of network modules within the human ppi_network
