sequence_analysis psar align improving multiple_sequence using probabilistic sampling we developed psar align a multiple sequence realignment tool that can refine a given multiple_sequence based on suboptimal alignments generated by probabilistic sampling our evaluation demonstrated that psar align is able to improve the results from various multiple_sequence tools availability_and the psar align source_code implemented mainly in c is freely_available for download atmultiple sequence_alignment msa is one of the most important foundations for cross_species comparative_genomic although many algorithms for msa have been developed msa is still error_prone for example it was estimated that at least of the human mouse wholegenome alignment is misaligned at the ucsc_genome and the number increases for other species we previously_developed a novel measure called psar which can assess the reliability of an msa based on its agreement with probabilistically sampled suboptimal alignments sas sas provide_additional that cannot be obtained by the optimal alignment alone especially when the optimal alignment is not far superior to the sas in this article we introduce a new realignment method psaralign which refines a given msa based on a probabilistic_framework that takes_advantage of the sas of the given msa briefly psar align i samples sas from the given msa ii estimates posterior_probabilities of aligning two residues from two different sequences and iii generates a revised msa using an expected_accuracy based alignment algorithm
