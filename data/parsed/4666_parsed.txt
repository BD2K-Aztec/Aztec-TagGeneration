gene_expression tigre transcription_factor inference through gaussian_process reconstruction of expression for bioconductor tigre is an r bioconductor_package for inference of transcription_factor activity and ranking candidate target_genes from gene_expression time series the underlying methodology is based on gaussian_process inference on a differential_equation model that allows the use of short unevenly sampled time series the method has been designed with efficient parallel implementation in mind and the package supports parallel operation even without additional software availability the tigre package is included in bioconductor since release for r the package and a users guide are available atunderstanding genome function through reverse_engineering of gene regulatory_relationships from experimental_data is one of the key_challenges in current biology one popular technique is to use gene_expression time series to infer these relationships unfortunately most real_world expression time series are short and contain insufficient_information for any realistic reconstruction of the gene_regulatory recognizing this the tigre package aims to answer a much simpler question given time series expression data where a transcription_factor tf is changing its activity which genes are plausibly regulated by that tf as a result it provides a ranking of tested target_genes according to their likelihood of being targets of the tf the underlying methodology was presented by a who showed that it can yield remarkably accurate_predictions from very limited data often attaining more accurate results based on the simple wild_type time series expression data than what could be obtained using tf knockout data the method is based on a linear ordinary_differential of tf protein_translation and transcriptional_regulation placing to whom correspondence should be addressed a non parametric gaussian_process prior on unobserved mrna concentration or protein activity time courses leads to a joint gaussian_process model over the protein activity level and all gene_expression levels the gaussian processes can be marginalized out analytically while the model_parameters are optimized using maximum_likelihood candidate targets are then ranked by model likelihood which effectively measures how well the target fits a model of regulation by the inferred tf the method was originally implemented in matlab making handling of genomic_datasets much more cumbersome than in the new bioconductor implementation which benefits from all the preprocessing annotation and other tools in bioconductor tigre can fit the models already on very short time series we have successfully_applied it to datasets with as few as and time points b the output of tigre is a ranked set of models for each candidate target_gene together with their associated log likelihoods used to form the ranking direct interpretation of the log_likelihood scores can be difficult we have found it very useful to use visualizations of the models to assess the fit and to select thresholds for filtering weakly expressed genes for details see we have also developed a web_interface called tigrebrowser http pypi python org pypi tigrebrowser to aid in browsing the visualizations the linearity of the differential_equation transcription model greatly_simplifies the algorithm but it may be too crude an assumption for some situations we are working on a method based on a more realistic non linear_model such models require however more advanced computational_techniques that often tend to be more fragile tigre avoids this pitfall by using a simple enough model allowing very robust inference while effectively capturing the essential degrees_of in the transcription regulatory_process
