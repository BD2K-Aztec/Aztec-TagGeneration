databases_and rdavidwebservice a versatile r interface to david the rdavidwebservice package provides a class based interface from r programs scripts to fully access control the database for annotation visualization and integrated discovery without the need for human interaction on its web_site david abcc ncifcrf gov the library enhances the database for annotation visualization and integrated discovery capabilities for gene_ontology analysis by means of gostats based direct acyclic graph conversion methods in addition to the usual many genes to many terms visualization availability_and rdavidwebservice is available as an r package from the bioconductor_project www bioconductor org and on the authors web_site www bdmg com ar under gpl license subjected to the terms of use of davidone of the most accessed systems for functional_genomics proteomics_analysis is the database for annotation visualization and integrated discovery david a web_based online bioinformatics resource http david abcc ncifcrf gov that aims to provide tools for functional_interpretation of large lists of genes proteins its access is carried mainly through a web_site there is also a uniform resource locator url based application_programming to query david programmatically accessible through davidquery r package however the url application_programming has limited capabilities such as url length and only works with the default_settings in a web_service interface was made available allowing full access and control over all its functionalities except visualization although it is possible to handle david web_services dws through r it requires high programming_skills in addition query results are difficult to manage as they are xml soap package temple lang or java objects rjava package here we provide a versatile class based r interface to access david it is an r wrapper to all dws functionalities with several new features such as offline processing allows using previously queried saved reports and native r classes data types additionally it overcomes dws visualization constraints providing the usual many genes to many terms feature and enhances david capabilities for gene_ontology go analysis by means of gostats based direct acyclic graph dag conversion methods therefore it expands david features by allowing new developments through one of the most used computer languages in bioinformatics r r core
