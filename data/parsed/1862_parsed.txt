focus point software for sted fluorescence correlation and time gated single photon_counting motivation fluorescence_correlation fcs is a popular tool for measuring molecular mobility and how mobility relates to molecular_interaction dynamics and bioactivity in living_cells the fcs technique has been significantly advanced by its combination with super_resolution sted microscopy sted fcs specifically the use of gated detection has_shown for enhancing sted fcs but has also created a demand for software which is efficient and also implements the latest algorithms prior to this study no open software has been available which would allow practical time gating and correlation of point data derived from sted fcs experiments fluorescence_correlation fcs is a well established statistical technique for characterizing diffusion and kinetics of fluorescently_labelled molecules in solution through the advent of confocal microscopes which allow detection to within small femtoliter volumes it was then possible to apply fcs techniques to study kinetics of a broad range of biological_molecules at the surface or within the cytoplasm of biological cells more recently super_resolution techniques have opened up a new vista in biological imaging and one of these techniques known as stimulated emission depletion sted microscopy has been combined with fcs to study diffusion of molecules below the diffraction_limit of light truly capable of studying membranes at the nanoscale nm the application of sted fcs to biological imaging has illuminated the kinetics of proteins and lipids whose mechanisms have until now remained_elusive until recently the sted fcs technique has only been applied to study a few select mechanisms due to the technically_demanding and specialist nature of the sted fcs acquisition v c the author published_by
