genome_analysis pyicos a versatile toolkit for the analysis of high_throughput high_throughput hts has revolutionized gene_regulation studies and is now fundamental for the detection of proteindna and proteinrna binding as well as for measuring rna expression with increasing variety and sequencing_depth of hts datasets the need for more flexible and memory_efficient tools to analyse them is growing results we describe pyicos a powerful toolkit for the analysis of mapped_reads from diverse hts experiments chip_seq either punctuated or broad signals clip_seq and rna_seq we prove the effectiveness of pyicos to select for significant signals and show that its accuracy is comparable and sometimes superior to that of methods specifically_designed for each particular type of experiment pyicos facilitates the analysis of a variety of hts datatypes through its flexibility and memory_efficiency providing a useful framework for data_integration into models of regulatory genomics availability open_source with tutorials and protocol files is available atgene expression is regulated through a complex network of protein interactions with rna and dna recent_advances in highthroughput_sequencing hts technologies_provide a very effective way to obtain information about these interactions at genome_wide level at reasonable cost chip_seq chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by hts has become the preferred method for current analysis of transcriptional_regulation in vivo since it provides genome_wide coverage at a high_sensitivity and signal_to however to unravel the complete gene_expression network it is also necessary to systematically identify proteinrna interactions in cells hitsclip or clip_seq cross_linking immunoprecipitation followed by hts provides a powerful mean to obtain global information about direct proteinrna interactions in cells additionally the rna_seq experiments provide a way to measure rna levels at a higher sensitivity and coverage than microarray_experiments despite the inherent biases rnaseq can overcome some of the array limitations and provides the possibility to measure alternative_splicing or expression levels to detect single_nucleotide and to discover novel genes short_read sequencing_platforms such as illumina are very suitable for the study of proteindna and proteinrna interactions since they can produce enough data to perform accurate quantitative analysis furthermore the resulting reads are of sufficient length to be mapped accurately to a reference_sequence but short enough to define the interaction sites with enough precision however not all interactions can be detected at the same coverage for instance transcription_factors produce generally a clearly localized or punctuated signal whereas histone_marks or rna_polymerase rnapii produce broad signals covering more extended regions most of the tools published for the analysis of chip_seq focus on punctuated signals with only few methods devoted to analyse broad signals however these methods are not readily_applicable to other hts datatypes like clip_seq or rna_seq making it necessary to incorporate additional tools to perform gene_regulation studies which generally involve_multiple hts experiments the increase in variety and sequencing_depth of such experiments as well as the growing need for memoryefficient tools that can be applied to various datatypes motivated us to develop pyicos in this article we describe pyicos a versatile toolkit operating on short hts reads that have already been mapped to a reference coordinate system like a genome or a transcriptome we demonstrate its accuracy on punctuated chip_seq comparing it to macs findpeaks and useq using published chip_seq we also describe the accuracy of pyicos enrichment_analysis ea to detect differentially_expressed de genes from rna_seq by comparing it with the bioconductor_packages degseq deseq and edger using published rna_seq and microarray_experiments on the same samples furthermore we illustrate the flexibility of
