structural_bioinformatics efficient identification and analysis of chemical_exchange in biomolecules by r q relaxation_dispersion with amaterasu we introduce here a novel acquisition and processing methodology for cross polarization based d rotating_frame relaxation_dispersion nmr_experiments this easy to use protocol greatly_facilitates the screening acquisition processing and model_fitting of large on and off resonance r q relaxation_dispersion nmr datasets in an automated manner for the analysis of chemical_exchange phenomena in biomolecules availability_and the amaterasu package including the spreadsheet bruker pulse programs and analysis software is available atprotein and nucleic_acid functions are central to all cellular_processes whereas the function of many biomolecules seems to be explained by a single static structure many macromolecules such as enzymes are highly_dynamic and rely on sampling multiple_conformations for their function accurate characterization of these dynamic conformations demands methods that can probe energetically excited minor states in solution relaxation_dispersion nmr_spectroscopy rd nmr is uniquely_suited to probe motion on the biologically_important timescale from microseconds to milliseconds as highlighted by recent research on protein binding enzymatic_activity and base mispairing relaxation_dispersion nmr facilitates the extraction of structural chemical_shift dx kinetic lifetime k ex and thermodynamic populations p i information about the excited_states by quantifying the broadening of resonance lines caused by the chemical exchange_process r q rd resolves motion on the unique timescale of several tens of microseconds to milliseconds by screening the spin lock power x and or offset x dependence of r q the relaxation_rate of a nucleus in the rotating_frame the state of theart version of this experiment achieves superior temporal_resolution by probing one resonance at a time using d nmr however it requires the time consuming acquisition processing and integration of n m free induction decays fids where n is the number of resonances probed and m is the number of variable spin lock power x or offset x values accordingly even for a biomolecule as small as an sh_domain amino_acids very large d datasets must be acquired processed and integrated before the r q values can be fitted to a theoretical_model we considered that this labor_intensive procedure is limiting the broader applicability of this promising approach thus our aim was to develop an efficient methodology to facilitate the investigation of chemical_exchange in biomolecules by r q rd
