sequence_analysis sibis a bayesian_model for inconsistent protein_sequence estimation motivation the prediction of protein_coding is a major_challenge that depends on the quality of genome_sequencing the accuracy of the model used to elucidate the exonic structure of the genes and the complexity of the gene splicing process leading to different protein variants as a consequence todays protein databases contain a huge amount of inconsistency due to both natural variants and sequence prediction_errors results we have developed a new method called sibis to detect such inconsistencies based on the evolutionary_information in multiple_sequence a bayesian_framework combined with dirichlet mixture_models is used to estimate the probability of observing specific amino_acids and to detect inconsistent or erroneous sequence_segments we evaluated the performance of sibis on a reference_set of protein_sequences with experimentally_validated errors and showed that the sensitivity is significantly_higher than previous methods with only a small loss of specificity we also assessed a large set of human sequences from the uniprot database and found evidence of inconsistency in of the previously_uncharacterized sequences we conclude that the integration of quality_control methods like sibis in automatic analysis_pipelines will be critical for the robust inference of structural functional and phylogenetic_information from these sequences availability_and source_code implemented in c on a linux system and the datasets of protein_sequences are freely_available for download atnext generation sequencing ngs_technologies are revolutionizing genomics but the annotation of the genome_assembly produced by these sequencers remains_a the first step in many automatic genome annotation_pipelines involves the prediction of protein_coding a process that is intrinsically complicated time consuming and error_prone first dna sequencing_errors can lead to errors in gene sequence prediction in particular those produced by ngs_technologies or low coverage assemblies second the dna errors are further confounded by inaccuracies in the methods used to delineate the proteincoding_genes coding_regions are mostly predicted by automatic_methods but the relationship between genes transcripts and proteins is complex and automated genome_annotation is not completely accurate the detection of protein_coding in prokaryotic_genomes is generally considered relatively simple compared with eukaryotic_genomes however there still remain a number of problems including the detection of small genes or the localization of the start site in eukaryotic_genomes recent analyses have shown that the complete exon_intron structure is correctly_predicted for only of genes even the best gene predictors and genome annotation_pipelines rarely exceed accuracies of at the exon level meaning that most gene_annotations contain at least one mis annotated exon the situation is further complicated by widespread alternative_splicing which affect of multi exon human genes inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the prediction of proteincoding_genes can often lead to errors in subsequent structural functional or phylogenetic_analyses for example it has been shown that low coverage genomes generate not only a massive number of false gene losses but also striking artifacts in gene_duplication inference it has also been demonstrated that contamination of databases with incomplete abnormal or mispredicted sequences introduces a bias in the definition of orthologs the analysis of protein domain_architectures between orthologs or the estimation of positive darwinian selection the accumulation of erroneous information in genomic and protein databases will continue to grow as features are frequently transferred from annotated to unknown sequences which only amplifies the level of errors in the databases such studies clearly highlight the urgent need for error_detection and quality_control strategies to reduce the impact of inconsistencies and to efficiently extract knowledge from the new genome data a number of computational_methods have been developed to identify inconsistencies or errors in genome and protein_sequences at the genome level current efforts in sequencing_error mitigation mainly rely on filtering strategies including filtering for sequencing read_depth base call quality short_read alignment_quality variant call quality known variants strand bias allelic_imbalance and sequence_context all of these postprocessing techniques help to reduce uncertainty in the final to whom correspondence should be addressed genotyping variant call at the protein level one approach toward solving this problem is to incorporate protein est and rna_seq evidence that may support or contradict the exon_intron structure of the annotated gene several metrics have been developed for example the annotation edit_distance aed which measures how congruent each annotation is with its overlapping evidence the mispred method is based on the hypothesis that conflicts in structural or functional_annotations might imply a badly predicted sequence unfortunately as stated by the authors although mispred identifies many suspicious sequences it detects only a fraction of the truly erroneous sequences we have previously_developed an alternative approach that incorporates evolutionary_information and does not require any structural or functional knowledge this approach was used to evaluate the effect of sequence errors on multiple_sequence accuracy as well as in evolutionary and functional enrichment_analyses in this method the evolutionary_conservation of a set of related sequences was measured using gribskov profiles representing observed amino_acid frequencies in alignment columns nevertheless there are a number of shortcomings in estimating scores for amino_acids based only on their observed_frequencies especially when the number of observed sequences is small first unseen amino_acids are assigned scores based on a substitution matrix that is generally chosen arbitrarily second an arbitrary threshold must be defined to distinguish related from unrelated or erroneous sequences here we present a new method called sibis bayesian inconsistency in sequences for the detection of sequence inconsistencies or errors which replaces the gribskov profiles used previously with a bayesian_model to represent the evolutionary_information in multiple_sequence and to estimate the relatedness of specific sequence_segments the bayesian_approach provides a strong theoretical_foundation for modeling the amino_acid frequencies found at a specific alignment position and for calculating scores for including new sequences sibis thus combines a prior_distribution of amino_acid probabilities with observed amino_acid frequencies at homologous positions within the related proteins in theory the prior_distribution may be of any form but here we use a powerful and elegant formalism which is to assume that the amino_acid frequencies follow a dirichlet distribution or a mixture of a finite number of dirichlet distributions we then exploit an efficient method for calculating posterior distributions which was developed in the context of bayesian integral log odds bild substitution scores designed to extend the log odds formalism that is widely used to define residue substitution scores for pairwise_alignments to multiple_alignments similar bayesian approaches have been used previously to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of various sequence_analysis including sequence database_searches and in gibbs_sampling optimization procedures for local multiple_alignment here we use the bayesian_model to estimate the relatedness of individual sequences within a conserved alignment region to do this we compare the probabilities of observing specific sequences under the assumptions of relatedness and unrelatedness unrelated sequence_segments are then flagged as sequence inconsistencies or potential_errors the accuracy of our prediction is evaluated and compared with two existing_methods based on a set of eukaryotic sequences with known sequence errors that were validated experimentally the results indicate that the bayesian_approach is statistically most powerful and has the highest_accuracy for detecting inconsistent sequence_segments corresponding to ambiguous sequence_variants or errors in spite of tremendous advances in computational gene_finding comprehensive and robust genome_annotation remains a challenge because of the exon_intron structure of eukaryotic_genes and the complex relationship between genes transcripts and proteins as a consequence computationally predicted genes and proteins should be confirmed by independent evidence and or manual verification experimental_validation of protein_sequences for example using shotgun_proteomics is one solution but this is clearly infeasible for all proteomes an alternative is to use bioinformatics approaches to identify erroneous ambiguous or inconsistent protein_sequences using additional information such as est_sequences protein_domain or evolutionary_information here we used multiple_alignments to identify non conserved or unrelated segments in sets of related sequences to assess the evolutionary_conservation between sequences in the alignment we used a bayesian_approach to combine dirichlet mixture distributions with the observed_frequencies of the amino_acids in the alignment columns the bayesian_model provides a robust theoretically sound representation of sequence relatedness and in our experiments we have shown that it significantly_improves the sensitivity of error_detection without loss of specificity a major advantage of our method is that it does not assume that structural or functional information is available so it can also be applied to sequences from less well studied or uncharacterized organisms the interpretation of the inconsistencies detected using bioinformatics approaches remains an issue there is a risk that a genetic event recombination alternative_splicing pseudogenization etc which affects a single_sequence in the multiple_alignment could be interpreted as an error nevertheless the majority of the inconsistencies detected by sibis are likely to result from genome sequencing_errors or inaccuracies in the gene annotation_pipeline our work confirms previous_studies which estimated that approximately half of the sequences in the public_databases contain errors and it is clear that simply eliminating these sequences from subsequent analyses is not a viable solution our method has the advantage that the errors are delimited so that the reliable sequence_segments can be used in subsequent studies error_detection methods such as the one described here that are capable of accurately distinguishing between reliable and unreliable sequence_segments will be crucial for automatic sequence analysis_pipelines and should lead to more robust structural functional and phylogenetic_analyses
