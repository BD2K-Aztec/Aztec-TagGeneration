systems_biology qualitative translation of relations from biopax to sbml qual motivation the biological_pathway exchange language biopax and the systems_biology sbml belong to the most popular modeling and data_exchange languages in systems_biology the focus of sbml is quantitative modeling and dynamic simulation of models whereas the biopax specification concentrates mainly on visualization and qualitative_analysis of pathway maps biopax describes reactions and relations in contrast sbml core exclusively describes quantitative processes such as reactions with the sbml qualitative models extension qual it has recently also become possible to describe relations in sbml before the development of sbml qual relations could not be properly translated into sbml until now there exists no biopax to sbml converter that is fully capable of translating both reactions and relations results the entire nature pathway interaction_database has been converted from biopax level and level into sbml level version including both reactions and relations by using the new qual extension package additionally we present the new webtool biopax sbml for further biopax to sbml conversions compared with previous conversion tools biopax sbml is more comprehensive more robust and more exact availability biopax sbml is freely_available atthe goal of systems_biology is the model driven understanding of biological and biochemical_processes across all layers and various levels of detail the biological_pathway exchange language biopax and the systems_biology sbml are common modeling languages that facilitate the exchange and storage of in silico models biopax can be used to describe the biological semantics of metabolic signaling molecular gene regulatory and genetic_interaction networks it is mainly used for qualitative_analysis and information_exchange sbml describes the structure of models in contrast to biopax it offers the possibility to include mathematical expressions which are necessary for dynamic simulations a detailed comparison between both languages has been given by strombackstromba besides these language differences biopax models from databases like the nature pathway interaction_database pid or metacyc are often used as information_source to build sbml models for further simulation processes the sbml core specification defines quantitative processes such as reactions events rules and constraints in detail but no other relationships between molecules those relationships are denoted as relations that specify enzymeenzyme relations proteinprotein_interactions interactions of transcription_factors and genes proteincompound interaction links to other pathways etc these relations are also provided in biopax models but before the creation of the qualitative models extension for sbml qual see it was not possible to define those relations or to include reactions together with relations in one model hence new biopax to sbml converters are needed today there exist mainly converters from sbml to biopax like the system biology format converter see european bioinformatics institutecomputational systems neurobiology but no converter for biopax to sbml that is capable of properly including relations other research groups previously faced the same problem with incompatibilities between biopax and sbml to overcome the limitations of those file_formats and to avoid the creation of pseudo reactions or similar constructions rubenackerintroduce an intermediate bridging format the need to combine both formats to use the knowledge from a multitude of databases in various applications becomes more and more urgent in this article we present a webtool for the translation from biopax into sbml format we demonstrate its functionality by converting the whole pid from biopax level and level formats to the sbml format including the qual extension
