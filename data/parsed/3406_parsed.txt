pager constructing pags and new pag pag relationships for network biology in this article we described a new database framework to perform integrative gene_set network and pathway analysis gnpa in this framework we integrated heterogeneous data on pathways annotated list and gene_sets pags into a pag electronic repository pager pags in the pager database are organized into p type a type and g type pags with a three letter code standard naming convention the pager database currently compiles genes from species including human pags genegene relationships and two types of pagpag regulatory relationshipsco membership based and regulatory relationship based to help users assess each pags biological_relevance we developed a cohesion measure called cohesion coefficient coco which is capable of disambiguating between biologically_significant pags and random pags with an area_under performance of pager database was set up to help users to search and retrieve pags from its online web_interface pager enable advanced users to build pagpag regulatory_networks that provide complementary biological_insights not found in gene_set or individual gene network_analysis we provide a case study using cancer functional_genomics data_sets to demonstrate how integrative gnpa help improve network biology data coverage and therefore biological in terpretability the pager database can be accessible openly at http discovery informatics iupui edu pager to characterize complex patterns of genetic_variations or rna protein_expressions in surging omics data_sets bioinformatics researchers have developed new data analysis approachesgene set analysis and network pathway analysis when compared with individual gene based analysis approaches gene_set network and pathway analysis gnpa have the potential_advantage of increasing results reproducibility model robustness and data interpretability while reducing biases in noisy omics experimental_data gnpa is essentially an integrative_analysis strategy that takes_advantage of a priori data_structures acquired from many sources in e g gene_ontology go pathways gene protein mutation or expression signatures chemical perturbations metabolomics signatures curated literature computational predictions or public_databases for gene_sets molecular_signatures and pathway network modules depending on the pathway details these analyses can take as minimal information as possible e g using gene_list alone as in gene_set incorporating gene_set databases with expression rank information as in gene_set or take as much pathway network interaction detail as possible e g using pathway reaction regulation details as in enrichnet for biomedical_researchers gnpa can v c the author published_by in this work we presented a new conceptual_framework that unifies pathways annotated gene_lists and gene_sets into a standardized representation called pags we constructed a comprehensive data repository called pager for pag data from heterogeneous sources including ontology pathway omics and public_databases the new pager database collects more pag data than that of the popular msigdb database we showed that a significant benefit for using pager data is the benchmarking of each pag with cohesion measuresscores that can help evaluate the biological_relevance of all genes proteins in a given pag in high_confidence to address the practical challenges of performing gnpa we define new pagpag relationships as m type for those with shared members between pags and t type for those with strong supporting gene regulatory_relationships pointing from one pag to the next we demonstrated through an integrative cancer_genomics study how integrative multiscale gnpa could help gain significant biological_insights of the omics_data we expect future researchers in the field to focus on addressing several key_questions related to pag data management and integrative gnpa first there should be sufficient focus on curating pags with rich meta_data e g information on individual genetic_background life_style and electronic_medical second there should be comprehensive linking of genomics and functional_genomics data from public_databases into pag data_structure therefore researchers may further investigate the biological_relevance of enriched pags and regulatory pag relationships derived from gnpa last we expect to develop novel literature mining and crowd sourcing within the biomedical research_community to continue rapid extension of data for the pager database
