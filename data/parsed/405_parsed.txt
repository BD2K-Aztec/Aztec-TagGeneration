databases_and an rna mapping database for curating rna_structure mapping experiments we have established an rna mapping database rmdb to enable structural thermodynamic and kinetic comparisons across single_nucleotide rna_structure mapping experiments the volume of structure mapping data has greatly_increased since the development of high_throughput sequencing_techniques accelerated software pipelines and large_scale mutagenesis for scientists wishing to infer relationships between rna_sequence structure and these mapping data there is a need for a database that is curated tagged with error estimates and interfaced with tools for sharing visu_alization search and meta_analysis through its on line front end the rmdb allows users to explore single_nucleotide mapping data in heat map bar graph and colored secondary_structure graphics to leverage these data to generate secondary_structure hypotheses and to download the data in standardized and computer friendly files including the rdat and community consensus snrnasm formats at the time of writing the database houses entries describing more than experiments of rna constructs in several solution_conditions and is growing rapidly understanding the secondary_and of rnas is critical for dissecting their diverse_biological ranging from catalysis in ribosomal_rnas to gene_regulation in metabolite sensing riboswitches and protein binding_elements in rna messages rna_structure has therefore been intensely studied with a variety of biophysical and biochemical technologies among these tools a facile information rich and widely used technique is structure mapping also called structure probing or footprinting in which the chemical_modification enzymatic_cleavage or degradation_rate of an rna nucleotide correlates with the exposure flexibility or other structural_features of the site modern_methods often reverse transcribe probed rna_molecules into dna_fragments whose lengths can be subsequently_analyzed to infer the locations of probe events these methods permit the single_nucleotide readout of structural data for rnas as large as ribosomes and in recent_years investigators have developed high_throughput such as well capillary_electrophoresis and deep_sequencing to perform this step furthermore several bioinformatic pipelines have been implemented to rapidly quantify map and analyze the resulting data rna mapping experiments are now routinely used to improve automated secondary_structure modeling probe entire viral_genomes simultaneously map arbitrary rna mixtures through deep_sequencing and infer an rnas contact_map by coupling to exhaustive single nucleotide mutagenesis these developments could enable novel methods in rna structural_biology especially if predictive relationships between rna_sequence structure and these data can be established however unlike existing structural_biology fields like nuclear_magnetic and crystallography there is no equivalent of the biological magnetic_resonance bank or the protein_data that stores curated datasets structure mapping data are available in the supporting material of papers or self_reported in snrnasm format but these formats do not typically include error estimates are not always normalized or background subtracted with standardized protocols are not linked to rna_structures and are not straightforward to visualize which would enable consistency checks during further analysis we have therefore created an rna mapping database rmdb and are populating it with curated structure mapping measurements in human and machine_readable formats amenable to inferring relationships between sequence structure and structure mapping data data contained in the rmdb are freely_available and can be easily integrated with future repositories such as rnacentral to whom correspondence should be addressed the throughput of structure mapping experiments has taken significant leaps with multiplexed capillary_electrophoresis and next_generation that allow probing of thousands of rnas at once these data should in principle permit the development of confident structural_biology tools that couple structure mapping measurements to secondary_and modeling however until recently researchers have had few resources that enable curation and sharing of high_throughput quantified rna mapping data it is our hope that the rmdb will make such projects possible
