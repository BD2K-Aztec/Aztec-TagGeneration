pathvisio validator a rule_based validation plugin for graphical pathway notations biological researchers use pathway diagrams as the medium to relay information about interactions among biological_entities graphical notations like the molecular_interaction map mim notation and the systems_biology sbgn promote the creation of unambiguous biological_pathway diagrams through the use of well defined rules for syntax the specifications for these notations are long and technical and this is a barrier to the wider usage of these notations by researchers this issue presents a clear need not only for tools that simplify the usage of these graphical notations but also tools that guide users in their correct usage pathvisio is an open_source java_based tool for creating and editing biological_pathways and linking diagram elements to to whom correspondence should be addressed external bioinformatics databases van by itself pathvisio does not compel users to create diagrams using any particular notation support for specific notations is added through the use of plugins such as the mim plugin or the sbgn plugin which is under development http www pathvisio org wiki sbgnpluginhelp given this open nature of pathvisio we have developed a validation framework similar to what developers are accustomed to in source_code editors that report syntax errors this accommodates the validation of pathway diagrams against any notation that pathvisio can draw with just the click of a button there are several projects related to standardized formats for computational_biology that have associated validators including well known formats like biopax and sbml there is also validation capability in bcml a sbgn compliant format and sbgned an sbgn diagram editor a key difference between sbgn ed and the plugin presented here is the extensible support for other notations in the latter which is especially important for the pathvisio community since its users may be using various graphical notations for diverse purposes a second difference is that rulesets specifically schematron rulesets created for use with this plugin can be reused in other software projects the use of schematron is a feature that this plugin shares with some generic xml editors with validation capability such as xmlspy http xml tools com validatorbuddy htm
