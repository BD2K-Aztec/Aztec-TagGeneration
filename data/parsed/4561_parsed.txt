databases_and tfcheckpoint a curated compendium of specific dna_binding rna_polymerase transcription_factors gene_regulatory assembly and analysis requires high_quality knowledge sources that cover functional_aspects of the various components of the gene regulatory machinery a multiplicity of resources exists with information about mammalian transcription_factors tfs yet only few of these provide sufficiently accurate classifications of the functional_roles of individual tfs or standardized evidence that would justify the information on which these functional classifications are based we compiled the list of all putative tfs from nine different resources ignored factors such as general tfs mediator complexes and chromatin modifiers and for the remaining factors checked the available literature for references that support their function as a true sequence_specific rna_polymerase tf dbtf the results are available in the tfcheckpoint database an exhaustive collection of tfs annotated according to experimental and other evidence on their function as true dbtfs tfcheckpoint org provides a high_quality and comprehensive_knowledge source for genome_scale regulatory_network studies transcription_factors tfs lie at the basis of gene_expression diversity in different cell_types and conditions tfs constitute key gene regulatory_components that usually participate in large multiprotein dna_complexes where they guide rna_polymerase i e rnap i ii and iii activity and regulate the onset and rate of rna_synthesis these protein_complexes may include general transcription_factors that bind to core_promoter dna general cofactors that bind to general transcription_factors to form a pre initiation transcription complex and specific dna_binding transcription_factors and factors that lack dna_binding but exert their regulatory_roles through interaction with other proteins in the transcription complex this last class of protein interacting transcription regulators includes coactivators corepressors histone modifiers and chromatin_remodeling proteins the dna_binding transcription_factors dbtfs play_a in specifying which genes are transcribed as they guide the transcription_machinery to distinct target_genes by binding to specific gene_regulatory located in proximal promoters as well as in distal enhancer regions kadonaga the dbtf proteins that regulate rnap_ii enjoy a special focus in gene_regulatory building because of their strong ability to explain the protein_coding gene_expression landscape of biological_responses access to accurate and genome_scale knowledge concerning these dbtfs therefore is of key importance multiple resources with knowledge about mammalian tf exist however we observed that i most of them do not distinguish well between true dbtfs proteininteracting tfs and general tfs and ii only in a minority of cases do they provide standardized evidence for the functional role of the tfs because of this users of these resources will only have an obscured view at the domain of dbtfs here we present tfcheckpoint www tfcheckpoint org a comprehensive repository of human mouse and rat tf candidates all entries have been manually checked for literature information pertaining to their potential biological_function as dbtfs the database serves as a checkpoint for tf information is freely_available and supports id or name searching browsing and bulk download a literature based exhaustively curated list of transcription_factors is an invaluable resource for researchers working on gene regulatory_mechanisms the encode_project for instance is targeting the generation of evidence for some putative dbtfs encode_project as estimated by one of our sources tfcheckpoint provides a reference for both small_scale experiments and genome_scale studies researchers may verify predicted lists of tfs even before characterizing the role of these regulatory_proteins or they can use the background_knowledge of tfs to infer gene_regulatory by ensuring that our annotations become part of the go database this knowledge will become available to all analysis approaches based on go knowledge tf candidate and associated literature references for each resource the total numbers of tf entries light gray and tf entries with literature references dark gray are given for goc data all unique proteins annotated to sequence_specific transcription_factor activity go or any of its children are listed the bar to the far right indicates unique tf entries in tfcheckpoint of these adjacent black bar were deemed to be true dbtfs
