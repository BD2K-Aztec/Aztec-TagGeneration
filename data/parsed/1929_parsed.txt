gap towards almost percent prediction for b strand mediated aggregating peptides with distinct morphologies motivation distinguishing between amyloid_fibril forming and amorphous aggregating aggregation_prone regions aprs in proteins and peptides is crucial for designing novel biomaterials and improved ag gregation inhibitors for biotechnological and therapeutic purposes results adjacent and alternate position residue pairs in hexapeptides show distinct preferences for occurrence in amyloid_fibrils and amorphous_aggregates these observations were converted into energy potentials that were in turn machine learned the resulting tool called generalized aggregation proneness gap could successfully distinguish between amyloid_fibril forming and amorphous aggregating hexapeptides with almost percent accuracies in validation tests performed using non redundant datasets conclusion accuracies of the predictions made by gap are significantly_improved compared with other methods capable of predicting either general aggregation or amyloid_fibril forming aprs this work demonstrates that amino_acid play_important in determining the morphological fate of mediated aggregates formed by short_peptides protein_folding and aggregation are among the most important unsolved_problems in biochemistry in the past_few protein_misfolding and aggregation have attracted much research interest not only because of their roles in conformational diseases such as alzheimers and other amyloid neuropathies but also because well ordered aggregates can lead to the design of novel nanomaterials with desired characteristics aggregation is also a major_hurdle in the commercial manufacturing of biotechnology products such as enzymes and biopharmaceuticals aggregates formed by proteins and peptides exhibit a wide_range of morphologies ranging from amorphous to well defined amyloid_fibrils with characteristic x_ray reflections formation of amyloid_fibrils by short_peptides is sequence_dependent when all other parameters such as ph and concentration remain the same indicating a role for side_chains in the mediated aggregation_process lopez de la in a pioneering work from serranos laboratory variants of a designed amyloid fibrilforming peptide stviie were tested for amyloid_fibril at neutral and low_ph lopez de la this study provided valuable datasets of hexapeptides that form_amyloid and those that form amorphous_aggregates the dataset of amyloid_fibril forming hexapeptides was expanded by the developers of waltz software who derived position specific matrices to further elucidate the rules for amyloid_fibril in hexapeptides moreover several computational_methods have been developed to identify the aggregation_prone regions aprs in proteins and peptides using descriptors such as strand propensity hydrophobicity and charge analyses of the available experimental_data on hexapeptides that form_amyloid amyloid peptides and those that form amorphousaggregates but not amyloid_fibrils amorphous aggregating peptides enabled us to decipher rules that distinguish amyloid_fibril hexapeptides from amorphous aggregating peptides it was observed that amyloid_fibril hexapeptides have position specific amino_acid propensities that are distinct from those of the amorphous aggregating hexapeptides by converting the position dependent differences in amino_acid propensities observed for the two types of hexapeptides into energy potentials an algorithm to predict amyloid_fibril peptides was devised this algorithm compared well with the predictive levels of currently available algorithms however there was scope for further improvement in the present work we extend our approach and probe propensities for various pairs of residues to occur simultaneously at alternate and adjacent position pairs in the strand hexapeptides that form_amyloid or amorphous_aggregates we report the development of an algorithm that identifies both amyloid_fibril and amorphous aggregate forming hexapeptides with nearly percent reliability accuracy furthermore the performance of gap was evaluated on five additional but nonredundant datasets that were not used in training this program in all these datasets gap performed with significantly_improved accuracy levels when compared with other commonly used methods for aggregation prediction at a fundamental level success of gap demonstrates that propensities of amino_acid to occur at adjacent and alternate position pairs may be crucial for determining the morphological fate of strand mediated aggregates formed by short_peptides this observation complements the well studied role of polypeptide backbone toward initiating aggregation in peptides and proteins besides accurately identifying potential aprs gap also predicts whether the aprs shall form amorphous_aggregates or amyloid_fibrils this tool is expected to find several applications in both fundamental protein science and biotechnology the three most important_applications of gap include the i ability to rationally design peptide based_nanomaterials with finely_tuned morphologies and physical_characteristics ii improved identification of proteins in human and animal proteomes whose aggregation could lead to diseases and iii improved ability to identify different types of aprs in biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes furthermore it is anticipated that reliable identification of aprs in peptides and proteins shall facilitate design of novel aggregation inhibitors for their use as therapeutic_agents as well as biotechnological excipients and protein_engineering efforts to improve solubility via apr disruption improved ability to identify aprs shall also enable fundamental_research into relationships of aggregation with protein_folding and function the amino_acid of amyloid_fibril forming and amorphous aggregating hexapeptides show distinct residue pair preferences to occur at adjacent and alternate positions this observation enabled us to derive statistical_potentials for amino_acid pairs to simultaneously occur at the alternate and adjacent position pairs in hexapeptides that have been experimentally shown in the literature to from either amyloid_fibrils or amorphous_aggregates these residue pair preferences have been used to develop a new tool called gap gap is capable of accurately identifying aprs in protein and peptide_sequences and also distinguishing whether the predicted aprs shall predominantly form_amyloid or amorphous_aggregates this work also improved our fundamental understanding of strand mediated aggregation_process by highlighting the role of side_chains in determining the morphological fate of the aggregates
