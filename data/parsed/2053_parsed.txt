genome_analysis geworkbench an open_source platform for integrative genomics geworkbench genomics workbench is an_open desktop_application that provides access to an integrated suite of tools for the analysis and visualization of data from a wide_range of genomics domains gene_expression sequence protein_structure and systems_biology more than distinct plug in modules are currently available implementing both classical analyses several variants of clustering classification homology detection etc as well as state of the art algorithms for the reverse_engineering of regulatory_networks and for protein_structure among many others geworkbench leverages standards based middleware technologies to provide seamless access to remote data annotation and computational servers thus enabling researchers with limited local_resources to benefit from available public infrastructure availability the project site http www geworkbench org includes links to self extracting installers for most operating system os platforms as well as instructions for building the application from scratch using the source_code which is freely_available from the projects svn subversion repository geworkbench support is available through the end_user and developer forums of the cabig molecular analysis tools knowledge center https cabig kc nci nih gov molecular forums contact a large number of bioinformatics techniques have been developed in recent_years to serve the needs of biomedical_research the field is moving rapidly with new and improved approaches appearing frequently the fast pace of change and the technical sophistication of these approaches creates a barrier of adoption for ordinary biologists the problem is exacerbated by the integrative nature of biomedical_research which requires combining data from multiple genomic biomedical databases and using an array of advanced analyses often available only in the form of command_line programs additionally due to their sheer size and dimensionality analysis of genomic data_sets can be computationally very demanding it is unlikely that every biomedical researcher that would like to utilize such analyses will have access to local institutional hardware resources capable of geworkbench comprises at present more than distinct modules supporting the integrated analysis and visualization of many types of genomic_data users of geworkbench can bullet load data from disk or from remote data_sources such as the caarray microarray_data repository at the national_cancer https array nci nih gov the pdb protein_structure database and sequence_databases at the university of santa_cruz and the european molecular_biology laboratory bullet visualize gene_expression molecular_interaction protein_sequence and protein_structure data in a variety of ways bullet access client and server side computational_analysis tools such as t test analysis hierarchical_clustering self_organizing analysis_of anova regulatory and signaling network_reconstruction basic_local blast_searches pattern motif_discovery etc bullet validate computational hypothesis through the integration of gene and pathway annotation_information from curated sources as well as through enrichment_analyses page the mission of the magnet center is to provide the research_community with novel structural and systems_biology methods and tools for the dissection of molecular_interactions in the cell and for the interaction based elucidation of cellular_phenotypes lists some of the magnet plug_ins supplementary figs and provide related screenshots other geworkbench modules are wrapped versions of pre_existing third_party software_tools such as cytoscape ontologizer and several analysis modules from the microarray experiment viewer and genepattern a complete module listing with screenshots is available at the project_web http www geworkbench org under the plug_ins page
