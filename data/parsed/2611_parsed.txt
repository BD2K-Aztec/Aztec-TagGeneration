systems_biology jnmfma a joint non_negative meta_analysis of transcriptomics_data motivation tremendous amount of omics_data being accumulated poses a pressing challenge of meta analyzing the heterogeneous data for mining new biological_knowledge most existing_methods deal with each gene independently thus often resulting in high_false in detecting differentially_expressed deg to our knowledge no or little effort has been devoted to methods that consider dependence structures underlying transcriptomics_data for deg identification in meta_analysis context results this article proposes a new meta_analysis method for identification of degs based on joint non_negative jnmfma we mathematically extend non negative matrix factoriza tion nmf to a joint version jnmf which is used to simultaneously decompose multiple transcriptomics data_matrices into one common submatrix plus multiple individual submatrices by the jnmf the dependence structures underlying transcriptomics_data can be interrogated and utilized while the high_dimensional transcriptomics_data are mapped into a low dimensional_space spanned by metagenes that represent hidden biological_signals jnmfma finally identifies degs as genes that are associated with differentially_expressed metagenes the ability of extracting dependence structures makes jnmfma more efficient and robust to identify degs in meta_analysis context furthermore jnmfma is also flexible to identify degs that are consistent among various types of omics_data e g gene_expression and dna_methylation experimental_results on both simulation_data and real_world cancer data demonstrate the effectiveness of jnmfma and its superior_performance over other popular approaches availability_and r code for jnmfma is available for non commercial use via http micblab iim ac cn download as high_throughput biotechnologies have become routine tools in biological and biomedical researches tremendous amounts of omics_data have been generated that provide great opportunity for deciphering molecular_mechanisms of cancer or other diseases two famous public gene_expression databases geo www ncbi nlm nih gov geo and arrayexpress www ebi ac uk arrayexpress have deposited transcriptomic_data with more than a million assays from more than studies another valuable resource the tcga project http cancergenome nih gov has released various types of omics_data for nearly cancer patient samples reusing the flood of transcriptomics_data with meta_analysis can reduce sample bias and increase_statistical and thus allow for indepth understanding of pathology of cancer or other diseases at molecular level however the key issue of meta_analysis i e capturing consistent but subtle patterns of gene activity across multiple transcriptomics datasets still remains_challenging both theoretically and practically differentially_expressed deg across studies could reflect subtle but consistent biological_effects and might be false_negatives in individual analysis to efficiently identify degs meta_analysis methods need to overcome a variety of biological or non biological_variations introduced by distinct protocols and data platforms used in individual studies from the aspect of information to be combined existing meta_analysis methods can be categorized into three classes p value based effect_size based and rank_based which each deal with non specific variations at different levels of data among them the p valuebased method is statistically most intuitive but allows for standardization of topic related associations from studies to the common scale of significance however the performance of p value based_methods heavily depends on the underlying method used for p value calculation in individual analysis compared with p value based_methods the effect_size based_methods estimate and directly synthesize effect_sizes across studies by using a t statistic like model because the effect_size quantity provides a direct measure of differential_expression effect_size methods tend to be more efficient in detecting degs than the p value based_methods there are two types of effect_size models that can be used for meta_analysis of transcriptomics_data fixed_effect fem and random_effect rem which differ in whether between study variation is ignorable generally effect_size based_methods suffer from unreliable error estimates due to improper distribution assumption to whom correspondence should be addressed and large noise inherent in microarray_data comparatively the rank based_methods combine the ranks of fold_change instead of expression values as in effect_size models and have an advantage of fewer or no assumptions about data_structures these two features make the rank based_methods more robust and outlierfree in ranking and assessing genes a representative rank_based method is the rankprod method proposed by which has been extensively demonstrated to be more reliable and robust than many other methods especially in low sample number and or large noise settings statistical hypothesis about variations of differential_expression is another non trivial factor in meta_analysis two complementary hypotheses are generally assumed behind meta_analysis methods one hsa assuming that degs are differentially_expressed de in all the studies and the other hsb assuming that degs are de in one or more studies the former is more desirable when all the studies are homogeneous while the latter is more useful and efficient when heterogeneity is expected across datasets to reconcile the two complementary hypotheses song and tseng recently presented a new type of hypothesis hsr which allows users to specify in what fraction of studies genes are expected to be de it is well known that gene correlations are ubiquitous in transcriptomics_data and can exert substantial impact on the performance of microarray_data analysis without exception the dependence structures also considerably influence the meta_analysis of multiple transcriptomics datasets and need to be dealt with carefully to our knowledge no or little effort has been devoted to the data dependency issue in meta_analysis of transcriptomics_data generally the dependency can be addressed by transforming the high_dimensional into a low dimensional_space in computer science many dimensional reduction or projection methods can be used for the task for example l e cao et_al applied canonical correlation cc analysis to pursuit low_dimensional projections that maximize the associations between two omics variables l e other researchers proposed to use coinertia analyses to explore the relationships between two different types of omics_datasets non_negative nmf is a recently_developed projection_method originally proposed for learning natural parts of faces or semantic features of text under the constraint of non negativity nmf specifically factorizes data matrix to recover natural parts that are integral to the whole it has been shown that nmf and its sparse versions perform well in microarray_data analysis for pattern discovery and classification in this study we propose a joint nmf transcriptomics_data meta_analysis method jnmfma for deg identification biologically a certain number of independent biological_signals underlie a phenotype and collectively shape gene activities that are associated with the phenotype relative to real gene entity these biological_signals can be referred to as metagenes one metagene might dominate the expression of a group of genes and account for the dependence structures between these genes in return we can recover these metagenes from transcriptomics_data and identify degs by associating them with metagenes that are responsible for the phenotype following this this article develops a joint nmf algorithm jnmf to simultaneously decompose multiple transcriptomics datasets into a low dimensional_space spanned by metagenes then we employ a regulation probability model to extract de metagenes and formulate a new metagene based statistic for measuring differential_expression of a gene in meta_analysis context in summary jnmfma can interrogate gene correlations in a joint decomposition way for efficient meta_analysis of transcriptomics_data the use of metagenes as an intermediate step also makes jnmfma flexible in identifying various types of degs by confining metagenes for example jnmfma can be used to meta analyze transcriptomics_data and dna_methylation data of a same or similar topic for identifying methylation driven degs as shown in results section compared with other dimensional reduction methods jnmfma as an extension of nmf derives a parts based representation favors a sparse matrix decomposition and thus is more suitable to analyze large_scale omics_data that are sparse in nature to evaluate the performance of jnmfma we first applied it to simulation_data where jnmfma successfully identified degs with high accuracies considering that lung_cancer is one of the most malignant_tumors worldwide jnmfma was then employed to identify gene_signatures for lung_adenocarcinoma luad based on real_world gene_expression and methylation data collected from geo database in addition we downloaded from tcga http cancergenome nih gov another two expression and methylation datasets of luad as independent evaluation datasets the results on both simulation and real_world cancer data show that jnmfma is able to efficiently identify degs with biological_significance and outperforms other popular approaches
