genome_analysis signalspider probabilistic pattern discovery on multiple normalized chip_seq signal profiles motivation chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip followed by high_throughput chip_seq measures the genome_wide occupancy of transcription_factors in vivo different combinations of dna_binding occupancies may result in a gene being expressed in different tissues or at different developmental_stages to fully understand the functions of genes it is essential to develop probabilistic_models on multiple chip_seq profiles to decipher the combinatorial regulatory_mechanisms by multiple transcription_factors results in this work we describe a probabilistic_model signalspider to decipher the combinatorial binding_events of multiple transcription_factors comparing with similar existing_methods we found signalspider performs better in clustering promoter and enhancer regions notably signalspider can learn higher_order combinatorial patterns from multiple chip_seq profiles we have applied signalspider on the normalized chip_seq profiles from the encode consortium and learned model instances we observed different higher_order enrichment and depletion patterns across sets of proteins those clustering patterns are supported by gene_ontology go enrichment evolutionary_conservation and chromatin_interaction enrichment offering biological_insights for further focused studies we also proposed a specific enrichment map visualization method to reveal the genome_wide transcription_factor combinatorial patterns from the models_built which extend our existing fine_scale knowledge on gene_regulation to a genome_wide level availability_and the matrix algebra optimized exe cutables and source codes are available at the authors websites in human and other eukaryotes gene_expression is regulated by the binding of various modulatory transcription_factors tf onto cis regulatory_dna near genes binding of different combinations of tfs may result in a gene being expressed in different tissues or at different developmental_stages to fully understand a genes function in the cell it is essential to identify the tfs that regulate the gene and their corresponding tf_binding tfbs the techniques such as protein binding microarray microfluidic affinity analysis and protein microarray assays enable us to measure the dna_sequence binding of tfs in vitro on the other hand the technology of chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip followed by microarray chip_chip or sequencing chip_seq can efficiently measure the binding occupancy of a particular tf on a genome_wide scale in vivo in a typical chip_seq study the first step is to call the peaks i e determining the precise location in the genome where the tf binds a number of peak_calling tools have been developed but recent benchmark studies have shown that the peaks from those tools are often inconsistent because multiple transcription_factors often work in cis_regulatory to confer complex gene regulatory programs it is necessary to develop models on multiple chip_seq to decipher the combinatorial dna_binding mechanism in the following we briefly_review some of the previous_works in this area gerstein et_al used pair_wise peak overlapping patterns to construct a human regulatory_network xie et_al proposed self organizing map methods to visualize the colocalization of dna_binding giannopoulou et_al proposed a non_negative to elucidate the clustering of dna_binding zeng et_al proposed jmosaics to discover histone_modification patterns across multiple chip_seq ferguson et_al have described a hierarchical bayes approach to integrate_multiple chip_seq libraries to improve dna_binding event predictions mahony et_al also proposed a mixture_model multigps to detect differential_binding enrichment of a dna_binding in different cell_lines which can improve the proteins dna_binding location predictions i e cdx protein in their study on the other hand chen et_al proposed a statistical_framework mm chip based on macs to perform an integrative_analysis of multiple chip datasets to predict chipenriched regions with known motifs for a given dna_binding i e er and ctcf proteins in their study to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com on the other hand ji et_al proposed a differential principal_component method on chip_seq to perform unsupervised pattern discovery and statistical_inference to identify differential proteindna_interactions between two biological conditions guo et_al described a generative probabilistic_model gem for high_resolution dna binding_site discovery from chip data interestingly that model combines chip signals and dna motif_discovery together to achieve precise predictions of the dna_binding locations of a dna_binding the authors have further demonstrated how gem can be applied to reveal spatially constrained transcription_factor pairs on a genome despite the success of the methods described above to fully understand a genes function it is essential to develop probabilistic_models on multiple chip_seq profiles to decipher the genomewide combinatorial patterns of dna_binding occupancy unfortunately the majority of the previous work usually focused on large_scale clustering of called peaks which is an intuitive and straightforward approach however such approaches have two limitations as i peak_calling ignores the contributions from weak bindings of tfs and ii pair_wise analysis ignores the complex combinatorial binding pattern among the tfs here we propose a new approach to build fine_scale probabilistic_models for directly analyzing multiple normalized chip_seq signal profiles on all the promoter and enhancer regions quantitatively so that weak bindings can be taken into account especially its computational_complexity has been carefully_designed to scale well with the increasing chip_seq i e linear complexity after model training we can extract and reveal the high order combinatorial and quantitative occurrence patterns from the trained probabilistic_models for better understandings on the dna_binding combinatorics with the prevalence of chip_seq technology massive chipseq data have been accumulated the current chip_seq analysis studies usually involve single profile peak_calling two areas of improvement are currently being explored in the field how to integrate binding_profiles of multiple transcription_factors and how to include the signals from the areas that are not called as peaks in light of that we have developed a probabilistic_model to analyse multiple chip_seq signal profiles directly the model signalspider not only can cluster genome into several region types but also can extract subtle binding combinations from multiple dna_binding the results show that the proposed model demonstrated performance better than the other existing_methods on the simulated_data derived from the available chip_seq dataset with the support of go enrichment_analysis evolutionary_conservation chromatin_interaction enrichment_analysis and available wet_lab studies we found that the discovered patterns show significant genome_wide insights in particular the patterns indicate that the genome_wide dna_binding occurrence patterns are far from simple co associative pair_wise interactions instead we observed different higher_order enrichment and depletion patterns across different proteins with increasing available chip_seq we envision that signalspider will be useful in understanding the genome_wide dna_binding dynamics examples of conserved_regions the vertical_axis is the conservation phastcons scores while the horizontal axis denotes two regions the left boxes correspond to the cluster regions of interest while the right boxes denote the background region outliers are omitted p values for wilcoxon_rank and t test are shown at the title
