genome_analysis mig multi image genome viewer multi image genome mig viewer is a web_based application for visualizing querying and filtering many thousands of genome_browser regions as well as for exporting the data in a variety of formats this methodology has been used successfully to analyze chip_seq and rna_seq and to detect somatic_mutations in genome resequencing projects next_generation ngs_technologies are producing vast amount of data for analyses it is usual for a typical chipseq rna_seq or genome resequencing experiment to produce millions of sequence_reads that are subjected to various iterations of analysis once the reads are mapped to a reference_genome they can be visualized in a genome_browser such as the ucsc_genome gbrowse igv or igb often in combination with a number of associated tracks such as gene structures expression graphs conservation plots and other quantitative data depending on the experiment the data are then stored in a variety of file_formats queried and filtered using a variety of bespoke tools and languages to produce spreadsheets web_pages and overview plots and visualizations bioinformatics_tools for analysis of such large_amounts of data are still immature have a wide_range of parameters and often produce confusing results a key issue is to verify the findings by linking filtered results to the original mapped data for example in a typical chip_seq experiment one would map the reads and isolate regions of enrichment using a peak finding algorithm such as macs peak finding is often dependent on antibody quality and experimental_conditions choosing suitable cutoff parameters such as p values false_discovery density of sequences and fold enrichment is difficult hence verification of the results is often done by visual_inspection once a set of satisfactory peaks are identified the next stage is to look for overlaps with various genomic_features such as cpg islands genes promoters and regions of conserved_sequences many biologists are overwhelmed by the volume of the data and find it difficult to query and manipulate the output an alternative use case might be in filtering somatic variant_calls following ngs the ninth column defines a facet for the feature that can subsequently be queried using migs web_interface accessory scripts have been written to aid the construction of the input gff files facets may be added using a perl script annotate pl which uses cisgenome for annotating region overlaps with various standard gene feature classes such as introns exons intragenic and intergenic_regions gene ontologies are also mapped using the nearest gene additionally a second script intersectappend pl can be used to integrate data from other resources e g cpg islands areas of histone_modification peak calls from other chip_seq this script wraps bedtools and allows regions to be classified as overlapping true false each of the features in the set both annotate pl and intersectappend pl append a name value pair to the ninth column of the source gff file these tools are available for download on the web_site mig has been used to analyze a combined dnase_seq chip_seq dataset as an example of migs use with chip_seq we use a dataset generated with an antibody recognizing the transcriptional_activator erf examples of data querying using the mig interface can be seen inand also within mig itself at https mig molbiol ox ac uk mig tutorials on the web_site are also available based on this dataset in summary we see mig as a compelling method to investigate ngs_data and other large_datasets by bringing a powerful and intuitive web_based interface to the biologist mig allows the user to generate these collections in an automated way and store multiple projects in the mig database these collections can also be shared with other mig users so that whole groups can perform analysis on the same data
