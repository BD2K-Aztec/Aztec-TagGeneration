gene_expression distance based differential analysis of gene curves motivation time course gene_expression experiments are performed to study time varying changes in mrna_levels of thousands of genes statistical_methods from functional data analysis fda have recently gained popularity for modelling and exploring such time courses each temporal_profile is treated as the realization of a smooth function of time or curve and the inferred curve becomes the basic_unit of statistical_analysis the task of identifying genes with differential temporal_profiles then consists of detecting statistically_significant differences between curves where such differences are commonly quantified by computing the area between the curves or the l distance results we propose a general test_statistic for detecting differences between gene curves which only depends on a suitably chosen distance measure between them the test makes use of a distance based variance decomposition and generalizes traditional manova tests commonly used for vectorial observations we also introduce the visual l distance which is shown to capture shape related differences in gene curves and is robust against time shifts which would otherwise inflate the traditional l distance other shape related distances such as the curvature may carry biological_significance we have assessed the comparative performance of the test on realistically simulated_datasets and applied it to human immune_cell responses to bacterial_infection over time availability r scripts are freely_available for download atin longitudinal microarray_experiments the temporal evolution of expression levels in thousands of genes are monitored in an attempt to understand the dynamic_processes that regulate them repeated_measurements of mrna are taken at a relatively small number of time points for all the available biological_replicates a common aim of such studies is to compare gene_expression observed in different populations or under different experimental_conditions and to identify those genes whose temporal_profiles differ significantly the data produced by such longitudinal_studies however present several challenges for to whom correspondence should be addressed statistical_analysis statistical_tests developed for cross_sectional data such as the t test and its many modifications are inadequate because they are only able to detect differential_expression at individual time points and they ignore the temporal dependencies that are typical of the experimental_data models from classical time series analysis are also limited in scope as the time courses are generally very short sampled at irregularly spaced time points and often contain missing_data over the last few years these issues have led to an increasing interest in the application of functional data analysis fda techniques in fda the longitudinal observations are treated as noisy realizations of an underlying smooth curve which represents the true continuous evolution of a genes expression_level over time once these underlying curves have been inferred from the observed data they become the basic_unit of statistical_analysis on which a wide_variety of tasks can be performed such as dimensionality_reduction and visualization clustering and differential analysis a recent review of developments in this area can be found in we consider the problem of detecting differences between gene curves representative of two or more groups when several biological_replicates are available for each group a number of test_statistics have been proposed to test for equality between curves including masigpro edge pace and functional bayes approaches the underlying problem of detecting differences between curves has also been extensively considered in non parametric statistics and various tests have been developed that could be used for the analysis of gene_expression temporal_profiles including the functional f statistic and the more recent tn statistic the underlying assumption shared by these methods is that under the null_hypothesis of equality between curves the area between them is zero our work is motivated by the observation that although the area between two curves as captured by the l distance often provides an intuitive and easily_interpretable measure of difference between them existing_methods only capture this specific type of difference thus potentially interesting differences between gene curves that may carry biological_relevance may be missed for instance the l distance may fail to capture specific shape related features that would otherwise be detected by the expert eye such as the number and location of peaks and troughs or their respective curvatures furthermore time shifted curves considered different when using the standard l distance might be considered similar using anpage
