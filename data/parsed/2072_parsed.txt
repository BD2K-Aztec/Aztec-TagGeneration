global optimization based_inference of chemogenomic features from drug_target motivation gaining insight into chemogenomic drugtarget_interactions such as those involving the substructures of synthetic_drugs and protein_domains is important in fragment_based and drug_repositioning previous_studies evaluated the interactions locally thereby ignoring the competitive effects of different substructures or domains but this could lead to high false_positive estimation calling for a computational_method that presents more predictive_power results a statistical_model termed global optimization based_inference of chemogenomic features from drugtarget_interactions or gift is proposed herein to evaluate substructure domain interactions globally such that all substructure domain contributions to drugtarget_interaction are analyzed simultaneously combinations of different chemical substructures were included since they may function as one unit when compared to previous methods gift showed better interpret ive performance and performance for the recovery of drugtarget_interactions was good among known drugdomain interactions were accurately_predicted by gift eighteen of the top predicted combined substructure domain interactions had corresponding drugtarget structures in the protein_data database and out of the had been proved gift was then implemented to predict substructure domain interactions based on drug_repositioning for example the anticancer_activities of tazarotene adapalene acitretin and raloxifene were identified in summary gift is a global chemogenomic inference approach and offers fresh insight into drugtarget_interactions availability_and the source codes can be found at http bioinfo au tsinghua edu cn software gift contact protein_domains are independent folding structures and form different proteins as the functional_units compared with sequence_similarity domain structures are much more conserved among proteins compound chemical substructures or functional scaffolds are the basic structural and functional building_blocks of small_molecules according to chemogenomics or chemical genomics involves the systematic_screening of targeted chemical libraries of small_molecules against individual drug_target familieswith the goal of identifying new drugs and drug_targets thus gathering chemogenomic data about protein_domains and the chemical substructures of drugs underlying drugtarget_interactions could foster the development of fragment_based drug_repositioning and the understanding of drug_induced side_effects thereby supplementing the network pharmacology methods of target prediction among fda_approved and nutraceuticals from the drugbank database only of them are contained in the protein_data pdb database the large_gap between the number of known binding positions and the total number of drugtarget_pairs calls for computational_models to bridge them such computational_models can be classified as structure based_methods and nonstructure based_methods structure based_methods such as docking have been developed over the course of many years but they are constrained by the dependence on three_dimensional structures of proteins in recent_years several non structure based_methods which are not limited by the structure information have been developed along the accumulation of large_scale database in both chemistry and biology developed a sparse canonical correspondence_analysis method to extract the associated sets of chemical substructures and protein_domains from drugtarget_interactions but the amount of detectable protein_domains was relatively small applied graph mining and sequence mining to automate the search for significant substructure patterns leading to the interpretation of polypharmacology in drugtarget network the substructures in drugs or proteins did not need to be defined from the literatures however protein substructures which are generally composed of two or three residues were difficult to correlate with biological interpretations treated this question as a classification_problem in machine_learning they used the logistic_regression and support_vector svm algorithm to seek the drug_chemical and protein_domains pairs that could be used to determine_whether drugs and proteins interact or not this method showed good results in predicting drugtarget_interactions however none the methods noted above was able to evaluate uncertainty or variance of results and they also ignored the possible combinations of drug_chemical that bind to protein_domains as a whole more importantly the competitive effects of different substructuredomain interactions have never been considered since prediction has thus far been performed locally therefore in this article a global optimization based_inference of chemogenomic features from drugtarget_interactions termed gift was proposed since different drug_chemical and protein_domains may competitively contribute to drugtarget_interactions gift takes into consideration all the substructuredomain interactions and treats them as latent_variables leading to drugtarget_interactions a substructuredomain interaction is defined as a direct_physical between a chemical substructure and a protein domain for example a hydrogen_bond between an atom in a chemical substructure and an atom in an amino_acids it should be noted that because some drugtarget_interactions have not been recorded in drugbank we incorporated two parameters namely fp false_positive and fn false_negative to describe data inaccuracy and incompleteness then the substructuredomain contributions to different drugtarget_pairs were globally analyzed by the expectationmaximum em_algorithm framework a statistical_method to find the maximum_likelihood when the latent_variables exist variances in results were calculated by the observed fisher information gift was further extended to include the combinations of different drug_chemical based on the likelihood that some may function together more than substructure domain interactions were found by gift some were validated by the pdb database our approach is a promising method for investigating drugtarget binding positions and contributes to our understanding in this field in this article a statistical_model termed gift was constructed to infer the interactions between drug_chemical and protein_domains based on drugprotein interactions data for the first time a global optimization perspective has been introduced into this computation meaning that all the substructure domain contributions on drugtarget_interactions are simultaneously_analyzed gift has several advantages compared with previous methods first it offers a more detailed_description on the drugprotein interactions instead of adhering to the constraint which holds that similar drugs target similar proteins we attempt to reveal the possible mechanisms_underlying drugprotein interactions second more than interactions were predicted by scca and around interactions were predicted by l svm however these figures represent local estimates in addition to the lack statistical_significance evaluations thus potentially overestimating substructuredomain interactions gift on the other hand can reduce such overestimation by incorporating a global perspective that accommodates variance estimation it should be noted that gift is limited in that it only focuses on two_dimensional chemical_space as presented by the pubchem substructures therefore in the future three_dimensional structure information should be incorporated into the calculations see section as reflected by data already accumulated in the pdb database more than compound protein interactions can be found including more than distinct compounds extraction of these binding information might result in more precise estimations of the substructure domain interactions in the future in summary we propose a novel chemogenomic approach to infer substructure domain interactions it provides a chemogenomic view of the mechanisms of drugprotein interactions and can be used as a new method that contributes to target prediction drug_repositioning and drug_combination studies
