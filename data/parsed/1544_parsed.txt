efficient genome ancestry_inference in complex pedigrees with inbreeding motivation high_density data of model animal resources provides opportunities for fine resolution genetic_variation studies these genetic_resources are generated through a variety of breeding schemes that involve multiple_generations of matings derived from a set of founder animals in this article we investigate the problem of inferring the most probable ancestry of resulting genotypes given a set of founder genotypes due to computational difficulty existing_methods either handle only small pedigree data or disregard the pedigree structure however large_pedigrees of model animal resources often contain repetitive substructures that can be utilized in accelerating computation results we present an accurate and efficient method that can accept complex pedigrees with inbreeding in inferring genome ancestry inbreeding is a commonly used process in generating genetically_diverse and reproducible animals it is often carried_out for many generations and can account for most of the computational_complexity in real_world model animal pedigrees our method builds a hidden_markov that derives the ancestry probabilities through inbreeding process without explicit modeling in every generation the ancestry_inference is accurate and fast independent of the number of generations for model animal resources such as the collaborative cross cc experiments on both simulated and real cc data demonstrate that our method offers comparable accuracy to those methods that build an explicit model of the entire pedigree but much better scalability with respect to the pedigree size model_organisms such as laboratory_mice are frequently bred or crossed in order to study genetic_influences often such animal resources are generated using prescribed breeding system to ensure diversity and reproducibility which leads to complex pedigree structure consisting of many generations through recombination the dna_sequences of founder organisms are intermixed in each generation a dna_sequence of any descendant organism is a mosaic of its founders dna_segments as recombinations at each breeding stage cannot be observed directly it is of great interest to infer the ancestry of resulting dna_sequences in other words which part of a resulting dna_sequence is inherited from which founder the vast_majority of the sequence_variations are attributed to single base_pair mutations known as single nucleotide to whom correspondence should be addressed the development of high_density technology makes model animal resources a powerful_tool genetic_variations it also makes any analysis on such resources computationally_challenging in this article we demonstrate that modeling repetitive substructure of a pedigree can provide significant_improvement in efficiency without compromising accuracy we introduce anovel method for modeling the inbreeding process integrated into the hmm framework originally introduced by the landergreen algorithm our method can handle large_pedigrees such as cc efficiently the inbreeding substructure model alone does not speed up the ancestry_inference for all types of pedigrees but as we have shown with the cc the computational benefit can be crucial for analyzing many model animal resources in analyzing such data our method outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency we believe that substructure modeling is a promising approach for large pedigree_analysis especially when specific types of pedigree are of interest in the future we plan to investigate other common substructures and build a more general framework to allow efficient computation on more types of pedigrees funding national_science iis iis partially national_institutes gm partially conflict of interest none declared
