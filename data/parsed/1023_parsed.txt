data_and cnvineta a data_mining tool for large case control copy_number datasets motivation copy_number cnv a major contributor to human genetic_variation comprises kb genomic deletions and insertions yet the identification of cnvs from microarray_data is still hampered by high false_negative and positive prediction rates due to the noisy nature of the raw_data here we present cnvineta an r package for rapid data_mining and visualization of cnvs in large casecontrol datasets genotyped with single_nucleotide oligonucleotide_arrays cnvineta is compatible with various established cnv prediction_algorithms can be used for genome_wide of rare and common cnvs and enables rapid and serial display of log of raw_data ratios as well as b allele_frequencies for visual_quality inspection in summary cnvineta aides in the interpretation of large_scale cnv datasets and prioritization of target_regions for follow_up experiments availability_and cnvineta is available as an r package and can be downloaded from http www ikmb uni kiel de cnvineta the package contains a tutorial outlining a typical workflow the cnvineta compatible hapmap dataset can also be downloaded from the link above contact m wittig mucosa demany recent research findings_suggest that copy_number cnv plays_a in genetic_variability and hence human disease however while methodologies for large_scale association studies of single_nucleotide snps are well established a comprehensive framework for the analysis and interpretation of genome_wide cnv predictions in large casecontrol datasets is still lacking cnv prediction_algorithms for data derived from snp microarrays have improved considerably over the last few years but many predicted segments are still false_positives and can only be excluded through visual_inspection in analogy to the mandatory inspection to whom correspondence should be addressed of genotyping assay scatterplots derived from snp based genomewide_association gwas wtccc in addition false_negative tend to be high which can for example cause problems when rare cnv candidates are overlooked in the data current visualization_tools such as the affymetrix genotyping console work well with small_datasets and are suitable for cancer_diagnostics and similarly small_sized sample_sets the difficulties in bridging the gap between packages for cnv prediction association analysis and visualization for distinguishing genuine signals from false_positive negative predictions in generally noisy datasets have hindered many scientists from conducting genome_wide cnv analysis of their existing large gwas datasets we here present cnvineta an r package capable of handling cnv data derived from large_datasets with implemented analysis tools for the detection and visualization of disease associated rare supplementary and common cnvs supplementary figs s s cnvineta was designed to allow researchers to access large_datasets from standard desktop computers we hope that cnvineta will empower scientists to perform genome_wide cnv screening and quickly evaluate raw_data of candidate cnvs in existing gwas datasets
