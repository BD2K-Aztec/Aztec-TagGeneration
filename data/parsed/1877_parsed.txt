genome_analysis fragment recruitment on metabolic_pathways comparative metabolic_profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes motivation the sheer scale of the metagenomic and metatranscrip tomic datasets that are now available warrants the development of automated protocols for organizing annotating and comparing the samples in terms of their metabolic_profiles we describe a user_friendly java program fromp fragment recruitment on metabolic_pathways for mapping and visualizing enzyme annotations onto the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg metabolic_pathways or custom made pathways and comparing the samples in terms of their pathway completeness scores their relative activity scores or enzyme enrichment odds_ratios this program along with our fully configurable perl based annotation organization pipeline meta pro metabolic_profiling of meta omic_data offers a quick and accurate standalone solution for metabolic_profiling of environmental_samples or cultures from different treatments apart from pictorial comparisons fromp can also generate score matrices for multiple meta omics samples which can be used directly by other statistical programs availability the source_code for fromp can be downloaded from https sites google comthe rapidly_accumulating environmental meta omic metagenomic and metatranscriptomic projects resulting from highthroughput sequencing_techniques warrant the development of new protocols that can provide a quick overview of the microbial metabolic potential or activity there has been some effort towards management of such data its taxonomic and metabolic_profiling visualization of metabolic_pathways and statistical_analyses of community differences in most cases the tools are web_based and the primary method for annotation is blast we describe here a standalone set of tools to get a rapid and accurate overview of the metabolic_functions of the resident microbial_community the enzyme identification component of this pipeline based on the modenza enzyme commission ec numbers and pfam profile_hidden hmms provides a quick and accurate ec_number identification the standout feature is the fromp fragment recruitment on metabolic_pathways pathway mapping and comparative visualization_tool which maps ec numbers and pfam annotations onto the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg reference or custom made metabolic_pathways multiple meta omic samples can be compared with each other based on a pathway completeness score modified from a pathway activity score or an odds_ratio for enzyme enrichment the increased accuracy of hmm_based annotation and an ability to compare multiple meta omic samples at once are attributes that improve on currently available metabolic_profiling tools such as megan and mg rast we present here a set of tools for accurate standalone metabolic_profiling of meta omic_data the java program fromp and the meta pro collection of perl scripts along with the relevant documentation are available from https sites google com site dhwanidesai home software
