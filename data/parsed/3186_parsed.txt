structural_bioinformatics mycpermcheck the mycobacterium_tuberculosis permeability prediction_tool for small_molecules motivation with million new cases in particularly documented in developing_countries tuberculosis tb is still a highly present pandemic and often terminal this is also due to the emergence of antibiotic_resistant mdr_tb and xdr_tb of the primary causative tb agent mycobacterium_tuberculosis mtb efforts to develop new effective drugs against mtb are restrained by the unique and largely impermeable composition of the mycobacterial cell_wall results based on a database of antimycobacterial substances cdd tb compounds were classified as active and thus permeable a data_mining approach was conducted to gather the physico_chemical similarities of these substances and delimit them from a generic data_set of drug like molecules on the basis of the differences in these datasets a regression_model was generated and implemented into the online tool mycpermcheck to predict the permeability probability of small organic_compounds discussion given the current lack of precise molecular criteria determining mycobacterial permeability mycpermcheck represents an unprecedented prediction_tool intended to support antimycobacterial drug_discovery it follows a novel knowledge driven approach to estimate the permeability probability of small organic_compounds as such mycpermcheck can be used intuitively as an additional selection criterion for potential new inhibitors against mtb based on the validation results its performance is expected to be of high practical value for virtual_screening purposes availability the online tool is freely_accessible under the url http www mycpermcheck despite its ancient origin and the successes of antibacterial chemotherapeutics introduced years_ago tuberculosis tb is still one of the most widespread and abundant infectious_diseases in million new cases were documented particularly in developing_countries since the discovery of mycobacterium_tuberculosis mtb as the primary causative_agent of tb a complex first line treatment was developed based on the prodrug isoniazid however because of the emergence of multi and extensively drug_resistant mdr_tb and xdr_tb the design of novel potent inhibitors is an ongoing challenge an important natural defense mechanism of mtb is its thick and waxy cell_wall providing a first powerful barrier against antibiotic_drugs it consists of a peptidoglycan arabinogalactanmycolic acid core as well as the outmost layer the so_called capsule it has been shown that not only hydrophilic agents but also lipophilic agents may have severe problems passing the permeability_barrier of the cell_wall owing to the unusually_low fluidity of the lipid_bilayer without the ability to penetrate this cell_wall even most potent inhibitors of validated mycobacterial drug_targets like inha will not have any efficacy unfortunately data about mycobacterial permeability properties of chemical_compounds are hardly available hampering the development of knowledge based_methods for permeability estimation however as in most of the cases a compound must permeate the mycobacterial cell_wall to show antimycobacterial_activity it is reasonable to infer an ability to pass this barrier for compounds active against mycobacteria in ekins and colleagues developed a collaborative database cdd tb of compounds which had been tested for antibiotic_activity against mtb over structures showed growth_inhibition of at a concentration of m obviously these compounds have sufficient permeability to be active against mtb and may thus be used as a knowledge_base for analyzing permeability determining features accordingly an extensive data_mining approach based on the physico_chemical of this dataset was performed with the subsequent development of a regression_model with this knowledge based classification system the permeability of potential new compounds against mtb can be estimated with high_accuracy and quantified comfortably
