bioinformatics_discovery systems_biology distinction immune genes of hepatitis induced heptatocellular carcinoma motivation hepatitis_b and hepatitis_c are the two leading causes resulting in hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc it is observed that hepatitis_c hcv is relatively difficult to induce hcc compared with hepatitis_b hbv this motivates us to reveal the reasons behind this from the viewpoint of immune genes results to distinguish the immune genes with low_level expression in hbv induced hcc but high_level expression in hcv induced hcc the concept of distinction immune gene is proposed a filter is then designed to screen these genes by using gene positive network with strong correlations between genes the genes are further filtered to form the set of key distinction immune genes the key distinction immune genes are screened which are divided_into four clusters t cells b cells immune signalling and major_histocompatibility it is evident that the screened genes are important immune genes which are activated in hcv induced hcc but inactivated in hbv induced hcc in hcv induced hcc the structures of hcv adaptively update so that they are difficult to be identified by antigens therefore the clinic advice is either to increase the update speed of antigens or reduce the update speed of the viruses during the treatment of hcv induced hcc moreover it is also advised to add t cells or add the expression levels of t cells to strengthen the ability to kill_cancer in contrast hbv updates slowly but the immunity system in hbv induced hcc has been damaged seriously as a result the clinic advice is to improve the immune ability of patients subjected to hbv induced hcc such as increasing immunoglobulin t cells and b cells and so forth contact hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc accounts for of primary_liver ranking it at the fifth position among the most common malignancies worldwide and in the third position as a cause of cancer death hcc is a devastating tumour with a mean survival of much less than one year if left_untreated hcc more than million people worldwide are persistently_infected with the hepatitis_b hbv and or hepatitis_c hcv who are at a risk of developing chronic_liver cirrhosis and even hcc increasingly experimental_evidences suggest that viruses such as hbv and hcv contribute to hcc by directly modulating pathways that promote the malignant_transformation of hepatocytes hcv_infection is one of the major risk_factors for hcc however cancer arises in only a subset of patients which takes several years to develop therefore the role of hcv in the aetiology of cancer has remained_elusive hcv may activate the immune system for instance natural_killer are activated by the hcv it is also noticed that hcc may escape adaptive_immune in addition cirrhosis is a transition_state from normal liver to tumorigenesis in hcv induced hcc there is a strong incentive to seek key immune genes and identify the relationship between these genes and hepatitisinduced hcc motivated by this a filter is designed to screen these genes and experiments are implemented by using the data from the stanford database according to the experiments results and analyses clinical_recommendations are finally given for the treatments of hcv induced hcc and hbv induced hcc equation based dynamic_network model and graph_based gene community network are usually used to model gene_networks in this study gene community network will be used to describe gene_networks the main contribution is summarized as follows
