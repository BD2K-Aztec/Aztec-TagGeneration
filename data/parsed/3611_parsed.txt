systems_biology population length variability and nucleoid numbers in escherichia_coli motivation cell_sizes and shapes are a fundamental defining characteristic of all cellular life in bacteria like escherichia_coli the machinery that determines cell length is complex and interconnected spanning extracellular cues biosynthesis and cell_division few tools exist to study cell lengths in a population we have developed and tested three automated_image routines on growing e coli cultures to simultaneously measure cell lengths and nucleoid numbers in populations of bacteria we find population profiles changing with culture densityhigher density of culture leads to fewer long cells additionally lab strains mutant for reca show a correlation between the number of nucleoids and cell length cell_shape size and its regulation are a fundamental property of cellular organisms escherichia_coli is a rod_shaped and multiple genetic_factors have been isolated over the years that affect its shape and size reviewed in cell size in e coli can be characterized as cell length and width while width has been observed to be more or less constant length of the bacteria has been shown to vary even in cells in the same environment and of the same age for instance the proportion of long cells has been shown to decrease with increasing cell_density decreasing temperature caused increased cell_volume while more recently cell lengths were observed to decrease at c compared with c the filamentous phenotype corresponding to elongated e coli cells has been generated by inhibition mutation or deletion of penicillin_binding cell scaffolding proteins mre and mbl cell_division proteins ftsz and mincde and nucleoid occlusion reviewed in however the population variability in such length measurements has been lacking thus reproducible quantification of cell_sizes and subcellular structures is important to address combinations of effects of genetic_and on cell phenotype recent studies_examining bacterial cell lengths have used cell sorters and particle analyzers to measure bacterial cell size and cell to whom correspondence should be addressed cycle stage however these methods lack spatial_information about the cells or their subcellular structures microscopy and image_analysis appear to be the optimal_solution have estimated the accuracy of cell_division in e coli to be by measuring the sd in the pinch position as a fraction of cell length in phase contrast_images using green_fluorescent gfp expressing_cells the sd of cell width was estimated as more recently a high content image_analysis tool has been applied to measuring the e coli cell length variability and mind oscillations the methods used works well on phase contrast and fluorescence_images but not on differential_interference dic images bacterial genomic_dna that is compacted in the cell is referred to as the nucleoid distinguishing it from the membrane_bound nucleus found in eukaryotes nucleoids form an important part of the cell_division machinery as has been seen recently seen in their role in determining the positioning of the ftsz ring necessary for equational division in e coli in bacillus incomplete dna_replication causes filamentation of cells by nucleoid occlusion i e the steric_hindrance of the cell_division machinery by nucleoids we have developed an algorithm to detect cell lengths in dic microscopy_images of populations of e coli laboratory_strains grown in liquid batch_culture we combined this with automated_detection of nucleoids in fluorescence_images we confirmed with previous_findings that the proportion of long cells decreases with increasing culture density additionally the lab strain dh with attenuated recombinase activity shows a linear correlation between cell length and nucleoid numbers we hypothesize that a higher rate of replication fork_stalling in such strains results in the inhibition of cell_division while cell_elongation continues leading to longer cells the algorithm presented here demonstrates our ability to detect and quantify cell length variability in e coli and relate it to the variability in nucleoid numbers changing properties like nutrient_availability per cell appears to affect this population variability in a manner consistent across strains the image_analysis algorithm presented here detects cell lengths and nucleoids in rod_shaped and filamentous bacterial_populations shows a linear trend linear fit r with slope please refer online for colour figures
