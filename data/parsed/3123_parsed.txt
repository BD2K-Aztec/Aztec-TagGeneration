gene_expression msnbase an r bioconductor_package for isobaric tagged mass_spectrometry data visualization processing and quantitation msnbase is an r bioconductor_package for the analysis of quantitative_proteomics experiments that use isobaric tagging it provides an exploratory_data framework for reproducible_research allowing raw_data import quality_control visualization data_processing and quantitation msnbase allows direct integration of quantitative proteomics_data with additional facilities for statistical_analysis provided by the bioconductor_project availability msnbase is implemented in r version and available at the bioconductor web_site www bioconductor org vignettes outlining typical workflows input_output capabilities and detailing underlying infrastructure are included in the package proteomics the analysis of the entire protein complement expressed by a genome has recently benefited from substantial technological_advances among the numerous approaches to interrogate proteomes a popular technique is the quantitation of samples using isobaric tags nevertheless high_throughput lags behind genomics genetics or transcriptomics in terms of reproducible data analysis and development of analytical stategies one of the challenges within proteomics is the availability of open extensible and efficient data_mining and statistical assessment environments here we introduce the msnbase package part of the bioconductor_project msnbase extends bioconductor with tools and data_structures to import raw tandem_mass ms data perform exploratory_data and quantification of isobaric reporter tags the infrastructure is compatible with existing bioconductor core packages incorporating available features and allowing direct utilization of additional functionality
