mesh a window into full text for document summarization motivation previous_research in the biomedical_text domain has historically been limited to titles abstracts and metadata available in medline records recent research initiatives such as trec genomics and biocreative strongly point to the merits of moving beyond abstracts and into the realm of full texts full texts are however more expensive to process not only in terms of resources needed but also in terms of accuracy since full texts contain embellishments that elaborate contextualize contrast supplement etc there is greater risk for false_positives motivated by this we explore an approach that offers a compromise between the extremes of abstracts and full texts specifically we create reduced versions of full text documents that contain only important portions in the long_term our goal is to explore the use of such summaries for functions such as document retrieval and information_extraction here we focus on designing summarization strategies in particular we explore the use of mesh_terms manually assigned to documents by trained annotators as clues to select important text segments from the full text documents results our experiments_confirm the ability of our approach to pick the important text portions using the rouge measures for evaluation we were able to achieve maximum rouge rouge and rouge su f scores of and respectively for our mesh_term based method versus the maximum baseline_scores of and respectively using a mesh profile_based strategy we were able to achieve maximum rouge f scores of and respectively human evaluation of the baselines and our proposed strategies further corroborates the ability of our method to select important sentences from the full texts contactinformation systems in the biomedical_domain serving goals such as information_extraction and retrieval have historically been designed in the context of medline records these records limited to titles_and and some metadata are very different from full text documents recent papers in bmc bioinformatics elaborate on these differences moreover recent research initiatives in bioinformatics such as trec genomics http ir ohsu edu genomics and biocreative http www biocreative org strongly point to the merits of moving beyond abstracts and taking_advantage of full texts but full texts are more expensive to process not only in terms of their much to whom correspondence should be addressed larger sizes and their often varying structural_characteristics but also in terms of what it takes to achieve high levels of accuracy since full texts contain embellishments that elaborate contextualize contrast supplement etc the core ideas of a paper there is greater opportunity for false_positives for example in a retrieval context a full text may be retrieved because of query terms being present in relatively unimportant sections in an information_extraction context a gene though correctly_identified in a document may be of low interest in terms of the documents core emphasis in this article we explore document summarization as a compromise between the two extremes of abstracts versus full texts specifically we create a reduced version of each full text document that contains only its important portions this reduced version may be viewed as a summary but our interest is not to generate a human_readable summary rather it is to have an intermediate representation that may later be used for algorithmic functions such as to serve text retrieval and information_extraction our approach for full text reduction is novel particularly in the context of various document summarization methods that have been explored we capitalize on the mesh_terms present in medline records our hypothesis is that mesh_terms may be used to identify the important portions of full text documents in essence we suggest that the mesh indexing accomplished by trained indexers offers a useful window into full text we treat mesh_terms as high_quality hooks used to select important text segments in the full document this idea if it works will give us a general_strategy for reducing biomedical documents to their core portions our long_term motivation for building reduced versions of full texts is to use these as document representations in biomedical systems designed for retrieval information_extraction and other high_level functions several use cases may be identified in the bioinformatics arena one obvious use case is document retrieval indeed our own efforts with genedocs a document retrieval system for gene queries and our efforts in biocreative iii motivate this research these also offer retrieval test beds for follow_up research another use case is in information_extraction an area that has attracted_significant a third use case is in text_mining particularly mining for new ideas and hypotheses again our algorithms here offer test beds for future work our document summarization methods are also general enough to be applied to any biomedical_domain that employs mesh indexing so it may be tested and utilized by other researchers in the context of their text_based biomedical_applications given the successful efforts of archival organizations such as pubmed central and the open_access initiative our goal is to explore a new basis for biomedical systems one that utilizes reduced versions of full texts that contain only their core portions we hope topage i i i our research goal was to test a mesh based_approach for reducing full text documents and constructing summaries we explore two approaches mesh_term and mesh profile approaches in the latter the mesh_terms are expanded with free_text terms in both cases the mesh_terms are used to select portions of the full text and thereby create summaries we compare these with the abstract using several i page i i i
