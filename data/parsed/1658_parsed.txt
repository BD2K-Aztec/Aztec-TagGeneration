evidence mining and novelty assessment of protein_protein with the consensuspathdb plugin for cytoscape proteinprotein_interaction detection methods are applied on a daily basis by molecular_biologists worldwide after generating a set of potential interactions biologists face the problem of highlighting the ones that are novel and collecting evidence with respect to literature and annotation this task can be as tedious as searching for every predicted interaction in several interaction data_repositories or manually screening the scientific_literature to facilitate the task of evidence mining and novelty assessment of proteinprotein_interactions we have developed a cytoscape_plugin that automatically mines publication references database references interaction detection method descriptions and pathway annotation for a user supplied network of interactions the basis for the annotation is consensuspathdba meta database that integrates numerous proteinprotein signaling metabolic and gene regulatory interaction repositories for currently three species homo_sapiens saccharomyces_cerevisiae and mus_musculus availability the consensuspathdb plugin for cytoscape version or later can be installed within cytoscape on a major operating system windows mac os unix linux with sun java or later installed through cytoscapes plugin manager category network and attribute i o the plugin is freely_available for download on the consensuspathdb web sitedue to the high explanatory_power of proteinprotein_interactions for biological_processes in health and disease dedicated interaction detection methods like yeast_two y h screening and co purification are applied on a daily basis by molecular_biologists worldwide and contribute to the completion of the map of protein_protein for human and other species an immediate task after generating a network of predicted interactions is to identifypage on the basis of accession_numbers such as uniprot or ensembl interactions from the query network are matched to the repository based on their participants the performance of the interaction matching depends critically on how well proteins in the query network are annotated with accession_numbers in the case that accession_numbers are not available the user is prompted to specify whether the node labels represent accession_numbers of a certain type the interaction matching_performance is influenced by two parameters protein annotation matching strict fuzzy and interaction cardinality matching strict allow containment strict protein annotation matching denotes that a protein from the query network and a protein from the database are considered identical only if all identifiers of a type match fuzzy matching means that the identifiers of the query_protein may form a sub set of the identifiers of the database counterpart or vice_versa fuzzy matching is useful e g when proteins on the one side are compared with protein_families on the other side the interaction cardinality matching parameter specifies whether the binary interactions from the query network should be matched only with binary interactions from the database network strict matching or whether they may be matched to complex interactions i e interactions of more than two proteins that contain the binary interactions more details about protein and interaction mapping can be found in the supplementary_material to this paper after matching proteins and interactions the web_service server sends annotation attributes for matched query interactions in the form of publication references pubmed identifiers interaction detection methods database references such as intact and mint and pathway annotations i e pathways that contain both participants of a proteinprotein_interaction to the client plugin the plugin creates a custom visual style in cytoscape where the thickness of interaction edges reflects optionally the number of publications number of containing interaction_databases number of distinct detection methods or number of containing pathways for the protein interaction interactions that are not found in the repository and thus represent potential novel interactions are highlighted in green in the results tab of cytoscape an interaction mapping summary is displayed together with a legend the interaction attributes that have been retrieved from consensuspathdb can be viewed for selected interactions under the interaction details tab of the results panel if applicable this information is provided as web links to the primary data and can be viewed in a web_browser shows the performance of the plugin implementation with respect to the mining of interaction annotation for different network sizes results show that even for large_networks evidence mining executes in minutes for example min for a network with nodes it should be noted however that the internet connection speed of the client influences the overall speed of interaction matching
