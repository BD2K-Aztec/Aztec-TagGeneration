motevo integrated bayesian probabilistic methods for inferring regulatory_sites and motifs on multiple_alignments of dna_sequences motivation probabilistic approaches for inferring transcription_factor tfbss and regulatory_motifs from dna_sequences have been developed for over two decades previous work has shown that prediction_accuracy can be significantly_improved by incorporating features such as the competition of multiple transcription_factors tfs for binding to nearby sites the tendency of tfbss for co regulated tfs to cluster and form cis_regulatory and explicit evolutionary modeling of conservation of tfbss across orthologous sequences however currently available tools only incorporate some of these features and significant methodological hurdles hampered their synthesis into a single consistent probabilistic_framework results we present motevo a integrated suite of bayesian probabilistic methods for the prediction of tfbss and inference of regulatory_motifs from multiple_alignments of phylogenetically_related dna_sequences which incorporates all features just mentioned in addition motevo incorporates a novel model for detecting unknown functional_elements that are under evolutionary constraint and a new robust model for treating gain and loss of tfbss along a phylogeny rigorous benchmarking tests on chip_seq show that motevos novel features significantly improve the accuracy of tfbs_prediction motif inference and enhancer prediction availability source_code a user_manual and files with several example applications are available at www swissregulon unibas ch what the sequence specificities of different transcription_factors tfs are and where in the genome their transcription_factor tfbss occur remain central questions in gene_regulation for over two decades a large number of computational_methods has been developed that aim to support answering such questions see e g for reviews although to whom correspondence should be addressed much progress has been made it remains highly_challenging to obtain accurate computational tfbs predictions especially on a genome_wide scale for example although from a biophysical point_of identical sequence_segments should have equal affinity for the tf one typically finds that only a small fraction of the sequences with high_binding act as functional tfbss that is tfbs functionality is context dependent and thus researchers have searched for additional features that are predictive for the functionality of putative sites one approach that has proven particularly fruitful is comparative_genomic of the conservation of putative tfbss across related species i e putative tfbss that are highly_conserved are generally more likely to be functional a large number of approaches for incorporating conservation information has been proposed including several simple ad_hoc methods e g but it has become clear that highest performance is obtained by methods that use explicit evolutionary_models for the evolution of tfbss along a phylogeny as a consequence there has been considerable interest in extending methods for regulatory motif_finding and tfbs_prediction to include such explicit phylogenetic_models for example the well known gibbs_sampling and expectationmaximization strategies for ab_initio motif_finding have been extended to methods that work on multiple_alignments of orthologous sequences and use explicit evolutionary_models beyond conservation information other features have also proven highly useful in improving the accuracy of tfbs_prediction for example especially in higher_eukaryotes functional tfbss often come in clusters where multiple binding_sites for a small subset of tfs co occur in close_proximity to each other several methods were developed that instead of looking for tfbss for one tf at a time explicitly look for clusters of sites for a collection of tfs these methods have been especially successful in identifying cis_regulatory that are distal to their target_gene it has also proven useful to take into account the contribution of many weak binding_sites and the competitive_binding of multiple_tfs to a dna_sequence by explicitly considering all possible configurations of non overlapping binding_sites using a dynamic_programming procedure e g however currently these methodologies are spread over multiple computational_tools each of which only implements some of these methods for example the methods for finding cis_regulatory have been extended to analyze pairs of aligned species but not to general multiple_alignments and phylogenetic_relationships other methods can only make predictions for one tf at a time ignoring the competitive_binding of multiple_tfs e g and the methods that incorporate sophisticated models for explicitly considering all possible binding configurations of multiple_tfs cannot incorporate conservation information e g beyond this as we show below current methods that incorporate explicit evolutionary_models make several implicit assumptions that cause pathologies that significantly affect their performance here we present a computational_tool motevo that integrates a suite of bayesian probabilistic methods for the prediction of regulatory_sites and motifs on multiple_alignments of phylogenetically_related sequences motevo not only implements and extends the functionality of many of the tools and methods mentioned in the introduction into a single integrated method it also incorporates a number of new features that address the pathologies that current methods suffer from as we explicitly demonstrate below although a key benefit of motevo as a computational_tool is that it integrates cutting_edge methods within a single executable we here focus on evaluating the performance benefits of the novel features that motevo implements for benchmarking we collected five datasets in which chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by next_generation chip_seq was performed for the human tfs ctcf gabp nrsf srf and stat using the peak finder macs we determined the regions bound by the tf in question for each chip_seq dataset binding regions that occurred in more than one dataset were removed to ensure that at least in the conditions tested only one tf is bound to each region finally we selected the regions with highest enrichment from each dataset see supplementary_materials for details using pairwise genome alignments from the ucsc database we extracted orthologous regions from six other mammals mouse dog cow monkey horse and opossum and obtained seven way multiple_alignments using t coffee for nrsf gabp srf and stat known wm motifs were taken from the literature and a ctcf wm was inferred from chip_chip data in fly to test the new features we predict tfbss with motevo on the benchmarking dataset both using the feature and with the feature turned off we then compare the tfbs predictions and evaluate to what extent the tfbs predictions are able to infer which region was bound by which tf in addition we compared motevos performance on these datasets with those of monkey and phyloscan finally we test the performance of motifs obtained using motevos motif refinement and compare it with the performance of motifs inferred by meme from a theoretical point_of the major advantage of the motevo method we presented here is that it integrates cuttingedge bayesian probabilistic methods for the prediction of tfbss regulatory_motifs and conservation patterns within one consistent theoretical frame work developing several novel features such as the ufe model and species selection in the process in addition our benchmarking tests have demonstrated that these features improve motevos performance and that motevo outperforms currently available methods another major advantage of the motevo tool is its versatility i e by simple changes to the parameter file the tool can perform a wide_array of tasks ranging from motif inference to enhancer prediction to conservation profile mapping site density estimation and of course tfbs_prediction moreover essentially all variables used by the algorithm from phylogeny to background models to priors can be controlled by the user allowing these to be adapted to a wide_range for example using motevo in combination with genome_wide mapping of transcription_start we have predicted functional tfbss for hundreds of wms in proximal promoters in human mouse yeast and escherichia_coli we have also obtained refined wms using motevo on chip_seq for a number of tfs beyond those studied here all these tfbs and motif predictions are available for download from our swissregulon database at www swissregulon unibas ch as experimental_validation of the functionality of individual tfbss is extremely labor_intensive it remains highly_challenging to estimate the accuracy of large_scale tfbs predictions in the past it has sometimes been assumed that chip_chip and chip_seq can be treated as a gold_standard but our own analysis suggests that computational predictions can in fact be considerable more accurate in mapping functional sites than such high_throughput experimental_approaches what is clear is that tf_binding and function is highly context dependent for a tf with a short degenerate motif there may be millions of sites genome_wide with motif matches at least as high as known functional sites but in a typical chip_seq experiment only a few thousand of these are found to be actually bound and even among these only a subset may directly affect_gene in the search for variables that provide important context it is important to distinguish those that are merely predictive for the functionality of tfbss from those that are explanatory crossspecies conservation is an example of an explanatory_variable i e highly_conserved tfbss are more likely to be functional but conservation is not explanatory sequences in other species cannot explain why a particular sequence is bound or functional in a given species in higher_eukaryotes the chromatin_state is likely to be an important explanatory_variable in areas where the nucleosomes are densely packaging the dna it may be hard for a tf to access an individual site in the dna this may explain why functional tfbss come in clusters of nearby sites for co expressed tfs these tfs may passively cooperate in displacing the nucleosomes from the dna such a model can potentially explain the observation that the genomic binding pattern observed for a given tf is dependent on the expression_profiles of other tfs however to what extent binding and function of tfbss is dependent on a high order grammar of tfbs configurations i e the precise page
