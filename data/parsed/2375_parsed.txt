improved side chain modeling by coupling clash detection guided iterative search with rotamer relaxation motivation side chain modeling has seen wide_applications in computational structure biology most of the popular side chain modeling programs explore the conformation space using discrete rigid rotamers for speed and efficiency however in the tightly_packed environments of protein interiors these methods will inherently lead to atomic_clashes and hinder the prediction_accuracy results we present a side chain modeling method cis rr which couples a novel clash detection guided iterative search cis algorithm with continuous torsion space optimization of rotamers rr benchmark testing shows that compared with the existing popular side chain modeling_methods cis rr removes atomic_clashes much more effectively and achieves comparable or even better prediction_accuracy while having comparable computational_cost we believe that cis rr could be a useful method for accurate side chain modeling availability cis rr is available to non commercial users at our websiteside chain modeling is the prediction of a proteins side chain conformation for a given backbone_structure due to its importance in protein design point_mutation analysis proteinprotein_docking homology_modeling and other aspects of structural_modeling side chain modeling has been intensively_studied for many years a thorough search through the continuous side chain conformations is inefficient and not feasible given the existing search algorithms and current computational power luckily side chain dihedral_angles are not evenly_distributed which occur in tight clusters around certain values based on these clusters the side chain conformational_space can be discretized into rotamers which represent the conformations of these clusters and an ensemble of rotamers for all side chain types is thus called a rotamer library based on rotamer definition side chain modeling can be efficiently transformed into a combinatorial search problem which is to find the best rotamer combination from all possible combinations of side chain rotamers for this methodology many efforts have attempted including development of powerful scoring_functions well sampled rotamer libraries and effective search_strategies so_far rotamer based side chain modeling_methods have become the most popular ones however because the side chain conformations are approximated by discrete rotamers these methods could inherently cause atomic_clashes in the modeled structures preventing them from accurate modeling of protein side_chains furthermore atomic_clashes can lead to high_energy and instability of structures and thus the elimination of atomic_clashes is beneficial for the subsequent analysis such as proteinprotein_docking atomic_clashes can be alleviated to some extent by utilizing a very large rotamer library or expanding a rotamer into finely sampled subrotamers other more sophisticated approaches could include an additional step of rotamer refinement by off rotamer space sampling in our study to achieve a more effective side chain modeling we attempt to integrate the advances from side chain modeling in both rotamer based search and rotamer optimization our method called cis rr performs clash detection guided iterative search cis of side chain rotamers while continuously optimizes side chain conformations using a conjugate gradients method careful implementation of cis rr shows obvious improvements of prediction_accuracy and elimination of atomic_clashes in contrast with the traditional iterative search method further benchmark testing shows compared with the existing popular side chain modeling programs cis rr removes atomic_clashes much more effectively and achieves comparable or even better predictionpage in this section we will first give an overview of our method cisrr then we will analyze the contributions of cis and rr to the improvement of side chain modeling and further investigate how cis rr effectively eliminates clashes finally to gain an overall performance of cis rr we compare it to several existing popular side chain modeling programs
