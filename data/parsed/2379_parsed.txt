improved topology prediction using the terminal hydrophobic helices rule motivation the translocon recognizes sufficiently hydrophobic regions of a protein and inserts them into the membrane computational_methods try to determine what hydrophobic regions are recognized by the translocon although these predictions are quite accurate many methods still fail to distinguish marginally hydrophobic transmembrane tm helices and equally hydrophobic regions in soluble protein_domains in vivo this problem is most likely avoided by targeting of the tm proteins so that non tm proteins never see the translocon proteins are targeted to the translo con by an n_terminal signal_peptide the targeting is also aided by the fact that the n_terminal helix is more hydrophobic than other tm helices in addition we also recently found that the c terminal helix is more hydrophobic than central helices this information has not been used in earlier top ology predictors results here we use the fact that the n and c terminal helices are more hydrophobic to develop a new version of the first principle based topology predictor scampi the new predictor has two main advantages first it can be used to efficiently separate membrane and non membrane_proteins directly without the use of an extra prefilter and second it shows improved_performance for predicting the topology of membrane_proteins that contain large non membrane_domains availability_and the predictor a web_server and all datasets are available atthe biogenesis of most a helical transmembrane tm proteins follows a path where the synthesis is halted after a signal_peptide is recognized by a signal_recognition after the recognition the ribosome is transported to the er organelle or plasmamembrane where translation starts again with the emerging peptide_chain threaded through the translocon channel additional tm helices being recognized and in some cases the signal_peptide is cleaved off although it is clear that for some proteins additional rearrangements occur most membrane_proteins appear to follow a folding procedure where the recognized tm helices come together to pack optimally this means that the location of membrane helices is primarily determined by the recognition of hydrophobic segments by the translocon the positive inside rule von governs the overall orientation of a protein so that there is a global pattern of positively_charged in the loops that occur on the periplasmic side of the membrane the exact way in which the positiveinside rule acts is unclear but even the presence or lack of positively_charged close to the c terminal can shift the orientation of the protein entirely ultimately the combination of hydrophobic segments recognized by the translocon and thethe topology of membrane_proteins all membrane_protein topology predictors take into account the biological_mechanisms for membrane_protein biogenesis consciously or non consciously many different computational_methods including hidden_markov hmms support_vector svms dynamic_bayesian and artificial_neural have been used in topology prediction a common_feature in all these methods is that they identify hydrophobic tm helices and then combine these predictions with the positive inside rule in order to determine the topology the positive inside rule is used to allow for less hydrophobic tmsegments to be recognized if this results in that more positive residues are found in periplasmic loops exactly how the balance between the hydrophobicity cut_off and the positive inside rule is optimized varies between methods in some methods such as toppred the two parts are performed independently while in most others the optimization is done simultaneously in contrast to most other topology predictors the scampi predictor performs topology prediction using no additional information apart from the hydrophobicity of the segments and the positive inside rule scampi only requires that two parameters namely the hydrophobicity weight and the relative_weight of the positive inside rule are optimized the performance of scampi is comparable with other state of the art methods that utilize much more complicated schemes and many more parameters one frequent problem when predicting the topology is that tmhelices are often erroneously predicted in non tm domains this problem becomes stronger in predictors that show the best overall performance the reason is that the hydrophobicity of the most hydrophobic segments in non tm domains may overlap with the hydrophobicity of some tm helices see this makes it impossible to use a single strict cut_off to separate membrane and non membrane regions see the overlapp in most non tm proteins never see the translocon and therefore the insertion of hydrophobic non tm segments is not a problem in vivo here the targeting of proteins to the translocon is either guided by a signal_peptide or by the most n_terminal tm helix in either case the n_terminal helix is on average more hydrophobic than later helices see from a prediction point_of this means that at least one helix in a tm protein has to be more hydrophobic than almost any segment in a non tm protein this fact has been used by many predictors by including a prefilter that determines whether a protein is a membrane or a non membrane one in it can be seen that the overlap in hydrophobic regions of non tm proteins dotted line is smaller for the n_terminal helix than for the other tmhelices because of that a stricter cut_off can be used in the prefilter resulting in fewer falsely predicted tm proteins although this strategy is useful for tm protein identification it does not solve the problem of falsely identifying tm helices in non tm domains of a tm protein in addition to the more hydrophobic n_terminal helix we recently found that the c terminal tm helix is also more hydrophobic than central tm helices see to understand this we have to take into account marginally hydrophobic helices i e helices that under normal circumstances are not fully recognized by the translocon these helices can be inserted if the number of positively_charged in an inside loop is sufficient however we noted that the effect of the positive residues in the loop is weaker if they are located at the c termini i e if they are not followed by another tmscampi was trained both with and without the prefilter i e two or three parameters were optimized a simplified_version of the hmm used for scampi four parameters are used the positive inside bias p kr and three dg biological hydrophobicity cut_offs for n_terminal central and c terminal helices these parameters are optimized individually the arrows denote the orientation of the helices from the cytoplasm to the extracellular_space and vice_versa the grey parts show the original scampi modelthe terminal hydrophobic rulehelix it therefore seems as if the positive inside rule is stronger when a following tm helix is present since no tm helix follows the most cterminal helix the insertion of it cannot be aided by the positive inside rule i e it needs to be sufficiently hydrophobic to be inserted by itself to the best of the authors knowledge all topology predictors treat all tm helices equally and do therefore ignore the fact that the n and c terminal tm helices should be more hydrophobic here we present a new version of scampi that improves predictions by utilizing this observation
