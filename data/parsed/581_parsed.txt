aura atlas of utr regulatory activity the atlas of utr regulatory activity aura is a manually_curated and comprehensive catalog of human mrna untranslated_regions utrs and utr regulatory annotations through its intuitive web_interface it provides full access to a wealth of information on utrs that integrates phylogenetic conservation rna_sequence and structure data single nucleotide variation gene_expression and gene functional descriptions from literature and specialized databases availability http aura the and untranslated_regions utrs are the portions of an mrna located at each side of the coding_sequence utrs contain information for post_transcriptional of mrna including transport stability localization and access to translation and hence they largely determine the fate of mature mrnas in the cell such events are mediated by hundreds of trans_acting primarily rna_binding rbps associated with all cellular mrnas to form ribonucleoprotein_complexes rnps but also noncoding_rnas of which the microrna mirna class has a clear functional role the experimentally_determined sequence and structure binding constraints of utrs vary_widely between and within rbps and non_coding and the regulatory_interactions are globally characterized by extreme complexity since a regulator can bind to multiple utrs in multiple sites and vice_versa moreover the mrna transcis interaction_network undergoes remarkable plasticity since the fate of an mrna is determined by its temporally_and dependent association to several regulators unraveling the molecular code behind this sophisticated process is the key for i understanding to what extent cell programs are regulated by the degree of mrna_abundance localization and translation ii deciphering how malfunction of trans_acting or mutation of target_sites is at the root of some severely altered cellular_phenotypes iii identifying novel therapeutics aimed at modulating mrna dynamics in the window between transport and translation with this aim a growing number of to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as studies both mechanistic and systems based provide information on factors binding to utrs nevertheless integration of these data and annotation of utrs in genome_browsers are lacking or insufficient the atlas of utr regulatory activity aura fills this gap with unprecedented richness and coverage by collecting and combining human utr annotation and binding data from several sources
