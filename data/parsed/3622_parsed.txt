structural_bioinformatics post_translational induce significant yet not extreme changes to protein_structure motivation a number of studies of individual proteins have shown that post_translational ptms are associated with structural_rearrangements of their target_proteins although such studies provide critical insights into the mechanics behind the dynamic_regulation of protein_function they usually feature examples with relatively large conformational changes however with the steady growth of protein_data pdb and available ptm_sites it is now possible to more systematically characterize the role of ptms as conform ational switches in this study we ask what is the expected extent of structural_change upon ptm how often are those changes in fact substantial whether the structural impact is spatially_localized or global and whether different ptms have different signatures results we exploit redundancy in pdb and using root_mean study the conformational heterogeneity of groups of protein_structures corresponding to identical_sequences in their unmodified and modified forms we primarily focus on the two most abundant ptms in pdb glycosylation and phosphorylation but show that acetylation and methylation have similar tendencies our results_provide that ptms induce conformational changes at both local and global level however the proportion of large changes is unexpectedly small only of glycosylated and of phosphorylated proteins undergo global changes a further analysis suggests that phosphorylation stabilizes protein_structure by reducing global con formational heterogeneity by overall these results suggest a subtle but common role of allostery in the mechanisms through which ptms affect regulatory and signaling_pathways post_translational ptms refer to in vivo biochemical processing_events of a protein after its synthesis it is speculated that nearly every protein undergoes some form of ptm and types of ptms have been reported so_far spanning all domains of life different ptms display different physicochemical_properties thus the same protein may exhibit different functions upon different modifications as a result the high_diversity of ptms combined with their reversibility and enzymatic control makes them a vital component of molecular_recognition signal_transduction and protein_degradation dysregulation of ptms and mutation of ptm_sites are implicated in a number of diseases from various monogenic_disorders to complex_diseases such as cancer heart_disease and neurodegenerative_disorders the mechanisms through which ptms regulate protein_function are of great interest to biologists most ptm events introduce additional chemical_groups to residue side_chains with the potential to alter the energy_landscape of a protein and subsequently lead to conformational changes observed in crystal_structures various examples have shown that this structural_change is essential for the modified protein to display new functionalities as in the case of phosphorylation glycosylation acetylation and sumoylation geiss additional mechanisms_include change of binding_affinity or creation of binding_sites the most extensively_studied ptm is phosphorylation that with some exceptions adds a phosphoryl group to serine threonine or tyrosine_residues in eukaryotes and to histidine or aspartic_acid in prokaryotes the phosphoryl group has a double negative_charge under physiological_conditions and is anticipated to affect the energy_landscape of the modified protein in their review johnson and lewis analyzed pairs of phosphorylated and non phosphorylated structures to characterize the structural consequences of phosphorylation they showed that the dominant structural response was an adjustment of protein conformation to accommodate for the electrostatic_effects between the phosphate and surrounding charged atoms however the types and extent of structural changes were highly_diverse they observed both local and long_range changes both association and disassociation of protein_complexes and both order to disorder and disorder toorder transitions in one extreme case phosphorylation of ser in glycogen_phosphorylase results in a shift of ser itself in addition this phosphorylation event alters the tertiary_structure of enzymes catalytic_site that is around a away from ser however there are also situations in which to whom correspondence should be addressed phosphorylation and other ptms introduce no detectable conformational_change we found multiple such cases in this study for example pseudomonas_putida benzoylformate decarboxylase bfda is phosphorylated fsjx is not zea_mays polyamine oxidase b c is glycosylated h c is not or human lysine methyltransferase set f b is methylated m b is not in each of these cases the global root_mean rmsd between two structures was a and the local rmsd within a of the modification site was a in addition to the analysis of experimentally_determined structures computational_approaches have also been explored common strategies_include molecular_dynamics and conformational_sampling however both of these strategies are limited by several factors including computational requirements necessary for modeling micro to millisecond events on large_molecules assumptions on the scale of conformational_change or influence of a particular force_field recent_studies have tested the accuracy of computational_models by predicting the structure of the phosphorylated molecule based on the structure of the unmodified molecule and then comparing the predicted with the actual phosphorylated structure the results of these and other studies suggest that such methods may be accurate enough to provide_valuable the structure_function despite the recent_progress in understanding the structural impact of ptms much of the focus has been on individual proteins however with the rapid_growth of protein_structure data as well as the presence of multiple structures corresponding to the same amino_acid larger_scale focused on characterizing the overall trends of the structural impact are becoming realistic this is further facilitated by the results of recent work in which multiple x_ray structures of the same protein in protein_data pdb were reported to be similar to those observed in solution using nuclear_magnetic suggesting that different x_ray structures of the same protein can in principle be used to study and understand protein conformational_flexibility in this study we systematically analyze groups of protein_structures corresponding to the same sequence in their modified and unmodified forms to address questions regarding the universality extent and signatures of structural changes upon ptm our work provides evidence that ptms similar to ligand_binding induce generally small_but conformational changes the major_goal of this study was to quantify the expected structural difference between unmodified and post_translationally proteins and thus understand the allosteric potential of ptms we exploited the presence of multiple structures with identical amino_acid in pdb that provided us with a means to approximate conformational_flexibility of each protein in order to work with a sufficient number of structures we focused on the four most abundant ptm types in pdb glycosylation phosphorylation acetylation and methylation because the datasets for acetylation and methylation were too small to carry out a reliable statistical_analysis our main focus was on glycosylation and phosphorylation although the importance of ptms as functional modulators has been established the mechanisms through which most of the regulation is carried_out are still not well understood in this study we investigated the potential for allosteric_regulation in ptm mediated functional changes by quantifying structural impact upon ptm allosteric_effect is usually seen as a specific form of structural_change in which binding of an effector molecule at one site in a protein alters the local structure around a functional site elsewhere in the protein thusthe target variable was log rmsd m log rmsd u affecting overall protein activity our results provide quantitative evidence that ptms induce significant conformational changes to protein_structure and suggest that ptms act in similar_ways as small_molecule allosteric effectors we investigated four ptms glycosylation phosphorylation methylation and acetylation and showed that all exhibit similar effects in local and global conformational changes in addition phosphorylation has showed an effect of stabilizing protein_structure by introducing new hydrogen_bonds and salt_bridges in the local neighborhood of the modified residue putting these results together we speculate that the predominant mechanism of ptm action is alteration of the energy_landscape as shown in specifically we believe that glycosylation and phosphorylation frequently lead to a conformational shift of the lowest valley in the energy_landscape however while glycosylation likely retains the approximate abundance of the conformation with the lowest energy phosphorylation results in an enriched abundance in the lowest energy form thus restricting conformational_flexibility similar conclusion has been speculated for intrinsically_disordered for phosphorylation the stabilizing effects might be a driving_force to populate protein conformations to a new state which has been suggested for ligand_binding conformational changes were also found in methylation and acetylation however due to the problems of dataset size only glycosylation and phosphorylation showed_statistically in most experiments although these results suggest preferences among ptms for conformational shifts only a small fraction of structures go through extreme changes at a global level glycosylation and phosphorylation introduce structural changes a in only of cases these results are similar to those observed for ligand_binding where of enzymes showed a structural changes these results strongly suggest that despite the importance of structural_change for the modified protein to modulate its function small to moderate structural changes are usually sufficient experiments in this study were carried_out with strict controls we only compared conformational heterogeneity between groups of protein_structures corresponding to identical amino_acid although such a requirement greatly_reduced the number of data_points that can be used for statistical_analyses one data point per sequence cluster or ptm site the approach was necessary since absolute rmsd values are not directly comparable when calculated on very different numbers of atoms in addition since rmsds were calculated using c atoms only side chain alterations that may also be critical for protein_function could not be observed we believe this resulted in more conservative estimation of the prevalence of structural_change note that allostery may occur without any observable backbone changes another reason that the estimates of conformational changes may be conservative is the influence of the expression system when studying ptms in particular non observed n linked glycosylation_sites expressed in eukaryotic_systems may still be glycosylated in the protein but with the polysaccharide molecule missing from the structural model due to static disorder on the other hand proteins expressed in bacterial systems would be less likely to include such problems a potential limitation of this study stems from the suitability of crystallographic data for the study of conformational changes as well as the assumptions used in our statistical_analysis although crystallographic data are generally reliable its limitations are related to the inherent biases in pdb and its ability to provide high_resolution insight into conformational_flexibility of macromolecules for example ptms that increase flexibility of protein regions leading to order to disorder transition could not be analyzed in this study statistically one limitation stems from glm fitting where we included seven variables that are believed to be the most important factors leading to observed structural_differences however other factors may also exist as well as an interplay between them for example a ptm can lead to protein complex formation while in the glm fitting they would be considered as independent events another limitation comes from the fact that a large enough dataset could not be collected to investigate the influence of modifications of different amino_acid residue_types as the size of pdb increases it will become possible to further refine the analysis it is important to mention that ptms have also been linked to intrinsically_disordered protein regions i e regions without a single_dominant conformational macro state under physiological_conditions for example phosphorylation ubiquitination methylation and others have been associated to disordered_regions either statistically daily et_al or experimentally although such associations are certainly useful for our understanding of the mechanisms_underlying ptm regulation and signaling a large number of proteins do contain ptm_sites in their structured regions therefore the results obtained through our experiments are of broad importance finally in this work we provide evidence that the observed differences between modified and unmodified structures are significant and can be attributed to ptm however the available data do not contain intermediate structures that lead from one observed conformation to another thus the structural_differences between modified and unmodified structures could be explained equally well by two alternative_mechanisms structural_change upon modification and conformational selection from a pre_existing structural ensemble our preliminary analyses suggest that both may be at play regardless of the underlying mechanism ptms are associated with small but common conformational changes of their target_proteins
