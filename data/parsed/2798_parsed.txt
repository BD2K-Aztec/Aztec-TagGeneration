genome_analysis marker sequence mine your qtl regions for candidate_genes marker sequence m s aims at mining quantitative_trait qtls for candidate_genes for each gene within the qtl region m s uses data_integration technology to integrate putative gene function with associated gene_ontology proteins pathways and literature as a typical qtl region easily contains several hundreds of genes this gene_list can then be further filtered using a keyword based query on the aggregated annotations m s will help breeders to identify potential candidate_genes for their traits of interest availability marker sequence is freely_accessible atquantitative trait loci qtls are regions on the genome statistically associated with a phenotype plant breeders aim to introgress these regions from a donor parent to improve a cultivar however a typical qtl region may contain hundreds of genes including genes negatively influencing the breeding goals complete_genome of many crop_plants are becoming available including the genome of important food crops such as tomato the international tomato genome and potato the potato genome_sequencing the availability of structural and functional genome_annotations makes it possible to investigate the qtl region for genes positively or negatively influencing the trait of interest a tool that offers this functionality is gbrowse however exploring several hundreds of putative candidate_genes with gbrowse will still be a lot of work as limited information is available for each gene identification of putative candidate_genes can be improved using data_integration approaches biologically_relevant knowledge about for example gene_ontology go the gene_ontology consortium protein functions or metabolic_pathways can be combined with expert_knowledge about the trait under investigation the basic principle of semantic_web technology is to integrate different to whom correspondence should be addressed types of data from different sources using standardized ontologies important resources such as uniprot and go have become available in a resource_description rdf http www w org tr rdf primer format allowing data_integration against these resources our research_aims to develop a tool called marker sequence m s which plant breeders can use to identify the putative candidate_gene for their qtl we describe how m s uses semantic data_integration approaches to obtain available information for each gene model and combine this with a keyword based search function to mine for the appropriate candidate_gene m s by design can work with any genome_annotation but we show the functionality of m s using the tomato genome_annotation
