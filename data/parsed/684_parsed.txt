bayesian nonparametrics in protein remote homology_search motivation wide_application of modeling of three_dimensional protein_structures in biomedical_research motivates developing protein sequence_alignment computer tools featuring high alignment_accuracy and sensitivity to remotely homologous_proteins in this paper we aim at improving the quality of alignments between sequence_profiles encoded multiple_sequence modeling profile contexts fixed_length profile fragments is engaged to achieve_this results we develop a hierarchical_dirichlet mixture_model to describe the distribution of profile contexts which is able to capture dependencies between amino_acids in each context position the model represents an attempt at modeling profile fragments at several hierarchical_levels within the profile and among profiles even modeling unit length contexts leads to greater improvements than processing length contexts previously we develop a new profile comparison method called comer integrating the model a benchmark with three other profile to profile comparison methods shows an increase in both sensitivity and alignment_quality availability_and comer is open_source licensed under the gnu gplv available at https sourceforge net_projects comer proteins large_molecules perform a huge number of functions within living_organisms given that the three_dimensional d structure of a protein determines its function structural_genomics centers aim and dominant programs such as the protein_structure initiative aimed at the determination of the d structure for most proteins in nature to facilitate understanding of how living_organisms function with increasing_coverage of protein fold space these efforts are greatly assisted by building protein models by homology to solved d structures homology discovery founded on data of solved d structures therefore constitutes the foundation for homology_modeling results of the critical assessment of structure_prediction casp experiments reveal homology search_methods as some of the most decisive intermediate means in protein_d based on alignments of sequence_profiles generalizations of protein_sequence families these methods s ding and can reliably establish homologous relationships even between proteins_sharing nearly random sequence_identity nevertheless such relations are remotely homologous and are often missed increasing the sensitivity to remotely homologous_proteins and the accuracy of alignments is accordingly of great practical importance to improve the quality of the sequence_profile and to obtain the probability_distribution of amino_acids residues more relevant to the sequence family many efforts were put into the calculation of mutation substitution_probabilities including the development of the pseudo counts composition based statistics and compositional adjustment and mixing with many other sequence structure derived measures see e g the advances in the calculation of substitution_probabilities at each profile position have induced more accurate profile alignments and consequently increased sensitivity to remote_homologs despite the apparent progress in developing profile to profile comparison methods some problems remain alignment_accuracy one of the most important challenges in homology_modeling seems to have saturated recently and further improvements in alignment necessitate enhancing the description of substitution_probabilities so that the probabilities accurately_reflect a structure sequence environment context addresses the problem biegert and s ding showed that generalizing substitution_probabilities for each position by mixing them with a library of context profiles has increased the sensitivity of the profile to sequence alignment_method psi_blast by more than the context profiles representative profile fragmentswere not derivatives of structure information but derived from clustering profile fragments the rationale of using sequence_based contexts was that the profile fragments with different distributions of substitution_probabilities could adopt similar local structures if grouped together these profile fragments would lose their specificity biegert and s ding modeled the profile fragment by using the product of weighted multinomial probabilities and optimized the substitution_probabilities of each context profile with the expectation_maximization in that framework the number of context profiles is a parameter whose value was found in a homology detection benchmark procedure in this work we aim at increasing the sensitivity of profile comparisons and the accuracy of alignments addressing the issue of profile contexts supplementary from a bayesian nonparametrics perspective we propose a hierarchical_dirichlet mixture_model to describe the distribution of profile contexts and apply the inferred mixtures to the problem of protein_homology the hierarchical_dirichlet hdp is developed for model_based of grouped data where each group is associated with a mixture_model the essential property of the hdp is that it employs a dirichlet_process dp for every group of data where all the dps share a base distribution which itself is drawn from a dirichlet_process such a construction enables sharing of clusters across groups and expresses the property of profiles sequence families of sharing_common features considering profiles as separate groups the hdp mixture_model formalizes the purpose of finding characteristic clusters of contexts within each profile with sharing of the clusters among them an important feature of the hdp mixture_model is that the number of clusters is unknown and is to be inferred from the data in markov_chain mcmc sampling overgeneralization of profile contexts leads to signal_loss and reduced specificity and this feature allows to avoid of selecting a particular number of clusters or placing an explicit parametric prior on it to our knowledge hdp based non parametric bayesian_models to define the distribution of profile contexts or substitution_probabilities have not been considered in the literature though modeled multiple_sequence msa columns with dp dirichlet mixtures they specified residue frequencies at single columns by a dirichlet distribution and inferred the dirichlet mixtures from msa data although computationally convenient such a specification has some limitations one is that a multivariate random variable drawn from a dirichlet distribution corresponds to a scaled vector of independently distributed gamma random_variables the dirichlet distribution therefore lacks versatility to capture inter component correlations as illustrated inof the supplementary_materials we build the model to handle profile data the profile generalizes each msa column with a vector of substitution_probabilities which depending on sequence weighting_scheme embody soft dependencies between adjacent columns with these properties substitution_probabilities in our setting constitute an observation vector to control correlations between residues we model the distribution of substitution_probabilities with a logistic normal distribution which follows from the logistic transformation applied to a normal distribution and to the best of our knowledge publicly has not been considered to characterize probabilities in profiles the context supplementary comprises an array of such vectors and is a random variable whose distribution the proposed mixture_model describes the model is valid for contexts of any length although in this work we confine to the context of one position section discusses how the model without any corrections adapts to longer contexts to evaluate the efficiency of the derived scores we performed an extensive comparison of sequence_profiles of protein_domains protein_domains served as an evaluation basis for two reasons first available d domain structures enable to assess reliably the accuracy of profile alignments a major_determinant in protein modeling second domain_sequences used to produce profiles reduce the probability of the homologous over extension error leading to a deterioration of the quality of profiles here the dataset comprised the protein_domains from the scope database version filtered to sequence_identity to challenge remote_homology the resulting domains excluding the members of class g of small proteins were divided evenly into training and test_set of and representatives respectively training_set was used to optimize the application parameters weights for the score table while the test_set to assess the performance on previously_unseen data multiple_sequence for the construction of profiles for domain_sequences from both sets resulted from searching each sequence with psi_blast version using a sequence inclusion threshold of and soft masking of from the i tasser software_package and ffas we wanted to include more state of the art methods into the benchmark but most of them are designed as internet servers or do not distribute computer utilities to make profiles from user supplied msas all the methods except ffas exploit secondary_structure ss predictions the new method comer and hhsearch incorporated ss predictions obtained by psipred whereas ss predictions calculated by psspred from the i tasser package accompanied the ppas sequence_profiles for each method we constructed profiles using the same set of msas compared the profiles all against all and evaluated the sensitivity of detecting related protein pairs and the accuracy of the produced alignments we found that hhsearch performed better with the option of posterior_probability threshold for maximum accuracy alignment set to mact the evaluation thus used this option value for hhsearch in addition as hhsearch employs length contexts in comparison of profiles we evaluated the effect of calculating contexts by both methods comer and hhsearch each method was evaluated by considering top_ranked profile alignments sorted by reported their statistical_significance only one of two alignments between the same pair of different domains that with higher statistical_significance was retained alignments between identical domains were removed highly important in many fields of biomedical_research protein homology_modeling relies on protein sequence_alignments alignments of high_quality stimulate discovery of evolutionary related matches and thus are key to sensitivity to homologous_proteins and consequently homology_modeling itself in this study we have addressed the problem of protein_remote by improving the quality of alignments between protein_sequence families represented by sequence_profiles modeling profile contexts fixed_length profile fragments representing the environment of sequence families previously undertaken by biegert and s ding has been engaged to achieve_this we have proposed an hdp mixture_model to describe the distribution of contexts where a logistic normal distribution is used to model substitution_probabilities in profile contexts to capture dependencies between amino_acids we have inferred the hdp mixtures from a large set of profile context data by combining gibbs_sampling with metropolis updates the metropolis updates exploited to overcome the inefficiency of gibbs_sampling were implemented by a splitmerge algorithm which we have adapted for the hdp mixture_model k distinct context clusters have been obtained by applying a parallel mcmc sampling algorithm developed to speed up posterior inference we have developed profile construction and comparison computer utilities and with respect to the inferred mixtures derived scores which we integrated into an extensive profile to profile comparison evaluating results by generating protein d models for each alignment between a pair of profiles and measuring the similarity between the model and the native_structure we have demonstrated that adding the scores increased the number of accurate d models and consequently the number of accurate alignments in both evaluation modes with respect to the entire protein domain global key to protein_structure and within the alignment boundaries local important to sensitivity a benchmark of the new method comer available under the gnu gp license v with three other profile to profile comparison methods shows a significant_improvement in both sensitivity and alignment_quality and an improvement from calculating unit length contexts is twice that of the hhsearch method employing length contexts although this study confined to unit length contexts the hdp mixture_model is applicable for longer contexts the context consisting of s vectors of a substitution_probabilities transformed by the inverse logistic transformation can be represented by an a s matrix x the random matrix x will have a matrix variate normal distribution with mean matrix m and covariance_matrices r a a and w s s or equivalently vecx t n as vecm t r w the mixture_model applied to g vecx t will then describe the distribution of slength contexts where the conditional distributions and the mcmc sampling algorithms presented in the study remain valid a model that allows for correlations not just between residues but also between context positions would impart much greater_flexibility in modeling profile contexts and specificity in recognizing structural contexts integrated into comparison of profiles the model would very likely increase the sensitivity and accuracy of alignments further accordingly our further work will investigate how effective longer contexts under the hdp mixture_model are
