gene_expression switchbox an r package for k top scoring pairs classifier development ktop scoring pairs ktsp is a classification_method for prediction from high_throughput data based on a set of the paired measurements each of the two possible orderings of a pair of measurements e g a reversal in the expression of two genes is associated with one of two classes the ktsp prediction rule is the aggregation of voting among such individual two feature decision_rules based on order switching ktsp like its predecessor top scoring pair tsp is a parameter free classifier relying only on ranking of a small subset of features rendering it robust to noise and potentially easy to interpret in biological terms in contrast to tsp ktsp has comparable accuracy to standard genomics classification_techniques including support_vector and prediction analysis for microarrays here we describe switchbox an r package for ktsp based prediction availability the switchbox package is freely_available from bioconductor http www bioconductor org finding omics based biomarkers for clinical use has been extensively_studied in numerous_diseases however mature clinical_applications of these biomarkers are scarce due to technological mathematical and translational barriers basing the prediction solely on the ordering of a small number of features e g gene_expression ranks within profiles may overcome such barriers to clinical_translation rank based_classifiers are robust to data_normalization and yield transparent decision_rules the first and simplest of these rank based_methods the top scoring pair tsp classifier in which the decision_rule is entirely determined by the ordering of two features i e the relative expression of two genes was introduced in multiple extensions to tsp were proposed e g and some have been successfully_applied to human cancer such as simplifying clinical biomarkers a theoretical_analysis r implementation and description of the tsp algorithm can be found inhttp hal archives ouvertes fr docs pdf article pdf leek and leek respectively one powerful successor of tsp is ktop scoring pairs ktsp which applies majority_voting among multiple pairs of features ktsp has outperformed support_vector in an open challenge for cancer classification and yielded comparable accuracy to the mammaprint breast_cancer assay here we introduce an r package switchbox for ktsp this package selects the gene_pairs for the ktsp decision_rule the package also implements a new approach to choose the number of pairs k based on the analysis_of introduced in which is less computationally_intensive and less prone to overfitting than the original method introduced inand implemented in the r ktspair package in addition switchbox provides more flexibility in the selection of candidate ranges of k as well as alternative_strategies for pair votes aggregation compared with the previous r implementation finally switchbox has a method for calculating sample specific scores based on the pairs see methods which can be extended beyond classification to class_discovery problems where i is the logical indicator function the ktsp classification decision is based on thresholding i e y if g provided the labels y f g the standard threshold is k equivalent to majority_voting the only parameters required for calculating are the number and choice of feature pairs in the introductory paper to tsp the authors proposed a score for each pair of features which measures the discriminative_power of a two feature comparison the score assigned to genes i and j was defined as s ij jp x i x j jy p x i x j jy j we introduced switchbox an r package for ktsp classifier with a robust procedure for pair selection as previously described in the procedure requires less computation and is less prone to overfitting than the one described inand implemented in ktspair package moreover we provide functions for calculating auxiliary statistics as well as any user_defined combination of the comparisons the comparisons votes y axis versus samples x axis the samples are labeled either good prognosis or bad_prognosis for breast_cancer truth and falsehood of the comparisons are indicated by blue lighter shade and red darker shade respectively the combination of the votes can be used to classify illustrated by requiring at least three votes for declaring bad_prognosis more explanation and code for this figure can be found in the supplementary document
