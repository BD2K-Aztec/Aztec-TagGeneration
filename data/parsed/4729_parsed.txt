trans species learning of cellular signaling_systems with bimodal deep belief networks motivation model_organisms play_critical biomedical_research of human_diseases and drug_development an imperative task is to translate information knowledge_acquired from model_organisms to humans in this study we address a trans species learning_problem predicting human cell responses to diverse stimuli based on the responses of rat cells treated with the same stimuli results we hypothesized that rat and human cells share a common signal encoding mechanism but employ different proteins to transmit signals and we developed a bimodal deep belief network and a semi restricted bimodal deep belief network to represent the common encoding mechanism and perform trans species learning these deep_learning models_include hierarchically_organized latent_variables capable of capturing the statistical structures in the observed proteomic_data in a distributed fashion the results show that the models significantly_outperform two current state of the art classification algorithms our study demonstrated the potential of using deep_hierarchical to simulate cellular signaling_systems due to ethical_issues modal organisms such as rat and mouse have been widely used as disease_models in studying disease mechanisms and drug_actions for example mouse_models have been used to study the disease mechanisms and treatment of type_diabetes since significant differences exist between species in terms of genome cellular_systems and physiology the success of using model_organisms in biomedical_research is hinged on the capability to translate transfer the knowledge learned from model_organisms to humans for example when using a rat disease model to screen drugs and investigate the action of drugs rat cells inevitably exhibit different molecular_phenotypes such as proteomic or transcriptomic responses when compared with corresponding human cells thus in order to investigate how the drugs_act in human cells it is critical to translate the molecular_phenotypes observed in rat cells into corresponding human responses recent species translation challenges organized by the systems_biology verification combined with industrial methodology for process verification in research sbv improver provided an opportunity for the research_community to assess the methods for trans species learning in systems_biology settings one challenge task was to predict human cells proteomic responses to distinct stimuli based on the observed proteomic response to the same stimuli in rat cells more specifically during the training phase participants were provided with data thatmeasured the phosphorylation states of a common set of signaling proteins in primary cultured bronchial cells collected from rats and humans treated with distinct stimuli in the testing phase the proteomic_data of rat cells treated with unknown stimuli were provided and the task is to predict the proteomic responses of human cells treated with the same stimuli to address the trans species learning_task a simplistic approach is to train regression classification_models that use the phosphorylation data from rat cells as input_features and treat the phosphorylation status of an individual protein from human cells treated with the same stimulus as a target class in this way predicting the proteomic_profile of human cells can be addressed as a series of independent classification tasks or within a multi_label classification_framework however most contemporary multi_label methods treat the target classes as independent or are incapable of learning the covariance_structure of classes which apparently does not reflect biological reality in cellular signaling_systems signaling proteins often form pathways in which the phosphorylation of one protein will affect the phosphorylation_state of others in a signaling_cascade and cross_talk between pathways can also lead to coordinated phosphorylation of proteins in distinct_pathways another shortcoming of formulating trans species learning as a conventional classification_problem is that contemporary classifiers such as the support_vector or regularized_regression classification concentrate on deriving mathematical representations that separate the cases whereas the real goal of trans species learning is to capture the common signaling_mechanisms employed by cells from both model_organisms and humans in response to a common stimuli indeed the cornerstone hypothesis underpinning trans species learning is that there is a common encoding mechanism shared by cells from different species but distinct signaling_molecules are employed by different species to transmit the signals responding to the same environmental_stimuli therefore it is important to explore models that are compatible to the above hypothesis recent_advances in deep_hierarchical commonly referred to as deep_learning models provide an intriguing opportunity to model the common encoding mechanism of cellular signaling_systems these models represent the signals embedded in observed data using multiple_layers of hierarchically_organized hidden_variables which can be used to simulate a cellular_signaling system because the latter is also organized as a hierarchical network such that signaling proteins at different levels compositionally encode signals with different degrees of complexity for example activation of the epidermal_growth egfr will lead to a broad change of cellular_functions including the activation of multiple signaling_molecules such as ras and map_kinases which in turn will activate different transcription_factors e g erk and c_jun c fos complex with each responsible for the transcription of a subset of genes responding to egfr treatment the signals encoded by signaling_molecules become increasingly more specific and they share compositional relationships therefore deep_hierarchical e g the deep belief network dbn are particularly suitable for modeling cellular signaling_systems in this paper we present novel deep_hierarchical based on the dbn model to represent a common encoding system that encodes the cellular response to different stimuli which was developed after the competition in order to overcome the shortcomings of the conventional classification approaches we employed during competition we applied the model to the data provided by the sbv improver challenge and systematically investigated the performance our results indicate that by learning better representations of cellular signaling_systems deep_hierarchical perform significantly better on the task of trans species learning more importantly this study leads to a new direction of using deep networks to model large omics_data to gain in depth knowledge of cellular signaling_systems under physiological_and such as cancer in this study we investigated the utility of novel deep_hierarchical in a trans species learning setting to our knowledge this is the first report using deep_hierarchical to address this type of problem our results indicate that by learning to represent a common encoding system for both rat and human cells the deep_learning models outperform contemporary state of the art classifiers in this trans species learning_task the empirical success of deep_hierarchical may be attributed to the following advantages first the dbn is capable of learning novel representations of the data that are salient to the task at hand the dbn models are more compatible to the biological_systems that generate the observed data the hidden_variables at the different layers of the dbn models can capture information with different degrees of abstraction thus allowing the models to capture a more complex covariance_structure of the observed variables it is possible that hidden nodes at lower layers e g h directly capture the covariance of the observed protein_phosphorylation states whereas the higher layers can capture the crosstalk between signaling_pathways that only occur in response to specific stimuli thus shallow models that only concentrate on the covariance at the level of observed variables such as svm and elastic network would have difficulties capturing such a high_level covariance_structure of the data it is now well appreciated that feature learning methods such as dbn tend to outperform feature_selection in complex domains such as image classification and speech_recognition second dbn strives to learn the common encoding system for both human and rat data and it naturally performs multi_label by taking_into the covariance of the class variables however a conventional classifier such as a svm can only predict one human protein as the class variable in an independent_manner thus failing to capture the covariance of class variables and yielding inferior performance the sbdbn model developed in this study provides a novel approach capable of simultaneously learning interactions and predicting the state of phosphoproteins interestingly the model assigns differential weights to the edges between phosphoproteins when comparing those from rat and human cells which potentially indicates that different parts of signaling_pathways are preferentially utilized in a species specific_manner however this hypothesis still needs to be experimentally tested in a relatively larger dataset deep_hierarchical are particularly suited for modeling cellular signaling_systems because signaling_molecules in cells are organized as a hierarchical network and information in the system is compositionally encoded our results indicate that dbns were capable of capturing the complex information embedded in proteomic_data interestingly in contrast to the training of deep_learning models in a machine_learning setting such as object_recognition in image_analysis where usually a large number of training cases is required our results show that the dbn models performed very well given a moderate_size of training cases this indicates that biological data tend to have strong signals that can be captured by dbns with relative_ease our study demonstrates the feasibility of using deep_hierarchical to simulate cellular signaling_systems in general and we foresee that deep_hierarchical will be widely used in systems_biology for example one can use deep_hierarchical to study how cells encode the signals regulating gene_expression to detect which signaling_pathway is perturbed in a specific pathological condition e g cancer finally models like our bdbn and sbdbn provide a novel approach to simultaneously model multiple types of omics_data in an integromics fashion
