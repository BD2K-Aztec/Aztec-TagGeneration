genome_analysis scribl an html canvas based graphics library for visualizing genomic_data over the web motivation high_throughput biological_research requires simultaneous visualization as well as analysis of genomic_data e g read_alignments variant_calls and genomic_annotations traditionally such integrative_analysis required desktop applications operating on locally stored data many current terabyte size datasets generated by large public consortia projects however are already only feasibly stored at specialist genome_analysis centers as even small laboratories can afford very large_datasets local storage and analysis are becoming increasingly limiting and it is likely that most such datasets will soon be stored remotely e g in the cloud these developments will require web_based tools that enable users to access analyze and view vast remotely stored data with a level of sophistication and interactivity that approximates desktop applications as rapidly dropping cost enables researchers to collect data intended to answer_questions in very specialized contexts developers must also provide software libraries that empower users to implement customized data analyses and data views for their particular application such specialized yet lightweight applications would empower scientists to better answer specific biological_questions than possible with general_purpose genome brow sers currently available results using recent_advances in core web technologies html we developed scribl a flexible genomic visualization library specifically targeting coordinate based data such as genomic_features dna_sequence and genetic_variants scribl simplifies the development of sophisticated web_based graphical tools that approach the dynamism and interactivity of desktop applications availability_and software is freely_available online atincreasingly multi_faceted and complex high_throughput require sophisticated analysis and visualization of genomic_datasets that are typically very large often in the many terabytes traditionally because of these multi fold requirements sophisticated genomic_analyses required desktop applications operating on locally stored datasets as genomic_datasets have grown in size it is less and less realistic to import large genomic_datasets onto local storage and especially smaller users without large it infrastructure must rely on datasets stored remotely at specialized data analysis and archival centers e g ncbi http www ncbi nlm nih gov and large international_consortium projects e g the genomes_project http www genomes org although some desktop solutions such as the integrative_genomics offer access to remote data new development increasingly centers on web_applications to access such data prime examples of web_tools accessing remote data are genome_browser applications owing to traditional limitations of web technologies these applications use server side image generation requiring the server to render and transmit each new image interactivity is thus severely limited by the speed of the network and the instant feedback seen in desktop applications is never achieved although genome_browsers provide users with excellent facilities to add their own datasets they offer very little flexibility to incorporate custom analyses or views simply put the needs of many specialized applications are not met with currently available stock genome_browser programs the recent release of updated core web technologies including javascript css and html popularly referred to as html enables development of more sophisticated web_applications these new technologies support client side image generation where only data rather than the image file are transferred to the client indeed several applications have already taken advantage of client side graphics however developing such applications from scratch is still a significant undertaking software libraries e g bioperl biojava and biopython can simplify this development by reducing duplicative efforts and increasing accessibility to non expert programmers more relevantly the icanplot library provides html image generation for visualizing statistical data our goal here was to develop a library specifically_designed for customizable client side visualization of coordinate based genomic_data in web_applications we are building on top of the html canvas element which has been used for other clientside graphic libraries here we report scribl an html canvas genomics graphic library to enable bioinformaticians to write dynamic interactive and powerful client side to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com graphical web visualizations and to merge the power of desktop applications with the inherently collaborative nature and accessibility of the web
