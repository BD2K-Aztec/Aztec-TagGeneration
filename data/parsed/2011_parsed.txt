genomelaser fast and accurate haplotyping from pedigree genotypes we present a software_tool called genomelaser that determines the haplotypes of each person from unphased high_throughput genotypes in family pedigrees this method features high_accuracy chromosome range phasing distance linear computing flexible pedigree types and flexible genetic_marker types availability_and haplotype refers to a group of alleles inherited together on a single chromosome haplotype is essential for mapping disease signals finding functional cis_acting loops among non coding elements imputing the missing_values in big_data genotypes can be obtained directly from high_throughput or next_generation but haplotypes cannot be obtained directly given that current high_throughput haplotyping technologies are still expensive and statistical haplotyping approach suffers from ambiguities phasing by pedigrees is the most cost_effective and accurate approach for haplotype determination whenever pedigree genotypes are available most of the phasing programs by pedigrees assume zero or minimal recombinations and difficult for large complicated and looping pedigrees the lack of efficient and accurate methods for long_range haplotype determination has hampered the functional_interpretation of non coding cis_acting in human_genome here we present a computational_tool genomelaser to reconstruct personal haplotypes from unphased genotypes it can also handle the looped pedigrees and missing genotype data genomelaser provides an efficient computational_tool for determination of molecular haplotypes from unphased genotype data in pedigrees accurate chromosome range personal haplotypes will be extremely useful to explore those long_distance cis regulatory_networks and epigenetic controls of chromosome function it is not suitable for those scenarios such as very small genomic_regions in which pedigree_information are not available briefly laser iii may be affected by admixture laser i and laser ii are based on the mendelian law of inheritance and they will not be affected by genetic admixtures but laser iii is a reference based imputation it will be affected by the admixture the performance may be improved by the following operations first locus specific ancestry may be determined in parallel with genomelaser to monitor the admixtures second the reference_panels should be either chosen according to the admixture background or based on the pooled reference_panels the statistical haplotyping approaches also use similar strategies to improve imputation performance for admixed samples by either improving the algorithm or careful selecting reference_panels
