data_and bdtcomparator a program for comparing binary classifiers the bdtcomparator facilitates the selection of the best performing binary_classification model or binary diagnostic_procedure from the many possible alternatives by comparing their predictions with a known output measured with the use of a system recognized as the gold_standard the program calculates the estimates of accuracy sensitivity specificity predictive_values and diagnostic likelihood_ratios along with appropriate confidence_intervals furthermore all pairwise_comparisons with respect to the above_mentioned measures are calculated the formatted results can be exported to a text_file availability_and bdtcomparator is distributed under the gnu gplv_license and is freely_available for download from http www tox portal net we provide programs for both linux and windows operating_systems the source_code of the program is provided in our companion websitedata analysis is one of the main driving_forces of modern science among others it results in the fast development of disease screening_procedures and classification algorithms for data_mining in both areas the ultimate_goal is to select the best performing model or diagnostic_procedure dp from the many possible alternatives by comparing their predictions with a known output measured with the use of a system recognized as a gold_standard furthermore one may be interested in pairwise performance_comparisons between the many competing_models dps in our report we focus on the binary dps classification_problems both prediction and measured output can be either zero or one and propose comprehensive freely_available software supporting this type of analyses a reallife example of its functioning is presented based on the drug safety_assessment problem
