girafe an r bioconductor_package for functional exploration of aligned next_generation reads the r bioconductor_package girafe facilitates the functional exploration of alignments of sequence_reads from next_generation data to a genome it allows users to investigate the genomic_intervals together with the aligned_reads and to work with visualise and export these intervals moreover the package operates within and extends the ever growing bioconductor framework and thus enables users to leverage a multitude of methods for their data in order to answer specific research_questions availability_and the r package girafe is available from the bioconductor web_site http www bioconductor org_packages release bioc html girafe html an extensive vignette and the bioconductor mailing lists provide additional documentation and help for using the package contact next_generation ngs technologies_provide users with millions of comparatively short_rna or dna_reads from biological_samples of interest the first step in the analysis of these data usually is to align the reads to the chosen reference_genome using powerful specific alignment tools for the secondary analysis that follows there is a need for an integrated work environment which allows users to explore and annotate the genome intervals with the aligned_reads besides providing functionality for data exploration this environment must also provide interfaces to other available tools especially as the field of ngs_analysis software is comparatively new and rapidly_evolving previously described excellent tools that provide frameworks for working with aligned_reads include galaxy and samtools here we describe the r bioconductor_package girafe that enables users to investigate the genome intervals with the aligned_reads henceforth referred to as aligned intervals and to work with visualise and export these aligned intervals one advantage of girafe over other tools for working with aligned_reads is that the package operates within the open_source open development and constantly to whom correspondence should be addressed growing bioconductor framework thus this package enables users to leverage a multitude of methods in the analysis of their data in order to answer specific research_questions the r bioconductor_package girafe provides users with a powerful flexible and extensible framework to explore ngs_data following alignment of the reads to a reference_genome the package interacts with other bioconductor_packages and allows export of the data in various formats for exploring them in other software with the aim of not restricting the user to a limited set of analysis tools the field of ngs_analysis software is growing rapidly thus future_developments of the package will include adding further methods for working with aligned genome intervals reducing the memory_footprint and providing additional interfaces to other r bioconductor_packages and other software
