webpsn a web_server for high_throughput investigation of structural communication in biomacromolecules we developed a mixed protein_structure network psn and elastic network model normal_mode enm nma based strategy i e psn enm to investigate structural communication in biomacromolecules the approach starts from a protein_structure graph and searches for all shortest communication pathways between user specified residues the graph is computed on a single preferably high_resolution structure information on systems dynamics is supplied by enm nma the psnenm methodology is made of multiple_steps both in the setup and analysis stages which may discourage inexperienced users to facilitate its usage we implemented webpsn a freely_available web_server that allows the user to easily setup the calculation perform post_processing analyses and both visualize and download numerical and d representations of the output speed and accuracy make this server suitable to investigate structural communication including alloster ism in large sets of bio macromolecular systems availability_and the webpsn server is freely_available webpsn hpc unimore it concepts and methods borrowed from graph_theory are being increasingly used to study several aspects of structural_biology including structural communication that comprises allosterism the graph based_approach defined as protein_structure network psn has been implemented in the freely_available wordom software it computes network_features e g nodes hubs links etc and shortest communication pathways on ensembles of structures generally derived from molecular_dynamics md_simulations with this approach information on systems dynamics participates both in building the protein_structure graph psg and in searching for the shortest communication pathways in a recent development of the method intended for highthroughput investigations the psg is computed on a single highresolution structure rather than an md trajectory and information on systems dynamics i e cross_correlation of atomic motions is supplied by elastic network model normal_mode enmnma see supplementary methods for detailed information the approach hereafter indicated as psnenm is powerful and fast but complex in the setup and analysis steps to foster wide usage the method was therefore implemented in a web_server webpsn that provides the user with a friendly graphical_interface for setting the input and visualizing the output while hiding all computation and data management steps
