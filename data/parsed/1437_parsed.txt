distmix direct imputation of summary_statistics for unmeasured snps from mixed ethnicity cohorts motivation to increase the signal resolution for large_scale meta_analyses of genome_wide genotypes at unmeasured single_nucleotide snps are commonly imputed using large multi_ethnic reference_panels however the ever increasing size and ethnic diversity of both reference_panels and cohorts makes genotype_imputation computationally_challenging for moderately sized computer clusters moreover genotype_imputation requires subject level genetic data which unlike summary_statistics provided by virtually all studies is not publicly_available while there are much less demanding methods which avoid the genotype_imputation step by directly imputing snp statistics e g directly imputing summary_statistics dist proposed by our group their implicit assumptions make them applicable only to ethnically homogeneous cohorts results to decrease computational and access requirements for the analysis of cosmopolitan co horts we propose distmix which extends dist capabilities to the analysis of mixed ethnicity co horts the method uses a relevant reference_panel to directly impute unmeasured snp statistics based only on statistics at measured snps and estimated user specified ethnic proportions simulations show that the proposed method adequately controls the type_i the genomes panel imputation of summary_statistics from the ethnically_diverse psychiatric genetic consortium schizophrenia phase suggests that when compared to genotype imputation_methods distmix offers comparable imputation_accuracy for only a fraction of computational_resources availability_and distmix software its reference_population data and usage examples are publicly_available atgenotype imputation_methods are commonly used to increase the genomic resolution for large_scale multi_ethnic meta_analyses by predicting genotypes at v c the author published_by
