genome_analysis calmate a method and software to improve allele specific copy_number of snp_arrays for downstream segmentation calmate calibrates preprocessed allele specific copy_number estimates ascns from dna_microarrays by controlling for single_nucleotide specific allelic crosstalk the resulting ascns are on average more accurate which increases the power of segmentation_methods for detecting changes between copy_number states in tumor studies including copy_neutral calmate applies to any ascns regardless of preprocessing method and microarray_technology e g affymetrix and illumina availability the method is available on cran http cran r project org in the open_source r package calmate which also includes an add on to the aroma project framework http www aroma project org several analytical pipelines for identifying total copy_number tcn events from dna_microarrays are available however certain types of genomic_alterations cannot be detected from tcns e g copy neutral loh events the identification of such events can be key to our biological understanding of cancer development and our ability to set up a personalized treatment_plan genotyping microarrays quantify not only tcns but also allele specific copy_numbers ascns which are necessary to identify cn states such as copy_neutral loh ascns are the cn estimates of each allele variant here a and b at a particular bi_allelic singlenucleotide polymorphism snp for the purpose of displaying ascns along the genome and also for detecting cn changes ascns are often represented by their tcns and b allele fractions bafs for instance for diploid snps in a to whom correspondence should be addressed all authors contributed equally normal region the expected tcn is and expected bafs are aa ab or bb in a region of copy neutral loh the expected tcn is and the expected bafs are or for a single_copy gain expected tcn is and expected bafs are and in observed tcns and bafs are displayed along the genome for a normal region a gain and a region of copy neutral loh based on these type of data segmentation_methods identify regions of constant cn state their performances depend greatly on the signal_to snrs of tcn and baf which in turn depend on the preprocessing method used e g dchip cn crma v acne ortiz and illumina some of these
