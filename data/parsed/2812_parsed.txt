matching experiments across species using expression values and textual information motivation with the vast increase in the number of gene_expression deposited in public_databases novel techniques are required to analyze and mine this wealth of data similar to the way blast enables cross_species comparison of sequence_data tools that enable cross_species expression comparison will allow us to better utilize these datasets cross_species expression comparison enables us to address questions in evolution and development and further allows the identification of disease related genes and pathways that play similar roles in humans and model_organisms unlike sequence which is static expression data changes over time and under different conditions thus a prerequisite for performing cross_species analysis is the ability to match experiments across species results to enable better cross_species comparisons we developed methods for automatically identifying pairs of similar expression datasets across species our method uses a co training algorithm to combine a model of expression similarity with a model of the text which accompanies the expression experiments the co training method outperforms previous methods based on expression similarity alone using expert analysis we show that the new matches identified by our method indeed capture biological similarities across species we then use the matched expression pairs between human and mouse to recover known and novel cycling genes as well as to identify genes with possible involvement in diabetes by providing the ability to identify novel candidate_genes in model_organisms our method opens_the to new models for studying diseases availability source_code and supplementary_information is available atcross species analysis has been at the center of genomics research for decades some of the most influential computational_biology work including blast and various alignment_methods were aimed at comparing genomics data across species in addition to answering several basic research_questions including issues related to evolution and development cross_species analysis is extensively used by pharmaceutical_companies indeed almost all drugs are initially_developed and tested using model_organisms and knowledge about the relationship to whom correspondence should be addressed between target_genes in these organisms and corresponding human genes is crucial for successful drug_development while most work to date has focused on the analysis of sequence_data across species other types of genomics data are rapidly_accumulating one of the most abundant types of genomics data are gene_expression data unlike sequence_data expression data changes between conditions time points and developmental_stages and is thus extremely useful for studies that involve responses to various treatments gene_expression databases from microarray_studies have grown exponentially over the last decade other technologies including rna_sequencing are also generating large expression datasets in multiple species this leads to a key challenge how can we effectively mine these databases to identify similarities and differences in gene_expression across species that complement sequence_data a prerequisite for cross_species analysis is the ability to match data in one species to data in another this can be easily done for sequence_data since dna is context independent and the nucleotides and amino_acids are universal however things become more challenging when using expression data first genes need to be matched across species and not all orthologs are currently known more importantly expression data are condition specific continuous sometimes dynamic and often much noisier than sequence_data this makes it hard to identify experiments that can be matched to find genes that are expressed in a similar way across species to address_this several researchers performed controlled experiments in which the same biological system was studied under the same condition in the same lab and in multiple species examples_include the cell_cycle immune_response various tissues drug response and development seefor a recent review while these studies successfully identified similarities and differences leading to new insights regarding conservation and response mechanisms this success only serves to strengthen the question mentioned above can we develop methods to mine the vast number of expression experiments currently deposited in public_databases so that they can also be used in such a cross_species analysis framework relatively little work has been carried_out to date to address this general question especially when compared with work that focuses on the cross_species analysis of sequence_data one previous approach byused non_negative nmf to perform the unsupervised discovery of a small set of metagenes that are a linear combination of gene_expression levels in one of the species being compared by similarly combining the orthologs of these genes into metagenes in anotherwe performed experiments by searching for matches between human when performing expression similarity comparisons we only use the ortholog pairs that vary the most within species this reduces the amount of training data required to fit our weight vector the reason for using this reduced set of orthologs is based on the idea that orthologs which do not vary their levels across experiments in a single_organism are less useful in differentiating experiments across species the initial positive training_set used was our hand curated set of pairs discussed above since we expect the vast_majority of random array pairs to represent different experiments as negative training data we used all pairs not in the positive training_set initially pairs
