structural_bioinformatics cascleave towards more accurate prediction of caspase substrate cleavage_sites motivation the caspase family_of play_essential in key_biological such as programmed_cell differentiation proliferation necrosis and inflammation the complete repertoire of caspase substrates remains to be fully characterized accordingly systematic computational screening studies of caspase substrate cleavage_sites may provide insight into the substrate_specificity of caspases and further facilitating the discovery of putative novel substrates results in this article we develop an approach termed cascleave to predict both classical i e following a p asp and non typical caspase cleavage_sites when using local sequence derived profiles cascleave successfully predicted of the known substrate cleavage_sites with a matthews correlation_coefficient mcc of we found that prediction_performance could be further improved by incorporating information such as predicted solvent_accessibility and whether a cleavage sequence lies in a region that is most likely natively unstructured novel bi profile bayesian signatures were found to significantly improve the prediction_performance and yielded the best performance with an overall accuracy of and a mcc of which is higher accuracy than published_methods that essentially rely on amino_acid alone it is anticipated that cascleave will be a powerful_tool for predicting novel substrate cleavage_sites of caspases and shedding new insights on the unknown caspase substrate interactivity relationship to date mammalian caspases have been identified these molecules function in signaling_cascades that control critical processes such as apoptosis necrosis inflammation migration proliferation and differentiation caspases cleave substrates that generally contain a highly_conserved aspartate d at the p position however in addition to the p asp the amino_acids at the p and p p positions contain important additional determinants of specificity that can dramatically affect cleavage efficiency accordingly mammalian caspases can be divided_into three groups group i caspases caspase and prefer bulky hydrophobic amino_acids at the p site and recognize peptide_sequence w l ehd group_ii caspases caspase and preferentially cleave the dexd motif while group_iii caspases caspase and recognize the sequence i v l e h t d in contrast to the other caspases caspase is expressed and activated mainly in the epidermis and exhibits cleavage preference for the wehd or ietd motif the study of apoptotic_pathways predominantly mediated by caspases has important implications for the development of therapies for cancer treatment there is significant interest in gaining a better understanding of caspase substrate_specificity even though almost caspase substrates have been reported to date there are likely to be hundreds of new caspase substrates that remain to be discovered experimental identification and characterization of protease substrates is often difficult and timeconsuming hence computational_prediction of caspase substrate_specificity may provide useful and experimentally testable information in regards to novel potential cleavage_sites or candidate substrates several computational_approaches have been developed to predict caspase_cleavage site_specificity peptidecutter utilized a limited experimental dataset and was initially used to predict the substrate cleavage_sites for a variety of protease families including severalpage caspases have central roles in apoptotic cell_death by catalysing a multitude of proteolytic events such as activating pro_survival or anti_apoptotic and activating anti survival or pro_apoptotic proteins the key to understanding the physiological role of caspases is to identify their natural substrates caspases have the ability to cleave multiple proteins in different physiological compartments and produce polypeptide products with potentially new functional activities with cleavage preference influenced by various factors such as substrate sequence substrate conformation and accessibility knowledge about the substrate_specificity of caspases can dramatically improve our ability to predict target protein_substrates however this information cannot at present be readily derived from experimental_approaches solving this problem is fundamental for both understanding caspase biology and the development of therapeutics that target specific caspase mediated apoptotic_pathways the recent proliferation of large_scale in vitro peptide cleavage libraries and proteome_wide global profiling platforms offers promising prospects of identifying specific caspase substrates in combination with computer based screening of genome_sequences the advantage of machine_learning such as svr make them particularly appealing in solving the difficult problem of caspase substrate_specificity prediction as they can be effectively applied to better describe the complex non linear relationships underlying the caspase substrate interactivity by using the kernel functions to build the predictive_models to address this problem we developed a novel bioinformatic approach based on svr to make testable_predictions on the substrate_specificity of caspases considering that caspase cleavage_sites show preferences for predicted_secondary solvent_accessibility and natively unstructured regions we used a bi profile bayesian feature_extraction approach to derive these profiles and train the svr models the efficiency of the resulting cascleave predictors for predicting caspase cleavage_sites has been demonstrated by comparing to one of the most accurate existing algorithms casvm and multi factor casvm the predictive_performance of cascleave was further showcased by predicting four caspase substrates for which the cleavage_sites have been experimentally_validated the results indicate that sequence scanning using cascleave should be very useful for identifying the putative caspase cleavage_sites in this study our goal was to predict all the potential cleavage_sites irrespective of the spatiotemporal environments or conformation changes that a substrate may be subject to the features used as input to the cascleave predictor are derived from primary sequences and the input_data does not contain specific information about the order of sequential cleavage events in proteolytic cascades in these exceptional cases there is a chance that the predictor will fail as a purely statistical_model the predicted solvent_exposure and native disorder features are a supplement to the primary sequence and in cases where the primary sequence alone contains a strong consensus indicating a cleavage_site we hope these amino_acid sequence_encoding features are overriding for example in rasgap uniprot id p there is a correctly_predicted cleavage_site degdsldg by cascleave which shows low_probability of being solvent_exposure and natively disordered supplementary in the specific cases where a sequential proteolytic_cascade occurs features based on primary sequence alone are unlikely to be sufficient training based on features from the d structure of the substrate protein may help in this regards although this is not amenable to a general predictor since the d structures of many substrates in their intact or cleaved form mid cascades are generally not known there are a number of additional measures with potential to further increase the accuracy of prediction in the future the first approach is to use either the accurate d structure of the substrate or the structure of a protease in complex with a substrate instead of the predicted structural_information to build the predictive_models this will allow us to ascertain whether the high_resolution crystal_structure of a protease substrate complex can be used to derive specificity information the second is to incorporate other informative and complementary features such as sequenceorder dependent context that can better describe the sequential neighborhood surrounding the substrate cleavage_sites the third is to investigate how to effectively represent the negatives non cleavage_sites that are true_negatives and are non cleavable under any cellular or physiological_conditions and how to better discriminate these absolute negatives from those that are cleavable under a given physiological condition thus the precise detection of the true_negatives is more likely to contribute to an improvement of the prediction_accuracy based on which characteristic feature_sets regarding positives and negative samples can be more accurately represented and established further improvement can be also achieved by using refined training and testing datasets with high_quality coverage of the cleavage_sites identified by high_throughput proteome_wide techniques in summary we have proposed a novel approach to predict cleavage_sites from the flanking amino_acid of caspase substrates we analyzed the structural determinants of caspase substrate_specificity based on a well curated database from multiple resources we built the cascleave models using the bi profile bayesian_approach that takes_into the characteristic sequential and structural profiles in the vicinity of cleavage and non cleavage_sites this provides a quantitative evaluation of caspase substrate_specificity the results showed that our approach is more accurate than the casvm and multi factor casvm methods demonstrating its usefulness for describing the complex sequence structure relationships and predicting caspase cleavage_sites it is anticipated that cascleave will be a powerful_tool for predicting novel substrate cleavage_sites of caspases and shedding new insights on the unknown caspase substrate interactivity
