structural_bioinformatics fast tomographic_reconstruction on multicore computers tomo d implements a multithreaded vectorized approach to tomographic_reconstruction that takes full advantage of the computer power in modern multicore computers full resolution tomograms are generated at high_speed on standard computers with no special system requirements tomo d has the most common reconstruction methods implemented namely weighted back projection wbp and simultaneous iterative_reconstruction technique sirt it proves to be competitive with current graphic processor unit solutions in terms of processing time in the order of a few seconds with wbp or minutes with sirt the program is compatible with standard packages which easily allows integration in the electron_tomography workflow electron_tomography et allows visualization of complex specimens in its native cellular_context at near molecular resolution a series of projection images is taken with an electron_microscope from a unique biological_sample at different orientations around a single tilt axis tomographic_reconstruction algorithms then combine those images so as to derive the d structure of the specimen the number of images in the series usually ranges from to due to the resolution needs the image size generally ranges between and pixels though can now be used as well weighted backprojection wbp is the standard reconstruction method iterative methods such as simultaneous iterative_reconstruction technique sirt exhibit better performance in et however they demand much longer processing time which has prevented their extensive use so_far the complexity of the algorithms along with the data size turns d reconstruction into a computational intensive problem traditionally high_performance has been used to cope with the demands in et recently the use of graphics processor units gpus has revolutionized the field as they provide exceptional performance to cost_ratio though a relatively specific to whom correspondence should be addressed hardware component the gpu is still necessary current standalone computers present tremendous power thanks to technological and architectural advances but they still have not been fully exploited in the field we present a program tomo d that implements an approach to tomographic_reconstruction based on the full use of the computational power within modern multicore computers it takes_advantage of the multiple cores and of the vector instructions within the cores and also uses general code optimization techniques to make the most of the computers the program significantly accelerates the d reconstruction methods wbp and sirt and even outperforms current gpu solutions furthermore this program enables real_time tomography on standard multicore computers without the need for clusters or gpus the multithreaded vectorized approach to tomographic_reconstruction in tomo d allows computation of full resolution tomograms at high_speed on standard computers there are no special system requirements to run the program and furthermore it is fully compatible with standard packages in the field all these are the major_contributions of tomo d from the users point_of the good performance of tomo d stems from the full exploitation of the computing_power latent in modern multicore computers the processing time required by the methods implemented in tomo d wbp and sirt turns out to be competitive with gpus
