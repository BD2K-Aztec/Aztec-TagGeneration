rna rna interaction prediction based on multiple_sequence motivation many computerized methods for rnarna_interaction structure_prediction have been developed recently o n time and o n space dynamic_programming have become available that compute the partition_function of rnarna_interaction complexes however few of these methods incorporate the knowledge concerning related sequences thus relevant evolutionary_information is often neglected from the structure_determination therefore it is of considerable practical interest to introduce a method taking_into both thermodynamic_stability as well as sequence structure covariation results we present the a priori folding algorithm ripalign whose input consists of two given multiple_sequence msa ripalign outputs i the partition_function ii base_pairing probabilities iii hybrid probabilities and iv a set of boltzmann sampled suboptimal structures consisting of canonical joint structures that are compatible to the alignments compared to the single_sequence pair folding algorithm rip ripalign requires negligible additional memory resource but offers much better sensitivity_and once alignments of suitable quality are given ripalign additionally allows to incorporate structure constraints as input_parameters availability the algorithm described here is implemented in c as part of the rip package the supplemental material source_code and input output_files can freely be downloaded fromrnarna interactions play_a at many different levels of the cellular_metabolism such as plasmid replication control viral encapsidation or transcriptional and translational regulation with the discovery that a large number of transcripts in higher to whom correspondence should be addressed eukaryotes are non_coding rnarna_interactions in cellular_metabolism are gaining in prominence typical examples of interactions involving two rna_molecules are snrnas snornas with their targets micrornas from the rnai pathway with their mrna target srnas from escherichia_coli and srna looploop interactions the common_feature in many ncrna classes especially prokaryotic small_rnas is the formation of rnarna_interaction structures that are much more complex than the simple senseantisense interactions as it is the case for the general rna_folding problem with unrestricted pseudoknots the rnarna_interaction problem rip is np complete in its most general form however polynomial time algorithms can be derived by restricting the space of allowed configurations in ways that are similar to pseudoknot folding algorithms the simplest approach concatenates the two interacting sequences and subsequently employs a slightly modified standard secondary_structure folding algorithm the algorithms rnacofold pairfold and nupack subscribe to this strategy a major shortcoming of this approach is that it cannot predict important motifs such as kissing hairpin loops the paradigm of concatenation has also been generalized to the pseudoknot folding algorithm of rivas and eddy the resulting model however still does not generate all relevant interaction structures an alternative line of thought is to neglect all internal base_pairings in either strand and to compute the minimum_free mfe secondary_structure for their hybridization under this constraint for instance rnaduplex and rnahybrid follows this line of thought rnaup and intarna restrict interactions to a single interval that remains unpaired in the secondary_structure for each partner these models have proved particularly useful for bacterial srna mrna interactions pervouchine andindependently proposed mfe folding algorithms for predicting the joint structure of two interacting rna_molecules with polynomial time complexity in their model a joint structure means that the intramolecular
