genetics_and raremetal fast and powerful meta_analysis for rare_variants raremetal is a computationally_efficient tool for meta_analysis of rare_variants genotyped using sequencing or arrays raremetal facilitates analyses of individual studies accommodates a variety of input file_formats handles related and unrelated_individuals executes both single_variant and burden tests and performs conditional association_analyses availability_and http genome sph umich edu wiki raremetal for executables source_code documentation andin genomewide_association meta_analysis has been key in establishing association between common_variants and complex_traits recent_advances in exome_sequencing and the development of exome genotyping_arrays are enabling complex disease studies to explore association between rare_variants of clear functional_consequence and complex_traits for these rare_variants single_variant tests can lack power and association tests that group rare_variants by gene or functional_unit are favored here we describe a tool for meta_analysis of rare_variant studies for quantitative_traits our tool enables individual studies to account for study specific covariates as well as family and population_structure in addition it generates summaries of linkage_disequilibrium information that allow association tests for groups of rare_variants during meta_analysis one of our primary considerations in raremetal was support for standard easy to implement input_formats rmw uses merlin format input_files to retrieve phenotypes covariates and family_structure and vcf files to retrieve genotypes checks are implemented for a variety of problems in input_files including formatting errors x linked genotypes that are inconsistent with reported sex and matching of identifiers across files rmw and raremetal are implemented in c source_code and binary executables are available from our web_site for convenience input and output_files can be processed directly in gzip format we have also tested compilation on several linux mac os x and windows platforms
