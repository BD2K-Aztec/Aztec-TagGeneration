structural_bioinformatics a new method to improve network topological similarity_search applied to fold_recognition motivation similarity_search is the foundation of bioinformatics it plays_a in establishing structural functional and evolutionary_relationships between biological_sequences although the power of the similarity_search has increased_steadily in recent_years a high percentage of sequences remain uncharacterized in the protein universe thus new similarity search_strategies are needed to efficiently and reliably infer the structure and function of new sequences the existing paradigm for studying protein_sequence structure function and evolution has been established based on the assumption that the protein universe is discrete and hierarchical cumulative evidence suggests that the protein universe is continuous as a result conventional sequence_homology search_methods may be not able to detect novel structural functional and evolutionary_relationships between proteins from weak and noisy sequence signals to overcome the limitations in existing similarity search_methods we propose a new algorithmic frameworkenrichment of network topological_similarity ents to improve the performance of large_scale similarity_searches in bioinformatics results we apply ents to a challenging unsolved_problem protein fold_recognition our rigorous benchmark studies demonstrate that ents considerably outperforms state of the art methods as the concept of ents can be applied to any similarity_metric it may provide a general framework for similarity_search on any set of biological_entities given their representation as a network availability_and source_code freely_available upon request contact lxie iscb orgrecent advances in whole_genome and high_throughput techniques have generated a vast amount of sequence and omics_data one critical bottleneck in the post genome era is the discernment of the biological meaning of uncharacterized sequences in the context of complex phenotypes similarity_search as the foundation of bioinformatics plays_a in establishing structural functional and evolutionary_relationships between biological_sequences in the case of protein_function and structure_determination although the power of the similarity_search has increased_steadily in recent_years the protein universe still contains a high percentage of dark_matter which consists of proteins that cannot be characterized by existing experimental or computational_techniques thus new similarity search_strategies are needed to identify homologs of new sequences efficiently and reliably and to infer their structures and functions in the context of biological_systems via integrating heterogeneous omics_data an increasing body of evidence suggests that protein space is continuous in general although there exist discrete islands it implies that two proteins could be related even if their pairwise similarity is undetectable thus the protein universe is better represented as a graph where each node is a protein two nodes are connected if there is a detectable relationship between them in this way two remotely related proteins can be connected through a transitive path however widely used sequence_similarity search_methods such as psi_blast and hidden_markov hmm and conventional protein_sequence and structure classification schema such as pfam structural_classification of proteins scop and cath are built on the assumption that protein space is discrete and hierarchical as a result novel structural and functional_relationships can be missed if two sequences are very divergent a network based method which connects all sequences into a graph_model and exploits the global network_structure of similarity relationships between proteins in a database provides an alternative_solution to explore the protein space in a continuous fashion although it has demonstrated its potential in detecting novel relationships that could be missed by the pairwisebased method the existing network based method has two fundamental limitations first it provides the ranking of similarities but gives no information on their reliabilities a model that can assess_the of similarity is one of the key components in both pairwise based and profile based_methods and is critical in distinguishing true and false_positives and enhancing the sensitivity of a similarity_search second few network based_methods can combine sequence and structural_similarity the incorporation of structural_similarity into sequence_profile has been successfully_applied to detecting novel sequencestructure relationships as the structure is more conserved than the sequence in this article we introduce a new similarity_search method enrichment of network topological_similarity ents to address challenges in protein similarity_search in terms of the continuous protein space ents synthesizes several concepts network_inference to detect the global similarity of a protein grouping of relevant proteins as a network profile incorporation of structural_information into the sequence_search and an efficient statistics model to assess the reliability of the network topological_similarity profile we apply ents to a challenging unsolved_problem protein fold_recognition our rigorous benchmark studies demonstrate that ents significantly_outperforms state of the art profile and network based_methods for protein_structure moreover ents can integrate different similarity measurements e g sequence_similarity and structure similarity and biological classifications e g scop to infer novel protein_structure and function as the principal concept of ents can be applied to any similarity_metric ents provides a new general framework to boost the performance of the similarity_search and may inspire novel methodologies in broad_areas of bioinformatics such as rna_structure and disease_gene similarity is a fundamental concept in bioinformatics and the emerging discipline of data science which seeks to harness big_data to improve data_driven decision_making in this article we propose a new method for computing statistically_significant similarity via integrating similarity profiles network topological_similarity and set enrichment_analysis because ents applies to any similarity_metric it is poised to make several contributions to bioinformatics individual predictive reliability is essential in risk sensitive applications ents is able to determine the statistical_significance of any similarity_metric and provides guidance for reliable discovery in large_data robustness to noisy and incomplete data_sets is important in bioinformatics applications many bioinformatics tasks need to handle data_sets that are partially and or positive only labeled ents provides a new approach to handling noisy and incomplete_data thus it is expected that ents has broad applications in bioinformatics
