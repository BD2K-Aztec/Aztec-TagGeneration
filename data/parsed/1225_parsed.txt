cyclo lib a database of computational molecular_dynamics simulations of cyclodextrins motivation cyclodextrins cds are amongst the most versatile multi_functional molecules used in molecular research and chemical applications they are natural cyclic oligosaccharides typically employed to encapsulate hydrophobic_groups in their central_cavity this allows solubilizing protecting or reducing the toxicity of a large variety of different molecules including drugs dyes and surfactant agents in spite of their great_potential atomic_level information of these molecules which is key for their function is really scarce computational molecular_dynamics md_simulations have the potential to efficiently fill this gap providing structural dynamic information at atomic_level in time scales ranging from ps to ls results cyclo lib is a database with a publicly_accessible web_interface containing structural and dynamic analysis obtained from computational md_simulation trajectories ns long of native and modified cds in explicit water_molecules cyclo lib currently includes cds typically employed for fundamental and industrial research tools for comparative_analysis between different cds as well as to restrict the analysis to specific time segments within the trajectories are also available cyclo lib provides atomic_resolution information aimed to complement experimental_results performed with the same molecules availability_and the database is freely_available undercyclodextrins cds are cyclic oligosaccharides formed by acd b cd or c cd glucopyranoside groups gpus that play_a in different fields such as pharmacy medicine chemistry materials design food or agricultural science by taking_advantage of the different accessibility and reactivity of the primary and secondary hydroxyl_groups of the native a b c cds specifically_designed chemical_modifications allow their selective functionalization in order to affect their physicochemical and pharmaceutical_properties solubility surface_properties complexation efficiency control release aggregation new and interesting perspectives for their use have emerged in recent_years by the development of novel cd derivatives despite the increasing number of patents and articles based on cds only a tiny fraction of that literature contains atomic_level structural dynamic information and even less includes results from computational simulations the development and optimization of applications using cds has been traditionally based on trial and error essays supported by wet_lab while the pharmaceutical_industry has successfully incorporated computational molecular_modeling tools into the drug_design process other chemical sectors where cds are involved textile food cosmetics cleaning painting agriculture etc have not extensively used this type of computational_tools it is worth noting that the chemical_processes involved in all these industries including the pharmaceutical are similar in contrast to what is commonly assumed it is known that cds are not rigid their flexibility is key in the way they interact to the surrounding molecules unlike other computational simulation_methods md allows studying molecules in motion as well as to include the explicit interaction with the solvent and with other solutes making the results more reliable here we present a web_based database with structural and dynamic analysis results obtained from computational md_simulation trajectories of native and modified cds in explicit water_molecules tools to easily compare the behaviour of different cds obtained from the corresponding md trajectories are included in cyclo lib due to their interesting physicochemical_properties there is a growing interest by the research_community in using cds for a number of applications based on their ability to encapsulate hydrophobic_groups or to form nanoaggregates the lack of information about these molecules at atomic_scale seriously limits the capacity of researches to rationally modify their structure and also to predict their behaviour at different levels cyclo lib provides not only the most probable structures and a detailed analysis of a large number of cds in aqueous_solution but also the parameter files required to perform more complex simulation_studies including docking aggregation or adsorption to interfaces so we do expect that the new insight provided by this database will significantly contribute to the ongoing efforts worldwide to design novel cd derivatives as well as to widen the range of applications based on these molecules
