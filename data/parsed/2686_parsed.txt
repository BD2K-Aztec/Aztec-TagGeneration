learning chromatin_states with factorized information criteria motivation recent_studies that both the genome and the genome with epigenetic_modifications the so_called epigenome play_important in various biological_functions such as transcription and dna_replication repair and recombination it is well known that specific combinations of histone_modifications e g methylations and acetylations of nucleosomes induce chroma tin states that correspond to specific functions of chromatin although the advent_of ngs_technologies enables measurement of epigenetic_information for entire genomes at high_resolution the variety of chromatin_states has not been completely characterized results in this study we propose a method to estimate the chromatin_states indicated by genome_wide chromatin_marks identified by ngs_technologies the proposed method automatically estimates the number of chromatin_states and characterize each state on the basis of a hidden_markov hmm in combination with a recently_proposed model_selection technique factorized information criteria the method is expected to provide an unbiased model because it relies on only two adjustable_parameters and avoids heuristic procedures as much as possible computational_experiments with simulated_datasets show that our method automatically learns an appropriate model even in cases where methods that rely on bayesian information criteria fail to learn the model structures in addition we comprehensively compare our method to chromhmm on three real_datasets and show that our method estimates more chromatin_states than chromhmm for those datasets in the eukaryotic cell_nucleus the genome forms a complex structure called chromatin the building_blocks of chromatin are nucleosomes in which a dna_strand is wrapped around an octamer of histone_proteins h a h b h and h it is known that in nucleosomes post transcription modifications of the histone_proteins and substitution of histone_proteins with variants both occur frequently gene_regulation and dna_replication repair v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com and recombination are greatly affected by the chromatin structures determined by not only transcription_factors bound to dna_sequences but also post translation modifications and substitutions with variants of the histone_proteins in molecular_biology the study of mechanisms of gene_regulation that do not depend on changing the dna_sequence itself is called epigenetics and it is an important research field in the post genome_sequencing era changes that affect chromatin structures are called histone_marks and include various histone_modifications e g methylation acetylation citrullination phosphorylation sumoylation ubiquitination and adp_ribosylation and substitution with histone variants e g h a z for h a histone recently it has become possible to measure these histone_marks at high_resolution across an entire_genome by using specific_antibodies in combination with next_generation ngs_technologies in dr brian d strahl and dr c david allis proposed the histone code hypothesis which posits that specific combinations of histone_modifications correspond to specific functions of chromatins called chromatin_states in a manner similar to how combinations of nucleotide codons correspond to translated amino_acids recent_studies have offered strong evidence in support of this hypothesis for example h_k h lysine di trimethylation and h k ac h lysine_acetylation characterize transcriptionally active_chromatin while h_k and h_k correspond to silent loci nucleosomes with both h_k and h_k characterize bivalent features of genes which are frequently found in stem_cells and an inactive_x is marked by the presence of h_k h_k and h_k although as described earlier a large amount of experimental_evidence and knowledge has been collected about histone_modifications in chromatins definitive answers to the following questions are still elusive how many chromatin_states exist what are the possible kinds the attempt to answer_these has inspired the development of computational_methods to estimate hidden chromatin_states from accumulated observational_data such a method is the focus of this study there are several computational_methods for characterizing hidden chromatin_states from observed experimental chromatin_marks see also supplementary section s for a review a pioneering and popular tool for one method of characterization is chromhmm which binarizes each chromatin mark with respect to base_pair bp intervals in genomes and then models the binarized data by using multivariate hidden_markov hmms whose hidden_states correspond to chromatin_states the size of interval can be changed in chromhmm because the conventional learning algorithm for hmms i e the baumwelch algorithm does not determine the model structure e g the number of chromatin_states chromhmm employs bayesian information criteria bic to estimate the variety of chromatin_states i e the number of distinct states although model_selection procedures frequently use bic quality guarantees with bic are available only for probabilistic_models that satisfy certain regularity conditions see e g for the details of these regularity conditions unfortunately hmms do not typically satisfy these conditions and so the model_selection by chromhmm is not mathematically well founded ernst and kellis has recognized this limitation of bic and primarily relied on intuition and biological interpretations to determine chromatin_states it is however important to develop unbiased methods of characterizing chromatin_states to ensure that overly optimistic conclusions are not being reached in this study we propose a new method for automatically estimating the variety of chromatin_states and simultaneously characterizing each state this method is based on a recently_proposed model_selection method that uses so_called factorized information criteria fic for selection it has been shown that the use of fic is more appropriate than the use of bic for selection in non regular models including hmms which are used in chromhmm as an additional benefit fic includes only two adjustable_parameters and avoids heuristic procedures as much as possible when learning the underlying model structures model_selection by fic is therefore expected to obtain a more nearly unbiased chromatin_state model than other approaches obtain to confirm this expectation we carried_out extensive computational_experiments on both simulated_and and the results indicate the usefulness of the proposed method the article is organized as follows in section we describe the theory and methods used in this study in section we describe computational_experiments on both simulated_and additional results from testing with both simulated_and are shown in the supplementary_information si the recent advent of ngs_technologies and related technologies seq including chip_seq rna_seq faire seq etc has allowed chromatin_states with emission probability profiles a as estimated by fic hmm and in combination with enrichments by external genomic_features for the ernst real_dataset supplementary section s b general genomic functions supplementary section s in the si including tsss tess and utrs c tfbss supplementary section s in the si such as c_myc gabp and rela and d repeated elements supplementary section s in the si such as alu sine l and l in all images the numbers along the vertical_axis are chromatin_states in each of the subfigures b d the enrichment of a chromatin_state with respect to a corresponding genomic_features is shown where we estimate the chromatin_states of each interval location in the genomes by using the viterbi algorithm warmer colors show higher degrees of enrichment as in learning chromatin_states with ficrapid gathering of a huge amount of omics_data about topics including genomes epigenomes variomes transcriptomes and interactomes this has hastened a shift in biology research from hypothesis based_approaches to data_driven approaches in this study we aim to contribute to data_driven biology by clarifying the biological model behind data about chromatin_states in the field of bioinformatics biological data are often modeled by probabilistic_models in which the probability_distribution p x h of a characteristic x parameterized with h examples of such models are hmms paired hmms for sequence_alignments stochastic_context for rna_secondary neural_networks and mixture_models to learn not only the parameters but also the model structures of probabilistic_models is important in data_driven biology it is known that many probabilistic_models including hmms do not satisfy the regularity conditions necessary for certain performance guarantees hence there is no mathematical justification for even some frequently used model selection_criteria such as aic bic and mdl with these models broadly models that include hidden latent structures rarely satisfy regularity conditions in this study we therefore applied fic to learning models of chromatin_states by using hmms it is noted that in this study a multivariate hmms were taken from a previous study and we focus mainly on model_selection part of the hmm developing techniques that use fic for and learning other types of probabilistic_models will be useful and should be pursued in the future some other approaches are suitable for model_selection on nonregular models including hmms for example waic and wbic are extensions of aic and bic respectively to non regular models variational bayes and non parametric bayesian approaches based on dirichlet models also enable us to simultaneously learn model structures and parameters in this article we used fic because fic is applicable to non regular models and not computationally burdensome because the algorithm is similar to the conventional baumwelch algorithm for training hmms but an application of alternative_approaches to the problem addressed in this article would be interesting in this article we compared learning of chromatin_states by fichmm with learning by bic hmm and chromhmm and suggested that fic hmms are more appropriate for both theoretical and practical reasons it should be remarked that our method fic hmm includes only two parameters which is expected to lead to unbiased learning of chromatin_states we consider that a method that relies little on heuristics is preferable for model_selection we observed that several differences between models learned by fic hmm and those learned by chromhmm for three real_datasets we suspect that previous_studies such as favor a smaller number of chromatin_states because a larger number of states complicate understanding we confirmed the larger number of chromatin_states estimated by fic hmm are useful for predicting promoters and or enhancers we used binarized emission values or for each chromatin mark in this study as was done in a previous study it might be useful to directly model the continuous values of observed chromatin_marks instead of using binarized values from a theoretical viewpoint fic hmm could be applied to continuous emission values by using certain probabilistic_models e g gaussian_distribution although the number of parameters would be increased learning them would be more difficult in particular poor but locally optimal solutions would be more likely than with binarized chromatin_marks in section we reported that similar chromatin_state models were learned by fic hmm for each of the cell_types in ernst real nine cell_types and hoffman real six cell_types however if we investigate those results in detailed the celltype specific annotated chromatin_states e g a genomic_region in some specific_cell may be completely differ from in others can be found and further study of this would be a worthwhile biological investigation in this study we proposed a novel method to learn the latent chromatin_states from observed chromatin_marks by using fic hmm our method is more theoretically suitable for this purpose than existing_approaches such as bic hmm which has been adopted by the chromhmm program learning with fic hmm is expected to provide unbiased chromatin_states model from the observed chromatin_marks comprehensive computational_experiments on simulated_and indicated that fic hmm could successfully recover the model of hidden chromatin_states because model learning methods are important for data_driven biology with necessitates analyzing a huge amount of accumulated biological data a similar approach will be useful to other problems in the field of bioinformatics
