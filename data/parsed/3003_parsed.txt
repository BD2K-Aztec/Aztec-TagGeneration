mirsynergy detecting synergistic mirna regulatory_modules by overlapping neighbourhood expansion motivation identification of microrna regulatory_modules mirms will aid deciphering aberrant transcriptional_regulatory in cancer but is computationally_challenging existing_methods are sto chastic or require a fixed number of regulatory_modules results we propose mirsynergy an efficient deterministic overlapping clustering_algorithm adapted from a recently_developed framework mirsynergy operates in two stages it first forms mirms based on co occurring microrna mirna_targets and then expands each mirm by greedily including excluding mrnas into from the mirm to maximize the synergy score which is a function of mirnamrna and genegene_interactions using expression data for ovarian breast and thyroid_cancer from the cancer_genome we compared mirsynergy with internal controls and existing_methods mirsynergy mirms exhibit significantly_higher functional enrichment and more coherent mirnamrna expression anti correlation based on kaplanmeier survival analysis we proposed several prognostically promising mirms and envisioned their utility in cancer research availability_and mirsynergy is implemented available as an r bioconductor_package at www cs utoronto ca yueli mirsynergy html contact micrornas mirnas are nt small non coding rna that base_pair with mrnas primarily at the untranslated_region utr to cause mrna_degradation or translational_repression aberrant mirna_expression is implicated in tumourigenesis based on mirbase release the human genome_encodes precursor mature_mirnas which potentially target majority of the human genes although targets of individual mirnas are significantly_enriched for certain biological_processes it is also likely that multiple_mirnas are coordinated together to synergistically regulate one or more pathways despite their limited number mirnas may be in charge of more evolutionarily robust and potent regulatory_effects through coordinated collective actions the hypothesis of mirna synergism is also parsimonious or biologically_plausible because the number of possible combinations of the human mirnas is extremely_large to potentially react to virtually countless environmental changes intuitively if a group of mirna workers perform similar tasks together then removing a single worker will not be as detrimental as assigning each worker a unique task several related methods have been developed to study mirna synergism some early methods were based on pairwise overlaps or score specific correlation between predicted target_sites of any given two co expressed mirnas for instance devised an overlapping scoring_scheme to account for differential utr lengths of the mirna_targets which may otherwise bias the results if standard hypergeometric_test was used methods beyond pairwise overlaps have also been described these methods consider not only the sequence_based mirna target_site information but also the respective mirnamrna expression correlation mimec across various conditions to detect mirna regulatory_modules mirms briefly developed a probabilistic search_procedure to separately sample from the mrna and mirna pools candidate module members with probabilities proportional to their overall frequency of being chosen as the fittest which is determined by their target_sites and mimec relative to the counterparts the algorithm finds only a single best mirm which varies depending on the initial mrna and mirna set used a maximal bi clique enumeration mbe technique to discover complete bipartite subgraphs where every mirna is connected with every mrna the approach operates on unweighted edges only which requires discretizing mimec moreover maximal bi clique does not necessarily imply functional mirms and vice_versa le anddeveloped groupmir to form mirms by assigning each mirna or mrna m mirna one or more memberships to whom correspondence should be addressed recent works on mirna dysregulation prove useful in cancer research to identify condition specific networks however most existing_methods exploited only the curated pathways or go terms methods for de_novo network_reconstruction in some recent literatures operate only on interactions involving differentially_expressed deg or differentially_expressed mirna because the corresponding solutions quickly become intractable with increasing number of m mirnas however the deg m driven approaches cannot capture subnetworks with accumulative changes of m mirna that have been filtered out either by individual hypothesis testings or by multiple testing corrections in this article we introduce mirsynergy as a reasonable alternative approach notably standard clustering_methods such as k means or hierarchical_clustering are not suitable for constructing mirms as these methods assign each data point to a unique b awere plotted as a cdf for internal nodes mirsynergy solid and boundary nodes snmnmf outputs dash we observe a significantly more negative mimec distribution for the internal nodes or mirsynergy mirms as their curves are clearly located on the left of the curves from the counterparts p values were computed by one sided ks test cluster a recently_developed greedy based clustering method clusterone is more realistic because it allows overlap between clusters however clusterone was developed with physical ppi in mind mirsynergy extends from clusterone to detecting mirms the novelty of our approach resides in a two stage clustering strategy with each stage maximizing a synergy score as a function of either the mirnamirna synergistic co regulation or mirnamrna gene_gene several methods have incorporated ggi as ppi tfbs in predicting mirms which proved to be a more accurate approach than using mirna mrna alone comparing with recent methods such as snmnmf and pimim le and however an advantage of our deterministic formalism is the automatic determination of module number given the predefined thresholds to merge and filter low quality clusters and efficient computation with theoretical bound reduced from o k t n m per iteration to only o m n m for n m mrnas mirnas across t samples because n is usually much larger than m and t our algorithm runs orders of faster based on our tests on a linux server mirsynergy took about h including the run time for lasso to compute ov n m t brca or thca n m t or respectively whereas snmnmf took more than a day for each dataset more importantly mirsynergy mirms are significantly more functionally enriched coherently expressed and thus more likely to be biologically functional the success of our model is likely attributable to its ability to explicitly leverage two types of information at each clustering stage i the mirnamirna synergism based on the correlation of the inferred mirna_target score profiles from mmiw matrix ii the combinatorial mirna regulatory_effects on existing genetic network implicated in the combined mmiw and ggiw matrices we also explored other model formulations such as clustering m mirnas in a single clustering stage or using different mmiw matrices other than the one produced from lasso which tends to produce mirms each containing only one or a few mirnas or several large low quality mirms which were then filtered out by the density threshold in either clustering stage notably an mirm containing only a single mirna can be directly derived from the mmiw without any clustering approach moreover mirsynergy considers only neighbour nodes with non zero edges thus our model works the best on a sparse mmiw matrix such as the outputs from lasso which is the best performing expression based_methods based on our comparison with other alternatives nonetheless the performance of mirsynergy is sensitive to the quality of mmiw and ggiw in this regard other mmiw or ggiw matrices generated from improved methods can be easily incorporated into mirsynergy as the function parameters by the users of the bioconductor_package please refer to the package vignette for more details in conclusion with large amount of m mirna_expression data becoming available we believe that mirsynergy will serve as a powerful_tool for analysing condition specific mirna_regulatory
