understanding the fabric of protein crystals computational classification of biological interfaces and crystal contacts modern structural_biology still draws the vast_majority of information from crystallography a technique where the objects being investigated are embedded in a crystal_lattice given the complexity and variety of those objects it becomes fundamental to computationally assess which of the interfaces in the lattice are biologically_relevant and which are simply crystal contacts since the mid s several approaches have been applied to obtain high_accuracy classification of crystal contacts and biological proteinprotein_interfaces this review provides an overview of the concepts and main approaches to protein interface classification thermodynamic estimation of interface stability evolutionary approaches based on conservation of interface residues and co occurrence of the interface across different crystal forms among the three categories evolutionary approaches offer the strongest promise for improvement thanks to the incessant growth in sequence knowledge importantly protein interface classification algorithms can also be used on multimeric structures obtained using other high_resolution techniques or for protein assembly design or validation purposes a key issue linked to protein interface classification is the identification of the biological assembly of a crystal_structure and the analysis of its symmetry here we highlight the most important concepts and problems to be overcome in assembly prediction over the next few years tools and concepts of interface classification will probably become more frequently used and integrated in several areas of structural_biology and structural_bioinformatics among the main challenges for the future are better addressing of weak interfaces and the application of interface classification concepts to prediction_problems like proteinprotein_docking contemporary structural_biology is a mature yet dynamic field where well established techniques like protein_crystallography and nuclear_magnetic coexist and cross fertilize with emerging or re emerging ones such as electron_diffraction or single_particle electron_cryomicroscopy thanks to advances in detectors and software this latter technique has broken resolution barriers that were once thought unassailable the bulk of biomacromolecular structural_information however still comes from protein_crystallography which accounts for of the entries in the protein_data pdb as of june a key feature of the crystal_structure of biomacromolecules is that the molecules are embedded in a crystal_lattice containing several non biological interfaces called crystal_packing contacts or briefly crystal contacts which are often indistinguishable by crystallographic means from any biological interface the protein may possess with the increasing complexity of biomacromolecular structures the interface problemcorrectly classifying all contacts in a crystal_lattice as biologically_relevant or crystal contacthas become more frequent and important starting in the mid s several computational_approaches based on a variety of concepts have been developed to tackle this interface classification_problem the number and diversity of the scientific contributions in this area are now large enough to constitute a recognized topic in structural_biology and structural_bioinformatics this review aims to provide an overview of the protein interface classification_problem as well as a historical_perspective of the research in this area of its applications and of the main perspectives and challenges for the future
