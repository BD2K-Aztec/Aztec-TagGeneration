systems_biology derivative processes for modelling metabolic_fluxes motivation one of the challenging questions in modelling biological_systems is to characterize the functional_forms of the processes that control and orchestrate molecular and cellular_phenotypes recently_proposed methods for the analysis of metabolic_pathways for example dynamic flux estimation can only provide estimates of the underlying fluxes at discrete time points but fail to capture the complete temporal behaviour to describe the dynamic variation of the fluxes we additionally require the assumption of specific functional_forms that can capture the temporal behaviour however it also remains_unclear how to address the noise which might be present in experimentally_measured metabolite_concentrations results here we propose a novel approach to modelling metabolic_fluxes derivative processes that are based on multiple output gaussian processes mgps which are a flexible non parametric bayesian modelling technique the main advantages that follow from mgps approach include the natural non parametric representation of the fluxes and ability to impute the missing_data in between the measurements our derivative process approach allows us to model changes in metabolite derivative concentrations and to characterize the temporal behaviour of metabolic_fluxes from time course data because the derivative of a gaussian_process is itself a gaussian_process we can readily link metabolite_concentrations to metabolic_fluxes and vice_versa here we discuss how this can be implemented in an mgp framework and illustrate its application to simple models including nitrogen_metabolism in escherichia_coli it is generally impossible to simultaneously measure the abundance of all the molecular_entities making up biological_systems in gene_expression assays for example we typically measure messenger_rna expression but not the activity of transcription_factors and or the occupancy of transcription_factor similarly in metabolomic analyses key metabolites can be measured using e g mass_spectrometry or nuclear_magnetic quantification but it is rarely possible to comprehensively quantify the metabolites even within a single pathway typically more interesting than metabolite and enzyme abundance are the fluxes through biochemical_reactions and metabolic_networks fluxes m t correspond to the rates at which molecules x x x n t are turned over by the m reactions regulation of fluxes in light of changes in environmental and physiological_conditions is also intimately_linked to cellular_physiology although the fluxes are of central concern they are hard to measure directly estimates for intracellular fluxes can be obtained by tracking products from isotope labeled c and n metabolic_flux metabolites through the metabolic_network however such an approach is restricted to a metabolically steady_state analysis and is not appropriate for capturing dynamical flux variations instead theoretical_analysis has often progressed by assuming stationarity of the metabolic_processes which in turn allows for characterizing the sets of steady_state fluxes under a set of suitable assumptions flux_balance is the most popular example of this strategy but it becomes questionable once the steady_state assumption can no longer be upheld furthermore as more data on enzyme abundance become available we should attempt to include such information and the impact on metabolic_processes here we provide a new framework that allows us to model metabolic_fluxes and their dynamics and which deals with the missing_data problem in metabolic analysis in a flexible and consistent_manner gaussian processes gp belong to the armoury of nonparametric bayesian_methods and have been widely used to describe dynamical processes and to infer hidden_states e g transcription_factor activities in applications to metabolic modelling parametric approaches can offer potentially incorrect representations of the underlying fluxes the strengths of gp models arise from their non parametric nature which enables us to put priors directly on a function rather than on the parameters of a parametric function with a multiple output gps mgps single gp framework can be extended to handle many outputs enabling us to learn the unknown relationships between metabolic species in turn mgps can be used to infill the sparsely sampled data this means that by using mgps it is possible to impute the missing_data in between the metabolic measurements more efficiently here we develop a more general framework that uses so_called derivative gps which allow us to link to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons
