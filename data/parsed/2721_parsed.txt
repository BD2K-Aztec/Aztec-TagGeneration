data_and linkinpath from sequence to interconnected pathway linkinpath is a pathway mapping and analysis tool that enables users to explore and visualize the list of gene protein_sequences through various flash driven interactive web interfaces including kegg_pathway maps functional composition maps treemaps molecular_interaction reaction_networks and pathway to pathway networks users can submit single or multiple datasets of gene protein_sequences to linkinpath to i determine the co occurrence and co absence of genes proteins on animated kegg_pathway maps ii compare functional compositions within and among the datasets using treemaps iii analyze the statistically enriched pathways across the datasets iv build the pathway to pathway networks for each dataset v explore_potential interaction reaction paths between pathways and vi identify common pathway to pathway networks across the datasets availability linkinpath is freely_available to all interested users atpathways are functional_units resulted from the interplay of interacting genes rnas proteins and small_molecules mapping genes or proteins into the context of pathways can help gain more insights into their functions and interactions in an organism although sequence_similarity based_methods e g ncbi_blast have been commonly used for identification of pathways to genes proteins based on their orthologous_genes proteins annotated in the well characterized pathways these methods have limitations such that some best hits such as those annotated as hypothetical or unknown genes proteins may not necessarily be annotated in any pathway the incorporation of additional data such as proteinprotein_interactions and enzymatic_reactions can help infer the pathways and their interconnection and uncover the biological_function of genes proteins however the information regarding the connections between pathways through molecular_interactions and reactions are not included and adequately represented to support the exploratory_analysis in most pathway mapping tools reviewed in for example genmapp pathway explorer and pathway projector to overcome to whom correspondence should be addressed these limitations a web based_interactive tool so_called linkinpath was developed to analyze map and visualize the gene protein lists in the context of interconnected pathways which provides a valuable resource for not only comprehensive studies of genegene_interaction but also functional_genomics in virtually all organisms linkinpath is a web_based that was applied the state of the art visualization_techniques for original aspects of pathway mapping and analyses its novel contributions such as functional composition using treemaps pathway to pathway interconnections and the global metabolic map with highlighting mechanisms add value over comparable existing_tools
