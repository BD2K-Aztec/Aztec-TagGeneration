systems_biology single assay wide variance experimental save design for high_throughput motivation advantages of statistical_testing of high_throughput include p values which provide objective benchmarks of compound activity and false_discovery estimation the cost of replication required for statistical_testing however may often be prohibitive we introduce the single assay wide variance experimental save design whereby a small replicated subset of an entire screen is used to derive empirical_bayes random error estimates which are applied to the remaining majority of unreplicated measurements results the save design is able to generate p values comparable with those generated with full replication data it performs almost as well as the random variance model t test with duplicate data and outperforms the commonly used z scores with unreplicated data and the standard t test we illustrate the approach with simulated_data and with experimental small_molecule and small_interfering screens the save design provides substantial performance_improvements over unreplicated screens with only slight increases in cost high_throughput hts provides concurrent testing of large_libraries for detecting biological_activity among large_numbers of compounds for ease of exposition we refer throughout to compounds although the points made apply to other screened objects such as small_interfering sirnas advances in combinatorial_chemistry robotic processing and plate miniaturization have dramatically_increased throughput large screens of one million_compounds or more termed ultra hts are increasingly common in industry this has led to pressure to reduce costs associated with the increased volume of screens techniques that can maintain performance in identifying rare biological_events while reducing costs are invaluable in the drug_discovery replicated screens which allow for statistical_testing of biological_activity are becoming more common http nsrb med harvard edu downloads nsrb newscreener pdf statistical_testing offers numerous advantages for detecting active_compounds relative to ranking or using biologically_motivated thresholds neither of which takes compound variability into account with statistical_testing estimates of uncertainty can be associated with activity measurements power analyses can be performed to determine cost_effective number of replicates for future screens false_discovery procedures can guide decisions for selecting compounds for follow_up screen validation obtaining replicates can be prohibitively_expensive however particularly for ultra hts one way to reduce costs is to use shrinkage statistical_tests that combine individual compound variances obtained from replicates with a screen wide estimate of the variance developed specifically for studies with few replicates these methods produce more accurate and more precise variance estimates for statistical_testing than do classical_methods such as the t test the random variance model rvm for example has been shown to be substantially superior to the standard t test and has been successfully_applied to hts_data although the rvm test performs well with as few as two replicates cost considerations may argue against obtaining even this minimal level of replication for an entire screen we introduce the single assay wide variance experimental save design as a means of generating an rvm error estimate that is based on a small replicated subset of a screen which can be applied to the remaining majority of unreplicated measurements we show that save produces p value distributions and rank order_statistics comparable with fully replicated screens for both simulated and experimental_data save also outperforms the popular z_score and standard one sample t test finally we provide guidelines for determining the number of compounds and replicates required to produce error estimates for use within the save design to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comstatistical testing and concomitant p values provide an objective way to benchmark false_positive in hts assays the save method can be used to generate p values that are comparable with those generated with full replication providing a reasonable alternative when the latter is not possible due to cost considerations replication that captures the true variability of the assay rather than only technical variation is the preferred approach e g by replicating sample_preparation and by randomly assigning replicated compounds to different well locations across plates this approach to the minimal replication required of the save design would improve generalizability of results and their validation as with other statistical_approaches save results are best when data are adequately normalized which is often not the case with frequently used methods such as the z_score or normalized percent inhibition activation as a consequence of not correcting for spatial biases within plates compound activity with data normalized by these latter methods will appear higher or lower than the true_biological signal depending on where the compound is located on a plate an additional problem of using z scores for purposes of generatingp values is the incorrect assumption that all compounds share a common population variance the incorrectness of the p values associated with z scores can be readily observed by their deviations from a uniform_distribution for inactive molecules this graphical approach can be used to assess saves appropriateness for datasets and normalization_methods not addressed in our study when used with primary screen data of mostly inactive compounds p values should be approximately uniformly_distributed in all but the lower p value range we demonstrated that spawn normalization provides good results in line with statistical expectation other methods that similarly correct for spatial bias such as the r score may also be considered the standard t test has been widely criticized for use with high_throughput studies because of its low power and poor random error estimation when applied to screens with few replicates we showed that save error estimates provided by partial replication are superior to full replication t test estimates this superiority is reflected in part by the typically larger degrees_of associated with the save method standard t tests with n provide only one degree of freedom df whereas the save t test provides a dfs shape parameter_values a of through are common in the two empirical datasets we examined for example a was providing dfs for the statistical_test thus by using the assay wide variance as the random error estimate rather than the individual feature compound error estimates of the standard t test save provides greater statistical_power that comes with more dfs while avoiding the unrealistically small denominator problem of the t test observed in highthroughput data obtaining accurate and precise shape estimates is crucial to the success of the save approach because it is the critical variable in estimating the prior variance distribution and because it defines the degrees_of used in generating p values in general save shape estimates improve with increasing numbers of plates and replicates but the overall number of plates required is small relative to the number of plates in a typical screen in particular for ultrahts screens for which the save design is most useful finally although save was created for and tested with hts assays the method is readily transferrable to other types of high_throughput assays whose variances are distributed according to an inverse
