structural_bioinformatics predicting pseudoknotted structures across two rna_sequences motivation laboratory rna structure_determination is demanding and costly and thus computational structure_prediction is an important task single_sequence methods for rna_secondary are limited by the accuracy of the underlying folding model if a structure is supported by a family of evolutionarily_related sequences one can be more confident that the prediction is accurate rna pseu doknots are functional_elements which have highly_conserved structures however few comparative structure_prediction can handle pseudoknots due to the computational_complexity results a comparative pseudoknot prediction method called dotknot pw is introduced based on structural_comparison of secondary_structure and h type pseudoknot candidates dotknot pw outperforms other methods from the literature on a hand curated test_set of rna_structures with experimental support availability dotknot pw and the rna_structure test_set are available at the web_site dotknot macromolecules such as dna rna and proteins have the ability to form diverse tertiary_structures which enable functionality and thus life for many decades proteins were deemed the global players in the cell until rna entered the spotlight for example rna_structures have been found to be catalytically_active which was assumed to be the privilege of proteins furthermore small_rnas are known to regulate_gene and rna_viruses employ a plethora of structure elements to invade the host_cell to gain insight into macromolecule function one must investigate the structure the first step in rna_folding is stable base_pairing that leads to a secondary_structure as rna_structure formation is of hierarchical nature secondary_structure is the basis for the tertiary fold that produces the functional structure especially for rnas structure_determination by experimental means is an intricate and expensive task computational rna_structure is therefore an invaluable tool for biologists comparative structure_prediction is considered the most reliable approach for computational rna_structure single_sequence structure_prediction is always limited by the accuracy of the underlying folding model three main streams have been identified for comparative rna_secondary i predict a structure from a pre_computed sequence_alignment ii simultaneously compute an alignment and a structure and iii alignment_free tools for multiple_sequence such as clustalw are readily available and thus structure_prediction from an alignment is a tempting approach e g rnaalifold such methods heavily depend on the sequence_conservation and quality of the underlying alignment however ncrnas are conserved rather on the structure level than on the sequence level the gold_standard of rna comparative structure_prediction is the sankoff approach as it does not rely on a high_quality sequence_alignment and captures the structural conservation of ncrnas introduced a theoretical dynamic_programming for simultaneous folding and aligning for a set of n sequences that takes o n n time and o n n space practical variants have been derived which more or less retain the sankoff principle by sacrificing optimality alignment_free aim to avoid the pragmatic restrictions made in a practical sankoff approach as well as the reliance on a high_quality alignment e g carnac note that all of these comparative structure_prediction exclude the prediction of rna pseudoknots rna pseudoknots are crossing structure elements with diverse functions the principle of pseudoknot formation is that bases within a loop region pair with complementary unpaired bases outside the loop from an algorithmic point_of even the simplest type of pseudoknot adds considerable computational_demands due to crossing base_pairs in fact the majority of comparative rna_structure prediction_methods exclude pseudoknots biologists have delivered a wealth of studies which show that pseudoknots have an astonishing number of diverse functions and occur in most classes of rna rna_viruses use pseudoknots for hijacking the replication apparatus of the host a limited number of rna comparative structure_prediction can handle pseudoknots due to the computational_complexity several of these methods take a sequence_alignment as an input ilm is an algorithm that takes as an input either individual sequences or a sequence_alignment a base_pair score matrix is prepared initially and helices are added to the structure in an iterative fashion in the approach hxmatch a maximum weighted matching algorithm with combined thermodynamic and covariance scores is used this program gives the option to be combined with rnaalifold to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work knetfold is a machine_learning which takes a sequence_alignment as an input and outputs a consensus structure allowing pseudoknots simulfold takes an alignment as an input and simultaneously calculates a structure including pseudoknots a multiple_sequence and an evolutionary tree by sampling from the joint posterior distributions tfold combines stem stability covariation and conservation to search for compatible stems and subsequently for pseudoknots for a set of aligned homologous_sequences several comparative structure_prediction including pseudoknots do not rely on an initial sequence_alignment the graph theoretical_approach comrna computes stem similarity_scores and uses a maximum clique finding algorithm to find pseudoknotted structures scarna performs pairwise_structural of stem fragments with fixed lengths derived from the probability dot plot in the following a novel comparative_approach for predicting structures including h type pseudoknots called dotknot pw will be introduced the input consists of two unaligned evolutionarily_related rna_sequences similarity_scores between structure elements will be calculated statistically_significant pairs will be used to find the set of conserved_structure elements common to two sequences which maximize a combined thermodynamic and similarity_score using a hand curated test_set of pseudoknotted structures with experimental support the prediction_accuracy of dotknot pw will be compared with methods from the literature many pseudoknot prediction programs have been evaluated using all the entries in the pseudobase database van there are several caveats in this approach first the sequences given in pseudobase are those which exactly harbor the pseudoknot however in practice structure prediction_algorithms will be applied to longer_sequences without prior_knowledge of the pseudoknot location second long_range pseudoknot entries appear in a truncated version in the database third some classes of pseudoknots have a large number of entries such as short h type pseudoknots in the untranslated_regions of plant viruses whereas more complex types of pseudoknots only have one representative such as long_range rrna pseudoknots therefore a hand curated dataset of pseudoknot structures will be used here when it comes to pseudoknots many structures have been published based on a secondary_structure predicted by free_energy these predicted secondary_structures are used as a working_model and refined using experimental_techniques such as chemical and enzymatic probing however the native_structure remains unsolved unless tertiary structure_determination methods such as x_ray are used testing structures that are based on computer predictions with no experimental support creates a bias in the benchmark and will be avoided in this evaluation a total of pseudoknotted reference structures from different rna types were collected which have strong experimental support for each reference structure a supporting set of evolutionarily_related sequences was obtained from the rfam database note that for the vast_majority of supporting sequences no experimentally_determined structures are available the average pairwise sequence_identities vary from to given a reference structure the performance of prediction_algorithms is evaluated in terms of sensitivity s i e the percentage of base_pairs in the reference structure which are predicted correctly as well as positive_predictive ppv i e the percentage of predicted pairs which are in the reference structure the matthews correlation_coefficient mcc is also reported and is in the range from to where corresponds to a perfect prediction and to a prediction that is in total disagreement with the reference structure the performance of each method for predicting the reference structure was evaluated as described in gardner and giegerich dotknot pw was compared with methods that are freely_available and use standard input and output_formats the comparative_methods are carnac tfold and hxmatch with thea option using rnaalifold all of these methods return structure predictions for only the reference structure with regards to the support set of evolutionarily_related sequences tfold and hxmatch take a sequence_alignment as the input clustalw with the default_parameters was used to produce the initial sequence_alignment dotknot pw and carnac take a set of unaligned sequences as the input furthermore prediction results for the reference_sequence not the supporting sequences were obtained from the single_sequence methods dotknot probknot ipknot and rnafold note that all methods except carnac and rnafold allow pseudoknot prediction the results are shown in dotknot pw has the highest_average mcc of for the test sequences for each reference structure with the support sequences from the corresponding rfam family predictions are returned ordered by the combined free_energy and similarity_score if only thepairwise prediction with highest combined free_energy and similarity_score is taken dotknot pw has an improved average mcc of tfold and hxmatch have average mcc of and respectively carnac has average mcc of with much higher average specificity than sensitivity the prediction results for single_sequence structure_prediction for each of the reference_sequences with experimentally_determined structures are also shown in note that this does not include the prediction for the support sequences from rfam as no experimentally_determined structures are available all single_sequence pseudoknot prediction_methods show improved results over using rnafold dotknot has the highest_average mcc of followed by ipknot and probknot as an example consider the s mrna pseudoknot that binds to specific proteins in the autoregulation mechanism of ribosomal_protein s synthesis for the reference_sequence s and support sequences from the corresponding rfam family dotknot pw returns pairwise predictions ordered by the combined free_energy and similarity_score the top two pairwise predictions with the highest_scores are shown in we presented dotknot pw for prediction of structures common to two rna_sequences including h type pseudoknots both dotknot and dotknot pw have been designed as dedicated pseudoknot prediction_tools in the following important aspects of pseudoknot prediction will be discussed
