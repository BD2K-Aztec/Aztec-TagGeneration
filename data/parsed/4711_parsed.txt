towards the knowledge based design of universal influenza epitope ensemble vaccines motivation influenza a viral heterogeneity remains a significant threat due to unpredictable anti genic drift in seasonal_influenza and antigenic shifts caused by the emergence of novel subtypes vaccines are the most efficacious and efficient medical_intervention known while vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated whole microbes or single protein subunits have proved widely useful vaccines based on ensembles of epitopes remain underexploited we have recently_developed a powerful new approach to the design of epitope ensemble vaccines combining available experimental_data with informatics based immunological predictions this approach now begins to gain a gratifyingly widening acceptance as a vaccine_design tool influenza is an infectious acute_respiratory caused by single negative_strand viruses of the family orthomyxoviridae within which three generainfluenzavirus a influenzavirus b and influenzavirus ccontain viral_strains corresponding to influenza types a b and c respectively ictv http ictvonline org virustaxonomy asp treatment when necessary includes antivirals to relieve symptoms and reduce_complications however prevention through vaccination is currently the most effective strategy to combat influenza_viruses only influenza a has both seasonal epidemic and pandemic capability and is classified into subtypes according to its hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na surface glycoprotein antigens influenza a caused the asian and hong_kong flu pandemics which all led to global_mortality in the millions as well as the milder pandemic pandemic strains from both h n and h n continue to circulate as seasonal_influenza maintained by antigenic_drift where mutations occur on the antigenic binding_sites of na and ha however pandemic strains arise through antigenic shifts where a new subtype emerges via gene re assortment after distinct influenza_viruses co infect an intermediate_host seasonal flu vaccines are mediated by antibody_responses against na and ha proteins which unfortunately are highly_variable the large_numbers of annual deaths continues to raise serious questions about the effectiveness of current_vaccines and vaccination strategies world_health http www who int csr don en formulating a universal vaccine where multiple strains are targeted to induce so_called heterosubtypic immunity hsi may prove more effective in combating novel strains before they can go on to cause pandemics studies in animal_models have suggested that generating cellular_immunity via t cell responses may induce broad cross_reactive protection that current_vaccines apparently lack t cells target exposed and non exposed proteins that are processed and presented by human_leukocyte hlas there are two main types of t cells cytotoxic cd t cell lymphocytes ctls and cd ctls recognize antigens presented by hla_class hla i molecules while cd t cell recognize antigens presented by hla_class hla ii molecules the role of ctl in cellular_immunity includes the direct clearance of virally infected_cells and the indirect recruitment of other immune_cells via chemokine and cytokine_secretion cd t cells primary roles include b cell stimulation leading to specific antigen antibody_production as well as stimulating cd proliferation and memory responses cd t cells also mediate direct and indirect viral_clearance and symptom_severity reduction in secondary_infection many targets for influenza vaccine_development have been investigated including those inducing t cell and or b cell responses e g the highly_conserved stalk domain of ha termed ha other evidence has implicated nucleoprotein np and matrix m as vaccine_targets capable of inducing cross_protection via enhanced t cell activation another potential vaccine target is influenza matrix protein m e initially this seemed highly_conserved and induced broadly acting antibodies however over variants of m e were later identified in newly_emerging influenza a strains raising questions over its usefulness as a universal vaccine nevertheless regions of m e may still be useful for inducing broadly acting protection conserved targets would be useful in formulating a universal vaccine as they would cover multiple viral subtypes such universal vaccine_design can potentially be addressed by a t cell epitope ensemble vaccine comprising short highly_conserved immunogenic peptides from influenza able to activate t cells some epitope_based influenza_vaccines are already in clinical_trials one multimeric which consists of a single recombinant_protein composed of b and t cell epitopes is seen to induce both cellular and humoral_immunity although such trials have been small they are promising inducing cross protective_immunity without severe side_effects we address here the design of epitope ensemble vaccines that have wide coverage of the human population in terms of hla binding and wide coverage of different viral subtypes such an approach draws strong support from both theoretical_studies and from a wealth of recent experimentally_verified vaccines developed with concordant goals including inter_alia filoviruses hiv dengue_virus survivin and metapneumovirus in what follows we expand on an emerging paradigm within rational vaccine_design to include class_ii epitopes and identify multiple conserved influenza a t cell epitopes that together comprise putative non seasonal flu vaccines we collected from the iedb cd and cd t cell influenza a specific epitopes of length residues known to be targeted during natural_infection we also collected influenza a proteins and clustered them using blastclust and cd_hit details in material and methods obtaining two different cluster sets and two different sets of conserved_regions one from blastclust and the other from cd_hit we used these conserved_regions to identify matching conserved t cell epitopes first we examined cd t cell epitopes identifying conserved epitopes common to both sets of conserved_regions additionally two extra epitopes were identified in the blastclust set gilgfvftl irhenrmvl and another two from cd_hit rgindrnfw yintallna episopt was used to select cd t cell epitopes for our usa specific vaccine to reach a ppc a minimum of two epitopes were needed to achieve a ppc at least six epitopes are required episopt identified four different combinations of which two combinations reached a ppc of and the other two we selected set one to define the cd arm of our usa specific ensemble vaccine we collected influenza a cd t cell epitopes from the iedb database and selected conserved cd t cell epitopes by comparing with the conserved_regions identified by blastclust and cd_hit clustering routes were used these conserved epitopes of varying amino_acid length were submitted to iedb the class_ii hla binding prediction_tool many epitopes did not bind to any alleles within the top percentile rank and of those that did only one epitope tgtgytmdtvnrthq was identified by both blastclust and cd_hit three additional epitopes were identified by blastclust kgilgfvftltvpse ilgfvftltvpserg and nplirhenrmvlast and three by cd_hit tyqrtralvrtgmdp mafleeshpgifens and eyimkgvyintalln all epitope hla ii binding_profiles were then entered into the iedb ppc tool for analysis nplirhenrmvlast tgtgytmd tvnrthq tyqrtralvrtgmdp and mafleeshpgifens have class_ii hla binding_profiles that are completely covered by the other three remaining epitopes and therefore they were not considered when calculating ppc with multiple cd t cell epitopes the remaining three cd t cell epitopes gave a combined ppc of the resulting combination of selected cd and cd epitopes form a population weighted potential candidate usa specific multiple epitope ensemble vaccine capable of inducing regionspecific cross_protection against influenza a to derive the equivalent universal vaccine the class i hla binding_profiles of each epitope were predicted using the iedb class i hla binding prediction_tool we then used the iedb ppc tool to estimate ppc values against the world_population rather than the north_american only coverage provided by episopt gmdprmcsl yintallna and irhenrmvl were excluded as they did not bind to any class i hla allele within the top percentile rank excluding those epitopes that gave a ppc of a maximum ppc of was possible with the remaining cd epitopes this was different result to episopt v where just epitopes gave a ppc this reflects the lesser diversity within the north_america population compared to the worlduniversal influenza vaccinespopulation as a whole epitopes which gave an individual ppc using the iedb ppc tool were considered and together reached a ppc value of these constituted the cd component of our universal influenza_vaccine the selected cd and cd epitopes were combined together to calculate a ppc against both class i hla and class_ii hla_alleles against the worlds population using the iedb ppc tool a total ppc of was achieved the selected t cell epitopes form a population weighted potential multiple epitope ensemble vaccine able to induce broad global cross_protection against influenza a lists the cd and cd epitopes comprising our global vaccine together with origin individual ppc and hla_class allelic binding restriction we have intentionally not specifically targeted subtypes however due to their wide sequence_conservation the identified epitopes are well represented across most major_subtypes apart from subtypes of influenza a unique to bats there are haemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes transmissible to humans making possible hn combinations of which have been observed in the wild as indicated by the presence of at least one designated sequence in the influenza_virus resource as of february blasting each of our usa specific vaccine epitopes against orthomyxoviridae taxid sequences within the non redundant ncbi protein database generated sets of identical matches to sequences from distinct hn subtypes ranging in number from hn subtypes gilgfvftl to subtypes svkekdmtk as a whole the usa specific vaccine hassequence matches to a total of distinct hn sub types this indicates that the vaccine has a high coverage of observed influenza subtypes blasting the universal vaccine epitopes against orthomyxoviridae sequences produced identical matches to distinct hn subtypes which ranged in number from kgilgfvftltvpse to fmysdfhfi the universal vaccine matches hn sub types again indicating a high overall coverage of observed subtypes identifying additional highly subtype specific conservation might enhance our putative universal influenza a vaccine further as adding a cocktail of strain specific epitopes may strengthen cross_protection within our putative epitope ensemble no single epitope vaccine would not provide universal protection against heterosubtypic influenza a strains no single peptide vaccines reinforcing the need to examine multiple conserved epitopes individually no single peptide gave a ppc greater however such values were achieved when combining epitopes it is evident from a comparison of episopt and iedb that generated ppc values are method dependent with alternative allele_frequencies and calculation strategies yielding different values nonetheless high consensus values as derived here indicate the value of this approach as a fully validated starting_point for vaccine_design ideally epitopes with a broad allele specificity would be assayed experimentally against wellunderstood alleles representative of class_i supertypes all t cell epitopes included in the final vaccine combination were either part of polymerase acidic protein pa nucleoprotein np matrix protein m or polymerase basic protein pb the large ppc value found for gilgfvftl located on m protein is not surprising as previous_research concluded it was broadly recognized by the population it is known to be immunodominant when restricted by hla a and other evidence suggests degenerate recognition by ctl when restricted by hla c in cellular_immunity immunodominance refers to the observation that while many peptides can be presented by host_cells a larger portion of t cells focus their attention on a very limited number of hla presented peptides such evidence together with our results supports the view that the epitope will be useful in providing broad protection against distinct influenza a strains np has long been considered a viable_option for inducing cross protective ctl in humans and mice many studies have sought to ensure np based_vaccines are immunogenic enough to be cross protective these include priming with dna_vaccines containing np alone or combined with other conserved proteins such as ns and m followed by boosting with recombinant np derived from e coli in animal_models all show promise with cross_reactive t cell responses against influenza a subtypes observed at many levels a vaccine consisting of modified vaccinia_virus ankara vector m and np mva np m has also been tested in clinical_trials involving healthy_adults the mva np m vaccine yields much higher t cell responses compared to other influenza_vaccines as well as being safe in animal_models and human_trials t cell responses were boosted when combined with seasonal vaccination compared to seasonal vaccination alone suggesting seasonal vaccines may still prove a useful component in future universal vaccines alexander et_al b also identified fmysdfhfi fyiqmctel yylekanki gilgfvftl and yshgtgtgy as cd epitopes for use in cross protective vaccines similar to our results each binds extensively within a particular class i hla supertype fmysdfhfi a fyiqmctel a yylekanki a gilgfvftl a and yshgtgtgy a these epitopes were conserved in over of distinct influenza strains and conserved in swine_flu h n strains all these epitopes produce good ctl_responses in donors expressing the relevant class i hla_alleles the similarity of derived epitopes coupled to their high_conservation among a diverse group of influenza a strains suggests such epitopes will prove viable targets for future influenza a epitope vaccine formulations none of these highly_conserved cd or cd t cell epitopes were found in hemagglutinin h or neuraminidase n while it is often assumed wrongly that h or n epitopes are all important thisuniversal influenza vaccinesis not the case with t cell responses while n and h are the key_proteins for antibody_binding cellular_immunity can respond to viral_infection before viral_shedding opening the whole influenza genome to immune_surveillance the absence of n and h epitopes is explained by the low sequence_conservation between different strains due to the highly_variable antigen binding_sites that allow antibody immune_evasion recent_studies immunodominant influenza epitopes are less conserved generally than their subdominant counterparts which is thought to result from immune pressure immunodominant epitopes are likely to give the greatest immune_response some of our epitopes may be subdominant potentially reducing their ability to induce potent immune_responses however immunodominance hierarchies are dynamic and can be altered by vaccination any peptide that is efficiently processed and presented in both target and antigen_presenting are good candidates for vaccines regardless of their immunodominance only subdominance resulting from failures of processing or from poor binding to mhcs would lead to an ineffective vaccine however the epitopes we selected are likely to be processed in vivo as they are known to be targeted during a natural_infection and exhibit high predicted mhc binding while the performance of many class i binding algorithms has recent improved_significantly class_ii predictions remain_poor or inconsistent since class_ii hla have open_ended binding_sites they can bind peptides with a much broader length_distribution than class i the lower_quality performance compared to class i hla prediction increases the likelihood of identifying false_positive cd t cell epitopes in this study cd epitopes were restricted to mer epitopes even though class i hla molecules can present a significant number of peptides of other lengths although most known class i hla specific peptides are mers and class i hla binding predictions of peptides of other lengths are not as reliable many immunogenic cd epitopes of length other than are known for example identified multiple mer influenza a specific cd epitopes future_studies might therefore usefully include epitopes of different lengths the list of epitopes identified here does not in itself constitute the entirety of a deployable vaccine constructing a multiple epitope ensemble vaccine is often problematic as they are seldom sufficiently immunogenic short_peptides suffer from poor immunogenicity and therefore vaccines require additional components to help initiate t cell responses epitopes must be delivered packaged into a stable vaccine formulation epitopes can be delivered as poly epitope peptide s or as part of a viral_vector in either case the order of epitopes and the presence of cleavage_sites etc is crucial have for example addressed how to optimize this process the typical lack of immunogenicity of such constructs is notable and much empirical workincluding optimizing the number and timings of vaccinationis necessary to address this the main way to do this is by addition of adjuvants to the formulation our approach has focused on designing the so_called biological component of a vaccine the part responsiblethrough molecular_recognition eventsfor engendering the specificity of vaccine responses issues will need to be addressed including the synergistic orchestration of both the mechanistic targeting and or co uptake of vaccine_components and the optimal logistics of vaccination protocols such as chosen regimen and the size number and frequency of vaccinations in this regard computational modelling frameworks have much to offer allowing us to predict overall immune system response dynamics and pharmacokinetics that should allow us to optimize memory effects and the dosing of vaccine administration
