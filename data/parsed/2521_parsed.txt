integrative classification and analysis of multiple arraycgh datasets with probe alignment motivation array_comparative arraycgh is widely used to measure dna_copy in cancer research arraycgh data report log_ratio intensities of thousands of probes sampled along the chromosomes typically the choices of the locations and the lengths of the probes vary in different experiments this discrepancy in choosing probes poses a challenge in integrated classification or analysis across multiple arraycgh datasets we propose an alignment based framework to integrate arraycgh samples generated from different probe_sets the alignment framework seeks an optimal alignment between the probe series of one arraycgh sample and the probe series of another sample intended to find the maximum possible overlap of dna copy_number between the two measured chromosomes an alignment kernel is introduced for integrative patient sample classification and a multiple_alignment algorithm is also introduced for identifying common regions with copy_number results the probe alignment kernel and the mpa algorithm were experimented to integrate three bladder_cancer datasets as well as artificial datasets in the experiments by integrating arraycgh samples from multiple datasets the probe alignment kernel used with support_vector significantly_improved patient sample classification_accuracy over other baseline kernels the experiments also demonstrated that the multiple probe alignment mpa algorithm can find common dna aberrations that cannot be identified with the standard interpolation method furthermore the mpa algorithm also identified many known bladder_cancer dna aberrations containing four known bladder cancer_genes three of which cannot be detected by interpolation it has been confirmed in many recent_studies that aberrations in chromosome copy_number rearrangement and structures have association with the disease among these chromosomal_aberrations dna copy_number cnvs the events of amplification or deletion of a large dna_segment on chromosomes are believed to play_an in to whom correspondence should be addressed tumorigenesis chromosome cnvs can be measured by comparative_genomic cgh which compares the copy_number of a differentially labeled case sample with a reference dna from a normal individual arraycgh technology based on dna_microarray can currently allow genome_wide identification of regions with cnvs at different resolutions the arraycgh data was used to discriminate healthy patients from cancer patients and classify patients of different cancer_subtypes thus arraycgh data is considered as a new source of biomarkers that provide_important of candidate cancer loci for the classification of patients and discovery of molecular_mechanisms of cancers arraycgh allows rapid mapping of dna cnvs of a tumor sample by a locus by locus measure in an arraycgh experiment probes short dna_segments on chromosomes of different lengths and locations are chosen for comparative_genomic the cnv information at a probe location is reported by the log_ratio of the probe intensity between a case and a reference the sizes and the number of the probe determines the resolution of an arraycgh experiment the length of the dna_probes used by current platforms ranges from bp to kb and in a typical study the number of probes ranges from several hundreds to tens_of for example a human array chromium surface array can consist of only probes at mb resolution whereas a high_resolution tiling_array provides measurements of probes the large difference in the sizes and numbers of probes makes integration of multiple arraycgh datasets used for similar studies a challenging_problem from a data analysis perspective the arraycgh data are series of real values labeled by their chromosomal positions the traditional approach is an interpolation between the two series of probe locations from two platforms as described in in an interpolation probe locations on one platform are added interpolated to the target platform and the corresponding cnv intensities are guessed by intensities of the most nearby probes in the target platform however when the two platforms have large variations in the number of probes the interpolation is not an appropriate way to integrate the two series of probes specifically when the two series are both sparse the interpolated points might give misleading or wrong information for example in some of the probes are interpolated to locations close to probes with opposite cnv when the probes are sparsely located this might introduce false_positives moreover some of the interpolated probes are far from other probes in these cases i e the interpolated probes marked by in the figure it is ambiguous to decide the cnv for the interpolated new probes a hypothetical example of interpolation and probe alignment interpolation and probe alignment are applied to compare the same two chromosomes the probe locations are marked with vertically striped blocks amplifications or horizontally striped blocks deletions the interpolation interpolates each probe to its corresponding position on the chromosome and add a new probe in the other series the cnv value of the new probe is guessed by checking the neighboring probes in the same series the probe alignment aligns nearby probe pairs in the two series with similar cnvs the matched probe pairs are connected by arrows in the alignment the interpolated probes marked with are possibly wrongly labeled in the interpolation
