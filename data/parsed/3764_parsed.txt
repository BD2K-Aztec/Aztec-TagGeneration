databases_and protf a comprehensive data and phylogenomics resource for prokaryotic transcription_factors investigation of transcription_factors tfs is of extreme significance for gleaning more information about the mechanisms_underlying the dynamic transcriptional_regulatory herein protf is constructed to serve as a comprehensive data resource and phylogenomics analysis platform for prokaryotic tfs it has many prominent characteristics i detailed annotation_information including basic sequence_features domain_organization sequence homolog and sequence_composition was extensively collected and then visually displayed for each tf entry in all prokaryotic_genomes ii workset was employed as the basic frame to provide an efficient way to organize the retrieved data and save intermediate records and iii a number of elaborated tools for phylogenomics analysis were implemented to investigate the evolutionary roles of specific tfs in conclusion protf dedicates to the prokaryotic tfs with integrated multi function which will become a valuable resource for prokaryotic transcriptional_regulatory in the post genomic era identification classification and phylogenomics analysis of transcription_factors tfs within or among specific organisms can help us to highlight how they evolutionarily_conserved or diverse in order to fit in the ever changing environment effectively in the past_decade a number of specialized tf databases were established the transfac and dbd databases were released as a universal data source covering putative tfs for all completely_sequenced and trsdb contains the tfs derived from nine eukaryotic_species within the plant_kingdom progressively integrated and comprehensively annotated biological_databases had to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as been constructed such as planttfdb dptf rartf plantapdb tobfac datfap grassius and plntfdb various information of tfs in animal are abundantly explored by databases such as tfcat tfdb flytf and itfp in addition fungal tfs can be accessed from ftfd up to now however no comprehensive platform for computational repository is available to provide access to the large complete sets of prokaryotic tfs regtransbase is a database of regulatory_interactions in prokaryotes which captures the knowledge in public scientific_literature and contains tfs in the latest_version ootfd is a database aimed at capturing information regarding the polypeptide interactions which comprise and define the properties of tfs with limited species and tf entries extratrain provides integrated and easily_manageable information for extragenic regions and for the genes delimiting each of them for tf it only contains tf families in addition the currently developed aracxyls only holds information about tf family arac in bacteria and the bactregulators contains three tf families tetr arac and iclr in bacteria and archaea dbtbs regulondb tractor db ctfbase and archaeatf only aim to focus on the tfs in bacillus_subtilis escherichia_coli gamma_proteobacteria cyanobacteria and archaea respectively herein a new tf database protf is constructed to provide an integrated useful resource for tfs research and facilitate further investigation of transcriptional_regulatory in prokaryotes in comparison with other comprehensive tf databases protf contains the following prominent characteristics i offered an extensively detailed annotation_information of each tf entry in all the completely_sequenced prokaryotic_genomes ii employed the workset as the basic frame to well organize the retrieved data and save intermediate records and iii implemented a number of phylogenomics analysis tools to investigate the evolutionary roles of specific tfs in or across different prokaryotic organisms in conclusion protf is dedicates to the prokaryotic tfs with multiple integrated phylogenomics function page
