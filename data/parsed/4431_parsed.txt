stochsens matlab_package for sensitivity analysis of stochastic chemical systems motivation the growing interest in the role of stochasticity in biochemical_systems drives the demand for tools to analyse stochastic dynamical_models of chemical_reactions one powerful_tool to elucidate performance of dynamical_systems is sensitivity analysis traditionally however the concept of sensitivity has mainly been applied to deterministic systems and the difficulty to generalize these concepts for stochastic systems results from necessity of extensive monte_carlo results here we present a matlab_package stochsens that implements sensitivity analysis for stochastic chemical systems using the concept of the fisher_information fim it uses the linear noise approximation to represent the fim in terms of solutions of ordinary_differential this is the first computational_tool that allows for quick computation of the information matrix for stochastic systems without the need for monte_carlo in the past_decade dynamic modelling of biochemical_systems using stochastic approaches has become increasingly popular as the role of stochastic effects has turned out to be significant for the functioning of living_cells the dynamical behaviour of such systems can not be understand by intuition alone but requires computational_tools for the analysis in the case of deterministic models sensitivity analysis is a concept that greatly helps to understand the dependance between parameter_values and the dynamic outputs various software_packages have become available to address this problem e g rodriguez fernandez and banga d a the classical sensitivity coefficient can simply be understood as a derivative of an output q with respect to a parameter the behaviour of a stochastic system however is not defined by an observable q that can be measured in a reproducible way instead it is defined by a distribution with density from which measurements are taken therefore there is a qualitative difference how outputs of stochastic and deterministic systems need to whom correspondence should be addressed to be quantified in order to predict a change in the behaviour of a deterministic system resulting from a perturbation in a parameter it is possible to calculate the derivative in case of a stochastic system one needs to see how a distribution changes changes in the distribution with respect to a change in the parameter are traditionally quantified as the expected value of a squared infinitesimal change in the logarithm of the density this quantity is called the fisher information fi and requires the value of the parameter to be known or at least a plausible range when calculated for a vector of parameters it is called fisher_information fim fi behaves locally as the kullback_leibler divergence and is directly related to the curvature of the expected likelihood_function therefore it is a natural measure of local sensitivity see supplementary user_manual um the possibility to evaluate equation for stochastic models of chemical kinetics has been previously achieved by the means of monte_carlo of model variables see e g plyasunov and recently we proposed to evaluate equation by approximating through the linear noise approximation and expressing the first two momements of and their derivatives in terms of ordinary_differential odes the applicability of fi extends much further than only to sensitivity analysis it is a primary tool to study robustness understood as stability of behaviour under simultaneous changes to model_parameters to guide optimal_experimental and for identifiability analysis that determines whether certain parameters can be estimated from experimental_data of a given type here we present a matlab_package stochsens which implements symbolic and numerical procedures to calculate the fim for stochastic chemical kinetics models as proposed in it is the first package that allows computation of the fim without monte_carlo calculations are therefore very efficient and can easily be repeated for different parameter_sets and alternative versions of a model corresponding to different experimental_setups the algorithm for fim computation is accompanied by functions for its analysis visualization and comparison stochsens is a new computationally_efficient and extendable matlab_package for computation and analysis of fims for stochastic and deterministic dynamical_models of chemical_reactions compared to sensitivity packages for deterministic models it accounts for the information that is contained in the noise structure this together with the high interest in stochasticity in biochemical_systems imply that our package can find wide applicability and be a basis for further extensions
