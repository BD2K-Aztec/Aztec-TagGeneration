gene_expression genome_scale analysis of interaction dynamics reveals organization of biological_networks analyzing large_scale interaction networks has generated numerous insights in systems_biology however such studies have primarily been focused on highly co expressed stable interactions most transient interactions that carry out equally_important functions especially in signal_transduction are yet to be elucidated and are often wrongly discarded as false_positives here we revisit a previously described smithwaterman like dynamic_programming and use it to distinguish stable and transient interactions on a genomic_scale in human and yeast we find that in biological_networks transient interactions are key links topologically connecting tightly_regulated functional_modules formed by stable interactions and are essential to maintaining the integrity of cellular_networks we also perform a systematic analysis of interaction dynamics across different technologies and find that high_throughput yeast_two is the only available technology for detecting transient interactions on a large_scale the proteinprotein interactome of an organism is the network of all biophysically possible interactions of different proteins in that organism it is of key importance to accurately map this network as most proteins function by interacting with other proteins moreover a better understanding of genotype to phenotype relationships in human disease requires modeling of how disease_causing might affect protein interactions and interactome properties currently there are two main highthroughput technologies to generate high_quality proteinprotein interactomes on a large_scale yeast_two y h where a protein interaction reconstitutes a transcription_factor which then activates expression of reporter_genes and affinity_purification followed by mass_spectrometry ap ms where proteins bound to tagged baits are co purified and identified high_throughput y h maps have been generated for yeast fly worm and human while large_scale ap ms datasets have the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as been generated for yeast worm and human an alternative approach adopted by most databases is to obtain literature curated lc interactions it has been shown that well controlled y h and ap ms experiments are both of high_quality but of complementary nature y h identifies direct binary interactions whereas ap ms determines co complex associations moreover gene_expression and other functional_genomics datasets are routinely integrated with proteinprotein_interactions to validate their biological relevancefor example interactions between proteins encoded by co expressed genes are often considered to be of high_quality in these analyses gene co expression is normally determined by a high pearson_correlation pcc which really means that the expression levels of the two genes are correlated over most conditions i e they are globally co expressed previous_studies that interacting_proteins within stable complexes also tend to be encoded by globally co expressed gene_pairs on the other hand the regulation and coordination of the subcellular machinery is achieved by dynamic transient interactions for example in signal_transduction proteins involved in transient interactions are not globally co expressed rather they share local blocks of co expression transient interactions and their dynamics have significant biological_importance but most genes in these pathways are often co expressed only under certain conditions as a result these are usually discarded as false_positives here we take advantage of a novel measurement of expression relationships to directly distinguish stable from transient interactions on a genomewide scale in human and yeast and systematically analyze their topological and biological_significance we also evaluate different technologies in terms of their sensitivity in detecting interaction dynamics on a genomic_scale
