genetics_and fregat an r package for region based association analysis several approaches to the region based association analysis of quantitative_traits have recently been developed and successively applied however no software_package has been developed that implements all of these approaches for either independent or structured samples here we introduce fregat family regional association tests an r package that can handle family and population samples and implements a wide_range of region based association methods including burden tests functional linear_models and kernel machine based regression fregat can be used in genome exome wide region based association studies of quantitative_traits and candidate_gene analysis fregat offers many useful options to empower its users and increase the effectiveness and applicability of region based association analysis availability_and https cran r project org_web fregat index htmlthe development of new and effective whole exome and whole_genome resequencing technologies demands the establishment of powerful and computationally_efficient statistical_methods to test the associations between rare_variants and complex_traits the methods developed for the analysis of common_variants are underpowered because of the small number of observations for any given variant the statistical_power of the association analysis of rare_variants is expected to increase when genetic_variants in a region of interest are tested_simultaneously rather than separately several approaches to the region based association analysis of quantitative_traits have been developed and successively applied in practice the simplest approach uses various methods for collapsing rare_variants within a region of interest burden tests in this case a set of rare_variants in a region is described by a single genetic variable that is then tested for association other approaches wherein genotype effects are estimated as fixed_effects are based on the multiple_regression especially on its functional data analysis based version functional linear_models flms an alternative approach treats the regional association as a random effect and employs kernel machine based regression i e sequence kernel association tests skat and skato each of these methods has their own advantages and limitations all have been adopted for pedigree samples however no software_package has yet been developed that implements all of these popular approaches for handling population or family samples we developed the family regional association tests fregat package an r package that can handle population and family samples and implements a wide_range of region based association methods includingburden tests flms and kernel machine based regression fregat can be used for the genome exome wide association studies of quantitative_traits and offers many useful options to increase the effectiveness and applicability of region based association analysis
