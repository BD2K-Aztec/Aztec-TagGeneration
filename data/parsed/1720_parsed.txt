extopodb a database of experimentally_derived topological models of transmembrane_proteins extopodb is a publicly_accessible database of experimentally_derived topological models of transmembrane_proteins it contains information collected from studies in the literature that report the use of biochemical_methods for the determination of the topology of helical transmembrane_proteins transmembrane_protein topology is highly important in order to understand their function and extopodb provides an up to date complete and comprehensive dataset of experimentally_determined topologies of helical transmembrane_proteins topological information is combined with transmembrane topology prediction resulting in more reliable topological models transmembrane_proteins constitute of fully_sequenced proteomes and they form an important class of proteins as they are crucial for a wide_variety of cellular_functions in order to understand their function we must acquire knowledge about their structure and topology across the membrane however due to the difficulty of obtaining crystals of transmembrane_proteins suitable for crystallographic analyses a small number of tm proteins have known d structure comprising about of all proteins with known d structure according to pdb therefore biochemical and molecular_biology methods are routinely used to determine the topology of transmembrane_proteins by topology we refer to the knowledge of the number and the exact localization of transmembrane_segments as well as their orientation with respect to the lipid_bilayer we have to note however that even in the case of known d structures the exact boundaries of the transmembrane_segments cannot be determined_accurately biochemical_methods include techniques of gene_fusions using enzymes such as alkaline_phosphatase galactosidase lactamase and various fluorescent_proteins to whom correspondence should be addressed detection of post_translational such as glycosylation phosphorylation and biotinylation cysteine scanning mutagenesis proteolysis methods and epitope mapping_techniques van prior_knowledge produced by such techniques is combined with topology prediction_methods resulting in improved prediction_performance although widely used prediction_algorithms are based mainly on machine_learning mostly hidden_markov during the last few years ab_initio topology prediction has been shown to be an attainable goal since it yields comparable_performance although a large amount of information in the literature refers to the determination of the topology of transmembrane_proteins few efforts have been made in terms of collection of this data in a database most of these databases are out of date and include small sets of proteins with topologies determined either by x_ray d or by a combination of various biochemical_methods here we report the construction of a database extopodb which provides detailed experimentally_verified annotation of the topology of helical transmembrane_proteins in addition we provide an analysis showing the increase in the prediction_performance using topological data from extopodb extopodb contains topological information for helical transmembrane_proteins originating from different organisms the application possesses a user_friendly environment through which the user may retrieve the necessary information find available resources and cross_references and perform additional tasks such as running prediction_algorithms in the main page of extopodb the user may find links for the following tools navigation text search blast_search and download through the navigation tool the user has the ability to browse the database by organism or by the experimental method that was used for the determination of the topology of the protein entry the user may submit advanced queries for text search and there is an interface for running blast against the database each record contains information concerning the protein_sequence with cross_references to many publicly_available databases furthermore the results of topology prediction using the hmm tm algorithm are included for each protein in the database unconstrained prediction and we also incorporated the experimental information about the topology of the proteins in the hmm tm prediction procedure producing more reliable topology models constrained prediction there is also an interface that allows user_defined constrained topology prediction using hmm tm each record of extopodb contains the topological information in relation to the experimental technique used and links to the pubmed entry of each study the database can be downloaded in several formats through the download tool the incorporation of experimental information in the prediction procedure improved the prediction_performance for all measures evaluated whereas constrained predictions are more reliable supplementary as previously shown moreover the fraction of correctly_predicted residuesin this article we present a database extopodb which is an up to date collection of experimentally_verified topological information for helical transmembrane_proteins compared to similar data_sets extopodb contains the largest number of proteins with topology_information derived from studies while developing extopodb a similar collection for transmembrane_proteins topdb was published in by tusnady and coworkers topdb contains records for transmembrane_proteins helical tm proteins and transmembrane barrels with information gathered from the literature and from public_databases and has not been updated since though topdb and extopodb share the same scope they have only entries in common due to the different criteria used for inclusion moreover even for common entries extopodb holds a larger number of experiments for each entry as most information was gathered from the literature specifically for the common entries extopodb collects data from published_studies whereas topdb has information from only studies supplementary both databases include the study of daley and coworkers where c terminal tagging using alkaline_phosphatase phoa and green_fluorescent gfp was used to establish periplasmic or cytoplasmic c terminal localization for membrane_proteins from escherichia_coli extopodb holds data only for proteins where both a phoa and a gfp clone was available a large proportion proteins of the common entries are derived from this study on top of that in extopodb there are an additional number of independently identified references for these entries our analysis showed that topology data derived from extopodb can be used for generation of constrained predictions which are more reliable and more accurate at defining the exact locations of the transmembrane_segments similar results were also obtained when we used for comparison the data deposited in the mptopo database since we observe a high_level of agreement in the predicted topology for out of transmembrane_proteins with known d structure supplementary the database might be a valuable_tool for researchers in order to design new experiments and for bioinformaticians since it provides a large representative set that can be used for training and testing prediction_algorithms for instance out of the proteins have a reliability and among them are multispanning ones moreover topology data in extopodb can be used for generating constrained predictions using other methods such as tmhmmfix hmmtop and phobius lastly we have to mention that detailed knowledge of topological information coupled with prediction_algorithms as well as information concerning amino_acid contacts derived from biophysical experiments can be used to calculate structural_models that closely_resemble the d structure thus such data can be of help in future structural studies we plan to update extopodb once a year
