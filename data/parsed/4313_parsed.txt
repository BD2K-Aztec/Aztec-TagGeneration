genetics_and snpman a program for genotype_calling using run data from taqman_allelic the snpman program calls the genotypes of single_nucleotide snp from taqman_allelic assays it utilizes the fluorescence data collected over the whole pcr run rather than relying on the end_point fluorescence measurements that is the basis of the genotype_calling process in most software solutions sold with the real_time instruments this inspection of run data facilitates genotype_calls in difficult sample_sets especially in those containing various concentrations of dna or inhibitors as indicated by results of a reanalysis of genotyping samples the program works with data from three different widely used pcr instruments availability the compiled program is available online atthe taqman_allelic is a very popular and widely used medium throughput genotyping format the assays use two short minor_groove binder mgb hydrolysis probes each annealing to one allelic_variant of the genotyped single_nucleotide snp amplified within a short polymerase_chain pcr_product the taqman_allelic is supported by most of real_time platforms however their proprietary software solutions utilize mainly the end_point analyses largely overlooking the potential of fluorescence data collected over the whole course of a pcr run in pcr runs with samples of good quality and comparable quantity the end_point scatter_plot suffices for genotype_calling nevertheless if the reaction runs in suboptimal conditions e g cheaper alternatives to the brand polymerases are used the quantity of starting dna varies or the dna contains inhibitors the end_point analyses may not effectively discriminate genotypes because the groups in the scatter_plot often stretch or blend together to whom correspondence should be addressed we therefore aimed to develop a program that would aid in taqman genotype_calling across various platforms by enabling a detailed inspection of fluorescence data from the polymerase_chain pcr runs in particular we aimed for improving the genotype call rate in runs with unequally concentrated samples in home brew assays and in samples with variable presence of inhibitors to test whether this algorithm aids in calling alleles that could not be distinguished using proprietary software of the three vendors we reanalyzed run files that contained genotypes unresolvable by the proprietary software according to the manufacturers instructions in particular we concentrated on selecting pcr runs with dna of poor_quality sample_sets of uneven dna concentration samples containing varying_amounts of inhibitors and runs containing alternative master mix chemistry we reanalyzed files from abi with samples files from lc with samples and files from biorad cfx with samples the files were selected based on previously encountered problems with genotype_calling using the proprietary software of the real_time machines mostly due to strong variations in dna quantity and quality the primers and probes for the assays were produced by applied_biosystems and were targeted mostly to snps withinand adjacent tothe nod card ctla ifih gck and ptpn genes typed in our previous_studies e g the dna samples were extracted from human whole blood or saliva using various techniques and archived up to years thereafter the reanalysis was done independently on the original genotype_calls from the instruments software both the original analysis and the reanalysis were done by two independent evaluators the result of the above reanalysis is summarized in in total genotypes of samples could not be resolved by the programs sold with the instruments of these unresolved genotypes were then called using the snpman of the genotypes that were called by the instruments software the snpman generated five genotypes discordant with the previous calls and eight samples could not be resolved by snpman although the instruments analysis yielded a genotype we did not analyze differences across the three instrument platforms as the success_rate of the genotyping heavily depended on the quality and quantity of dna in the various projects rather than on the type of the instrument shows an example of a run that entirely failed in the end_point analysis but was successfully sorted into genotypes using our program this run was not included in the overall analysis here the blending of signals from unevenly concentrated samples is visible toward the end of pcr which effectively hampered end_point analyses using fluorescence data note that the graphs c and d aided in genotype_calling independently of these fluorescence data and that moving the vertical_line of the crosshair enabled better resolution of the samples in their early amplification
