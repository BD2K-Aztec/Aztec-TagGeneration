data_and meshable searching pubmed_abstracts by utilizing mesh and mesh derived topical terms medical_subject mesh v r is a controlled_vocabulary for indexing and searching biomedical_literature mesh_terms and subheadings are organized in a hierarchical_structure and are used to indicate the topics of an article biologists can use either mesh_terms as queries or the mesh interface provided in pubmed v r for searching pubmed_abstracts however these are rarely used and there is no convenient way to link standardized mesh_terms to user queries here we introduce a web_interface which allows users to enter queries to find mesh_terms closely_related to the queries our method relies on co occurrence of text words and mesh_terms to find keywords that are related to each mesh_term a query is then matched with the keywords for mesh_terms and candidate mesh_terms are ranked based on their relatedness to the query the experimental_results show that our method achieves the best performance among several term extraction approaches in terms of topic coherence moreover the interface can be effectively used to find full names of abbreviations and to disambiguate user queries availability_and https www ncbi nlm nih gov iret meshable contact sun kim nih govpubmed is the most comprehensive bibliographic database of biomedicine and life_sciences as pubmed continues to grow it becomes more difficult to discover what one is looking for but what if we could search and browse pubmed through subject areas searching documents by subjects not only can help focus the search but can also help explore the landscape for a subject of interest many studies have pointed_out the usefulness of finding subjects in search results the common approach in these studies is to group the search results on the fly many methods make use of ontological information provided by the medical_subject mesh resource for grouping our goal is to provide a convenient way to use the mesh resource at query time there are a few options for doing this one is by directly querying with a mesh_term e g otitis this however does not appear to be the most convenient way for accessing the information because mesh is a controlled_vocabulary with a specific syntax more frequently the mesh resource is used indirectly by expanding a text query with the related mesh_term for example the query ear infection is automatically expanded to include the mesh_term otitis however such expansions are limited to terms listed as synonyms or variants for a given mesh_term an alternative way to search using mesh_terms is by starting from the mesh interface http www ncbi nlm nih gov mesh and using the pubmed query builder then again this approach is not intuitively available at the pubmed_search page and may only be known to more experienced users in this study the goal is to search pubmed_abstracts through the lens of the mesh vocabulary the key_question we address here is how to link a text query with relevant mesh concepts and we approach it by setting a supervised task as follows first for every mesh_term we define the mesh doc set as the group of documents assigned the mesh_term we then identify significant terms appearing in the mesh doc set based on the occurrence frequency of these terms in the set versus the rest of pubmed we refer to these terms as topic terms associated with the particular mesh_term as a result topic terms along with corresponding weights are computed for every mesh_term at query time mesh concepts are ranked based on how they weight the terms in the query
