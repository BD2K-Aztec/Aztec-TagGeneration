achievements and challenges in structural_bioinformatics and computational biophysics motivation the field of structural_bioinformatics and computational biophysics has undergone a revolution in the last years developments that are captured annually through the dsig meeting upon which this article reflects results an increase in the accessible data computational_resources and methodology has resulted in an increase in the size and resolution of studied systems and the complexity of the questions amenable to research concomitantly the parameterization and efficiency of the methods have markedly_improved along with their cross_validation with other computational and experimental_results conclusion the field exhibits an ever increasing integration with biochemistry biophysics and other disciplines in this article we discuss recent_achievements along with current_challenges within the field structural_bioinformatics originally known as structural computational_biology predates other forms of bioinformatics it can be argued that the seminal article by watson and crick is in fact a modeling paper and arguably the first structural_bioinformatics paper thus the nobel_prize for multiscale modeling to martin karplus arie warshel and michael levitt marks an important hallmark acknowledging the impact of structural_bioinformatics on science in his account of the birth of the field levitt describes how computation was required to accurately refine the trna model predicted by crick in building an actual model that was taller than himself thus computation has been an integral part of structural_biology from its early days and has had an ever increasing role in biochemistry and molecular_biology with the passing of years indeed from the first simulations of small systems and a few picoseconds acknowledged by the nobel committee we are now at a stage where millisecond simulations or massive searches of sequence and structure space as required for e g computational_protein are achievable structural_bioinformatics or structural computational_biology broadly_defined is a field at the intersection between computer science physics chemistry and molecular_biology historically the term structural_bioinformatics describes data_driven statistical knowledge based research of representative non redundant ensembles of structures to understand the statistical behavior of the system under investigation alternatively computational biophysics describes a hypothesis driven physics based treatment of biological molecular_systems the ergodic hypothesis guarantees that conclusions from the two types of approaches converge over large non redundant samples or long simulations currently numerous methodologies employ ideas from both approaches consequently hereafter we will refer to both as structural_bioinformatics biologically structural_bioinformatics aims to understand the factors that influence and determine the function of biological_macromolecules the interplay between evolution kinetics and thermodynamics the determinants of specificity and selectivity in molecular_interactions the dynamic aspects of macromolecular structures and their effect on function and stability and finally the ability to use all these for engineering design and biotechnology in fact a complete understanding of biological_processes must inescapably pass through an understanding of the factors_influencing such processes at the atomic and sometimes even subatomic levels in this article we discuss some of the most notable achievements in structural_bioinformatics over the past_years and discuss existing challenges in the field without a doubt the topics and the specific articles mentioned here are biased by the opinion of the authors
