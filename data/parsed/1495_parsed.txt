dsigdb drug signatures database for gene_set we report the creation of drug signatures database dsigdb a new gene_set resource that relates drugs compounds and their target_genes for gene_set gsea dsigdb currently holds gene_sets consists of unique compounds covering genes we also developed an online dsigdb resource that allows users to search view and down load drugs compounds and gene_sets dsigdb gene_sets provide seamless_integration to gsea software for linking gene_expressions with drugs compounds for drug_repurposing and transla tional research availability_and dsigdb is freely_available use at http tan lab ucdenver edu dsigdb high_throughput enable researchers to analyze tens_of of omic data_points within biological_systems typically long lists of interesting candidate_genes were generated from these analyses however interpreting these gene_lists remains a challenge for biomedical_researchers recognizing that genes act in concert to drive various biological_processes gene_set gsea was introduced to summarize genomics data using a priori defined gene_sets this seminal article has revolutionized genomic_data analyses and interpretation influenced the development of other analytical enrichment tools the critical_components of these tools are the annotated databases used as the gene_sets for summarizing high_level biological_processes the popular molecular_signatures which provides the gene_sets for gsea currently contains positional curated gene_ontology motif and computational gene_sets it also contains specialized gene_sets for oncogenic and immunologic signatures that were extracted from literatures genesigdb a database of gene_signatures extracted and manually_curated from the published_literature is another resource for analytical enrichment tools here we introduce drug signatures database dsigdb a collection of drug and small_molecule related gene_sets based on quantitative inhibition and or drug_induced gene_expression changes data see supplementary dsigdb differs from the existing resources in the following aspects i dsigdb gene_sets were extracted and compiled from quantitative inhibition data of drugs compounds from a variety of databases and publications these genes represent the direct_targets of the drugs compounds ii dsigdb gene_sets are acquired through both automatic computational_methods and manual_curation iii gene_sets from dsigdb are explicitly designed to provide seamless_integration to gsea software see supplementary here we will describe the gene_set collections of dsigdb the accompanying online resource and provide an example illustrating the utility of dsigdb gene_sets for gsea software
