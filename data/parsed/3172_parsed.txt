multitask_learning for host pathogen protein interactions motivation an important aspect of infectious_disease research involves understanding the differences and commonalities in the infection mechanisms_underlying various diseases systems_biology based_approaches study infectious_diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host_species and the pathogen organisms this work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental_studies of host_pathogen in several diseases to build stronger predictive_models our approach is based on a formalism from machine_learning called multitask_learning which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other a task in our scenario is the set of hostpathogen protein interactions involved in one disease to integrate interactions from several tasks i e diseases our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases in particular we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological_processes in the host in defining a common structure across the tasks results our current work on hostpathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host and four bacterial_species as pathogens the multitask_learning technique we develop uses a task based regularization approach we find that the resulting optimization_problem is a difference of convex dc functions to optimize we implement a convexconcave procedure based algorithm we compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single hostpathogen protein interaction dataset our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data we further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models and find some interesting insights infectious_diseases are a major health_concern worldwide causing millions of illnesses and deaths each year newly_emerging viral_diseases such as swine h n influenza severe_acute sars and bacterial_infections such as the recurrent salmonella and escherichia_coli outbreaks not only lead to wide_spread loss of life and health but also result in heavy economic_losses to better navigate this landscape of infectious_diseases it is important to not only understand the mechanisms of individual diseases but also the commonalities between them combining knowledge from related_diseases will give us deeper insights into infection and host_immune will enhance our ability to comprehend new diseases and lead to efficient development of therapeutics key to the infection process are hostpathogen interactions at the molecular level where pathogen proteins physically bind with human proteins via these protein interactions the pathogen manipulates important biological_processes in the host_cell evades host_immune and multiplies within the host interactions between host and pathogen proteins can be studied using small_scale biochemical biophysical and genetic experiments or large_scale high_throughput methods like yeast_two y h assays databases like phi base pig hpidb phisto aggregate hostpathogen protein interactions from several small_scale and high_throughput experiments via manual literature curation these databases are valuable sources of information for developing models of the modus_operandi of pathogens however interaction datasets from these databases are not only small but are available for only a few well studied pathogens for example the phi base database covers diseases but has only interactions pig covers only pathogens computationally this calls for techniques that combine datasets and build joint models across several pathogens which can then be used to analyze the commonalities in the pathogens and also to predict plausible interactions that are biased by this joint understanding in our work we study hostpathogen proteinprotein_interaction ppi where the host is fixed and the pathogens are various bacterial_species the host_species we consider is human and the bacterial_species are yersinia_pestis francisella_tularensis salmonella and bacillus_anthracis which cause the diseases bubonic plague acute_pneumonia typhoid and anthrax respectively some recent work on infectious_diseases has alluded to the hypothesis that different pathogens target essentially the same critical biological_processes in the human_body the analysis bysuggests that hiv_infection shares common molecular_mechanisms with certain signaling_pathways and cancers study bacterial and viral interactions with human genes and find infection mechanisms common to multiple pathogens experiments byshow how various bacterial cyclomodulins target the host cell_cycle the study byon plant_pathogens in particular arabidopsis concludes that pathogens from different kingdoms deploy independently evolved virulence proteins that interact with a limited set of highly_connected cellular hubs to facilitate their diverse life_cycle strategies illustrates an example depicting the commonality in various bacterial_species where to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an

is exploited here to jointly learn ppi models for multiple bacterial_species we translate the hypothesis into a prior that will bias the learned models we use a multitask learningbased approach where each task represents the interaction of one bacterial_species with human the prior is represented in the form of a regularizer that penalizes models to the degree that the above hypothesis is violated we presented a method that uses biological_knowledge in jointly learning multiple ppi prediction tasks using a task regularizationbased multitask_learning technique we were able to encode a biological hypothesis into the optimization framework effectively thus enabling the commonality hypothesis to be tested our results indicate that the tasks benefit from this joint learning and we see an improvement of f points over the baseline methods while our current results were presented on four bacterial_species we plan to extend our analysis to several other pathogens another direction to explore is the case where the pathogen is fixed and the hosts are different our current approach integrates multiple tasks in a pairwise manner which is inefficient because it does not scale well while integrating several ppi datasets the most straightforward way of extending equation to learning m tasks simultaneously involves loss terms for each of the tasks and om pairwise regularization terms which unfortunately makes the optimization_problem more complex and inefficient a more promising and efficient direction would be to consider model_selection at the task level where only the most relevant and useful tasks are used for multitask_learning
