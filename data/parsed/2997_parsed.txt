sequence_analysis mirpipe quantification of micrornas in niche model_organisms micrornas mirnas represent an important class of small_non regulating gene_expression in eukaryotes present algorithms typically rely on genomic_data to identify_mirnas and require extensive installation procedures niche model_organisms lacking genomic_sequences cannot be analyzed by such tools here we introduce the mirpipe application enabling rapid and simple browser_based mirna homology detection and quantification mirpipe features automatic trimming of raw rna_seq originating from various sequencing instruments processing of isomirs and quantification of detected mirnas versus public or user uploaded reference_databases availability_and the web_service is freely_available atmicrornas mirnas are nucleotides_long and belong to the class of snrnas mirnas serve numerous roles in downregulation transcript degradation and sequestering translational suppression of gene_expression in general mirnas are assumed to regulate multiple_targets although effects on most targets are relatively mild isoforms of mirnas resulting from imperfect digestion by drosha and dicer or rna_editing by specialized enzymes represent a challenge during the determination of correct read_counts following rnaseq mirna variants might be silent modification isomir or target different mrnas when changes occur in the regions responsible for complementary binding sequence differences between taxa hamper quantification especially if no genomic or mirna data for the studied organism are available as in the case of niche model_organisms sequencing_errors can further complicate the identification of mirnas these effects should ideally be addressed on multiple levels including i isomir handling ii enforcement of a minimum read copy_number iii clustering of similar mirnas iv removal of relatively low_abundance reads and v optional fallback to the mirna family level a set of applications in the field attempts to cover these features but a web_based able to unify all functionalities that can be applied to any organism is critically missing introduced by organism prefixes and precursor suffixes e g btamir a oan mir a p mir a for each read the detected reference mirna families are scored based on the minimum number of mismatches if a read matched equally well versus multiple mirna families the respective families are joined by single_linkage clustering this permits the inclusion of reads that cannot be matched uniquely as well as the exact measurement of the fraction of ambiguously matching reads and thereby the reliability of the match by default only those read sequences that are at least as abundant as the most abundant sequence per mirna family cluster are denoted to reduce the impact of sequencing_errors and increase robustness counts per mirna family and cluster are presented for download currently mirpipe can complete a job within h depending on the file size and the selected reference_database mirpipe quantification results can be directly used for differential_expression using other tools on our web_site supplementary_file s
