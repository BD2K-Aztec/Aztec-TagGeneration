systems_biology fastgapfill efficient gap_filling in metabolic_networks motivation genome_scale reconstructions summarize_current about a target_organism in a structured manner and as such highlight missing_information such gaps can be filled algorithmically scalability limitations of available algorithms for gap_filling hinder their application to compartmentalized reconstructions results we present fastgapfill a computationally_efficient tractable extension to the cobra toolbox that permits the identification of candidate missing knowledge from a universal biochemical_reaction database e g kyoto_encyclopedia for a given compartmentalized metabolic reconstruction the stoichiomet ric consistency of the universal reaction database and of the metabolic reconstruction can be tested for permitting the computation of biologically more relevant solutions we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of fastgapfill on a range of metabolic reconstructions availability_and fastgapfill is freely_available from http thielelab eu a biomolecular network_reconstruction summarizes biochemical physiological and genomic knowledge in a mathematically structured electronic format it can be converted into a computational_model and predictions have been used to accelerate biotechnological and biomedical discoveries the predictive capacity and accuracy of a model depend on the comprehensiveness and biochemical fidelity of the reconstruction with respect to the underlying biochemistry the comprehensiveness of a genome_scale reconstruction can be improved by using the model to detect and fill network gaps similarly reconstruction fidelity can be improved by using the model to detect reconstruction stoichiometry inconsistent with biochemistry or reactions inconsistent with steady_state flux existing gap_filling algorithms reviewed by orth and palsson become intractable in high_dimensions decompartmentalization of genome_scale compartmentalized metabolic_networks reduces their dimension rendering gap_filling tractable however this approach underestimates the amount of missing_information because it connects reactions that would normally not co occur in the same cellular compartment we present fastgapfill the first scalable algorithm capable of efficiently detecting and filling network gaps in compartmentalized genome_scale models fastgapfill draws on and extends fastcore an algorithm to approximate the cardinality function to identify a compact flux consist ent model in which all reactions carry a non zero flux in at least one flux distribution fastgapfill allows integrating all three notions of model consistency namely gap_filling flux consistency and stoichiometric consistency in a single tool
