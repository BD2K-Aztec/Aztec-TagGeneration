sequence_analysis cpss a computational platform for the analysis of small_rna deep sequencing_data next_generation ngs techniques have been widely used to document the small ribonucleic_acids rnas implicated in a variety of biological physiological_and an integrated computational_tool is needed for handling and analysing the enormous datasets from small_rna approach herein we present a novel web_server cpss a computational platform for the analysis of small_rna deep sequencing_data designed to completely annotate and functionally analyse micrornas mirnas from ngs_data on one platform with a single data submission small_rna ngs_data can be submitted to this server with analysis results being returned in two parts i annotation analysis which provides the most comprehensive analysis for small_rna transcriptome including length_distribution and genome_mapping of sequencing_reads small_rna quantification prediction of novel mirnas identification of differentially_expressed piwi_interacting and other non coding small_rnas between paired_samples and detection of mirna editing and modifications and ii functional analysis including prediction of mirna targeted genes by multiple tools enrichment of gene_ontology signalling_pathway involvement and proteinprotein_interaction analysis for the predicted genes cpss a ready to use web_server that integrates most functions of currently available bioinformatics_tools provides all the information wanted by the majority of users from small_rna deep sequencing_datasets availability cpss is implemented in php perl mysql r and can be freely accessed atnon coding ribonucleic_acids rnas which do not encode_proteins include ribosomal_rnas transfer rnas micrornas mirna piwi_interacting pirnas and other rna species these rnas participate in a surprisingly diverse collection of regulatory_events mirnas have received particular attention due to their negative role in widespread regulation of mrna metabolism through direct base_pairing interactions at transcriptional_and to better understand the regulatory_roles of mirnas and other small_rnas in different tissues and developmental_stages the expression_profiles of small_rnas need to be assessed recently the emergence of the next_generation ngs techniques has revolutionized the identification of small_rnas with particularly high levels of sensitivity and accuracy several published tools detecting non coding rna profiles from ngs_data have been developed for example mirexpress is a stand alone software for detecting known mirnas and novel mirnas miranalyzer which also offers stand alone version is a web_server tool that can detect known and novel mirnas identify differentially_expressed and predict mirna_targets seqbuster offering a web_based toolkit and stand alone version focuses on detecting mirna variants isoforms for known mirnas and can also be used to identify differentially_expressed and predict mirna_targets there are several recent comprehensive tools designed to analyse ngs_data mirtools is a web_based designed to explore the genome map and length_distribution of short_reads and to classify them into known categories to detect differentially_expressed and to predict novel mirnas and their secondary_structures dario is a free web_service for detecting and normalizing non coding rna expression and predicting novel non_coding waprna is not used only to detect mirna_expression from small_rna ngs_data but also to analyse mrna ngs_data detailed overview of cpss and other bioinformtics tools are shown in supplementary until now none of the currently available tools provides functional analysis for predicted targets of mirnas from ngs_data which could help users to find potentiallycandidate genes pathways for further experimental or computational studies thus a comprehensive and systematic tool integrating most features of previous tools with functional analysis for predicted targets of mirnas from ngs_data is still needed herein we present a novel and free web_server cpss which integrates most functions of currently available bioinformatics_tools supplementaryand supplementary by using cpss small_rna ngs_data can be analysed systematically in one platform after a single submission of data by integration of annotation and functional analysis of novel and or differentially_expressed cpss generates an analysis report including i annotation analysis which provides a comprehensive analysis for small_rna transcriptome such as length_distribution and genome_mapping of sequencing_reads small_rna annotation prediction of novel mirnas identification of differentially_expressed pirnas and other non coding small_rnas between paired_samples and detection of mirna editing and modifications and ii functional analysis which provides the functional analysis of mirnas e g predicting mirna target_genes by multi tools enriching gene_ontology go terms performing signalling_pathways and analysing proteinprotein_interaction ppi for the predicted genes
