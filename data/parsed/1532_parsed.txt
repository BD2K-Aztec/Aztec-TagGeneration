systems_biology e driver a novel method to identify protein regions driving cancer motivation most approaches used to identify cancer_driver focus true to their name on entire genes and assume that a gene treated as one entity has a specific role in cancer this approach may be correct to describe effects of gene loss or changes in gene_expression however mutations may have different effects including their relevance to cancer depending on which region of the gene they affect except for rare and well known exceptions there are not enough data for reliable statistics for individual positions but an intermediate level of analysis between an individual position and the entire gene may give us better statistics than the former and better resolution than the latter approach results we have developed e driver a method that exploits the internal distribution of somatic missense_mutations between the pro teins functional_regions domains or intrinsically_disordered to find those that show a bias in their mutation_rate as compared with other regions of the same protein providing evidence of positive_selection and suggesting that these proteins may be actual cancer drivers we have applied e driver to a large cancer genome dataset from the cancer_genome and compared its performance with that of four other methods showing that e driver identifies novel candidate cancer drivers and because of its increased resolution provides deeper insights into the potential mechanism of cancer_driver identified by other methods availability_and a perl script with e driver and the files to reproduce the results described here can be downloaded from https the landscape of cancer somatic_mutations revealed by projects such as the cancer_genome tcga or the international cancer genome consortium is overwhelmingly complex as hundreds of thousands of different mutations ranging from large genomic_rearrangements to point missense_mutations have been identified in different cancer samples several approaches have been developed to identify which genes are likely driving the carcinogenic_process driver_genes such methods rely on the hypothesis that driver_genes should be under positive_selection in the cancer environment methods in this category include those that try to identify genes with higherthan expected by chance mutation_rates such as music or those that tend to accumulate highly damaging mutations such as oncodrivefm gonzalez more recently methods that focus on the internal distribution of mutations along a protein have also been developed for example oncodriveclust looks for regions of proteins with higher than expected mutation_rates which makes it optimal for the identification of gain of function sites that while being key for the carcinogenic_process would otherwise be missed another similar idea is activedriver which tries to identify phosphorylation_sites that are recurrently mutated in cancer one of the differences between the two methods is that activedriver tests the mutation frequencies of predefined regions a phosphorylation_site and its neighboring amino_acids whereas oncodriveclust first looks for potential seeds of highly mutated clusters and then tries to extend them here we present e driver a novel method that identifies protein functional_regions pfrs that show a bias in their mutation_rates in this context pfrs can be either domains or intrinsically_disordered idrs our method is based on the assumption that different pfrs within the same protein mediate different functions and thus might have distinct roles in carcinogenesis this becomes evident when describing proteins in terms of functional_networks in such networks nodes represent different proteins and edges between nodes represent functional_relationships between them such as physical_interactions or post_translational different edges leading to the same node protein are usually mediated by different pfrs within that same protein and mutations in the pfr mediating one edge will have different consequences than mutations in another pfr mediating a different edge for example if an enzyme contains a catalytic_domain and an idr that is phosphorylated it is likely that the consequences of a missense_mutation disrupting the catalytic_domain will be different from those of a missense_mutation affecting the phosphorylation_site or a truncating_mutation that disrupts both pfrs at the same time our method exploits this idea which has been previously used to analyze mutations associated with mendelian_disorders by looking for pfrs that show a bias in their mutation_rate we have applied e driver to the cancer genomic dataset from the pan cancer project of tcga this dataset has also been analyzed with four other methods music oncodrivefm oncodriveclust and activedriver allowing us to compare to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions
