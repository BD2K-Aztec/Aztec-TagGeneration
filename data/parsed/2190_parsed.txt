higher classification sensitivity of short metagenomic_reads with clark s the growing number of metagenomic_studies in medicine and environmental sciences is creating increasing demands on the computational infrastructure designed to analyze these very large_datasets often the construction of ultra_fast and precise taxonomic classifiers can compromise on their sensitivity i e the number of reads correctly_classified here we introduce clark s a new software_tool that can classify short_reads with high_precision high_sensitivity and high_speed availability clark s is freely_available atone of the primary_goals of metagenomic_studies is to determine the taxonomical identity of bacteria and viruses in a heterogenous microbial sample e g soil water urban environment human_microbiome this analysis can reveal the presence of unexpected bacteria and viruses in a newly explored microbial habitat or in the case of the human_body elucidate relationships between diseases and imbalances in the microbiome arguably the most effective and unbiased methods to study these microbial samples is via high_throughput the associated computational_problem is to assign sequenced short_reads to a taxonomic unit several methods and software_tools are available but faster and more accurate algorithms are needed to keep pace with the increasing throughput of modern sequencing instruments inwe introduced clark a taxonomy dependent binning method whose classification speed is currently unmatched a recent independent evaluation of fourteen taxonomic_binning profiling methods kraken by wood and salzberg megan by and many others showed that the classification precision of clark is comparable sometimes better than the state of the art classifiers while clarks speed and precision are very high its classification sensitivity i e the fraction of reads that it correctly classifies can be significantly_improved with the methods described next we recall that clark is a k_mer based method briefly it assigns a read r to a reference_genome g if r and g share more discriminative k_mers i e k_mers that appear exclusively in one reference_genome than other genomes in the database here we show that the classification sensitivity can be increased by allowing mismatches between shared kmers in a limited number of carefully predetermined positions while maintaining the requirement for k_mers to be discriminative the idea of allowing mismatches to improve the sensitivity of seed and extend alignment_methods was pioneered inwith the notion of spaced seed while spaced seeds have been used in some metagenomic binning profiling methods e g megan the use of discriminative spaced k_mers is novel here we describe an extension of the algorithmic infrastructure of clark based on spaced seed called clark s
