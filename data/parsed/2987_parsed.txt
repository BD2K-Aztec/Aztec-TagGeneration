data_and mircancer a microrna cancer association database constructed by text_mining on literature motivation research_interests in micrornas have increased rapidly in the past_decade many studies have showed that micrornas have close_relationships with various human_cancers and they potentially could be used as cancer indicators in diagnosis or as a suppressor for treatment purposes there are several databases that contain micrornacancer associations predicted by computational_methods but few from empirical results despite the fact that abundant experiments investigating microrna expressions in cancer_cells have been carried_out the results have remain scattered in the literature we propose to extract micrornacancer associations by text_mining and store them in a database called mircancer results the text_mining is based on rules we have constructed which represent the common sentence structures typically used to state microrna expressions in cancers the micrornacancer association database mircancer is updated regularly by running the text_mining algorithm against pubmed all mirnacancer associations are confirmed manually after automatic extraction mircancer currently documents relationships between micrornas and human_cancers through the processing of published_articles availability mircancer is freely_available on the web atmicrornas mirnas are small_non that regulate gene_expressions by base_pairing to messenger_rnas although the first mirna lin was introduced in it did not draw much attention until when the second mirna let was characterized studies found that let regulates a couple of gene_expressions in caenorhabditis_elegans development and is conserved in many species since then many techniques have been developed to identify_mirnas as of november mature mirna sequences have been identified with a growth of in the past year current findings_suggest that mirnas play_an in crucial biological_processes such as cell_proliferation apoptosis development differentiation and metabolism among these mirna association with disease especially the association between mirna and human_cancers has attracted a great_deal of interest in both scientific and business fields cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide it is estimated that cancer caused million deaths in about of all deaths globally http turl ca xndn by cancer surpassed heart_disease as the top killer in usa for the first time there are many possible carcinogens including tobacco radiation chemicals environmental toxins viruses and genetic problems however the causes of many cancers remain_unknown cancer involves unregulated cell_growth thereby invading nearby parts of body during development early_diagnosis before proliferation usually makes a difference in treatment and survival_rate the fact that mirna_expression levels vary significantly between normal cells and cancer_cells suggests that mirna might be associated with cancer development and potentially could be used for cancer diagnosis or even treatment even though it is uncertain whether cancer is a cause or consequence of deviant mirna_expression mirna fingerprints are found in all types of analysed cancers such as lung_cancer breast_cancer cervical_cancer and lymphoblastic_leukemia numerous databases have been created to document mirna functionalities either from computational predictions or from experimental_results although computational target prediction_methods are fast experimental_validation of mirna functionalities is also needed the significant increase in validation experiments raises the need for having a database to store these results in some uniform way however compared with databases providing computationally predicted mirna functions databases storing experimental mirna_targets are rare most of these experimentally_verified mirna_target databases are manually collected such as mir disease mirecords mirtarbase and tarbase version to rapid increase in the number of mirna related publications makes the manual collection more and more difficult three databases using textmining strategies have been introduced in the past_years mirsel and mirwalk contain mirna interaction data and mirna_targets were derived solely from text_mining of medline_abstracts tarbase adds text_mining to preprocess abstracts before human curation the text_mining to whom correspondence should be addressed preprocessing increased entries about fold as compared with its previous version without text_mining text_mining is the process in which useful information is extracted from text using computational_approaches or tools unlike its application in other fields accurate biomedical_text remains_an as a result of specialized and complex vocabularies there are three commonly used text_mining approaches in biomedical realm i co occurrence based_approach which was adopted by mirsel and tarbase ii rule based_approach which keeps a set of rules that usually take significant amount of time to develop and iii machine_learning where the required training data are usually expensive or even impossible to generate co occurrence based systems are normally easier to build while the other two provide better accuracy in this article we proposed and developed rule_based textmining approaches to extract mirna and cancer association and store them in a database called mircancer all the discovered associations have been manually confirmed after automatic extraction mircancer currently documents relationships between micrornas and human_cancers through the processing of published_articles from pubmed
