data_and efficient visualization of high_throughput targeted_proteomics experiments tapir motivation targeted mass_spectrometry comprises a set of powerful_methods to obtain accurate and consistent protein quantification in complex samples to fully_exploit these techniques a cross_platform and open_source stack based on standardized data_exchange formats is required results we present tapir a fast and efficient python visualization software for chromatograms and peaks identified in targeted_proteomics experiments the input_formats are open community driven standardized data_formats mzml for raw_data storage and traml encoding the hierarchical relationships between transitions peptides and proteins tapir is scalable to proteome_wide targeted proteomics_studies as enabled by swath ms allowing researchers to visualize high_throughput datasets the framework integrates well with existing automated analysis_pipelines and can be extended beyond targeted_proteomics to other types of analyses availability_and tapir is available for all computing platforms under the clause bsd_license at https github com msproteomicstools msproteomicstools in mass_spectrometry most currently available analysis and visualization software is focused on discovery proteomics workflows and consequentially on the representation of fragment_ion spectra recent_advances in targeted_proteomics such as the development of high_throughput selected_reaction srm and swath ms have sparked interest in the computational_analysis of chromatographic traces these methods have substantially increased the number of transitions that can be concurrently analyzed in a single lc_ms run from a few hundred to several hundred thousand although multiple algorithms have been proposed in the literature to analyze such data insufficient visualization capability and inability to manually verify the results have hampered their adoption in the research_community the lack of common data_formats and missing cross_platform support are some of the main challenges for targeted proteomics_analysis which make combining and integrating_multiple analysis workflows difficult often a user is thus restricted to a single software environment causing lock in effects and preventing optimal data analysis in addition most currently available software_tools were developed with low_throughput targeted proteomics_data srm mrm data in mind and may not scale well to the large data_volumes generated by next generation highthroughput targeted_proteomics pipelines such as swath ms here we present tapir a fast and efficient cross_platform software for visualizing chromatograms and corresponding peaks identified in targeted_proteomics experiments tapir uses standardized and open file_formats for data access mzml and traml and is able to visualize v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com experiments whose size substantially exceeds system memory through efficient access to the raw_data tapir is a novel tool designed to display and analyze targeted proteomics_data to validate experimental_results it presents a highly interactive user_interface allowing to zoom pan investigate individual data traces and export data as images or tables in a highly customizable fashion the tool is scalable to a large amount of input_data dozens of input_files with several hundred thousands of transitions each which makes it suitable to display and analyze high_throughput data this is achieved by using the indexed mzml data format which allows fast indexed seeks and loading of only the requested chromatograms into memory in addition tapir uses highly optimized data_structures based on the numerical numpy library to represent data and to generate the plots employs the efficient guiqwt plotting library even though no data is held in system memory loading the data and generating the plots is generally done in less than a second providing a fast and responsive user experience on the desktop to demonstrate the application of tapir we have used the software to visualize multiple types of chromatographic_data first we have applied it to an experiment investigating the virulence mechanisms of streptococcus_pyogenes using swath ms and a targeted data analysis strategy supplemental material specifically several thousand peptides more than transitions were monitored over multiple conditions and tapir allowed the visual_inspection of peptides reported to have differential_expression between conditions the software displays the extracted_ion for each peptide and highlights the correct peak as determined by openswath for example further information relating to each peak q value intensity peak boundaries is displayed alongside the chromatogram facilitating visual validation of data obtained in high_throughput experiments next we have extended the tapir software framework and adopted it for a metabolomics use case in the supplementary_material we show multiple extracted_ion in a metabolomics gc_ms gas_chromatography experiment where three metabolites were quantified because the analysis also relied on mzml and traml for data storage no changes were needed to adopt tapir to gcms data of metabolites by design tapir is built for high_throughput applications is completely open_source and supports multiple computing platforms scaling well with the number of transitions analyzed and the number of runs in a single experiment this sets it apart from other visualization software for targeted_proteomics such as peakview skyline or toppview see also supplemental discussion the design of tapir allows for rapid visual validation of results obtained from automated software_tools and deep exploration of signals that were highlighted by downstream statistical_analysis to confirm the correct identification and quantification of the analyte manual_inspection by life_science researchers increases confidence in the results and allows a tight integration of automated analysis_pipelines with efficient visualization software we hope that the availability of such a tool improves the quality of reported results in targeted_proteomics and can contribute to increased confidence and transparency in the biological findings of future mass_spectrometric studies screenshot of user_interaction with tapir displaying chromatographic_data the tapir software is highly_flexible and interactive allowing for investigation of single data traces and data_points each graph item can be selected and inspected individually allowing for customization of the visualization and production of publication quality figures data can be exported as an image or in table format and used for further analysis individual traces can be removed or re added and all graph settings such as color line width line style etc are fully customizable the implementation relies on guiqwt for these features here simulated_data is shown
