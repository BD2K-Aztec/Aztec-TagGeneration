structural_bioinformatics all atom knowledge based potential for rna_structure and assessment motivation over the recent_years the vision that rna simply serves as information_transfer molecule has dramatically changed the study of the sequence structure_function in rna is becoming more important as a direct consequence the total number of experimentally solved rna_structures has dramatically_increased and new computer tools for predicting rna_structure from sequence are rapidly emerging therefore new and accurate methods for assessing the accuracy of rna_structure models are clearly needed results here we introduce an all atom knowledge based potential for the assessment of rna three_dimensional d structures we have benchmarked our new potential called ribonucleic_acids statistical potential rasp with two different decoy datasets composed of near native rna_structures in one of the benchmark sets rasp was able to rank the closest model to the x_ray structure as the best and within the top models for and of decoys respectively the average correlation_coefficient between model accuracy calculated as the root_mean and global distance test total_score gdt ts measures of c atoms and the rasp score was and respectively based on a recently released benchmark_dataset that contains hundreds of d models for rna motifs with non canonical base_pairs rasp scoring_function compared favorably to rosetta farfar force_field in the selection of accurate_models finally using the self splicing group i intron and the stem_loop iiic from hepatitis_c internal_ribosome as test cases we show that rasp is able to discriminate between known structure destabilizing mutations and compensatory mutations availability rasp can be readily applied to assess all atom or coarse_grained rna_structures and thus should be of interest to both developers and end_users of rna_structure prediction_methods the computer software and knowledge_based are freely_available atover the recent_years the vision that rna_molecules only serve as a genetic_information carrier has dramatically changed today it is widely_accepted that most of the genome is actively_transcribed and that non coding rna_molecules would have key functional_roles in several fundamental cell processes such as cell_division growing and differentiation indeed rna_molecules are now known to carry diverse functions such as catalysis transcription_regulation and chromosome repair among others in this context experimental determination of rna threedimensional d structures has become an essential tool for characterizing the functional activity of new rna_molecules as a direct consequence of this the number of rna_structures deposited in the protein_data pdb has rapidly increased over the past_few reaching now over structures additionally new computational_tools for the assessment prediction and comparison of rna_structures have been recently_developed therefore the total number of rna structureseither solved by experiment or predicted by computer based methodsis expected to continue to increase at a high rate this fact poses the urgent need for developing accurate rna_structure assessment methods and tools the development of new methods for assessing the accuracy of rna_structure models can benefit from previous_experience gathered in the field of protein_structure and assessment one of the most popular approaches to assess the quality of d protein_structures has been the use of knowledge based or statistical_potentials however a drawback of this methodology is that it ideally requires a non redundant set with several dozens to hundreds of experimentally solved structures which in the case of rna may be difficult to obtain because most of the known rna_molecules available in the pdb are highly redundant at the sequence level despite this a recent_publication has reported the first calculation of a knowledge based potential for rna_structure and assessment this new knowledge based scoring_function for rna_structures named nast relies on a coarse_grained representation i e c atoms only of rna geometrical features i e distances angles and dihedral_angles and it has been derived by calculating statistics from only three experimental_structures of large ribosomal units the nast scoring_function was used for successfully predicting coarsegrained d structures of rna_sequences of varying length nast was able to build rna_structure models averaging and root_mean rmsd for the yeast phenylalanine trna and the p p domain of the tetrahymena_thermophila group i intron respectively more recently a fullatom potential available within the rosetta suite was successfully used for the de_novo prediction and design of non canonical rna d structures this new full atom potential contains weak carbon hydrogen_bonding and solvation terms as well as a complete description for potential hydrogen_bonds between bases and backbone oxygen_atoms here we introduce the description and development of a new knowledge based or statistical potential for rna_structure and assessment called ribonucleic_acids statistical potential rasp which has the following features i it has been derived from a non redundant set of rna_structures ii it has geometrical descriptors that explicitly account for base_pairing and base stacking_interactions both being important features that contribute to the thermodynamic_stability of native rna_structures iii it is a detailed full atom potential that includes a representation for local and non local_interactions in rna_structures and iv some of its key_parameters have been optimized by calculating information_theory measures in the same set of native structures used to derive the potential and not from a specific benchmark that may introduce some bias in the optimization_process moreover we have built a new and independent set of rna_structures which was used to benchmark the performance of rasp through the use of a jackknife procedure our full atom rasp potential was validated against other simpler and coarse_grained rasp potentials which were derived by using common parameters optimized with the same set of rna_structures and tested in the same benchmarks finally the rasp potentials were also compared against the nast and rossetta potentials as well as the amber force_field we begin this article by describing a new benchmark set of rna_structures that was used by us to test the rasp as well as to optimize its parameters we continue by showing the results of the optimized potential scores in model ranking and accuracy correlation tests next we illustrate some energy score functions of the rasp potential accounting for base_pairing and base stacking_interactions we continue by describing the results of rasp at selecting near native models in a real rna modeling scenario by assessing its performance at selecting accurate_models in a dataset of hundreds of d models of rna motifs with non canonical base_pairs finally we apply rasp to study the effects of mutations including compensatory mutations in the self splicing group i intron of azoarcus pre trnaile and in the stem_loop iiic of an internal_ribosome ires element from the hepatitis_c hcv to date few computational_tools have been developed and are freely_available to assess the accuracy of rna_structures among those the nast and rosetta tools were recently_developed and have proven to be useful in the assessment and prediction of rna d structures in this work we have developed a new knowledge based potential by using a list of non redundant experimental rna_structures despite the limited number and size of currently known experimental rna_structures our potential called rasp was able to accurately discriminate between near native and misfolded rna_structures rasp has several unique features that can render it as a complementary tool to the existing ones rasp has been optimized by means of information product maximization a single measure that has strong support from the field of information_theory as it has been previously demonstrated this strategy allows for an elegant and unbiased optimization of knowledge_based rasp inherits key_parameters that have proven to be successful in the related field of protein_structure assessment and prediction these parameters are the distance_dependent geometrical descriptions for atom pairs in a molecule the topological factor or sequence separation to split local from non local_interactions and the use of properly defined atom types to reduce the matrix size and avoid sparse_data in addition to this rasp has been calculated from a dataset of experimental_structures that is larger and more diverse than those used in previous_efforts our rna_structure dataset is representative of the currently known rna structural space as highly redundant structures have been removed from the final dataset rasp describes the geometrical restraints that naturally arise in base_pair formation through hydrogen_bonding and base_stacking through interactions more importantly rasp not only describes the canonical watsoncrick base_pairs but also the non canonical pairs that are highly abundant in native rna_structures moreover the rasp scores were highly_correlated with the structural deviation from native conformations it is expected that as more non redundant rna_structures become available the accuracy and performance of a potential such as rasp will improve meanwhile rasp can assist the accuracy evaluation of predicted rna_structure models by computer based techniques as well as in assessing the quality of experimental rna_structures as demonstrated by the three real case_examples analyzed here despite of the important features described above the current version of rasp has limitations that need further improvements for example the incorporation of a solvation term would allow for a more accurate description of the energy in highly unfolded and non compact rna conformations in the case of proteins this term clearly contributes to improve the performance of knowledgebased potentials in the assessment and prediction of d structures b additionally deriving rasp from a larger and more diverse set of rna_structures would likely result in a more accurate_knowledge based potential as it has also been demonstrated for proteins unfortunately experimental_difficulties for working with rna using either x_ray or nuclear_magnetic have resulted so_far in a limited number of determined structures although with outlined limitations the results obtained here using two different benchmarks demonstrate that rasp still is a competitive potential when compared to nast rosetta and amber force_fields future improvements of rasp will certainly attempt to overcome the two drawbacks mentioned above as well as the ability to perform energy score minimizations with this potential
