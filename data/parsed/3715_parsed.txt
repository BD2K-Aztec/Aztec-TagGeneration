gene_expression probeselect selecting differentially_expressed probes in transcriptional_profile data transcriptional_profiling still remains one of the most popular techniques for identifying relevant biomarkers in patient samples however heterogeneity in the population leads to poor statistical_evidence for selection of most relevant biomarkers to pursue in particular human transcriptional differences can be subtle making_it to tease out real differentially_expressed biomarkers from the variability inherent in the population to address_this we propose a simple statistical technique that identifies differentially_expressed probes in heterogeneous populations as compared with controls availability_and the algorithm has been implemented_in and available at www sourceforge net_projects high_throughput gene_expression protein or metabolite_profiling of patient samples has become a standard tool of biomarker_discovery for disease_subtypes and progression irrespective of the particular technology platform be it affymetrix chip mirna profiles mass spec proteomics metabolomics or so on the challenge of focusing analyses on the most informative markers is similar for heterogeneous_diseases the first challenging step analyzing multidimensional data is identification of markers that distinguish disease and control_groups because of heterogeneity of the disease grouping all disease samples for comparison against healthy_controls may fail in identifying markers that could be specific to only a small percentage of disease samples once such candidate markers are identified unsupervised clustering_methods are applied to uncover the disease substructure in the biomarker space consider a hypothetical case of a marker that is fold different on the log scale in just of disease samples with zero variability and with of disease samples the same as control_group the standard_deviation in disease groups for this marker will be and the log fold_difference between cases and controls only assuming zero variability in controls such a marker would only have a z_score of thus not significant by either fold or p value nevertheless this marker clearly distinguishes a disease subtype from control and the rest of the population first approach to address this challenge has been proposed in the seminal paper bywhere breast_cancer were identified using whole_genome expression_profiling in this article probes with variability in the cohort were selected for further unsupervised_clustering and this clustering successfully recapitulated major breast_cancer molecular_subtypes this simple method has been applied in numerous subsequent publications and a variety of diseases and sample_types another method frequently used is comparison of disease and control samples and identification of probes significantly different between disease and control cohorts e g as implemented in limma bioconductor_package often decisions determining significance thresholds and their stringency of probe selection are arbitrary in this article we propose a simple statistical formalism for selection of the probes that distinguish heterogeneous disease samples from healthy_controls the standard clustering approach considers all probes with a high coefficient of variation cv typically and subsequently clusters both controls and cases to discover a structure that may separate controls from cases in comparison our method considers only the probes that are significantly different from healthy_controls in a subgroup of patients we apply this method to the whole blood profiles of secondary_progressive spms patients and uncover distinct subgroups in the patient population that when treated as a uniform group are indistinguishable from the control_group profiles that is a standard limma approach to identification of genes_differentially between spms and control_groups does not identify any significant differences in addition the method used by cv selects probes of which overlap with our methods selection however a standard principal_component pca or hierarchical_clustering in the space of these probes does not separate out the controls from the cases supplementary
