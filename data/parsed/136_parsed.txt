sequence_analysis adviser_pyro amplicon identification using sparse_representation of pyrosequencing signal motivation converting a pyrosequencing signal into a nucleotide_sequence appears highly_challenging when signal_intensities are low unitary peak_heights or when complex signals are produced by several target amplicons in these cases the pyrosequencing software fails to provide correct nucleotide_sequences accordingly the objective was to develop the adviser_pyro algorithm performing an automated fast and reliable analysis of pyrosequencing_signals that circumvents those limitations results in the current mycobacterial amplicon genotyping application adviser_pyro performed much better than the pyrosequencing software in the following two situations when converting single amplicon sample sas signals into a correct single_sequence versus and when translating multiple amplicon sample mas signals into the correct sequence pair availability adviser_pyro is implemented in an r package http sites uclouvain be md ctma index php softwares and can be used in broad range of clinical_applications including multiplex pyrosequen cing and oncogene re sequencing in heterogeneous tumor_cell samples pyrosequencing is a dna_sequencing that has many applications including rapid genotyping of a broad_spectrum of bacteria in this type of application bacterial s_rrna is a commonly used target for identifying organisms at the species and even strain level high_throughput ngs is now emerging as a powerful technology able to characterize at the finest scale the diversity in natural microbial and viral_populations however ngs is expensive and requires complex sample_preparation and elaborate data analysis despite the increased use of ngs for the study of microbial_diversity pyrosequencing therefore remains a cost_effective solution for genotyping a portion of the bacterial_genome that allows rapid bacterial or viral genotyping as well as rapid assessment of microbial antibiotic_resistance pyrosequencing is based on pyrophosphate release during nucleotide incorporation the four possible nucleotides are sequentially dispensed in a predetermined order the first chemi luminescent signal produced during nucleotide incorporation is detected by a charge_coupled camera in the pyrosequencer and displayed in a pyrogram tm the pyrogram tm can then be converted automatically into a nucleotide_sequence by dedicated software or visually by an experienced operator the number of incorporated nucleotides at each position is computed from the corresponding peak_height the pyrosequencing_data analysis software frequently produces reading errors in homopolymer regions due to the nonlinear light response following incorporation of consecutive identical nucleotides however pyrosequencing software interpretation is mostly reliable when a pyrogram tm with intermediate unitary peak_heights i e the peak_heights observed after incorporation of a single nucleotide is obtained from a single amplicon sample sas i e a sample that includes a single target amplicon as inwhere unitary peak_heights are close to two main situations generate signals preventing automated translation into a correct nucleotide_sequence this happens first when a sample contains a very low dna concentration which induces a signal with peak_heights close to the noise_level it happens also when the pyrogram tm compiles signals from a multiple amplicon sample mas i e a sample that includes multiple target amplicons in this case the complex signal reflects indeed the integration of signals produced by each amplicon the pyrosequencing_data analysis software is not able to distinguish each amplicon specific signal hence it has a limited capacity to produce correct amplicon specific nucleotide_sequences in such situations the only option left is a cumbersome time consuming and usually very inefficient visual interpretation this is an

used simultaneously which leads to overlapping of primer specific pyrosequencing_signals the mpsqed and the multipsq softwares were recently_developed to aid researchers in designing and analyzing multiplex pyrosequencing assays the mpsqed software can be used to avoid situations where competing signals from snps in different sequences cancel each other out the multipsq software enables the analysis of multiplex pyrograms originating from various pyrosequencing primers a second application is found in clinical molecular_diagnostic laboratories testing mutations in kras braf pik_ca and egfr genes recently a virtual pyrogram generator pyromaker was developed to resolve complex pyrosequencing results and could be used to generate simulated pyrogram tm based on user inputs the interpretation of mas pyrosequencing_signals was also addressed by shen et_al who developed a pyrosequencing_data analysis software for egfr kras and braf_mutation analysis the software aimed at identifying the presence of mutated cells as well as their proportions in a first step this software compared peak_heights with a known wild_type peak pattern if the signal did not fit with the expected wild_type pattern the software compared it with the mutant peak patterns when a mutation was identified the percentage of the candidate mutant gene in the specimen was computed using a built in formula specific for each mutation the main_drawback of this software was the need for a built in formula defined specifically for each mutation and not based on objective parameter computation exploiting a statistical_method a third application that generates mas signals is related to samples including a heterogeneous microbial_population in this context a novel approach based on a single sanger_sequencing reaction was recently_proposed for identifying each microbial_population from the original population mixture this novel approach was based on the reconstruction of a sparse signal using a small number of measurements sparse representations of signals have received a lot of attention in recent_years the problem solved by sparse_representation is to look for a compact_representation of signals in terms of linear combination of atoms in an over complete dictionary i e a dictionary including a number of atoms p that exceeds the dimension of the signal space n in the present study each atom of the dictionary corresponds to a pyrosequencing signal generated from a known amplicon for a y testing signal of length n the issue for sparse_representation is to find a vector j j p such that the following objective_function is minimized where x ij is i th element of the j th atom and jj j jj is the l norm of vector j and is equivalent to its number of nonzero components after having constructed the model the values of j regression_coefficients are used for identifying which of the atoms are contributing to the y testing signal unfortunately finding the solution to this problem is np_hard however a solution can be obtained by replacing the l norm by a l p norm penalty on the regression_coefficients l norm penalties are used in lasso_regression while l norm penalties are used in ridge_regression and a combination of l and l norm penalties are used in elastic_net elnet to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that sparse_representation of signals is used to analyze pyrosequencing_signals accordingly the objective of the present study was to develop a new algorithm for improving the analysis of pyrosequencing_signals this algorithm called adviser_pyro deciphers each amplicon specific signal that contributes to the resulting global signal in the present study adviser_pyro was used to identify mycobacterial_species by pyrosequencing considering the likely existence of heterogenous mycobacterial populations in a clinical_specimen this case study appears particularly relevant indeed the identification of causative mycobacterial agents in infected samples can be affected by the presence of other ubiquitous mycobacterial_species moreover coinfection with mycobacterium_tuberculosis mtb and nontuberculous_mycobacteria ntb in clinical samples and notably in aids patients can easily be overlooked when using conventional identification methods and presents therefore a real challenge in diagnosis and treatment this probably explains at least partially why evidence of dual infection with mtb and ntb is scanty the performance of adviser_pyro in identifying mycobacterial amplicons was assessed using signals generated by sas n and mas n the latter containing twodistinct amplicons for sas signals the adviser_pyro performance was compared with the percentage of correct identification obtained with the pyrosequencing_data analysis software psq tm ma software v biotage ab sweden and reflecting the pyrogram tm translation into a correct nucleotide_sequence the adviser_pyro algorithm appears as an efficient tool that can reliably be used to identify amplicons in pyrosequencing_signals generated by sas or mas the first prerequisite is that pyrosequencing signal analysis by adviser_pyro requires the corresponding amplicon representation in the dictionary otherwise the model produced by adviser_pyro would be wrong in that case the fitted values would be weakly correlated with the pyrosequencing signal which will allow operators to avoid erroneous interpretation from this study it also appears that a quantitative interpretation of signal contributions is not feasible indeed the estimated relative_contribution of each amplicon in the mas pyrosequencing_signals did not correspond to the initial ratio of each dna target this derives from significant differences in pcr_amplification efficiency of these dna targets hence to differences in the respective amount of amplicons to be pyrosequenced moreover the estimated relative_contribution of each amplicon in the mas pyrosequencing_signals did not correspond to the initial ratio of pcr_product as previously_reported inwho showed that all primertarget association does not perform equally well a second prerequisite for using adviser_pyro is that each amplicon produces a specific signal which is different from signals generated by all other amplicons expected to be produced in the genetic identification process if this is indeed the case the adviser_pyro algorithm can be applied to a wide_spectrum of pyrosequencing based genotyping applications other than mycobacterial_species typing and is able to analyze genotyping_data generated by various types of polymorphisms including single_nucleotide single nucleotide repeat_sequence deletion and insertion a cyclic dispensation order can be used if itsatisfies this second prerequisite i e if it produces distinct amplicon specific signals however choosing a selected dispensation order can be advantageous to maximise the signal differences inherent to pyrosequencing_signals produced respectively by each type of amplicon according to the genotyping application maximising signal differences could also be achieved by increasing the number of dispensed nucleotides with the deleterious consequence that long_reads are associated with higher peak_height variance consequently the choice of an optimal nucleotide dispensation order is based on a difficult compromise between the quantity and the quality of the acquired information in the context of oncogene re sequencing in heterogeneous tumor_cell samples adviser_pyro could be used as a tool complementary to pyromaker the latter is used to complete the representative learning dictionary by generating a theoretical pyrosequencing signal for each mutation for which no biological_sample is yet available hence experimental signal is still lacking in the dictionary if multiplex pyrosequencing needs to be carried_out adviser_pyro could be applied to the analysis of complex signals obtained with multiplex primers designed with the mpsqed software in this study adviserpyro showed a high percentage of correct identification with signals generated from samples containing two distinct amplicons although this has not been yet tested and needs to be validated it should be pointed_out that adviser_pyro can also be used on samples containing more than two distinct amplicons in the present study the optimisation of adviser_pyro hyperparameters was done on a validation dataset to obtain the higher percentage of correct identification irrespective of the impact of a false positive_or results however such optimisation should ideally be performed for each genotyping application by considering the global clinical context in oncogene re sequencing_applications the sct could indeed be defined in terms of relative_contribution by estimating the limit of blank lob from a dilution series experiment this lob could be modulated to limit the probability of either false_negative or positive results by considering the clinical impact relative to both types of error as illustrated here adviser_pyro is expected to substantially help improve the reading and translation of the pyrogram tm into a correct sequence or set of sequences in case of sas and mas signals respectively validation and optimization of adviser_pyro in clinical_applications other than mycobacterial genotyping are already under way
