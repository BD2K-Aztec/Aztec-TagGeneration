hammock a hidden_markov based peptide clustering_algorithm to identify protein interaction consensus motifs in large_datasets downloaded from motivation proteins often recognize their interaction_partners on the basis of short_linear located in disordered_regions on proteins surface experimental_techniques that study such motifs use short_peptides to mimic the structural_properties of interacting_proteins continued development of these methods allows for large_scale screening resulting in vast_amounts of peptide_sequences potentially containing information on multiple protein_protein processing of such datasets is a complex but essential task for large_scale studies_investigating protein_protein results the software_tool presented in this article is able to rapidly_identify multiple clusters of sequences carrying shared specificity motifs in massive datasets from various sources and generate multiple_sequence of identified clusters the method was applied on a previously_published smaller dataset containing distinct classes of ligands for sh_domains as well as on a new an order of magnitude larger dataset containing epitopes for several monoclonal_antibodies the software successfully identified clusters of sequences mimicking epitopes of antibody targets as well as secondary clusters revealing that the antibodies accept some deviations from original epi tope sequences another test indicates that processing of even much larger datasets is computa tionally feasible availability_and hammock is published under gnu gpl v

ham mock the source_code can be downloaded from https github com hammock dev hammock releases molecular_interactions between proteins occur ubiquitously in cells and play_central in most biological_processes these interactions are often mediated by short_linear located in disordered_regions on the surface of one of the interacting_partners the functional and evolutionary importance of this kind of interaction is substantial to investigate linear motif mediated binding_interactions several experimental methods utilize short_peptides to mimic structural_properties of interacting_proteins libraries containing very large_numbers of such short peptide_sequences can be generated easily and used to discover interaction preferences of proteins these methods include phage_display or other display based_methods as well as technologies utilizing peptide microarrays such high_throughput methods are capable of generating huge_amounts of data the identification of true binding_motifs within large_datasets is a challenging_task for several reasons first binding_motifs are typically short and weak second experimental origin of the data imposes the possibility of fair level of noise and most remarkably multiple binding_motifs are often contained within the data the occurrence of more than one motif may be caused by true poly specificity of the target as well as by experimental imperfections in the case of phage_display two main_issues may occur the first problematic phenomenon is nonspecific_adsorption of phages to surfaces that were used to immobilize target_proteins and the second issue is caused by differences in phages propagation capabilitiesphages may be selected on the basis of their growth capacity rather than their binding_affinity to the target with low_cost high_throughput methods such as nextgeneration_sequencing of phage_display it is possible to obtain up to millions of unique peptide_sequences it is therefore reasonable to think of even more complicated experiments aiming to discover multiple binding_specificities of protein_complexes or even whole mixtures of proteins at once such an experimental_setup would mean an even greater number of true motifs to be identified and generally much more data to be processed demanding not only better sensitivity but also adequate computational_efficiency of methods_employed significant effort has already been put into the development of software methods for peptide data_processing part of these tools aim to process problem specific data e g to predict binding targets of mhc_molecules these approaches utilize various techniques including hidden_markov gibbs_sampling and artificial_neural it has been shown that domains interacting with short_peptides are often poly specific which leads to correlations between residue positions of recognized motifs therefore even for a single recognition domain it is necessary to capture these correlations which can be done either directly with the use of e g artificial_neural or indirectly by describing one motif with correlated positions by several motifs with uncorrelated positions the second approach is implemented in tools using multiple position_weight also known as position_specific to represent multiple specificity profiles_obtained by various techniques e g mixture_model optimization or gibbs_sampling these tools try to be versatile and allow for peptide data from any biological source to be processed but may require some prior data knowledge such as the number of clusters to identify although tools mentioned above perform well on smaller datasets of up to thousands of sequences they have not been designed to process datasets orders_of larger in this article we address_this by introducing hammock a novel software_tool for peptide sequence_clustering hammock uses profile_hmms for precise computational representation of sequence_motifs and is based on the idea of progressive cluster growth the three key_properties of this approach are i the ability to process very large_datasets ii the ability to identify multiple distinct motifs within one dataset and iii versatility as no limits are put on the origin of the data and no prior data knowledge is required hammock was used to process two datasets of different sizes and complexities another collection of large both real_and was utilized to investigate computation time requirements to maintain consistency we present results obtained by runs with default_parameters to visualize multiple_sequence of resulting clusters we use sequence_logos generated by weblogo throughout the article only alignment columns containing less than gaps are shown we presented hammocka software_tool for short_peptide sequence_clustering the tool is able to cluster large_amounts of data containing noise and to produce multiple_sequence of resulting clusters the main motivation to create hammock was to provide the ability of processing datasets originating from largescale screening of combinatorial peptide_libraries such as phage_display nevertheless the tool is universal and no limits are put on the origin or format of processed data hammock accepts input in three formats including fasta and no prior data knowledge such as the a summary of the results obtained by running hammock musi and the gibbs_sampling tool on the sh and the antibodies datasets number of clusters to identify is needed therefore hammock is applicable for a range of other data_sources such as variable_regions of lymphocyte receptors or viral_proteins it accepts virtually any set of peptide_sequences as input we performed a pilot large_scale phage_display experiment which shows the way future_experiments based on combinatorial peptide_libraries could take we demonstrated that hammock is capable of processing data originating from such an experiment and provide valuable biological_insights even when the data contain noise we also demonstrated hammocks time requirements on datasets of various sizes compared with existing_tools hammock is much faster and can process datasets orders_of larger while it achieves the best quality of clustering_results another difference is that with default_parameters hammock may remove many sequences from the result if they do not fit any cluster well this feature is beneficial in the case of large and noisy datasets and can be utilized by using hammock as a de_noising tool on the other hand in the case of small and clean datasets containing subtle sequence_motifs only this behavior may not be desired it can be changed by parameter_tuning but we estimate that for such cases some of more computationally_intensive methods such as gibbs_sampling may be more suitable there are a number of parameters allowing the user to influence clustering_results in this article hammock was shown to perform well with default_parameters but parameter_tuning will often be desirable to accommodate the diverse nature of input_data and the diverse spectrum of biological_questions that require answering if a strong motif and less noise is present in the dataset or coarsegrained clustering is desired cluster merging and extension thresholds should be lowered if a large number of small and specialized clusters is needed thresholds should be increased hammock comes as a standalone program as well as a tool for the galaxy toolbox galaxy provides a gui server functionalities and also an online storage called the galaxy tool shed which allows any galaxy server administrator or local instance user to install hammock with all its dependencies just by virtually one click the galaxy implementation makes hammock more user_friendly and allows for broad community of non expert users to use it easily in conclusion hammock satisfies the need for extremely_large peptide_datasets to be processed and thus allows for novel types of experiments based on data from various sources to be performed the user_friendly galaxy implementation gives the possibility to use this tool to a broad_spectrum of potential users hammock peptide clustering
