gene_expression application of survival analysis methodology to the quantitative analysis of lc_ms proteomics_data motivation protein_abundance in quantitative_proteomics is often based on observed spectral_features derived from liquid_chromatography lc_ms or lc_ms experiments peak_intensities are largely nonnormal in distribution furthermore lc_ms based proteomics_data frequently have large_proportions of missing peak_intensities due to censoring mechanisms on low_abundance spectral_features recognizing that the observed peak_intensities detected with the lc_ms method are all positive skewed and often left censored we propose using survival methodology to carry out differential_expression of proteins various standard statistical_techniques including non parametric tests such as the kolmogorovsmirnov and wilcoxonmann whitney rank sum tests and the parametric survival model and accelerated_failure with log normal log logistic and weibull distributions were used to detect any differentially_expressed the statistical operating characteristics of each method are explored using both real_and results survival methods generally have greater statistical_power than standard differential_expression methods when the proportion of missing protein level data is or more in particular the aft models we consider consistently achieve_greater statistical_power than standard testing procedures with the discrepancy widening with increasing missingness in the proportions proteomics is a growing field that deals with the determination of gene and cellular function at the protein level it is often of interest to the protein researcher to identify as well as quantify the amount of protein in a given biological_sample several methods and instruments are available for both the identification and quantitation of peptides within proteins including the bottom up liquid_chromatography lc_ms and lc_ms or the tandem_mass approaches in the lc_ms approach proteins are extracted from the biological_sample digested into peptides and ionized following the ionization step the ionized to whom correspondence should be addressed sample is introduced to the mass_spectrometer for scanning where the mass to charge m z and observed peak_intensities are obtained once the peak_intensities are obtained the observed features of the peptides are matched to a database for peptide_identification following the identification step the peptide level information is rolled up to the protein level in lcms ms a precursor ion is picked after the first ms step for fragmentation prior to the identification step it is often of interest to measure the abundance of proteins from the identified peptides in the sample this is the quantitation step of the analysis in bottom up ms based quantitation the estimation of protein abundances in a sample is typically carried_out on the basis of one of three quantities i spectral counts ii label_free methods or iii isotopic_labeling experiments spectral counts are simply the number of peak_intensities for a given peptide protein labelfree intensity based quantitation uses peak_intensities heights or areas under the peaks to estimate peptide or protein_abundance other label_free methods are based on the unlabeled peak_intensities associated with the mass_spectrum of the extracted ions label based_methods of quantitation which are viewed as the gold_standard for measuring protein_abundance involve the ratio of the observed peak_intensities of two isotopically_labeled samples once the protein abundances have been obtained it is often of interest to assess differentially_expressed across comparison groups the goal of differential analysis is to differentiate features across groups which can be subsequently used for biomarker_discovery or for providing additional clues for studying the causal pathways of the disease or the biological condition of interest one of the characteristics of peak_intensity data from lc_ms based proteomics is large_quantities of missing_data the missing_data patterns are often not independent of the peak_intensities of the peptides which is likely due to censoring of the peak_intensities for low_abundance peptides proteins to assess differentially_expressed across treatment groups the observed peak_intensities are often normalized imputed and transformed various imputation techniques are available for the imputation step these include the row mean imputation k nearest_neighbor knn singular_value bayesian principal_components gaussian mixture clustering and a convex combination of these methods lincmb in quantitative_proteomics it is often of interest to determine how proteins obtained from subjects under various treatment conditions differ in this article we focused on various techniques for detecting such differential expressions at the protein level we recognize the nature of peak_intensity data as positive data prone to missingness due mostly to left censoring we propose using methods from survival analysis to detect any differences at the protein level based on our application of the various techniques to the diabetes data we find that applying the aft models under with left censoring had the highest power to detect any group differences tests applied under the assumption of left censoring had the highest ability to detect differentially_expressed when compared with tests based on the assumption that the missing_data are randomly missing our simulation_study also confirms the benefit of treating the missing_data as left censored and applying the aft models overall we would recommend treating raw peak_intensity data as positive and left censored_data and apply survival methods such as the aft model with the log logistic distribution to determine any differentially_expressed many omics_technologies will be expected to give rise to censored_data to one degree or another for example array based data are fluorescence intensity_measurements nuclear_magnetic data are spectral intensity_measurements etc each of these are strictly positivein this article we applied methods from survival analysis to detect differentially_expressed based on lc_ms proteomics_data we find that applying the aft model with left censored_data leads to more proteins being considered as differentially_expressed when compared with other standard statistical_techniques which assume that the missing_data are randomly missing
