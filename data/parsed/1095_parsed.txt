compression of dna_sequence in fastq format motivation modern sequencing instruments are able to generate at least hundreds of millions short_reads of genomic_data those huge volumes of data require effective means to store them provide quick access to any record and enable fast decompression results we present a specialized compression algorithm for genomic_data in fastq format which dominates its competitor g sqz as is shown on a number of datasets from the genomes_project www genomes org availability dsrc is freely_available sun aei polsl pl dsrc one of the main tasks of bioinformatics is to collect and analyze huge genomic_data sequencing instruments are able to generate at least hundreds of millions of short_reads accompanied with annotations like quality_scores denoting uncertainties in sequence identification processes read identifications and other descriptions e g unique instrument names are also kept in the same file we propose an algorithm for effective compression of genomic reads of the described kind in the widely_accepted fastq input format and show experimental_results suggesting its supremacy over existing solutions our scheme provides fast random_access to individual records of the dataset and is capable of finding repeating sequences in reads strings we are not aware of any direct competitors to our algorithms except for g sqz presented in the experimental section there is a number of dna compressing algorithms but they deal with genomic and usually not annotated sequences rather than dna_reads the used compression techniques_include detecting exact and inexact repeats complementary palindromes higherorder coding and more unfortunately most of the known algorithms are computationally_intensive and have been tested only on small_datasets e g a few mbs a recent_trend is to exploit similarities between sequences of individuals of the same species but this is also a problem different to the one we consider here for a survey of compression techniques in computational_biology see to whom correspondence should be addressed we presented a specialized compressor dsrc for genomic_sequences with quality_scores clearly superior both in compression efficiency and performance to its only known competitor for this kind of data g sqz comparison with two well known generalpurpose compressors also puts our solution in a favorable position a carefully_designed two level structure of compressed records made it possible to extract any individual record in less than ms
