genetics_and evoker a visualization_tool for genotype intensity data genome_wide gwas which produce huge volumes of data are now being carried_out by many groups around the world creating a need for user_friendly tools for data quality_control qc and analysis one critical aspect of gwas qc is evaluating genotype cluster plots to verify sensible genotype_calling in putatively associated single_nucleotide snps evoker is a tool for visualizing genotype cluster plots and provides a solution to the computational and storage problems related to working with such large_datasets genome_wide gwas have recently transformed the landscape of complex human disease genetics by identifying hundreds of genes affecting risk for common diseases and traits while these studies have become commonplace the large volumes of data they produce still pose analytical and computational challenges among the most important of these is the importance of rigorous quality_control qc procedures which help to reduce false_positives arising from poor_quality dna population_structure hidden confounders and genotyping artifacts this last category genotype_calling artifacts persist despite the considerable effort which has been invested in genotype_calling and automated qc filters while filters like genotype call rate and hardyweinberg equilibrium can flag a proportion of poorly clustered snps the most reliable means of verifying the quality of genotypes is to visualize the genotype cluster plots for each snp individually wellcome_trust while genotype cluster visualization is critical to gwas qc it remains_challenging for many gwas research groups to do so efficiently the normalized intensity files from which genotype cluster plots are generated are extremely_large and unwieldy in the default formats from snp chip providers uncompressed text format intensities from a gwas of individuals would be hundreds of gigabytes extracting subsets of data and plotting hundreds of snps of interest is typically a tedious procedure requiring some computational sophistication moreover the rapid_proliferation of gwas has exposed a general need for freely_available easy to use to whom correspondence should be addressed tools for routine tasks as illustrated by the widespread_adoption of programs like plink for qc and association_analyses therefore we have developed evoker a java program which supports two simple and compact binary data_formats and is designed to make genotype cluster plot inspection an easy and efficient process evoker is an open_source program for visualizing genotype cluster plots designed to be integrated into qc workflows for gwas it provides a fast user_friendly and interactive interface to these large and cumbersome datasets enabling researchers without computational backgrounds to undertake this key qc step consistently while reducing the amount of time spent on the task
