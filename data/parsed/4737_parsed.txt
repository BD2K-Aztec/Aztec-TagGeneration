treepl divergence time estimation using penalized likelihood for large phylogenies ever larger phylogenies are being constructed due to the explosion of genetic data and development of high performance phylogenetic_reconstruction algorithms however most methods for calculating divergence times are limited to datasets that are orders_of smaller than recently_published large phylogenies here we present an algorithm and implementation of a divergence time method using penalized likelihood that can handle datasets of thousands of taxa we implement a method that combines the standard derivative based optimization with a stochastic simulated_annealing approach to overcome optimization challenges we compare this approach with existing software including r s pathd and beast availability source_code example files binaries and documentation for treepl are available at https github com blackrim treepl divergence times make phylogenetic hypotheses easier to interpret in light of other information on geology biogeography and co diversification a number of methods exist for transforming branch_lengths to be proportional to time however many of these methods do not scale well for phylogenies with thousands of taxa the number of species included in published phylogenies has exploded with the increase in the size of phylogenies there is the need to develop divergence time methods that are capable of handling larger datasets here we present a method implemented in the software treepl for calculating divergence time estimates using penalized likelihood on large phylogenies penalized likelihood uses a semi_parametric approach that allows for different rates on different branches but has a smoothing parameter set using cross_validation that affects how much rate differences over the tree are penalized our approach attempts to overcome the problem of local_minima a problem amplified by including more taxa
