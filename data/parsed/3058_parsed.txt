systems_biology modevo exploring modularity and evolution of protein_interaction interrogating protein_complexes and pathways in an evolutionary context provides insights into the formation of the basic functional components of the cell we developed two independent cytoscape plugins that can be cooperatively used to map evolving protein_interaction at the module level the apcluster plugin implements a recent affinity propagation ap algorithm for graph_clustering and can be applied to decompose networks into coherent modules the networkevolution plugin provides the capability to visualize selected modules in consecutive evolutionary stages availability the plugins input_data and usage scenarios are freely_available from the project_web molecular_systems are composed of many loosely coupled components that together orchestrate higher cellular_functions the emergence of this inherent modularity is only beginning to be elucidated for example up close investigation of selected protein_complexes have shown how some of them have been formed through a series of duplication and rewiring events such studies have previously focused on complexes of known d structure more recently systematic analysis based on large_scale proteinprotein_interaction ppi data have been performed for the purpose of analyzing conserved modules in ppi_networks it seems natural to employ network alignment_techniques in particular those which attempt to infer the network snapshots at previous evolutionary stages in such scenario one may first identify complexes and pathways highly_conserved in multiple species and then infer duplication deletion and rewiring events that gave rise to the observed modules ideally the entire_process should be automated and interactive allowing the user to easily_identify the conserved to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address departments of medicine and bioengineering university of california san_diego gilman drive la jolla ca usa network regions and seamlessly move between networks of different species to observe the evolutionary changes for this task we have implemented new software_tools and integrated them with the popular cytoscape platform via its plugin interface our first plugin allows for interactive comparison of networks across evolutionary stages which is a unique feature not available in other graph visualization_tools the second plugin implements a recent and already widely used affinity propagation ap algorithm thus extending the set of existing clustering and module detection methods available within cytoscape
