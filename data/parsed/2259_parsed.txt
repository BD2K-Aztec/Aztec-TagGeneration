genome_analysis ibag integrative bayesian_analysis of high_dimensional multiplatform genomics data motivation analyzing data from multi_platform genomics experiments combined with patients clinical_outcomes helps us understand the complex biological_processes that characterize a disease as well as how these processes relate to the development of the disease current data_integration approaches are limited in that they do not consider the fundamental biological_relationships that exist among the data obtained from different platforms statistical_model we propose an integrative bayesian_analysis of genomics data ibag framework for identifying important genes biomarkers that are associated with clinical_outcome this framework uses hierarchical modeling to combine the data obtained from multiple_platforms into one model results we assess the performance of our methods using several synthetic and real examples simulations show our integrative methods to have higher power to detect disease related genes than non integrative methods using the cancer_genome glioblast oma dataset we apply the ibag model to integrate gene_expression and methylation data to study their associations with patient_survival our proposed method discovers multiple methylation regulated_genes that are related to patient_survival most of which have important_biological in other diseases but have not been previously studied in glioblastoma the overarching goal of cancer_genomics is to customize patient_care decisions according to diverse genetic and epigenetic_alterations for a tumor early cancer_genomics studies focused on only a single type of alteration at a time to assess these changes e g high_resolution copy_number profiling led to the discovery of novel oncogenes in ovarian_cancer melanoma and lung_carcinoma some of these findings have already been translated into personalized cancer treatment such as imatinib for kit mutated gastrointestinal_stromal and trastuzumab for her positive breast_tumors as technologies to perform comprehensive profiling of the cancer genome have progressed different technology platforms from basic capillary_electrophoresis sequencing to advanced_forms of microarrays have been brought together on the same patient set for example the cancer_genome tcga is a worldwide research program that currently encompasses comprehensive genomic_datasets for types of cancer http cancergemone nih gov the work of tcga is motivating approaches for integrating data outputs from different types of technology platforms to identify important biomarkers related to cancer_development the key hypothesis behind these approaches is that cancer consists of hundreds of distinct_molecular changes from multiple types of genetic and epigenetic_alterations to the interactions among them each type of alteration provides a different and complementary view of the whole_genome hence integrating_multiple aspects of the genome and the underlying biological_processes to identify novel targets is essential and has the potential to improve the clinical_management of cancer the concept of integration is very broad see review by such integration studies can be divided_into three general groups according to the primary_focus of the study the focus of the first group called sequential integration studies is the sequential_analysis of heterogeneous data from different platforms for the purpose of understanding the biological evolution of disease as opposed to predicting clinical_outcome in this group data obtained on one type of platform are analyzed along with the clinical_outcome data and then a second data platform is subsequently used to clarify or confirm the results obtained from the first platform for example showed that microrna expression can be used to sort tumors from normal_tissues regardless of tumor_type the study then analyzed the relationship between the candidate target_genes for the cancer related micrornas and mrna_expression and disease status the focus of the second group of integration studies which we call biological integration studies is the analysis of biological_pathways and regulatory_mechanisms among data to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com this is an

from different platforms such as the relationship between gene_expression and protein abundances or the relationship between gene_expression and copy_number changes in patient tumor_samples the challenge for this group of studies is that the biological annotation databases used for mapping different datasets are inconsistent an r package to match array_comparative cgh and gene_expression microarray features for integrative_analysis purposes was provided by van the focus of the third group of integration studies which we term model based integration studies is the analysis of data obtained from multiple_platforms that are combined into one statistical_model to identify clinically relevant_genes and or to predict clinical_outcome instead of merging datasets or analyzing them sequentially the data from different platforms are treated equally and the most relevant_features are selected from all available platforms for example proposed a kernel based_approach to integrate data from multiple_platforms for the classification of discrete clinical_outcomes they showed that the area_under auc based on integrated data used for predictions was significantly_improved compared with the auc based on data from a single_platform however these studies treated each platform independently and ignored the underlying_biological among different platforms witten and tibshirani developed a supervised canonical correlation model to find significant axes of correlations between multiple multivariate datasets at a global chromosomal level they integrated copy_number and gene_expression data and identified linear_combinations canonical variables that are related to a clinical_outcome however they also did not take the biological_mechanisms directionality into account as we detail later in the text our proposed method_takes a different approach in modeling biological_relationships among molecular_features measured by different platforms by focusing on relationships at a genecentric level we first study the underlying_biological relating the data across the different platforms then using this information we partition gene_expression into different independent units and use this to identify genes relevant to clinical_outcome as modulated by these different platforms we hypothesize and show that compared with non integrative methods our proposed method can detect clinically_relevant gene_expression changes with greater_power and a lower false_discovery fdr in addition to obtaining results that are more biologically interpretable molecular_biology has shown that features identified on different platforms influence clinical_outcome at different levels for example in tcga studies copy_number methylation mutation status mrna_expression microrna expression and the expression of proteins in specific signaling_pathways have been measured on the same set of samples the fundamental biological_relationships among the products of these different platforms and their associations with clinical_outcome are shown in generally_speaking molecular_features measured at the transcript_level e g mrna_expression affect clinical_outcome more directly than molecular_features measured at the dna epigenetics level e g copy_number methylation and mutation status molecular_features measured at the dna level affect clinical_outcome by influencing mrna_expression similarly micrornas post transcriptional_regulators that bind to complementary_sequences on target_mrnas influence mrna through translational_repression or target degradation which then affects clinical_outcome conducting the proposed integrative_analysis is a challenge because of the complicated biological_relationships and the different intrinsic structures of various platforms for example molecular_features measured at the dna level regulate the mrna_expressions of the corresponding genes or nearby genes in contrast micrornas can regulate the mrna_expression of any gene regardless of its locus and each microrna molecule has multiple target_genes another challenge underlying this analysis is the large_scale of the different types of gene_alterations in contrast to the limited number of patient samples for such a study hence an easily implemented and efficient variable_selection method is needed for such an integration analysis we have developed the integrative bayesian_analysis of genomics data ibag model to address these challenges the main advantages of our proposed model can be summarized as follows the ibag model i uses a hierarchical_approach to model the fundamental biological_relationships underlying molecular_features obtained by different platforms ii accounts for both the influences of different platforms and the biological_relationships among the platforms in one unified_model to predict patients clinical_outcomes iii can conduct high_dimensional variable_selection which adapts to analyzing hundreds of distinct_molecular entity effects jointly in one model iv uses a bayesian_framework which allows the model enough flexibility to estimate the different intrinsic structures of biological_relationships for different high_throughput platforms and v is computationally_efficient and feasible owing to its closed forms of full conditional posterior distributions for posterior sampling the rest of this article is organized as follows in section we describe the ibag model construction along with prior formulations for continuous discrete and survival clinical_outcomes in section we introduce an innovative approach for conducting high_dimensional variable_selection using bayesian fdrs in section we illustrate the performance of the ibag model and use simulations to compare its performance with those of alternative_approaches in section we apply the ibag model to integrate gene_expression and methylation data for tcgas glioblastoma study and evaluate the associationsbetween those data and patients survival_times finally we provide a summary and discussion in section the technical_details and additional simulation_results are contained in the supplementary_material section s in this article we introduce an innovative model ibag to integrate two different platforms of omics_data and estimate their associations with clinical_outcome different from most existing integration approaches which focus on either finding biological_relationships among different platforms or predicting patient prognosis our ibag model involves a hierarchical_structure which simultaneously estimates biological_mechanisms and uses this information to find significant prognostic genes our simulation_study shows that the ibag model can simultaneously increase the power and decrease the fdr in detecting clinically relevant_genes especially for genes with expression effects modulated only by methylation moreover we can categorize all clinically relevant_genes into three groups according to different biological_mechanisms genes with expression effects modulated only by methylation genes with expression effects modulated only by other mechanisms and genes with expression effects modulated by both methylation and other mechanisms we apply the ibag model to integrate methylation data and gene_expression data from tcgas gbm dataset the results show that the ibag model outperforms the model based on data from a single layer of biological_information in both determining genes important to survival and model_fitting the main goal of the ibag model is to i identify more disease associated genes and ii achieve better predictive_power by treating gene_expression as the downstream event that is regulated by different mechanisms e g methylation copy_number and microrna we choose to treat the gene_expression as a downstream event regulated by different mechanisms so that the ibag model can help us identify more disease associated genes there are several reasons underlying this choice first acknowledging that a genes expression can be modulated by different mechanisms e g methylation copy_number and microrna even if these mechanisms do not have a direct effect on survival we can still identify genes whose modulated expressions potentially impact survival second as the measure of gene_expression from microarray_technology is usually noisy ibag can effectively_identify which part of the gene_expression is actually modulated by various factors from other platforms thus denoising the expression to find prognostic genes in addition as shown by our analysis of the gbm data if we simply use methylation information additively to gene_expression to estimate the methylation effects on patient_survival we find that many methylation effects related to survival do not significantly change the gene_expression levels the ibag model can help us eliminate these genes and obtain results that are more biologically interpretable as our main goal is to identify important genes associated with patient_survival we assume that the methylation effect on gene genes with significant gene_expression effects obtained by ibag unified_model at fdr
