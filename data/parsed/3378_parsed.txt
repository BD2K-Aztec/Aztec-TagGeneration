systems_biology optimizing a global_alignment of protein_interaction motivation the global_alignment of protein_interaction is a widely_studied problem it is an important first step in understanding the relationship between the proteins in different species and identifying_functional orthologs furthermore it can provide useful insights into the species evolution results we propose a novel algorithm piswap for optimizing global pairwise_alignments of protein_interaction based on a local optimization heuristic that has previously demonstrated its effectiveness for a variety of other intractable problems piswap can begin with different types of network_alignment approaches and then iteratively adjust the initial alignments by incorporating network topology_information trading it off for sequence_information in practice our algorithm efficiently refines other well studied alignment_techniques with almost no additional time cost we also show the robustness of the algorithm to noise in protein interaction data in addition the flexible nature of this algorithm makes it suitable for different applications of network_alignment this algorithm can yield interesting insights into the evolutionary_dynamics of related species availability our software is freely_available purposes from our web_site http piswap proteinprotein_interactions ppis are crucial to a wide_variety of cellular_processes and the interacting_proteins are likely to evolve with high correlation during the evolution of species barabasi thus the use of ppi_information can help detect functional orthologs while sequence_homology alone is often not sufficient to identify_conserved protein_complexes ever since high_throughput experimental screening_techniques such as yeast_two analysis mass_spectrometry and tandem_affinity made protein_interaction available for several species efforts have been made in the bioinformatics community to extract useful biological_information from these networks protein_interaction provide a more complete and higher_level representation of molecular_components than has been available before and also enable genome_scale understanding of the cell from a systems perspective one important goal has been to produce accurate alignments of two or more of these networks with the expectation that this would help in establishing the biological_function of unknown_proteins by exhibiting their correspondence with the proteins of another species with known biological_function and providing insight into evolutionary_dynamics alignments of protein_interaction can be broadly classified into two categories local and global alignments the distinction is similar to the one made for sequence_alignment more specifically local_network is concerned with identifying a subnetwork of one species closely matching a subnetwork of another species or having a certain topology typically multiple closely matching subnetworks are identified by such algorithms which may be mutually inconsistent on the other hand global_network attempts to map two or more networks as a whole and their output is a single mapping between the vertices of the networks furthermore the objective of global_alignment of ppi_networks is to search for the best consistent mapping between all vertices across the networks which can reveal evolutionarily_conserved functions at the system level in contrast to local_network relatively little attention has been paid to global_network in the present article which deals with the global_alignment problem we view this mapping as a bipartite matching where the vertices on one side of the bipartite_graph are the proteins in one network and the vertices on the other side are the proteins in the other network following the rapidly increasing availability of large ppi_networks many analytical and algorithmic approaches have been developed for their comparative_analysis previous work on the problem of ppi network_alignment includes networkblast m graemlin isorank isorankn path and graal although a number of other techniques exist as well a couple of these build on a to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work preliminary version of our work moreover some of these methods can handle more than two networks networkblast m uses a new data representation of networks and computes a local_alignment by greedily finding regions of high local conservation based on inferred phylogeny graemlin provides a network aligner to compute both local and global alignments by training a network_inference algorithm on a known set of alignments and then optimizing the learned objective_function on the set of all networks isorank first finds pairwise_alignment scores across all pairs of networks obtained by a spectral method on a product graph it then uses these scores in a greedy_algorithm to produce the final global_alignment the more recent isorankn uses a different method of spectral clustering on the multiple_alignment graph to compute a global_alignment of multiple ppi_networks path formulates the pairwise network_alignment as a graph_matching problem and solves its convex and concave relaxations by iteratively updating the weights and following the path of solutions thus created graal in contrast computes a sequence free pairwise_alignment by using the notion of graphlet_degree signatures as pointed_out in the literature one of the main difficulties faced by network_alignment is the lack of an accurate and reliable gold_standard for evaluation purposes another challenge is the computational_complexity of network_alignment the problem of network_alignment is a generalization of the intractable subgraph isomorphism problem a biological challenge is that a network_alignment algorithm must efficiently and effectively_identify biologically conserved functions
