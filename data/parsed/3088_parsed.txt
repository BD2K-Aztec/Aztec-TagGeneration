motifbreakr an r bioconductor_package for predicting variant effects at transcription_factor functional_annotation represents a key_step toward the understanding and interpretation of germline and somatic variation as revealed by genome_wide gwas and the cancer_genome tcga respectively gwas have revealed_numerous genetic risk_variants residing in non coding_dna associated with complex_diseases for sequences that lie within enhancers or promoters of transcription it is not straightforward to assess the effects of variants on likely transcription_factor consequently we introduce motifbreakr which allows the biologist to judge whether the sequence surrounding a polymorphism or mutation is a good match and how much information is gained or lost in one allele of the polymorphism or mutation relative to the other motifbreakr is flexible giving a choice of algorithms for interrogation of genomes with motifs from many public sources that users can choose from motifbreakr can predict effects for novel or previously described variants in public_databases making it suitable for tasks beyond the scope of its original design lastly it can be used to interrogate any genome cura ted within bioconductor availability_and https github com simon coetzee motifbreakr www bioconductor org transcription_factor tfbs are typically short dna_sequence that facilitate binding of a specific transcription_factors via proteindna_interactions there are some software_tools that facilitate the scoring of non coding variants with respect to either predefined or user specified motifs regulomedb haploreg and funseq each enable assessment of the effects of single_nucleotide on predicted binding_sites each of these packages has strengths but does not provide the analysis independent of its other functions many users generate their own motifs but users are limited to built in motif collections and functions the functions are largely unavailable to non human data_sets we hereby introduce an r bioconductor software_package called motifbreakr that addresses these major_concerns implementation in r has the advantage of universality r and bioconductor are widely used for bioinformatics and well supported across different platforms including galaxy in principle a snp label contains all the information necessary to characterize a variant or mutation since it points to information in external databases somewhere our package makes it possible to rapidly explore tfbs disruptions for a large number of snps within the r framework with no need to install third_party software or massage arcane output_files for downstream_analysis although the intention is to study the relationship of human variation to disease use of motifbreakr is not limited to this application indeed one may access any genome in bsgenome and query it with custom snps and pwms or specify organism specific sets of pwms from motifdb motifbreakr uses a highly_efficient information contentbased algorithm for discriminating between truly disruptive variants versus neutral because motifbreakr is designed to work with the existing bioconductor framework we believe it to be the most flexible and extensible package available for this type of analysis example of motifbreakr output from plotmb function for a previously_published snp genomic_sequence and coordinates are at the bottom of the display the positions of the matches represented light blue boxes the position of the snp within the motif is indicated with red bounding box and alternate allele below and as red text on the motif logo position bar above the motif logos generated from motifstack are shown above using the color conventions of the genomic_sequence below
