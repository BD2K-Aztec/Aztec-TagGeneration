methylmix an r package for identifying dna_methylation driven genes dna_methylation is an important mechanism_regulating gene_transcription and its role in carcinogenesis has been extensively_studied hyper and hypomethylation of genes is an alternative mechanism to deregulate gene_expression in a wide_range of diseases at the same time high_throughput dna_methylation assays have been developed generating vast_amounts of genome_wide measurements yet few tools exist that can formally identify hypo and hypermethylated genes that are predictive of transcription and thus functionally_relevant for a particular disease to accommodate this lack of tools we developed methylmix an algorithm implemented in r to identify disease specific hyper and hypomethylated genes methylmix is based on a beta mixture_model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal dna methylation_state methylmix introduces a novel metric the differential_methylation value or dm value defined as the difference of a methylation_state with the normal methylation_state finally matched gene_expression data are used to identify besides differential transcriptionally predictive methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that effect gene_expression dna_methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic aberrations underlying oncogenesis besides genetic_mutations hyper and hypomethylation of genes is an alternative mechanism that is capable of altering the normal state and driving a wide_range of diseases prior studies have identified hypo or hypermethylation based on heuristic measures for example in breast_cancer additionally computational_methods have been developed to identify differentially_methylated for specific dna_methylation platforms however few methods formalize the identification of dna_methylation driven genes using a model based_approach we identified three key criteria that should be addressed to derive key methylation driven genes first the determination of the degree of methylation cannot hinge on arbitrary thresholds as is commonly done second the assessment of a gene as hyper or hypomethylated must be made in comparison to normal_tissue finally the identification of genes that are hyper or hypomethylated should be transcriptionally predictive effect thereby implying that their methylation is functionally_relevant we designed methylmix to accommodate these three criteria to identify methylation driven genes in diseases bullet step ii the methylation states of a gene are identified using univariate beta mixture modeling to identify subgroups of patients with similar dna methylation_level for a specific cpg_site we use the bayesian_information bic to select the number of methylation states by iteratively adding a new mixture component if the bic score improves each beta mixture component is referred to as a methylation_state and represented by its mean methylation_level bullet step iii hyper and hypomethylated genes are defined relative to normal by comparing the methylation_levels of each methylation_state to the mean of the dna methylation_levels of normal tissue_samples using a wilcoxon_rank based on this test differential methylation_values or dm values are created defined as the difference of a methylation_state with the normal methylation_state genes with methylation states different from normal are called differential genes the final output of methylmix is genes that are both transcriptionally predictive and differential together with the parameters of their methylation states additionally a matrix of dm values is part of the output and can be used in subsequent analysis for example to define methylation driven subgroups using clustering_algorithms methylmix is an r package that identifies hyper and hypomethylated genes using a beta mixture modeling_approach methylmix also quantifies the effect dna_methylation has on gene_expression thereby identifying transcriptionally predictive dna_methylation events methylmix can be used both to study single genes as in the example above or in parallel mode to build methylmix models genome_wide methylmix requires a largecohort to identify methylation states and capture dna_methylation heterogeneity present in a particular disease we used methylmix and their associated dm values to identify driver_genes on dataset sizes of samples ore more and on more than tcga cases across tissues to identify methylation driven subgroups in summary methylmix offers a new tool to identify methylation driven genes providing a complimentary source of information to copy_number and mutation spectra to identify disease driver_genes
