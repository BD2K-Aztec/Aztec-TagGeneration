gene_expression tsser an automated method to identify transcription_start in prokaryotic_genomes from differential rna sequencing_data accurate identification of transcription_start tsss is an essential step in the analysis of transcription regulatory_networks in higher_eukaryotes the capped analysis of gene_expression technology enabled comprehensive annotation of tsss in genomes such as those of mice and humans in bacteria an equivalent approach termed differential rna_sequencing drna_seq has recently been proposed but the application of this approach to a large number of genomes is hindered by the paucity of computational_analysis methods with few exceptions when the method has been used annotation of tsss has been largely done manually results in this work we present a computational_method called tsser that enables the automatic inference of tsss from drna_seq data the method rests on a probabilistic_framework for identifying both genomic positions that are preferentially enriched in the drna_seq data as well as preferentially captured relative to neighboring genomic_regions evaluating our approach for tss calling on several publicly_available datasets we find that tsser achieves high consistency with the curated lists of annotated tsss but identifies many additional tsss therefore tsser can accelerate genome_wide identification of tsss in bacterial_genomes and can aid in further characterization of bacterial transcription regulatory_networks availability tsser is freely_available under gpl license atidentification of transcription_start tsss is a key_step in the study of transcription regulatory_networks it enables identification of promoter_regions and thereby the focused search for binding_sites of transcription_factors although for species such as mouse and human methods to capture tsss have been developed years_ago owing to differences in messenger_rna mrna_processing these methods cannot be applied to bacteria recently however a method for genome_wide identification of bacterial tsss has been proposed the method called differential rna_sequencing drna_seq uses the mono phosphate dependent terminator exonuclease tex that specifically degrades mono phosphorylated rna species such as processed rna mature ribosomal_rnas and transfer rnas whereas primary mrna_transcripts that carry a triphosphate remain intact this approach results in an enrichment of primary_transcripts allowing tsss to be identified by comparison of the tex treated samples to control untreated ones as an automated computational_method to identify tsss based on drna_seq data has not been available tss annotation based on drna_seq data required substantial effort on the part of the curators the aim of our work was to develop an automated analysis method to support future analyses of drna_seq data we here introduce a rigorous computational_method that enables identification of a large proportion of bona_fide tsss with relative_ease the method is based on quantifying enrichment of tsss and also the significance of their expression relative to nearby putative tsss benchmarking our method on several recently_published datasets we find that the identified tsss are in good agreement with those annotated manually and that a relatively large number of additional tsss that also have the expected transcription regulatory_signals are identified tsser is freely_available www clipz unibas ch tsser index php deep_sequencing has truly revolutionized molecular_biology it enabled not only the assembly of the genomes of thousands of species but also annotation of transcribed regions in these genomes and the generation of a variety of maps for dna_binding factors non_coding and rna_binding factors highthroughput studies revealed that not only eukaryotic but also properties of tsss that were present only in the reference list left both in the reference and the tsser list middle or only in the tsser list right a box plot of averaged normalized expression the boxes are drawn from the first to the third quantile and the median is shown with the red line b box plot of the displacement distribution relative to the start_codon c scatterplots of versus local enrichment both shown as percentage d sequence_logos indicating the positiondependent direction frequencies of nucleotides_upstream of the tss datasets are shown from top to bottom rather than from left to right prokaryotic_genomes are more complex than initially thought in particular bacterial_genomes encode relatively large_numbers of non_coding with regulatory_functions and antisense_transcripts such transcripts are of particular interest because they are frequently produced in response to and contribute to the adaptation to specific stimuli the availability of a large number of bacterial_genomes further enables identification of regulatory_elements through comparative genomicsbased approaches however these methods benefit from accurate annotation of tsss that enables a focused search for transcription_factor although the data supporting tss identification can be obtained with relative_ease the annotation of tsss has so_far been carried_out manually which is tedious and likely leads to an incomplete set of tsss only recently as our manuscript was in the review process methods for automated annotation of tsss based on drna_seq data started to emerge see also http www tbi univie ac at newpapers pdfs tbip pdf the method that we propose here is meant to provide a starting_point into the process of tss curation because it uses drna_seq data it is clear that only tsss from which there is active_transcription during the experiment can be annotated as we have determined in the benchmark against the h pylori there remain tsss for which the expression evidence is poor yet have the properties of bona_fide tsss additional samples covering conditions in which these tsss are expected to be expressed are necessary to identify them alternatively they can be brought in during the process of manual_curation nonetheless the advantage of an unbiased automated method such as the one we propose here is that it allows the discovery of tsss that may not be expected or easily evaluated such as those of antisense_transcripts alternative tsss and tsss corresponding to novel genes furthermore this method can provide an initial set of high_confidence tsss that can be used to train more complex models of transcription_regulation which could be used to iteratively identify additional tsss that may be supported by a small number of reads to illustrate this point we here used an hmm which we trained on high_confidence tsss from the common category to provide an additional list of putative tsss that appear to have appropriate transcription regulatory_signals but that were not captured with high_abundance or enrichment in the experiment supplementary thirty six percent of the tsss that were only present in the reference annotation are part of this list more sophisticated versions of this approach could be used toward comprehensive annotation of tsss in bacterial_genomes finally the method can be applied to other systems in which genomic_regions give rise to an increased number of transcripts in specific conditions we have proposed an approach for genome_wide identification of tsss in bacteria which uses drna_seq data to quantify the and local enrichment in reads at putative tsss and their corresponding significance the method is implemented in an automated pipeline which we applied to several recently_published drna_seq datasets a thorough benchmarking of the tsss proposed by our method relative to manual_curation indicates that the method_performs in identifying known tsss and is able to further detect novel tsss that have the expected properties of bona_fide tss thus our method should enable rapid identification of tsss in bacterial_genomes starting from drna_seq data
