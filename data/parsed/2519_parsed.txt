integrative_analysis for identifying joint modular patterns of gene_expression and drug response data motivation the underlying relationship between genomic factors and the response of diverse cancer drugs still remains_unclear a number of studies showed that the heterogeneous responses to anticancer treatments of patients were partly associated with their specific changes in gene_expression and somatic alterations the emerging large_scale pharmacogenomic data provide us valuable opportunities to improve existing therapies or to guide early_phase clinical_trials of compounds under development however how to identify the underlying combinatorial patterns among pharmacogenomics data are still a challenging issue results in this study we adopted a sparse network regularized partial least square snpls method to identify joint modular patterns using large_scale pairwise gene_expression and drug response data we incorporated a molecular_network to the sparse partial least square model to improve the module accuracy via a network based penalty we first demonstrated the effectiveness of snpls using a set of simulation_data and compared it with two typical methods further we applied it to gene_expression for genes and pharmacological profiles for anti_cancer across cancer_cell consisting of diverse types of human_cancers we identified gene drug co modules each of which consists of cell_lines genes and drugs on average the majority of identified co modules have significantly functional_implications and coordinated gene drug associations the modular analysis here provided us new insights into the molecular_mechanisms of how drugs_act and suggested new drug_targets for therapy of certain types of cancers availability_and a matlab_package of snpls is available at http page amss ac cn shihua zhang the increasing amount of available high_throughput data_sets at both levels of genomic_data and drug response data provide us the opportunities for large_scale integrative_analysis by computational_methods this situation also enables us to study the underlying_mechanisms of drug_actions from the perspective of gene_regulation in general drugs function in human_body by binding to their targets or altering their targets activity to perturb biological_systems previous_studies suggested that one drugone target_therapies cannot effectively treat complex_diseases likecancers which are caused by complex biological_processes in other words drug molecules often interact with multiple_targets known as polypharmacology additionally the same mechanism of action or target is shared by more than one drug actually in clinical practice some drug_combinations were adopted as valuable and promising therapies such as thiazide_diuretics and angiotensin_converting for hypertension glyburide and metformin for type_diabetes saracatinib and trastuzumab for breast_cancer the multiple tomultiple relationships between drugs and their targets imply that it is valuable to discover combinatorial gene drug patterns to gain novel insights into molecular_mechanisms and examine new drug_targets for therapy the nci project employed an ensemble of human_cancer to screen over chemical_compounds and natural_products which greatly_facilitated the pharmacological_studies however this project only used cell_lines which limited further deep exploration fortunately two large_scale pharmacogenomic studies cancer_cell and cancer genome_project cgp published diverse types of genomic_data such as gene_expression chromosomal copy_number mutation and pharmacological data across hundreds of cell_lines which provided valuable resources to reveal gene drug associations both studies adopted a multivariate variable_selection technique the elastic_net method to systematically discover genomic markers of drug_sensitivity in cancer_cell however they only focused on uncovering genomic predictors of each drug independently and failed to determine coherent gene drug patterns in recent_years a number of integrative methods were developed for identifying combinatorial patterns in multiple_data for different purpose for example proposed singular_value based statistical_models to study the regulatory relationship between multi_dimensional predictors and responses developed a joint non_negative nmf framework andintroduced a sparse multi block partial_least smbpls regression_method to simultaneously analyze_multiple types of genomic_data to identify multi_dimensional regulatory_modules in addition network_structure such as pathways and gene_gene with respect to input variables plays a complementary_role in the integrative_analysis for example developed a network constrained regularization procedure to analyze genomic_data ma and kosorok anddrew more attention towards pathway based_methods to identify differential gene pathways adapted a network regularized joint nmf method to discover mirna gene regulatory_modules designed a sparse group laplacian shrinkage method to integrate_multiple cancer_prognosis data_sets to select gene markers particularly developed the ping_pong algorithm ppa to identify gene drug co modules by combining the gene_expression and drug response data from nci however this method tends to identify co modules relating to a very limited number of cell_lines e g about of all identified co modules only cover one or two cell_lines which is unreasonable and inconsistent with the definition of a co module in addition the sizes of these co modules are very large majority of which contain thousands of genes and hundreds of drugs this makes these co modules impractical in clinical_trials and leads to vast_amounts of redundant information moreover prior_knowledge on gene interactions was not considered in this study which could provide valuable combinational signals to improve the module discovery accuracy in this study we adopted a sparse network regularized partial least square snpls method to identify combinatorial gene drug co modules by integrating gene_expression and drug response data across a set of cell_lines as well as a gene interaction_network the standard partial least square pls is a class of methods for investigating the relations between two sets of observed variables by means of maximizing the covariance between their corresponding latent_variables however it doesnt perform variable_selection for high_dimensional phamacogenomic data which makes the results lack of biological interpretability hence a few types of sparse pls spls methods were applied to the genomic_data to our knowledge there was yet no study to incorporate network_structure into the spls framework here we first proposed a snpls model to incorporate a gene interaction_network moreover we obtained the next co module by subtracting the signals of a former one from the data_matrices which can overcome the redundancy problem of ppa to some extent to demonstrate its effectiveness we applied snpls to a set of simulated_data and compared it with two typical methods spls and ppa the results showed that snpls performed significantly better than spls and ppa in terms of specificity and sensitivity we also applied snpls to a biological data_set consisting of gene_expression of genes and drug response data of anticancer_drugs across cell_lines cgp we identified gene drug co modules and majority of them are significantly related to known functions cancers and coordinated gene drug overview of the snpls for identifying gene drug co modules a comodule is a subset of genes and drugs exhibiting_similar profiles across a subset of samples determined by the weight variables g and d of snpls applied in pairwise gene_expression data x and drug response data y a gene interaction_network g is incorporated to enhance the modular characteristics integrative_analysis for identifying joint modular patternsassociations these gene drug patterns provide us insights into potential_drug and drug_combinations for cancer_therapy deciphering the multiple to multiple relationships between drugs and their targets is crucial for studying the mechanisms of drug_actions and developing_effective treatment for patients meanwhile the dramatic accumulation of large_scale genomic_data and drug response data from the same cell_lines provides us the unprecedented_opportunities to identify gene drug joint modular patterns to decode these relationships from the perspective of gene_regulation in this study we developed a method snpls to integrate these two data as well as a gene interaction_network to identify gene drug co modules when compared with spls snpls employs the network_structure as prior_knowledge such that genes in each co module tend to be closely connected in the network which makes such a co module more biologically interpretable we applied snpls to a pairwise gene_expression and drug response data from cell_lines covering a wide_range of tumor_types and identified gene drug co modules most of these co modules displayed_significant functional_connections from functional_interpretation of gene drug and cell_line views for drug members of the same co module they often have the same related targets or have effects on the same biological_processes and pathways in some related_diseases these observations suggested that the co modules can help us to find new drug_combinations or similarities for treatment of certain cancer or provide new drug_target candidates we may study the following aspects to extend snpls in future_studies first we used a coordinate descend algorithm to solve the objective_function which may be improved with more computationally_efficient algorithms second besides using a gene interaction_network we can also incorporate drug drug similarities or interactions to improve the accuracy of module discovery third snpls may be further adapted to consider the potential negative correlation of two genes in the network regularized term i e taking the sign of weight variable g into account finally with the accumulation of abundant data in biology and pharmacology we can extend this method to similar pairwise biological data for joint modular analysis comparison of all the enriched go biological_processes of gene_modules detected by snpls and spls for each go biological_process we computed enrichment_scores log q value with benjamini corrected q values and the highest_scores among all modules were taken as the final score of this go biological_process for each method the scores for snpls were plotted against those of spls dash lines along the horizontal_and directions both indicate the significance threshold the points in the top left part represent the significantly_enriched go biological_process exclusively by snpls co modules whereas the points in the bottom right part are ones exclusively by spls co modules a set of representative terms are shown points above the central diagonal line represent terms that are more significantly_enriched using snpls than spls indicating that snpls can identify more biological relevant gene_modules than spls by incorporating the prior gene network
