analyzing circadian expression data by harmonic regression_based on autoregressive spectral estimation motivation circadian_rhythms are prevalent in most organisms identification of circadian regulated_genes is a crucial step in discovering underlying pathways and processes that are clock controlled such genes are largely detected by searching periodic patterns in microarray_data however temporal gene_expression usually have a short time series with low sampling_frequency and high levels of noise this makes circadian rhythmic analysis of temporal microarray_data very challenging results we propose an algorithm named arser which combines time domain and frequency_domain analysis for extracting and characterizing rhythmic expression_profiles from temporal microarray_data arser employs autoregressive spectral estimation to predict an expression_profiles periodicity from the frequency_spectrum and then models the rhythmic patterns by using a harmonic regression_model to fit the time series arser describes the rhythmic patterns by four parameters period phase amplitude and mean level and measures the multiple testing significance by false_discovery q value when tested on well defined periodic and non periodic short time series data arser was superior to two existing and widely used methods cosopt and fishers g test during identification of sinusoidal and non sinusoidal periodic patterns in short noisy and non stationary time series finally analysis of arabidopsis microarray_data using arser led to identification of a novel set of previously_undetected non sinusoidal periodic transcripts which may lead to new insights into molecular_mechanisms of circadian_rhythms availability arser is implemented by python and r all source codes are available from http circadian_rhythm is one of the most well studied periodic processes in living_organisms dna microarray_technologies have often been applied in circadian_rhythm studies thus we can monitor the mrna_expression of the whole_genome level which is an effective way to simultaneously identify many hundreds_or of periodic transcripts the matter to be addressed is which genes are rhythmically expressed based on their gene_expression this can be classified as a periodicity identification problem however there are computational challenges when dealing with this issue sparse determination of sampling_rate and short periods of data_collection for microarray_experiments circadian microarray_experiments are usually designed to collect data every h over a course of h generating expression_profiles with or time points yamada and ueda to whom correspondence should be addressed in this study we present an automated algorithm for identifying periodic patterns in large_scale temporal gene_expression it employs harmonic regression_based on ar spectral_analysis to identify and model circadian_rhythms compared with separate frequency_domain or time domain methods our methodology is a joint strategy which analyzes the time series through both frequency and time domains testing on synthetic and real microarray_data showed that our novel method was computationally optimal and substantially more accurate than two existing and widely used rhythmicity detection techniques cosopt and fishers g test in addition our method identifies a novel set of rhythmically expressed arabidopsis genes which may supply more valuable information for further study of plant circadian systems
