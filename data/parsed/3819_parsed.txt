qaarm quasi anharmonic autoregressive model reveals molecular_recognition pathways in ubiquitin motivation molecular_dynamics md_simulations have dramatically improved the atomistic understanding of protein_motions energetics and function these growing datasets have necessitated a corresponding emphasis on trajectory analysis methods for characterizing simulation_data particularly since functional protein_motions and transitions are often rare and or intricate events observing that such events give rise to long_tailed spatial_distributions we recently_developed a higher order_statistics based dimensionality_reduction method called quasi anharmonic analysis qaa for identifying biophysically relevant reaction coordinates and substates within md_simulations further characterization of conformation space should consider the temporal_dynamics specific to each identified substate results our model uses hierarchical_clustering to learn energetically coherent substates and dynamic modes of motion from a s ubiqutin simulation autoregressive ar modeling within and between states enables a compact and generative description of the conformational landscape as it relates to functional transitions between binding poses lacking a predictive component qaa is extended here within a general ar model appreciative of the trajectorys temporal dependencies and the specific local dynamics accessible to a protein within identified energy wells these metastable_states and their transition_rates are extracted within a qaa derived subspace using hierarchical markov_clustering to provide parameter_sets for the second order ar model we show the learned model can be extrapolated to synthesize trajectories of arbitrary length conformational changes in proteins constitute the underlying behavior of cellular_regulation as part of regulating cellular_homeostasis proteins perform a number of functions through native fluctuations at multiple length and timescales a variety of experimental_techniques have illuminated the linkage between protein dynamics and function however resolving the precise spatio_temporal relationships in protein_motions which confer biological_function remains a long_standing challenge in protein biochemistry henzler to whom correspondence should be addressed governing the proteins rich conformational_space is a highdimensional energy_landscape with multiple hills and valleys to characterize this energy surface theoretical and computational_modeling of protein dynamics have been widely used as have molecular_dynamics md and monte_carlo techniques to provide atomistic insights into protein fluctuation these techniques are now being extensively used to investigate various biophysical and biochemical_processes including protein ligand_binding protein_folding and enzyme catalysis as the timescales accessible to all atom md and other coarsegrained approaches continue to reach the micro and millisecond timescales the data generated from such simulations can potentially reach o petabytes the availability of large_datasets that cover the native_state dynamics and folding and unfolding pathways of the entire foldome called dynameomics van_der has allowed scientists to simulate over proteins with a combined timescale of s projects such as folding home have also accelerated the availability of large_datasets of protein_folding trajectories as have specialized hardware such as anton field programmable gate arrays fpga and gpus the availability of such datasets while useful has created new challenges in i extracting low_dimensional biophysically relevant coordinates that elucidate how the protein functions for example how a protein recognizes its binding_partner ii separating the landscape spanned by the simulations or even groups of simulations into a coherent set of conformational_substates iii quantifying the intrinsic structural_and within a substate and finally iv determining transition_rates between these conformational_substates indeed important dynamical phenomena within simulated trajectories must be extracted from an enormous quantity of non specific ambient fluctuations clustering techniques for mining this noisy conformational_space often use structural similarity_measures such as root_mean rmsd which quantifies an average value of structural deviation however functional motions need not elicit large global rmsd values indeed localized protein regions commonly exhibit small but important flexibility these observations motivated us to examine the statistical nature of atomic fluctuations from long timescale simulations our studies across multiple simulations andpage i i i
