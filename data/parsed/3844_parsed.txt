systems_biology quantproreloaded quantitative analysis of microspot immunoassays protein microarrays are well established as sensitive tools for proteomics particularly the microspot immunoassay mia platform enables a quantitative analysis of phospho proteins in complex solutions e g cell_lysates or blood_plasma and with low_consumption of samples and reagents despite numerous biological and clinical_applications of mias there is currently no user_friendly open_source data analysis software available with versatile options for data analysis and data visualization here we introduce the open_source quantproreloaded that is specifically_designed for the analysis of data from mia experiments availability_and quantproreloaded is written in r and java and is open for download under the bsb license ata robust experimental_platform to assess the abundance and activity of many proteins in parallel in biological and clinical samples is a prerequisite to obtain a better understanding of signaling_networks thus a careful and systematic analysis of samples from healthy and diseased patients promises to facilitate also the detection of new biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis microspot immunoassays mias can determine the abundance as well as the activity of different proteins and other analytes in parallel the mia technology is comparable to the enzyme_linked elisa approach but is superior in terms of its lower sample and reagent consumption and a vastly improved dynamic range capture antibodies that are specific for a particular analyte or posttranslational_modification e g phosphorylation are immobilized on a solid_surface subdivided into several sub arrays blocks each block is incubated with a different biological_sample so that the immobilized antibodies capture their specific analytes in the detection step suitable antibodies_directed a different epitope of the respective target are utilized contributing to the highthe accuracy analysis determines the accuracy of the calibration by crossvalidation of the calibrator data_points thus of the calibrator data_points of each concentration are used to fit a calibrator curve and the remaining data_points are used to re estimate the protein concentration the overall accuracy is one minus the normalized distance between the real protein concentration and the estimated protein concentration thus a result of indicates that there is no difference between the real protein concentration and the estimated protein concentration several robust linear_and functions are included as option to fit a calibrator curve and other functions can easily be integrated the resulting accuracy plot visualizes how accurately the analyte_concentration can be re estimated using a certain algorithm to fit the calibrator curve in addition the calibrator curve displaying the single calibrator data_points is shown the measurement analysis is designed to estimate the target protein concentration of the samples and can be used independently of the accuracy analysis a calibrator curve is calculated using all calibrator data_points and serves as basis for the calculation of the analyte_concentration in each sample spots can be excluded from the analysis by marking them in the image_analysis e g spotfinder and genepix and setting the remove marked spots option to yes the measurement analysis produces two tables as output the first one contains the estimated analyte concentrations for all samples and the second one lists the median as well as the median absolute deviation for all analyte concentrations of all technical and biological_replicates furthermore a calibrator plot displaying the calibrator curve the calibrator data_points a confidence_interval as well as the data_points of measurement samples is generated as well for further information about the displayed confidence_intervals can be found in supplementary_material in case of dynamic measurements a time course plot is returned to facilitate a fast comparison between the median concentration levels of a particular protein at different time points data from the time course example inresult from dose_dependent measurements of receptor_tyrosine signaling in particular the human breast_cancer was exposed to different concentrations of epidermal_growth egf and the formation of phosphorylated_erk was monitored six slides with blocks were used to analyze the measurements and scanned with an odyssey infrared_imaging system at a resolution of m at nm spot signal_intensities were quantified using the genepix pro software and the results were saved as gpr files see_supplementary for further details on the protocol
