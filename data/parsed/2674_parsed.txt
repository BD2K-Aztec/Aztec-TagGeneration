large_scale model_quality for improving protein tertiary_structure motivation sampling structural_models and ranking them are the two major challenges of protein_structure traditional protein_structure prediction_methods generally use one or a few quality_assessment qa methods to select the best predicted models which cannot consistently select relatively better models and rank a large number of models well results here we develop a novel large_scale model qa method in conjunction with model clustering to rank and select protein structural_models it unprecedentedly applied model qa methods to generate consensus model rankings followed by model refinement based on model combination i e averaging our experiment demonstrates that the large_scale model qa approach is more consistent and robust in selecting models of better quality than any individual qa method our method was blindly tested during the th critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp as multicom group it was officially ranked third out of all human and server predictors according to the total scores of the first models predicted for casp protein_domains and second according to the total scores of the best of the five models predicted for these domains multicoms outstanding performance in the extremely competitive casp experiment proves that our large_scale qa approach together with model clustering is a promising solution to one of the two major problems in protein_structure modeling availability_and the web_server is available at http sysbio rnet missouri edu multicom cluster human protein tertiary_structure has been an important scientific problem for few decades especially in bioinformatics and computational_biology despite more and more native structures are included in protein_data pdb database the gap between the sequenced proteins and the native structures is still enlarging due to the exponential_increase of protein_sequences produced by large_scale genome and transcriptome_sequencing it is estimated that of protein_sequences have the native structures in pdb database therefore accurate computational_methods for protein tertiary_structure that are much cheaper and faster than experimental structure_determination techniques are needed to reduce this large sequence structure gap furthermore computational structure_prediction are important for obtaining the structures of membrane_proteins whose structures are hard to be determined by experimental_techniques such as x_ray the two major problems of protein_structure are model sampling and model ranking the former is to generate a number of structural_models conformations for a protein target and the latter is to rank these models and to select the presumably best ones as final predictions the two main ways of generating protein models are template_based and template free modeling template_based methods use the known structures templates of the proteins that are homologous or analogous to a target protein to construct structural_models for the target for instance we developed a large_scale model qa technique in conjunction with model clustering and refinement to improve protein tertiary_structure inspired by the previous work that integrated several primary qa methods our method that combined a large number of protein model qa methods reliably and consistently improved protein model rankingone of the major challenges of protein_structure for the first time we demonstrate that this large_scale consensus qa approach is more robust and accurate than any individual quality method by integrating their strength together our tertiary_structure based on this method outperformed all the server predictors during the very competitive casp experiment in the casp official assessment also ranked our method as one of the top three best tertiary_structure prediction_methods on all the casp human targets this outstanding performance demonstrates our large_scale model qa approach is a promising direction to advance the state of the art of protein model ranking and selection moreover our approach adopts an open qa system into which adding more complimentary methods may potentially improve the ranking but incorporating redundant methods does not necessarily lead to an improvement however our general combination approach demonstrates the importance of developing more individual qa methods and the possibility of optimally combining them together to advance the field of protein_structure
