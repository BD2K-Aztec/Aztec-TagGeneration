genome_analysis tasuke a web_based visualization program for large_scale resequencing data because an enormous amount of sequence_data is being collected a method to effectively display sequence_variation information is urgently_needed tasuke is a web_application that visualizes large_scale resequencing data generated by next generation sequen_cing technologies and is suitable for rapid data release to the public on the web the variation and read_depths of multiple_genomes as well as annotations can be shown simultaneously at various scales we demonstrate the use of tasuke by applying it to rice and human_genome resequencing datasets availability_and the tasuke program package and user_manual are available from http tasuke dna affrc go jp recent_advances ngs_technologies have allowed the rapid production of a tremendous amount of genomic sequence_data at a low_cost this has naturally led to the resequencing of hundreds_or of genomes such as the human_genomes http www genomes org and the genomes_project in arabidopsis http www genomes org a method for comparing dozens of genomes in an effective_manner is therefore urgently_needed although a few stand alone programs for comparative genome visualization have been developed to our knowledge there is no web_based application that can handle dozens or more resequencing data of large_genomes from higher_eukaryotes the basic requirements of a visualization program for genome_wide resequencing data are as follows first a large amount of data obtained from tens or hundreds of samples from a species with genomes of mb need to be displayed in a smooth manner an overview of ngs read_mapping results needs to be shown so that users can grasp read_coverage of a genome at the hundred to million base scale at a glance second the use of storage and memory resources for the data browser should be minimal and small enough to be handled by the average computer server it is not realistic to load an enormous amount of mapped read data from individual samples one by one with a stand alone program on pc therefore a client server system in which an efficient program runs on the server is preferred third it should be possible to share the data with collaborators or the public in general data from resequencing studies that are published as figures and tables in an article are not sufficient to reproduce a studys results whereas raw short_reads registered in sequence_read databases and resultant single_nucleotide snp data are informative for experimental researchers who seek polymorphisms at the genome_wide level a browser that can effectively address hundreds of genomes and display a large number of polymorphic_sites is needed here we present tasuke a web_application for the visualization of large_scale resequencing data obtained from at least genomes this application allows users to rapidly release their own data on the web variant frequencies read_coverage and gene annotation_information are shown simultaneously at various scales tasuke uses a window analysis so that users can get a birds eye view of the snp density whether the region has no snps or no mapped_reads which are generally omitted in vcf format the frequency of variation occurrence and or average depth are shown in a block that corresponds to a region scalable from bp to kb with colored gradations blue for snps red for insertions_deletions and gray or yellow for depth the maximum number of blocks displayed in a window is so that up to mb can be viewed at the most precise level individual nucleotides and translated amino_acids can be shown by clicking on a block a window of detailed information about nucleotide variations and depth pops up to find mutations that possibly affect phenotypes the effect information of each variant such as nonsynonymous changes and frame shifts which can be added to a vcf file by snpeff is shown by selecting snpeff in the menu bar and m if a sample name is clicked the reference_genome is reset to the selected sample and variant frequencies are recalculated for all genomes this reference switch function is useful to look over variations derived from different origins from the tools menu as a demonstration we applied tasuke to resequencing data from rice and human samples so that users can experience the functions of tasuke first we used resequencing data from rice genomes at coverage which was downloaded from the ddbj sequence_read the short_reads of rice were mapped to the reference_genome by bwa second alignments of human_genome resequencing data generated by the genomes_project were downloaded ftp ftp trace ncbi nih gov genomes ftp and individuals who represent subpopulations were arbitrarily selected variant and read depth_information were obtained from both datasets by using samtools the annotations from the rice annotation project database and ensembl were also stored in mysql databases these datasets are accessible through tasuke at http tasuke dna affrc go jp
