structural_bioinformatics gaia automated quality_assessment of protein_structure models_motivation increasing use of structural_modeling for understanding structurefunction relationships in proteins has led to the need to ensure that the protein models being used are of acceptable_quality quality of a given protein_structure can be assessed by comparing various intrinsic structural_properties of the protein to those observed in high_resolution protein_structures results in this study we present tools to compare a given structure to high_resolution we assess packing by calculating the total void_volume the percentage of unsatisfied hydrogen_bonds the number of steric clashes and the scaling of the accessible_surface we assess covalent geometry by determining bond_lengths angles dihedrals and rotamers the statistical parameters for the above measures obtained from high_resolution enable us to provide a quality_score that points to specific areas where a given protein structural model needs improvement availability_and we provide these tools that appraise protein_structures in the form of a web_server gaia http chiron dokhlab org gaia evaluates the packing and covalent geometry of a given protein_structure and provides quantitative_comparison of the given structure to high_resolution modeling protein_structure has become an integral part of biological studies via providing experimentally testable_predictions of molecular_interactions similarly comparative modeling plays an important role in expanding the structural landscape of proteins however important quality_control steps are essential to ensure that any given protein structural model conforms to known properties of proteins starting from its covalent geometry to ideal atomic packing several studies have measured properties like bond_lengths bond_angles and bond torsions allowable in protein_structure other studies have also benchmarked properties like steric clashes hydrogen_bonding and rotamer outliers in this study we systematically determine the distribution of these structural_parameters as well as other properties such as solvent_accessibility and void_volume using high_resolution structures based on statistical_analysis we introduce gaia a new web_based with filters that systematically report on protein_structure quality we select structural filters that represent some of the important features in stable protein_folds i close packing in the buried core of the protein which minimizes the void_volume in the protein core ii minimal number of free polar charged_residues in the buried core of the protein and iii minimal number of sterically overlapping atoms these factors are incorporated into the energy_functions of most protein force_fields to recapitulate the structure of the folded_state of a protein however due to approximations used in all force_fields and insufficient sampling there can be predicted low_energy decoy structures possessing nonphysical structural_features measures that compare theoretical structures with high_resolution structures on the basis of known characteristics of folded_proteins can be used to filter out the nonphysical models from a pool of predicted models additionally these filters will also point to regions in a given structure that need to be refined to ensure_quality of a structural model closer to that of the native_structure in order to report on the packing quality of a given protein_structure gaia computes its total void_volume percentage of unsatisfied hydrogen_bond donors acceptors and extent of steric clashes in addition to report on the quality of a model structures covalent geometry gaia also determines deviant bond_lengths angles torsions side chain rotamers and the scaling of accessible_surface with protein length the users are also provided with an option to resolve clashes using chiron http chiron dokhlab org our recently_developed rapid clash minimization routine and anomalous side chain orientations using our force_field medusa
