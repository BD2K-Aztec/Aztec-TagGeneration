genome_analysis cbar a computer program to distinguish plasmid derived from chromosome derived sequence_fragments in metagenomics_data huge amount of metagenomic sequence_data have been produced as a result of the rapidly increasing efforts worldwide in studying microbial_communities as a whole most if not all sequenced metagenomes are complex_mixtures of chromosomal and plasmid sequence_fragments from multiple_organisms possibly from different kingdoms computational_methods for prediction of genomic_elements such as genes are significantly different for chromosomes and plasmids hence raising the need for separation of chromosomal from plasmid sequences in a metagenome we present a program for classification of a metagenome set into chromosomal and plasmid sequences based on their distinguishing pentamer frequencies on a large training_set consisting of all the sequenced prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids the program achieves in classification_accuracy on a large set of simulated metagenomes with sequence_lengths ranging from bp to kbp the program has classification_accuracy from to on a large independent test_set the program achieves classification_accuracy availability the program has been implemented as a standalone prediction program cbar which is available atone of the major challenges in analyzing a metagenome lies in the reality that metagenomic_data are generally very complex in terms of their composition often consisting of sequence_fragments from numerous genomes possibly from different kingdoms while analyses of a metagenome as a whole could definitely reveal useful information about a microbial_community more detailed_analyses generally requires the binning of the metagenomic_sequences into multiple taxonomical groups according to some criteria there have been a number of published computer programs designed to bin metagenomic_sequences into multiple groups each of which consists of sequences from the same taxonomical group to whom correspondence should be addressed e g from the same genera another important metagenome binning problem that has not been well addressed by metagenome sequence analysts is to separate chromosomal from plasmid sequences this problem is important because sequence_features associated with various classes of genomic_elements in chromosomal and plasmid genomes are generally different hence separation of these two classes of sequences is the prerequisite to accurate computational_identification of such genomic_elements for example identification of genes in chromosomal and plasmid sequences represents two different problems even when they are from the same organism since their di codon frequency biases in coding versus noncoding_regions the basis for computational gene_finding could be substantially different for genome_sequencing this has not been a general_problem since plasmids have been typically extracted using alkaline lysis or removed using nuclease so they can be sequenced separately from chromosomal sequences however microbial_community sequencing_projects typically do not separate chromosomes from plasmids in advance due to various technical reasons so the sequenced metagenome is generally a mixture of chromosomal and plasmid sequences hence raising the needs to computationally separate them here we present the first computer program for classification of a given metagenome into chromosomal and plasmid sequences based on observed differences in their pentamer frequencies using the pentamer frequencies collected from completely_sequenced prokaryotic_genomes including both chromosomal and plasmid sequences we have trained an sequential minimal optimization smo based model to separate chromosomal from plasmid sequences which achieved consistent accuracies at in our fold cross_validations fcvs on our training data on an independent testing dataset and on the simulated metagenomes we have tested five types of classification approaches namely c decision_tree bayes network support_vector smo and nearest_neighbor for solving our classification_problem the results of our three evaluations as described above on the five approaches are listed in on the fcvs on the training_dataset four out of five algorithms except for bayes network worked well with the overall accuracy better than and the smo approach has the highest performance in all the performance measurements with overall accuracy on the testing dataset the performance of the trained classifier dropped slightly as shown in and the smo approach remains the best performer with ac using the fcvs on the combined training and testing_set the smobased classifier has approximately the same level of performance accuracy still the best among the five the auc value strongly suggests that the smo based_classifier is accurate and robust some bacteria harbor chromids whose lengths are between those of chromosomes and plasmids cbar predicted of them as chromosomes due to their similarities in the nucleotide compositions to the host chromosomes a few other validations including the comparison with a blastbased strategy can be found in the
