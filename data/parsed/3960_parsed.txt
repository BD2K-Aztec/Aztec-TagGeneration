rela a local_alignment search tool for the identification of distal and proximal gene regulatory_regions and their conserved transcription_factor motivation the prediction and annotation of the genomic_regions involved in gene_expression has been largely explored most of the energy has been devoted to the development of approaches that detect transcription_start leaving the identification of regulatory_regions and their functional transcription_factor tfbss largely_unexplored and with important quantitative and qualitative methodological gaps results we have developed rela for regulatory_region local alignment_tool a unique tool optimized with the smithwaterman_algorithm that allows local searches of conserved tfbs clusters and the detection of regulatory_regions proximal to genes and enhancer regions relas performance shows specificities of and when tested on experimentally_validated proximal regulatory_regions and enhancers respectively availability the source_code of relas is freely_available and can be remotely used through our web_server under http www bsc es cg rela the identification of the genomic_regions that control the transcription of genes still remains a challenge despite the recent and continuous development of new experimental and computational methodologies multiple automatic approaches have been proposed ranging from those that search for phylogenetic conservation of sequence or transcription_factor in non transcribed dna regions to the analysis of dna physical_properties characteristic of regions expected to bind transcription_factors to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as however the incorporation of novel biological_knowledge into these programs is not necessarily improving the quality of their predictions which still contain a substantial fraction of false_positives currently methods that de_novo detect and characterize proximal regulatory_regions show specificity levels van even though phylogenetic_footprinting using prealigned homologous regulatory_regions offers promising results in the identification of conserved regulatory_modules crms of transcription_factor tfbss they cannot define the regulatory_region itself in most real scenarios because they are based on global_alignment strategies and require that all matching binding_sites across all compared sequences are located in the same or similar position within each sequence i e they require predefined and pre aligned regulatory_regions as a result in spite of the existing methodologies still the most common and reliable way to identify proximal regulatory_regions in genomes is the analysis of a few nucleotides typically up to immediately_upstream of annotated transcription_start tsss which likely constitutes the proximal_promoter but the annotation of gene starts is still unsolved particularly for non human species for example a simple search in the ensembl_database identified substantial fractions of vertebrate genes without annotated utr from in mouse to in opossum for human this result is even more dramatic within invertebrates other problems that constitute a barrier for the automatic inference of promoters even in human or mouse are the abundance and overprediction of alternative transcripts taken together most computational_methods that detect or align promoters strongly depend on or are coupled with the annotation of untranslated gene regions which is generally insufficient for this purpose on the other hand the computational_identification of enhancers is even more complex these regulatory_regions that work in cooperation with promoters throughout multiple structural constraints are apparently delocalized relative to the genes that are controlling therefore their identification through computational_methods requires strategiestaking into account the available methods to in silico recognize gene regulatory_regions a substantial improvement is necessary to accurately annotate genes and promoter_sequences in most genomes here we report the development of rela a computational_tool to identify such regulatory_regions using genome_wide comparisons rela is distributed as a standalone program and as a web_server our approach is mostly based in an adaptation of the popular smith_waterman algorithm that is able to rapidly_identify coincidences of tfbss between two sequences conceptually similar to traditional proteinprotein comparisons rela is able to efficiently process long_sequences in standard computational platforms e g less than a minute to obtain the results shown in we have evaluated the accuracy of rela first in a dataset of experimentally_validated human and mouse promoters on an extensive collection of validated tss from the eukaryotic promoter database as well as on an experimentally_validated collection of rvista enhancers we have reached maximums of of recall and precision levels on abs sequences on the other hand and surprisingly relas performance results lower when using epd tss entries a possible explanation for this observation could be that rela performs better on certain types of promoter_regions but after we classified all abs and epd entries into different promoter types according to their composition and evaluated their associated performance obtained with all the methods used here for the validation we observed that relas accuracy is similar among most of the identified promoter types we cannot discard though that other uncontrolled biases present either inside the underlying search methodology of each of the protocols used here or in the used databases could actually explain the different behaviour observed it is worth noticing that overall tfbs based prediction_methods perform better on the tfbs based abs database than on the tss based epd where tss predictors are doing better in any case the levels of precision and recall obtained with rela are sufficient to provide reliable predictions that guide posterior experimental_validation this study also demonstrates the benefits of using the smithwaterman_algorithm to directly search for conserved binding_sites as it outperforms other methods like rvista and tfm that are based on pre aligned dna and global search_strategies see the example in which cannot be solved using global_alignment approaches please note that other methods based on similar strategies could not be included in the comparison as they did not provide results on our benchmark set because of limitations in the size mmeta and on the number of sequences furthermore we also show that rela is able of predicting alternative promoters and even enhancer regions dealing with multiple suboptimal solutions in most cases our approach is suitable for integrating a computational annotation_pipeline in which other predictive methods such as homology_searches e g blast against protein databases can assist in the improvement of the final predictions in summary we believe that the development of rela constitutes a significant step_forward in the field of the prediction of regulatory_regions as it shows the highest predictive_power reported so_far rela is able to locally compare multiple large_genomic and identify non alignable conservation events across different genomes this is relevant if we consider that the limited information regarding regulatory_regions in eukaryotes is restricted to human page snapshot of the rela web_server output graphical_representation of the putative promoters and alignments of tfbss of the human e f gene as well as the lists of predicted regions and conserved binding_motifs see sections and for a complete interpretation of each of the results provided and mouse e g from vertebrate entries in the eukaryotic promoter database belong to these two species thus with this tool in hand we can now not only fill missing gaps in the annotation of the genomes of model_organisms mostly with the identification of enhancers and alternative promoters but also to start a reliable and consistent annotation of conserved promoters throughout the rest of genomes that have little or no information regarding utrs and often first coding_exons beyond the current performance of rela and as we are planning a genome_wide search of regulatory_regions across sequenced vertebrate_genomes we are actively searching for ways of improving further its predictive_power by for example applying more sophisticated scoring_systems and accepting even larger dna regions with low additional computational costs
