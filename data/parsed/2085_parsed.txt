genome_analysis gmd measuring the distance between histograms with applications on high_throughput sequencing_reads gmd generalized minimum distance of distributions is an r package to assess the similarity between spatial_distributions of read based sequencing_data such as chip_seq gmd calculates the optimal distance between pairs of normalized signal distributions optionally sliding one distribution over the other to align the distributions gmd also provides graphical and downstream clustering tools availability the r package gmd source_code is available at http cran r project org_web gmd under gpl license contact high_throughput dna sequencers are now a cornerstone in genomics and can be used for inferring expression splicing and non coding isoforms rna_seq transcription_start tsss cage transcription_factor chromatin status chipseq and more aside from typical tasks of read_mapping aligning to a reference or de_novo assembling differential_expression counting and peak_calling variant and mutation calling comparing the distributions of dna_reads between different genomic_loci or between different biological_features e g histone_modifications is also often meaningful this is because the spatial_distributions of such reads often indicate biological_features for example chipseq experiments targeting h_k histone_modifications often aggregate in characteristic double peaks around tsss while the h_k mark increase from tss to termination site similar examples exist for tss and small_rna data to do this systematically a measure of similarity between distributions is necessary such measures should ideally be true metrics have as few parameters as possible be computationally_efficient and also make biological sense to end_users here we present such a measure generalized minimum distance of distributions gmd based on mdpa minimum difference of pair assignment it can compare two empirical distributions of categorical_data which we refer as histograms supplementary_material considering two normalized histograms to whom correspondence should be addressed here we show two examples of comparing distributions of cage and chip_seq around tsss and an example of multiple pairwise_comparison and the cluster utilities in gmd the gmd metric differs from common distance measurements e g euclidean norm kl divergence since the bins in the histogram will not be treated as independent and the similarity between non overlapping bins is taken into account discussed in and partial alignment is allowed this makes sense in many applications when we have little knowledge about bin to bin correspondence between distributions the gmd package together with its vignette and manual makes systematic studies comparing distributions possible with limited r knowledge
