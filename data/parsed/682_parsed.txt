systems_biology bayesian_network prior network_analysis of biological data using external knowledge motivation reverse_engineering gi networks from experimental_data is a challenging_task due to the complex nature of the networks and the noise inherent in the data one way to overcome these hurdles would be incorporating the vast_amounts of external biological_knowledge when building interaction networks we propose a framework where gi networks are learned from experimental_data using bayesian_networks bns and the incorporation of external knowledge is also done via a bn that we call bayesian_network prior bnp bnp depicts the relation between various evidence types that contribute to the event gene interaction and is used to calculate the probability of a candidate graph g in the structure learning_process results our simulation_results on synthetic simulated and real_biological show that the proposed approach can identify the underlying interaction_network with high_accuracy even when the prior information is distorted and outperforms_existing availability accompanying bnp software_package is freely_available for academic use at http bioe gene interaction gi networks provide insight for understanding the biological_mechanisms that explain various phenotypes in health and disease the inference of gi networks from highthroughput biological data is an important and challenging_task in systems_biology throughout the literature the term gi has been used in a broad sense implying direct and indirect interactions between genes and or gene_products several machine_learning and statistical_methods have been proposed for the problem and bayesian_network bn models have gained popularity for the task of inferring gene_networks because of the complexity of gi networks and the sparse noisy nature of experimental_data machine_learning and statistical_methods may lead to poor reconstruction_accuracy for the underlying_network one way to overcome this problem would be to incorporate prior_biological when making network inferences using experimental_data due to technological_advances in sequencing microarray proteomics and related_fields biological and clinical data are being produced at an ever increasing rate the database issue of the nucleic_acids research journal lists molecular_biology databases which provide a vast amount of annotated data and meta_data that could be used in a systematic way fernandez suarez and bns have a number of features that make them viable candidates for combining prior_knowledge and data as bns can deal with uncertainty avoid over fitting a model to training data and learn from incomplete datasets bns handle stochastic events in a probabilistic_framework accounting for noise which results in emphasizing only strong relations in the observed data furthermore bns are able to focus on local_interactions where each node is directly_affected by a relatively small number of nodes and interactions defined by a bn can be related to causal_inference these properties are similarly observed in biological_networks justifying the use of bns in exploring pathways in the setting of identifying gi networks using experimental_data learning algorithms for both the structure and parameters of bns have been developed most of the research on bns has focused on directed_acyclic dags and static systems with discrete variables and or linear gaussian models used bns to generate a causal_model of the yeast_cell data using either a model with discretized expression levels e g boolean or underexpressed normal overexpressed or a linear gaussian_model the latter treats the expression_level of a gene as being normally distributed around a mean which is a linear sum of inputs therefore rather than true causal_relationships the results may represent co regulation of genes accordingly a method to sample network_structures from the posterior_distribution with markov_chain mcmc has been introduced many bn structure_learning algorithms are based on heuristic_search techniques with the likelihood approximation because of the infeasible computational_complexity these approaches may lead to a false model as neither the search technique nor the objective_functions guarantee the optimal_solution informative priors generated from existing biological_information can improve structure_learning to get

has been shown to improve the fidelity of network_reconstruction incorporated genomic location data to guide the bn model inference proposed a method which iteratively detects consensus motifs based on the structure of the estimated network model then evaluates the network using the result of the motif_detection until the inferred network becomes stable proposed a framework utilizing gibbs distribution where an energy function was used to evaluate the probability of an edge in the inferred networks extended this approach to integrate_multiple sources of prior_knowledge into dynamic_bayesian dbn learning via mcmc sampling mukherjee and speed proposed a scheme to incorporate known network_features including edges classes of edges degree distributions and sparsity into gene network_reconstruction within a bayesian learning framework utilizing mcmc sampling these studies were limited in the use of external biological_knowledge by incorporating only certain features such as network_topology or binding_sites in promoter_regions furthermore in the aforementioned approaches manual_curation and or incorporation of the external knowledge are employed in this article we present a framework to incorporate multiple sources of prior_knowledge regardless of its type into bn learning the meaning of prior_knowledge in our context is the enumeration of pair_wise interactions of genes from biological information_sources and the use of this information in bn modeling the proposed method is fully_automatic and does not use likelihood approximations to find the optimal network that explains observed experimental_data we propose a novel framework that uses bn infrastructure itself to incorporate external biological_knowledge when learning networks this infrastructure yields gi information for pairs of genes which can be used as informative priors to calculate the probability of a candidate graph g this information is then incorporated in the networklearning process that tries to identify the most probable graph given data we provide an open_access web_based implementation of the proposed method at http bioe bilgi edu tr bnp our results indicate that we can successfully reconstruct networks using synthetic data in addition to simulated and real geneexpression data in this article we describe a framework to incorporate multiple sources of prior_knowledge regardless of its type into bayesian_network learning in several studies the use of prior_biological of the gi network in conjunction with gi data has been suggested to improve the fidelity of network_reconstruction however existing methods_fail to rigorously harness and use the existing wide_range of biological_information the proposed bnp model makes inferences about interactions between gene_pairs the model is instantiated each time with the given experimental_data to infer whether the gene_pair is related or not represented by a prediction value between and a prior_knowledge matrix is populated with prediction values for all combinations of gene_pairs using a proposed energy and informative prior function the prior_knowledge is utilized in learning network_structure with the greedy search algorithm in the bn framework the goal on these applications is to construct gene_networks from gi data and a list of genes of interest we tested
