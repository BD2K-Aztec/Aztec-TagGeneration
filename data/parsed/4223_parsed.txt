structural_bioinformatics sherekhan calculating exchange parameters in relaxation_dispersion data from cpmg experiments dynamics governing the function of biomolecule is usually described as exchange processes and can be monitored at atomic_resolution with nuclear_magnetic nmr relaxation_dispersion data here we present a new tool for the analysis of cpmg relaxation_dispersion profiles sherekhan the web_interface to sherekhan provides a user_friendly environment for the analysis availability a stable version of sherekhan the web_application and documentation are available at http sherekhan functions of biomolecules are governed by their dynamics of conformational interconversions sometimes induced by binding of a second partner the kinetics of these processes need to be explored normally kinetics of the mentioned processes can be described with exchange processes for example proteins can be in conformational_equilibrium which may be characterized by two different conformations of the same molecule or in chemical equilibrium which may represent the bound and unbound state of molecules to a binding_partner the environments of the nuclei may differ in each state and thus their nuclear_magnetic nmr parameters e g chemical_shifts scalar or dipolar_couplings and relaxation may also be different we focus here on processes in which at least one of the magnetically active nuclei exchanges between these states by either chemical_exchange or conformational exchange the study of chemical_exchange processes by nmr is already well established depending on the time scale at which the exchange_process occurs various nmr techniques such as line shape analysis measurements of the spin spin or spin_lattice the off resonance saturation method and pulse spin_echo techniques such as the carrpurcellmeiboomgill cpmg experiment can be applied in particular the exchange processes occurring within the micro to millisecond time window can be detected by the nmr relaxation_dispersion experiments by using cpmg or off resonance irradiation approaches the cpmg experiment can provide thermodynamic relative populations of the species kinetic rates of exchange and structural_information in form of chemical_shifts at atomic although cpmg relaxation_dispersion experiments are in general well established their analysis is not a straightforward process currently existing programs are available on request from the authors e g cpmgfit demand a number of software libraries which are often not commonly available on personal_computers and result in compatibility problems or require proprietary software therefore we developed sherekhan which is accessible through a web_interface allowing a user_friendly selection of residues and suggesting models for the calculation of kinetic_parameters like the relative populations of the species the exchange_rate and chemical_shift information from the cpmg relaxation_dispersion data sherekhan assumes a global two state exchange_process to fit the data with models for the slow or fast exchange
