data_and mirdeep p a computational_tool for analyzing the microrna transcriptome in plants motivation ultra deep sampling of small_rna by next_generation has provided rich_information on the microrna mirna transcriptome of various plant_species however few computational_tools have been developed to effectively deconvolute the complex information results we sought to employ the signature distribution of small_rna reads along the mirna precursor as a model in plants to profile expression of known mirna_genes and to identify novel ones a freely_available package mirdeep p was developed by modifying mirdeep which is based on a probabilistic_model of mirna_biogenesis in animals with a plant specific scoring system and filtering criteria we have tested mirdeep p on eight small_rna derived from three plants our results demonstrate mirdeep p as an effective and easy to use tool for characterizing the mirna transcriptome in plants mirnas are an important class of endogenous small_rnas that regulate_gene at the post transcription_level there has been a surge of interest in the past_decade in identifying mirnas and profiling their expression pattern using various experimental_approaches most recently deep_sequencing of specifically prepared low_molecular rna libraries has been used for both purposes in diverse plant_species a major_drawback of these efforts is the exclusive focus on mature_mirnas the final gene_product and ignorance of sequence_information associated with other parts of the mirna_genes new strategies and tools are thus highly_desirable to analyze the increasingly available sequencing_data to gain insights into the mirna transcriptomes although mirnas are only nt_long they are processed from longer stemloop structured precursors called pre mirnas maturation of mirnas releases small_rnas derived from different parts of the stemloop structure with asymmetric abundance the program mirdeep employs a probabilistic_model of mirna_biogenesis in animals to score compatibility of the to whom correspondence should be addressed nucleotide position and frequency of sequenced small_rna reads with the secondary_structure of pre mirnas however two significant differences in mirna_precursors between animals and plants prevent straightforward adaptation of mirdeep to the plant systems first plant pre mirnas are much longer with more variable lengths second more mirnas in plants belong to paralogous families with multiple members encoding identical or near identical mirnas supplementary_materials and we have demonstrated that mirdeep modified with plantspecific parameters is useful in analyzing the mirna transcriptome in the model plant arabidopsis here we describe the improved package called mirdeep p and its applications in plants
