systems_biology epitop a proteochemometric tool for mhc_class binding prediction motivation t cell epitope identification is a critical immuno informatic problem within vaccine_design to be an epitope a peptide must bind an mhc protein results here we present epitop the first server predicting mhc_class binding based on proteochemometrics a qsar approach for ligands binding to several related proteins epitop uses a quantitative matrix to predict binding to hla_drb it identifies of known epitopes within the top of predicted binders reducing laboratory labour materials and time by epitop is easy to use gives comprehensive quantitative predictions and will be expanded and updated with new quantitative matrices over time t cell epitope identification is a challenging immunoinformatic problem within vaccine_design to be an epitope a peptide should bind a major_histocompatibility mhc protein for mhc_class epitopes typically comprise residues the mhc_class binding_site is open_ended allowing much longer peptides to bind although only nine amino_acids occupy the site many computational_methods have been developed for t cell epitopes see flower many work well and are widely used by immunologists and vaccinologists most available epitope prediction_methods separately address peptides binding particular mhc proteins developing models for a single target allele for mhc_class only the generalized artificial_neural ann based server netmhciipan uses both peptide and human_leukocyte hla sequence_information recently we developed a proteochemometrics based_approach to mhc_class prediction proteochemometrics a quantitative_structure qsar approach originally developed by wikberg deals with ligands binding to several related proteins in conventional qsar the to whom correspondence should be addressed x matrix of descriptors includes only information from ligands in proteochemometrics the x matrix contains information from proteins and ligands a single proteochemometric model could potentially predict peptide binding to many mhc proteins we have developed and validated several models for binding to several hla_drb and now make the best model available in the server epitop it uses a quantitative matrix qm to predict peptide affinity to hla_drb proteins drb drb drb drb drb drb drb drb drb drb drb and drb we undertook a rigorous evaluation of the performance of epitop across three datasets comparing it to that of either four or eight other servers using either recall statistics or roc_analysis overall epitop compares very favourably with other more specialized models for the antijen and iedb datasets epitop performs suboptimally only at the highest specificity since it is strongly inclusive and much broader in its predictive potential other much more highly focused allele specific models outperform it at this highly stringent level at more permissive thresholds and within statistical error epitop performs identically to best in class servers for lins dataset the five tested binders were much close in performance within the limits of error epitop performs suboptimally only for drb it is interesting to note that epitop is very much the best model for drb for the identification of binding cores epitop again performs well but interestingly core identification correlates inversely with overall statistical perform perhaps suggesting that much remains to be understood regarding class mhcpeptide interaction taken together results from these various benchmarking exercises both validate epitop and indicate that development of a synergistic meta server which integrates results from several servers should prove a useful exercise hopefully yielding significant overall enhancements epitop is the first proteochemometrics based server for t cell epitope_prediction it is a tool for performing preliminary computational_analyses of large_datasets for accelerated epitopebased vaccine_design it is easy to use gives comprehensive quantitative predictions and will be expanded and updated with new qms
