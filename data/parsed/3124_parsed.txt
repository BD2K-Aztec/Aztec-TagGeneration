structural_bioinformatics mspocket an orientation independent algorithm for the detection of ligand_binding motivation identification of ligand_binding on proteins is crucial for the characterization of protein functions it provides valuable information for proteinligand docking and rational engineering of small_molecules that regulate protein functions a major number of current prediction_algorithms of ligand_binding are based on cubic grid representation of proteins and thus the results are often protein orientation dependent results we present the mspocket program for detecting pockets on the solvent excluded surface of proteins the core algorithm of the mspocket approach does not use any cubic grid system to represent proteins and is therefore independent of protein orientations we demonstrate that mspocket is able to achieve an accuracy of in predicting ligand_binding on a test_dataset used for evaluating several existing_methods the accuracy is if the top three predictions are considered comparison to one of the recently_published best performing methods shows that mspocket reaches similar performance with the additional feature of being protein orientation independent interestingly some of the predictions are different meaning that the two methods can be considered complementary and combined to achieve better prediction_accuracy mspocket also provides a graphical_user for interactive investigation of the predicted ligand_binding in addition we show that overlap criterion is a better strategy for the evaluation of predicted ligand_binding than the single point distance criterion availability the mspocket source_code can be downloaded from http appserver biotec tu dresden de mspocket mspocket is also available as a pymol plugin with a graphical_user the prediction of ligand_binding on proteins provides important information for proteinligand docking and structuralbased rational engineering of small_molecules that modulate protein functions furthermore comparative_analysis of ligand_binding is to whom correspondence should be addressed found to provide_valuable for the understanding of proteinligand binding_specificity it has been observed that ligand_binding often locate in the largest pockets on protein_surfaces thus the identification of pockets on protein_surfaces plays_a in the prediction of protein functional sites in particular ligand_binding a variety of computational_approaches have been proposed for the prediction of ligand_binding these methods can be divided_into two categories according to the information they utilize to detect pockets geometric approaches that are purely based on the geometric characteristics of proteins and comprehensive approaches that not only consider geometric criteria but also take into account evolutionary_information interaction_energy or chemical_properties of proteins a major number of these methods in both categories are based on the cubic grid representation of protein_structures geometric methods like pocket ligsite and ligsite cs generate d grids for proteins and identify surface pockets as the set of solvent grid points that are situated between protein grid points pocketpicker uses grids to represent proteins and search the environment of each surface grid along directions for defining pockets introduced the vice program as part of the hint toolkit similar to pocketpicker vice scans grid points along the path in various directions at each grid points and defines pocket grids as those with at least half of the scan directions blocked the vice program represents proteins as binary grid maps in which grid points occupied by atoms are set to one and the rest zero such that the vice algorithm is performed on only integers and thus is very efficient suggested the roll algorithm in which a probe sphere of radius is used to roll on each slice of the d grid representations of proteins pockets are defined to be the regions between the probe sphere and the protein surface the grid representation of proteins is dependent on the orientation of proteins in the coordinate system inconsistent results may be observed for grid based_methods if the atomic_coordinates of proteins are transformed one solution to address the problem of inconsistent results is to increase the grid resolution and generate finer grid representations however this is at the cost of decreased efficiency of the methods alternatively geometric methods that do not use cubic grid systems have also been suggested surfnet places probe spheres in gaps between protein surface_atoms and defines pockets using the probe spheres cast represents a protein as delaunay triangulation and derives the alpha shape of the protein page
