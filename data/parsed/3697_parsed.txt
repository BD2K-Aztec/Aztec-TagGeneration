primus improving pedigree reconstruction using mitochondrial and y haplotypes primus is a pedigree reconstruction algorithm that uses estimates of genome_wide identity by descent to reconstruct pedigrees consistent with observed genetic data however when genetic data for individuals within a pedigree are missing often multiple pedigrees can be reconstructed that fit the data we report a major expansion of primus that uses mitochondrial mtdna and non recombining y chromosome nry haplotypes to eliminate many pedigree structures that are inconsistent with the genetic data we demonstrate that discordances in mtdna and nry haplotypes substantially reduce the number of potential pedigrees and often lead to the identification of the correct pedigree availability_and we have implemented primus updates in perl and it is available at primus correctly determining pedigree structures is key to identifying the causes of genetic_disorders in some cases reported pedigree structures are inconsistent with observed genetic sharing which may result in a loss of power and failure to find the disease_causing variant s cryptic relatedness within datasets and sample swaps are frequently observed pedigree reconstruction can find cryptic relationships and correctly fit them into a pedigree structure early methods for checking pedigrees applied pairwise relationship prediction_approaches that use co dominant genetic_markers however pedigree reconstruction can more accurately_predict relationships find the correct pedigree and identify cryptic pedigrees pedigree reconstruction and identification of a maximum unrelated set primus uses estimates of genome_wide identity by descent ibd to reconstruct pedigree structures that fit the ibd estimates missing genetic data for a set of people in a family often leads to the identification of multiple pedigrees that fit the data we show that by using inconsistencies in the inheritance patterns of the human mitochondria mtdna and non recombining y chromosome nry haplotypes captured by genotyping_arrays or by highthroughput_sequencing improves the accuracy of pedigree reconstruction we describe the utilization of mtdna and nry data for pedigree reconstruction in primus v to reduce the number of generated pedigrees and improve the chance of identifying the correct pedigree structure v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comprimus is the current state of the art program for reconstructing pedigrees and is the only program that lists all non inbred pedigree structures that fit genetic data using up to rd degree relationships to illustrate the use of mtdna and nry haplotypes during pedigree reconstruction we compare reconstructions by primus with and without mtdna and nry haplotypes with simulated_and we modified the pedigree simulations described by to explore the effects of using mtdna and nry on the reconstruction of pedigrees with different structures genotypes and combinations of missing samples we selected pedigrees of size and masked the genotypes for of individuals in the pedigree we modified the simulations by permuting the sex of the individuals while maintaining the biologic integrity of the pedigree for each simulation we assigned a unique nry haplotype to each male founder and a unique mtdna haplotype to all founders and propagated these genotypes through the pedigree we obtained mtdna and nry haplotypes from the phase release of unrelated ceu and tsi haplotypes with individual_level call rates from the genomes_project these haplotypes consisted of mtdna and nry loci with quality_score call rates and with a minor_allele for inclusion we randomly_assigned a unique haplotype to each of the founders in each pedigree and propagated the haplotypes through the pedigrees we considered pedigree reconstruction performance on the autosomal data alone as the baseline and compared this to the performance when we added additional information such as sex status mtdna and nry we see a moderate reduction in the number of possible pedigrees with mtdna and nry individually but the synergistic_effects of mtdna and nry with sex status exceeded the combined individual improvements our results show themtdna nry sex or all of these are applied the addition of either mtdna or nry data outperforms the addition of only sex status the greatest_reduction in the number of possible pedigrees is obtained when mtdna nry and sex status are combined eliminating nearly of the incorrect pedigrees primuslargest improvement in pedigrees with more missing samples where a reduction in the mean number of genetically consistent pedigrees is seen the improvement declines beyond missing samples because the pedigrees become too sparse for the discordant mtdna and nry haplotypes to rule out possible pedigrees we also see a substantial improvement in ranking the correct pedigree structure supplemental in fact when mtdna and nry are combined with individual sex status we see a fold increase over sex status alone in the number of simulations that reconstructed to the only true pedigree the improvements in pedigree specificity using mtdna and nry genotypes are remarkable as shown in supplemental a pedigree that reconstructed to possible pedigrees using autosomal dna and sex status resolved to the single correct pedigree with the addition of mtdna data the new implementation of primus identified this pedigree by eliminating the pedigrees that were inconsistent with the mtdna data we validated our results on real_data by reconstructing the pedigrees within the jackson heart study jhs cohort we received illumina_infinium humanexome beadchip genotype data for individuals we estimated ibd proportions for these individuals using the method described in after cleaning supplemental methods there were autosomal snps used for the ibd calculation and nry snps and mtdna snps used for haplotype comparison using primus we reconstructed the jhs pedigrees with and without mtdna nry haplotype_data inclusion of the mtdna nry haplotypes reduced the number of pedigrees generated for the jhs family networks we saw up to a reduction in the number of generated pedigrees supplemental with an average reduction of this improvement of specificity did not negatively impact sensitivity primus with mtdna and nry identified the expected pedigrees at the same rate as primus without mtdna and nry these results fall well within the range of improvement we saw in simulations with genomes data therefore with both simulated_and nry and mtdna provide a substantial improvement in automated pedigree reconstruction
