assumption weighting for incorporating heterogeneity into meta_analysis of genomic_data motivation there is now a large literature on statistical_methods for the meta_analysis of genomic_data from multiple studies however a crucial assumption for performing many of these analyses is that the data exhibit small between study variation or that this heterogeneity can be sufficiently modelled probabilistically results in this article we propose assumption weighting which exploits a weighted hypothesis_testing framework proposed by genovese et_al to incorporate tests of between study variation into the meta_analysis context this methodology is fast and computationally simple to implement several weighting_schemes are considered and compared using simulation_studies in addition we illustrate application of the proposed methodology using data from several high profile stem_cell gene_expression in recent_years with the extensive usage of microarray and other high_throughput in biomedical_research there has been a rapid_growth in the amount of publicly_available datasets the ncbi gene_expression geo http www ncbi nlm nih gov geo the ebi arrayexpress http www ebi ac uk arrayexpress and the stanford microarray database smd http smd stanford edu are a few examples of widely used public internet repositories these resources allow researchers to further exploit the information in these data especially in the form of meta_analysis how to effectively integrate_information of microarray_datasets from multiple studies is becoming an increasingly important problem the other area of genomics that has increasingly relied on the use of meta_analysis has been genome_wide gwas some seminal studies in this field are returning to the microarray example the most common type of analysis is the detection of differentially_expressed especially for the case of two groups of samples namely treatment and control combining information from multiple datasets is expected to increase the power for differential_expression many methods for meta_analysis addressing this type of problem have been proposed and reviewed in recent_years an incomplete list to whom correspondence should be addressed includes the p value combining approach of the genemeta method by rankprod method by the metaarray approach of a hierarchical_model put forth byand the mdeds algorithm of campain and yang in this latter paper a comparison between several meta_analysis approaches was considered as well one important issue that has received limited discussion in most of this literature is the assessment of the concordance of data among different studies and the integration of this information into further analysis this problem is very well understood in the classical meta_analysis problem and tests for between study heterogeneity have been accordingly developed see normand for a discussion however it becomes conceptually problematic to extend this approach directly to the genomic meta_analysis problem as one has to perform g tests of heterogeneity and then determine based on the result of the tests whether or not meta_analysis is feasible for every single gene it will be the case that there will be some genes that will show significant evidence for between study heterogeneity thus the meta_analysis will be done on a subset of genes contrary to the approaches described in the previous paragraph in addition there are issues of pre testing and model_selection that arise which complicate the analysis and interpretation of such a meta_analysis the evidence for between study heterogeneity in these highthroughput genomic_data settings is growing one potential cause is errors in mapping the proper gene to the microarray annotation this can be viewed as a technical mistake that leads to between study variation a more biologically oriented cause is that samples being profiled actually represent subtypes of different disease groups this has been mostly famously explored in breast_cancer prostate_cancer and leukaemia thus the presence of subtypes of samples leads to the between study heterogeneity a final reason is the fact that due to the diversity of labs generating these data there will inherently exist between lab variation and more generally batch_effects a recent review bydemonstrates the existence of batch_effects in a variety of high_throughput genomic_datasets two questions then naturally arise from these findings first how does one assess between study variation using high_throughput second how can one incorporate the betweenstudy variation into the analysis measures of reproducibility have been proposed by implicitly once these measures are calculated one would then calculate a summary measure on genes that were sufficiently reproducible another approach would be to model thethat entails assessment of global concordance in contrast the approach developed in this article will utilize measures of gene wise or local concordance other methods have been proposed to assess the global concordance of studies such as the concordance_correlation ccc byproposed a multi class correlation measure to seek for genes of concordant inter class patterns across studies the between study variation can also be modelled as variance components or other parameters in the joint modelling frameworks of genemeta and these algorithms will tend to be more computationally_intensive than what is proposed in this article in this article we focus on meta_analysis of microarray_datasets for differential_expression we take the viewpoint that the major_goal in these studies is selection and prioritization of genes for further validation_studies we exploit the weighted hypothesis_testing framework proposed by and propose an assumption weighting methodology to be specific we will use weights that assess between study heterogeneity and incorporate them into a multiple testing procedure we also note in passing that the use of weights for characterizing the assumptions needed for meta_analysis is a novel application of this weighted hypothesis_testing framework we proposed four different weighting_schemes including two based on an assessment of the concordance of the test_statistics of different studiesthe i index and two based on a newly_proposed measure of expression correlation between studies the performance of these methods are assessed through simulation_studies as well as applications to a set of stem_cell studies
