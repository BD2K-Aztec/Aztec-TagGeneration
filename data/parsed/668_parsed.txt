bayesian consensus clustering motivation in biomedical_research a growing number of platforms and technologies are used to measure diverse but related information and the task of clustering a set of objects based on multiple sources of data arises in several applications most current approaches to multi source clustering either independently determine a separate clustering for each data source or determine a single_joint clustering for all data_sources there is a need for more flexible approaches that simultaneously model the dependence and the heterogeneity of the data_sources results we propose an integrative statistical_model that permits a separate clustering of the objects for each data source these separate clusterings adhere loosely to an overall consensus clustering and hence they are not independent we describe a computationally scal able bayesian_framework for simultaneous estimation of both the consensus clustering and the source specific clusterings we demonstrate that this flexible_approach is more robust than joint clustering of all data_sources and is more powerful than clustering each data source independently we present an application to subtype identification of breast_cancer tumor_samples using publicly_available data from the cancer_genome availability r code with instructions and examples is available atseveral fields of research now analyze multisource data also called multimodal data in which multiple heterogeneous datasets describe a common set of objects each dataset represents a distinct mode of measurement or domain while the methodology described in this article is broadly_applicable our primary motivation is the integrated analysis of heterogeneous biomedical data the diversity of platforms and technologies that are used to collect genomic_data in particular is expanding rapidly often multiple types of genomic_data measuring various biological_components are collected for a common set of samples for example the cancer_genome tcga is a large_scale collaborative_effort to collect and catalog data from several genomic technologies the integrative_analysis of data from these disparate sources provides a more comprehensive understanding of cancer genetics_and separate analyses of each data source may lack power and will not capture intersource associations at the other extreme a joint analysis that ignores the heterogeneity of the data may not capture important features that are specific to each data source exploratory methods that simultaneously model shared_features and features that are specific to each data source have recently been developed as flexible alternatives the demand for such integrative methods motivates a dynamic area of statistics and bioinformatics this article concerns integrative clustering clustering is a widely used exploratory tool to identify similar groups of objects for example clinically_relevant disease_subtypes hundreds of general algorithms to perform clustering have been proposed however our work is motivated by the need for an integrative clustering method that is computationally scalable and robust to the unique features of each data source in section we apply our integrative clustering method to mrna_expression dna_methylation microrna expression and proteomic_data from tcga for a common set of breast_cancer tumor_samples these four data_sources represent different but highly related and dependent biological_components moreover breast_cancer tumors are recognized to have important distinctions that are present across several diverse genomic and molecular variables a fully integrative clustering approach is necessary to effectively combine the discriminatory_power of each data source this work was motivated by the perceived need for a general flexible and computationally scalable approach to clustering multisource biomedical data we propose bcc which models both an overall clustering and a clustering specific to each data source we view bcc as a form of consensus clustering with advantages over traditional_methods in terms of modeling uncertainty and the ability to borrow information across sources the bcc model assumes a simple and general dependence between data_sources when an overall clustering is not sought or when such a clustering does not make sense as an assumption a more general model of cluster dependence such as mdi may be more appropriate furthermore a context specific approach may be necessary when more is known about the underlying dependence of the data for example nguyen and gelfand exploit functional covariance models for timecourse data to determine overall and time specific clusters our implementation of bcc assumes the data are normally distributed with cluster specific mean and variance parameters it is straightforward to extend this approach to more complex clustering models in particular models that assume clusters exist on a sparse feature_set or allow for more general covariance_structure are growing in popularity while we focus on multisource biomedical data the applications of bcc are potentially widespread in addition to multisource data bcc may be used to compare clusterings from different statistical_models for a single homogeneous dataset note summary data includes year survival_probabilities using the kaplanmeier estimator with confidence_interval mean fraction of the genome altered fga using threshold t with confidence_interval receptor status for estrogen er progesteron pr and human epidermal_growth her and copy_number for amplification at sites p and q and deletion at sites q and q
