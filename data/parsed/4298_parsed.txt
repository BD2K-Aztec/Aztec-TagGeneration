genome_analysis smashcell a software framework for the analysis of single_cell amplified genome_sequences recent_advances in single cell_manipulation technology whole_genome amplification and high_throughput have now made it possible to sequence the genome of an individual cell the bioinformatic_analysis of these genomes however is far more complicated than the analysis of those generated using traditional culture based_methods in order to simplify this analysis we have developed smashcell simple metagenomics analysis shell for sequences from single cells it is designed to automate the main steps in microbial genome analysisassembly gene prediction functional annotationin a way that allows parameter and algorithm exploration at each step in the process it also manages the data created by these analyses and provides visualization methods for rapid analysis of the results availability the smashcell source_code and a comprehensive manual are available at http asiago stanford edu smashcellthe rapid evolution of dna sequencing_platforms has had a dramatic beneficial impact on the study of microbial_ecology and population_genetics so_far these benefits have mostly come from shotgun community metagenomics that provides a highlevel overview of the taxonomic and functional composition of microbial_communities however this approach is limited in its ability to yield complete_genome as well as the fine_scale genetic_variation that defines population substructures within these communities one possible solution uses a combination of single cell_manipulation technologies multiple_displacement mda and highthroughput_sequencing to generate single_cell amplified genomes sags this approach has already been used to characterize the genomes of uncultivated microbes and as the throughput of the associated technologies
