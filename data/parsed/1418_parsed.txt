sequence_analysis discriminative modelling of context specific amino_acid substitution_probabilities motivation protein_sequence searching and alignment are fundamental tools of modern biology alignments are assessed using their similarity_scores essentially the sum of substitution matrix scores over all pairs of aligned amino_acids we previously_proposed a generative probabilistic_method that yields scores that take the sequence_context around each aligned residue into account this method showed drastically improved_sensitivity and alignment_quality compared with standard substitution matrix based alignment results here we develop an alternative discriminative approach to predict sequence_context specific substitution scores we applied our approach to compute context specific sequence_profiles for basic_local blast and compared the new tool cs blastdis to blast and the previous context specific version cs blastgen on a dataset filtered to maximum sequence_identity cs blastdisis was more sensitive than blast and more sensitive than cs blastgenin detecting remote homo logues at false_discovery at maximum sequence_identity its alignments contain and more correct residue pairs than those of blast and cs blastgen respectively clear improvements are also seen when the approach is combined with psi_blast and hhblits we believe the context specific approach should replace substitution matrices wherever sensitivity and alignment_quality are critical inferring the functions and the structures of proteins from those of homologous_proteins has proven to be an extremely powerful approach in biology to predict a homologous relationship between two proteins their sequences are aligned such as to maximize the sum of scores over all aligned pairs of amino_acid minus penalties for gaps a sufficiently_high score indicates a homologous relationship the standard method for calculating scores for pairs of amino_acids is the substitution matrix method the substitution score for amino_acids a and b can be written as sa b const logpajb pa where pajb is the probability of amino_acid b mutating into a and p a is the background probability of a the probabilities p a and pajb are derived by counting the numbers of amino_acids a and of aligned pairs a b in a large set of trusted sequence_alignments as protein_sequences of folded domains are constrained by the necessity to maintain a stable structure the substitution_probabilities for a given residue are largely determined by the structural context within which it resides substitution matrices have therefore been trained for particular structural contexts for example depending on the residues secondary_structure solvent_accessibility or polarity methods that infer substitution_probabilities of amino_acids solely from their local sequence_context have the advantage that they do not require the structure of the query_protein to be known in biegert and sodingsoding we formulated a general approach to predict substitution_probabilities from sequence_context for each residue in the query_sequence we compared the residue window centred around it with a precomputed library of column sequence_profiles that represent all known sequence contexts the substitution_probabilities are computed as the weighted mixture of the central columns in these context profiles with weights proportional to the similarity between the context profile and the residue sequence_context the approach was based on a generative_model for learning context specific substitution_probabilities the goal of this work is to further improve_the by developing a discriminative machine_learning for the prediction of substitution_probabilities as in our previous work we apply the method to enhance basic_local blast by storing the predicted substitution_probabilities for the query_sequence in a sequence_profile and jump starting psi_blast with it we also apply the new method to generate context specific pseudocounts for psi_blast and hhblits our highly_sensitive iterative sequence_search software based on the pairwise_comparison of hidden_markov hmms in all cases we observe significant improvements over the generative version to whom correspondence should be addressed
