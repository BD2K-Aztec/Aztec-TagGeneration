genome_analysis masive mapping and analysis of sirevirus elements in plant genome_sequences we present masive an expertly built tool for the large_scale yet sensitive and highly_accurate discovery preliminary_analysis and insertion age_estimation of intact sirevirus ltr_retrotransposons in plant genomic_sequences validation was based on the recently available and annotated large maize chromosome one results show a considerable improvement in the annotation of sireviruses and support our approach as an important addition to the bioinformatics toolbox of plant biologists availability perl source_code and essential files are available online atthe availability of large and complex plant genome_sequences has necessitated the development of algorithms that can facilitate high_throughput discovery and annotation of transposable_elements especially long_terminal retrotransposons ltr rtn that comprise the majority of these genomes tools like ltr struc ltr finder and ltrharvest are available however they are all based on general structural_characteristics of ltr rtns which may lead to misannotations or incomplete identification of the ltr rtn set the recent_discovery that the abundant and plant specific sireviruses contain highly conserved_motifs in key_domains of their genome provided the opportunity to develop masive mapping and analysis of sirevirus elements presented herein a tool able to identify with high_precision and sensitivity intact sirevirus elements in plant genomic_sequences all ltr rtns contain polypurine tract ppt and primer binding_site pbs domains however their high sequence and length plasticities render them inappropriate for the identification of a specific retrotransposon class in contrast sireviruses have multiple identical ppts at the upstream border of to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the masive algorithm pipeline and the effect of filtering on the numbers of sireviruses finally reported as intact white parallelograms represent data dark rectangles tools and grey diamonds filters the ltr and a highly_conserved ltr internal domain junction that includes part of the pbs these along with several filters applied sequentially are used by masive to target full_length sirevirus elements while excluding false_positives like other retrotransposons or non retroelement derived sequences resembling the structure of ltr rtns masive has been calibrated and validated in the largest chromosome of the now available and expertly annotated zea_mays maize b genome chromosome one
