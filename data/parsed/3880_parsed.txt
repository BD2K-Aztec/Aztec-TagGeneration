genome_analysis rapidr an analysis package for non_invasive of aneuploidy non_invasive nipt of fetal aneuploidy using cell_free is becoming part of routine_clinical rapidr reliable accurate prenatal non_invasive diagnosis r package is an easy to use open_source r package that implements several published nipt analysis methods the input to rapidr is a set of sequence_alignment files in the bam format and the outputs are calls for aneuploidy including trisomies and monosomy x as well as fetal sex rapidr has been extensively tested with a large sample set as part of the rapid project in the uk the package contains quality_control steps to make it robust for use in the clinical_setting availability_and rapidr is implemented in r and can be freely downloaded via cran from here http cran r project org_web rapidr index html since the first demonstration of the use of cell_free cfdna to detect aneuploidy many groups around the world have reported large studies showing high sensitivities_and for the detection of trisomies and in contrast to invasive methods such as amniocentesis non_invasive nipt uses cfdna in maternal_plasma and does not present a risk of miscarriage currently outside the context of research studies nipt for aneuploidy is only available from commercial providers to perform nipt cfdna is extracted from maternal_plasma and sequenced using short_reads and high_throughput sequenced_reads are aligned to the reference human_genome using a short read_aligner aneuploidy is called if the number of reads_mapped to each chromosome differs from its expectation based on a comparison with a set of baseline samples the general approach is usually referred to as a read_depth strategy a number of factors influence test performance for example the fetal fraction i e the proportion of reads originating from the fetus and other technical parameters such as read_length and coverage the choice of sequencing parameters needs to be balanced against costs previous_studies that an acceptable level of test sensitivity can be reached with relatively short_read bp and modest coverage million_reads per sample here we present a flexible and robust r package for nipt analysis called rapidr reliable accurate prenatal noninvasive_diagnosis r package rapidr combines several analytical_techniques that have been proposed for nipt analysis and has been tested with a large sample set from the rapid project nihr funded project to evaluate the use of nipt rapid validation results can be found in the supplementary_material supplementary figs s s supplementary text s and supplementary tables s and s in this article we described the rapidr package for nipt of fetal aneuploidies rapidr has been validated using samples and delivers an acceptable level of specificity and sensitivity for t t t and monosomy x the system requirement for rapidr is modest supplementary text s future work on rapidr will include evaluating strategies to detect sub chromosomal_abnormalities
