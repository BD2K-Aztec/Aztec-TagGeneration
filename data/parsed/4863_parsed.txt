genome_analysis virusseq software to identify viruses and their integration sites using next_generation of human cancer tissue we developed a new algorithmic method virusseq for detecting known viruses and their integration sites in the human_genome using next_generation data we evaluated virusseq on whole transcriptome_sequencing rna_seq of human cancer samples from the cancer_genome using these data we showed that virusseq accurately detects the known viruses and their integration sites with high_sensitivity virusseq can also perform this function using whole_genome sequencing_data of human tissue about of all human_cancers are known to be caused by viruses thus the detection of viruses in human cancer tissue has significant_clinical in oncology the advent_of ngs_technologies using paired_end pe reads allows for the detection of viruses in human cancer tissue at unprecedented levels of efficiency and precision several groups have developed computational_tools for pathogen virus discovery by exploiting the great amount of ngs_data obtained from human tissue these groups have implemented a computational subtraction analysis which has also been used to discover a new polyomavirus associated with most cases of merkel_cell although detecting viruses in human tissue is important in clinical_oncology investigating virus integration sites in host_cell chromosomes is equally valuable as insertional_mutagenesis is one of the most critical steps in the pathogenesis of hepatitis_b hbv mediated hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc ngs_data have been used to map the hbv integration sites in hcc_samples however no software_tool is currently available for detecting viral_integration by ngs_data we present virusseq which starts with computational subtraction on ngs_data and subsequently identifies viruses and their potential integration sites in the human_genome with high_specificity
