databases_and gpcr okb the g_protein oligomer knowledge_base rapid expansion of available data about g_protein gpcr dimers oligomers over the past_few requires an effective system to organize this information electronically based on an ontology derived from a community dialog involving colleagues using experimental and computational methodologies we developed the gpcr oligomerization knowledge_base gpcr okb gpcr okb is a system that supports browsing and searching for gpcr oligomer data such data were manually derived from the literature while focused on gpcr oligomers gpcr okb is seamlessly connected to gpcrdb facilitating the correlation of information about gpcr protomers and oligomers availability_and the gpcr okb web_application is freely_available atg protein coupled receptors gpcrs are transmembrane tm helical proteins that are implicated in many biological_responses and thus serve as targets for a variety of therapeutic_compounds although still a matter of controversy for some gpcr subtypes the very close_proximity of two or more receptors has been demonstrated unambiguously in heterologous cell systems for several gpcrs using biochemical and biophysical techniques the challenge now is to determine_whether all gpcr complexes have functional significance in native_tissues as already demonstrated for a few pairs information supporting the existence of functionally_relevant gpcr dimers oligomers is described in multiple articles_published in the literature this creates a challenge to researchers trying to gather experimental_evidence and or computational predictions about any given oligomer our previous work focused on the design of an ontology to organize information about gpcr oligomerization and its functional consequences in vitro and in vivo the ontology was well received demonstrating significant interest in an electronic system to access gpcr oligomer information in this article we describe the gpcr okb system which implements the gpcr okb ontology and an electronic front end to organize information about gpcr
