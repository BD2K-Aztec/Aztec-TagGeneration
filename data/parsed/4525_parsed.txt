tanglegrams for rooted phylogenetic_trees and networks motivation in systematic biology one is often faced with the task of comparing different phylogenetic_trees in particular in multi gene analysis or cospeciation studies one approach is to use a tanglegram in which two rooted phylogenetic_trees are drawn opposite each other using auxiliary lines to connect matching taxa there is an increasing interest in using rooted_phylogenetic to represent evolutionary_history so as to explicitly represent reticulate events such as horizontal_gene hybridization or reassortment thus the question arises how to define and compute a tanglegram for such networks results in this article we present the first formal definition of a tanglegram for rooted_phylogenetic and present a heuristic approach for computing one called the nn tanglegram method we compare the performance of our method with existing tree tanglegram algorithms and also show a typical application to real_biological for maximum usability the algorithm does not require that the trees or networks are bifurcating or bicombining or that they are on identical taxon sets in systematic biology one is often faced with the task of comparing different phylogenetic_trees in particular in multi gene analysis or cospeciation studies one way to visualize similarities and differences is to draw two phylogenetic_trees as rooted trees side_by and to draw lines which we will call connectors between taxa that correspond to each other in the two trees see such a depiction is called a tanglegram and different variations of the problem of computing an optimal tanglegram have been studied in the literature for example a number of articles consider the one tree crossing minimization otcm and the two tree crossing minimization ttcm problems that both aim at minimizing the number of crossings between connectors in the former problem the layout of one of the trees is fixed and that of the other is mutable whereas in the latter formulation the layout of both trees are allowed to be changed for binary trees otcm is solvable in o nlogn time while ttcm is np complete in the authors describe a seesaw heuristic for the ttcm problem for to whom correspondence should be addressed a tanglegram between a phylogeny of sections of ficus a and that of their associated genera of pollinating wasps b adapted from binary or bifurcating trees which operates by repeatedly solving the otcm problem each time switching the roles of the two trees a branch and bound approach for binary trees that works in o n time and gives a approximation for complete binary trees is presented in a generalization of the algorithm to unbalanced binary trees is described in though in this case the approximation factor does not hold in addition this article gives an ilp formulation and an exact branch and bound algorithm for binary trees where the latter has a worst_case running time of o n n n other approaches use fixed parameter tractability fpt parameterized by the number k of connector crossings a generalization to nonbinary trees is discussed in the only algorithm that is able to compute tanglegrams for binary trees with many to many connections is described in their algorithm requires o k log k loglogk time where k is the number of connectors in the case that one tree is fixed additionally they present some alternating and local search_strategies for the ttcm problem while evolutionary_histories are usually described by rooted phylogenetic_trees in some cases rooted_phylogenetic may provide a more accurate evolutionary scenario especially when mechanisms such as horizontal_gene hybridization recombination reassortment or incomplete_lineage have played a role in shaping the history there is currently much research on the development of computational_methods for computing rooted_phylogenetic for an overview see huson and scornavacca a the goal of this article is to introduce the concept of a tanglegram for rooted_phylogenetic and to provide a useful heuristic for computing such tanglegrams unlike trees rooted_phylogenetic are not necessarily planar and so the definition of an optimal tanglegram is not immediately obvious for them our heuristic does not require that the networks are bifurcating orpage i i i
