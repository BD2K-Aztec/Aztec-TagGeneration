hdtd analyzing multi tissue gene_expression data motivation by collecting multiple samples per subject researchers can characterize intra subject variation using physiologically_relevant measurements such as gene_expression this can yield important insights into fundamental biological_questions ranging from cell_type identity to tumour_development for each subject the data measurements can be written as a matrix with the different subsamples e g multiple tissues indexing the columns and the genes indexing the rows in this context neither the genes nor the tissues are expected to be independent and straightforward application of traditional statistical_methods that ignore this two way dependence might lead to erroneous_conclusions herein we present a suite of tools embedded within the r bioconductor_package hdtd for robustly estimating and performing hypothesis_tests about the mean relationship and the covariance_structure within the rows and columns we illustrate the utility of hdtd by applying it to analyze data generated by the genotype tissue expression consortium availability_and the r package hdtd is part of bioconductor the source_code and a comprehensive users guide are available atthe term transposable data refers to data that are naturally written in a matrix whose dimensions correspond to two distinct_features of interest while the term high_dimensional reflects the fact that the dimension of the subject specific data matrix is larger than the number of subjects high_dimensional transposable data can be found in genetics e g when for each subject gene_expression levels are measured in multiple tissues in different fragments of the same tumour or in a welldefined spatial order in yeast expression studies in protein signaling_networks in eqtl_analysis and in other studies with eeg fmri and time series data cf to analyze robustly such datasets we developed the r package hdtd high_dimensional transposable data in multiple tissue gene_expression studies the rows correspond to genes and the columns to tissues and genes and tissues might to be correlated with each other ignoring a potential tissue wise correlation could be misleading in determining the strength of the gene wise correlation and it may hinder the discovery of differentially_expressed since traditional anova type tests suffer from extremely_low power and or false_positive the unique feature of hdtd is the implementation of sound statistical_methods that account for and estimate both the tissue and gene wise correlation thus facilitating reliable inference about the form of the mean gene_expression levels and the functional relationship among genes and or tissues
