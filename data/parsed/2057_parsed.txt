genome_analysis giira rna_seq driven gene_finding incorporating ambiguous reads motivation the reliable identification of genes is a major_challenge in genome research as further analysis depends on the correctness of this initial step with high_throughput rna_seq reflecting currently expressed genes a particularly meaningful source of information has become commonly available for gene_finding however practical_application in automated gene identification is still not the standard case a particular challenge in including rna_seq is the difficult handling of ambiguously mapped_reads results we present giira gene identification incorporating rna_seq and ambiguous reads a novel prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene finder that is exclusively based on a rna_seq mapping and inherently includes ambiguously mapped_reads giira extracts candidate_regions supported by a sufficient number of mappings and reassigns ambiguous reads to their most likely origin using a maximum flow approach this avoids the exclusion of genes that are predominantly supported by ambiguous mappings evaluation on simulated_and and comparison with existing_methods incorporating rna_seq information highlight the accuracy of giira in identifying the expressed genes the reliable annotation of genes as the regions encoding the basis for all processes in the cell is a key goal of genomic_research hence numerous studies focus on revealing the structure of genes and their controlling mechanisms to enhance the understanding of the functionality of proteins and their interactions following the need for accurate gene prediction_methods various gene_finders have been developed identifying genes either by genome_sequence comparison ab_initio by using the genomic_sequence alone evidence_based by integrating different kinds of additional external_information ab_initio gene_finders predict genes based on the presence of open_reading orfs in the genome and in case of eukaryotes identify intron exon structures indicated by known splice_sites typically these approaches are based on statistical or machine_learning such as hidden_markov and they require training data to evaluate the probability for each gene and gene structure in contrast to ab_initio methods evidence_based and comparative gene_finders make use of additional external_information to identify genes and their structures sources of information include est libraries messenger_rna or protein_sequences the external evidence is compared with the genome of interest to identify regions showing similarity to the given sequences hybrid approaches such as augustus combine ab_initio gene prediction with evidence from other sources to verify the predicted genes for an overview on gene_finding algorithms the reader is referred to despite all efforts gene identification still faces significant challenges handling complex gene structures rare splice_sites or mutations in genes these problems can be approached by using the knowledge available from high_throughput rna_seq experiments the transcriptome reflects the genes expressed in the current condition of the cell which provides valuable information to identify novel genes or to confirm predicted genes although rna_seq experiments were included in several annotation studies so_far only few gene_finders directly incorporate rna_seq in gene prediction methods for gene_expression analysis such as ireckon cufflinks and erange perform a transcript assembly on rna_seq and thereby allow the identification of exons and splice_sites but they do not predict reading frames and start and stop_codon for genes for an overview of transcriptome annotation the reader is referred to augustus allows the integration of rna_seq experiments as an additional external_source for eukaryotic gene identification whereas genemark incorporates rna_seq evidence on prokaryotic gene predictions to identify operons the gene finder g mo r se predicts gene models based on rna_seq but does not identify mono exonic genes and only incorporates non ambiguous mappings because for instance repetitive or highly_similar regions or homologous_genes lead to a substantial part of non unique to whom correspondence should be addressed mappings discarding ambiguously mapped_reads from further analysis may result in a significant loss of prediction_accuracy to use the complete information contained in rna_seq experiments for gene identification we developed a rna seqbased de_novo gene predictor called giira gene identification incorporating rna_seq and ambiguous reads that works on a reference_genome and reads derived in a rna_seq experiment giira is primarily focused on prokaryotic gene prediction and in particular resolves genes within the continuously expressed region of an operon however giira can also be applied to predict genes and alternative transcripts for eukaryotes and it leverages information from spliced reads for intron identification hence it is also a useful addition to annotation_pipelines such as maker or a good complement to other eukaryotic gene_finders the identified transcripts are completed into gene models via a search for start and stop_codons as well as reading_frame and strand prediction based on the observed mapping coverage giira identifies candidate_genes that are refined in further validating steps ambiguous reads are reassigned to their most likely origins using a maximum flow approach formulated as a linear_program in contrast to other approaches to ambiguous read assignment such as the expectation_maximization based strategy introduced in chung et_al or contextmap our approach can integrate_information on the likelihood of a read_alignment not only from a fixed context interval of specified length or a context solely based on the mapping instead we directly incorporate the information gained in the process of identifying gene_candidates and further the linear_program ensures a convergence to an optimal_solution in principle the general idea of the maximum flow approach can also be applied to other questions related to ambiguity resolving we validate the accuracy of giira in three simulations and compare our approach with the widely used method cufflinks as well as the gene_finders genemark glimmer and augustus finally we apply giira to two real_datasets including million_reads from an escherichia_coli and million_reads from a saccharomyces_cerevisiae rnaseq experiment in our study we intend to demonstrate the applicability of giira on different organism types and the effect of including ambiguous mappings in the analysis thus a crucial point is the proportion of ambiguously mapped_reads in the alignment all mappings showed ambiguity although in varying levels with the simulated e coli data had the lowest proportion of ambiguous mappings whereas the real e coli experiment showed the highest proportion with the human simulation showed and the yeast datasets ambiguous hits respectively note that the large proportion on the real e coli data is due to a high_level of ribosomal_rna contamination within the sample data not shown without contamination the ambiguity is similar to the mapping proportion of the simulated e coli dataset that did not include contaminants details for all mapping results and system requirements of giira are included in the supplementary_material shows the cuffcompare comparison between cufflinks giira genemark and glimmer for the e coli simulation and the real e coli dataset respectively because the reads were derived directly from the annotated_genes the simulation reflects the ability of the compared methods to identify expressed regions and to resolve overlaps cufflinks glimmer and giira yield a high_accuracy on the base level with giira being more specific than cufflinks and glimmer whereas glimmer is slightly more sensitive than giira compared with genemark all methods show a sensitivity_and increased by more than because only giira and glimmer focus on extracting structural genes rather than operons or expressed areas it is not surprising that on exon and locus level both methods show clearly better accuracy than the competing_methods refer toandin the supplementary_material in the e coli simulation giira yields more accurate results than glimmer with sensitivity_and increased by up to and respectively on the locus level it should be noted that for cufflinks only the fuzzy exon and locus level are of relevance as cufflinks does not predict start and stop_codons and thus regularly misses bases at the start and end of genes the fuzzy category covers these bases because here not only a perfect match but also a match in range around the correct result is accepted for giira the fuzzy sn and sp are only slightly_increased compared with the perfect match sn and sp indicating a high_accuracy in predicting the correct frame for an expressed region it should be noted that for the real e coli dataset sn and sp values are only relative measurements to compare the four methods but cannot be regarded as absolute_numbers because not all of the genes in e coli are necessarily expressed at the same time thus an additional analysis based on a subset of likely expressed reference genes is included in the supplementary_material for this dataset it was not only important to identify expressed regions and distinguish contaminants but to also correctly predict genes within the expressed areas this is reflected in the low sensitivity_and values for cufflinks and genemark as both methods have a scope differing from identifying structural genes as shown_inand also inandin the supplementary_material glimmer appears to yield the best prediction_accuracy on all compared levels however the values obtained for glimmer do not reflect the prediction of the actually expressed genes because it is the only compared method that exclusively predicts ab_initio without including rna_seq evidence for the purpose of completeness we included the measures of sensitivity_and in the cuffcompare analysis however in our comparison we focus on the three methods capable of rna_seq integration genemark and giira yield comparable results on the base sensitivity level however giira is more specific as genemark covers large_parts of the e coli_genome with operons without indicating the correct locus of the included genes as illustrated inand inandin the supplementary_material giira performs better than cufflinks and genemark on exon and locus level giira achieves a good prediction_accuracy of the reference genes whereas cufflinks only predicts the expressed regions without indicating the included genes genemark predicts operons although these predicted regions also cover not expressed areas and can also span more than one operon indicated by reference genes in different directions we introduced giira as a gene finder that identifies potential coding_regions exclusively based on mapping of reads from an rna_seq experiment unlike other gene predictors giira also includes ambiguously mapped_reads in the analysis which improves on the prediction_accuracy as demonstrated for various datasets with different levels of ambiguity as shown in section note the highlighted numbers indicate the best results for each criterion for sensitivity_and for giira with ambiguous reads giira without ambiguous reads giira w o cufflinks and augustus note that in case of fuzzy sensitivity_and not only a perfect match but also a match in a range around the ground_truth result is accepted already a comparably small number of ambiguous reads can substantially contribute to the ambiguity of a mapping disregarding this information leads to a loss in sensitivity e g for genes sharing homologous regions or present in high copy_numbers refer to section where including ambiguous reads enhanced the sensitivity of exon predictions by up to one third giira accurately_predicts the correct genes for prokaryotic transcripts as demonstrated in section it identifies the most likely set of genes explaining the expressed region using an alignment scoring adaptation coupled with a linear_program formulation in comparison with existing_approaches capable of rna_seq integration giira has two major benefits i it shows overall increased prediction_accuracy and ii it predicts structural genes themselves rather than focusing on operons such as genemark or transcripts without indicating start and stop_codons such as cufflinks although giira was primarily designed for prokaryotic gene prediction it can also be applied to eukaryotic gene prediction as an addition to existing annotation_pipelines or a complement to other gene_finders for eukaryotic_genomes the complexity of alternative_splicing poses a critical challenge because giira does not work with splice_graphs to combine exons but evaluates each splice_site independently from others as illustrated in section compared with the other methods giira is sensitive in predicting exons and transcripts it also yields a high_accuracy in predicting introns but is less accurate in combining them to the correct intron chain for instance a challenge arises for giira if two alternative isoforms share an exon where one isoform ends with this exon and the other isoform proceeds with other exons for giira both isoforms appear to be continued with other exons and it assigns an incorrect intronchain because cufflinks uses a graph_theory approach to evaluate splice_sites it is less affected by this phenomenon and on the intron chain level it hence yields higher prediction_accuracy than giira augustus as a hybrid_gene predictor using non ambiguous rna_seq mappings as external evidence is less specific than the compared methods in regard to exon prediction but is superior in locus prediction because giira is exclusively based on rna_seq information it can only predict genes currently expressed in the organism of interest and thus does not necessarily provide a complete annotation of all encoded_genes giira provides two frameworks to control the number of false_positive i to filter contaminants and sequencing artifacts and ii to verify the reported gene predictions it can identify regions with an extremely_large coverage compared with the average coverage to be sequencing artifacts or other errors such as contaminants in case of the real e coli dataset this outlier identification filtered out most of the ribosomal_rna contaminants further giira reports additional information on coverage and ambiguous read support for each prediction this enables an easy post_processing of the output allowing a trade_off of sensitivity_and adjusted to the intended follow_up analysis note that although giira is independent from any a priori information it is possible to use such information if present to improve_the for instance if a reference annotation is already available different runs of giira can be compared using the cuffcompare framework to identify an optimal parameter setting
