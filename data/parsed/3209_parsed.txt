systems_biology near optimal_experimental for model_selection in systems_biology motivation biological_systems are understood through iterations of modeling and experimentation not all experiments however are equally valuable for predictive_modeling this study introduces an efficient method for experimental_design aimed at selecting dynamical_models from data motivated by biological_applications the method enables the design of crucial experiments it determines a highly informative selection of measurement readouts and time points results we demonstrate formal guarantees of design efficiency on the basis of previous results by reducing our task to the setting of graphical_models we prove that the method finds a near optimal_design selection with a polynomial number of evaluations moreover the method exhibits the best polynomial complexity constant approximation factor unless p np we measure the performance of the method in comparison with established alternatives such as ensemble non centrality on example models of different complexity efficient design accelerates the loop between modeling and experimentation it enables the inference of complex mechanisms such as those controlling central metabolic operation availability toolbox nearoed available with source_code under gpl on the machine_learning open_source web siteat the present level of development investigations in biology require setting up complicated and expensive experiments advances in measurement techniques prompted the recent growth of detailed mathematical_models which capture biological_phenomena at different levels of detail however the employment of novel measurement techniques by itself is insufficient to achieve high predictive_power experimental_design provides the necessary guidance to determine crucial observations often in fact an important task is the selection of the most informative experiments in systems_biology dynamical_models express causeeffect relations between interacting components designing optimal experiments for parameter_estimation is challenging but also well studied at present there already exist conclusive_results and ready to use procedures in contrast modern research often consists of discriminating between alternative_models a task for which several questions remain_open design optimization for the selection of dynamic_models proves especially challenging in the presence of nonlinear behavior in classical statistics ensemble non centrality constitutes the reference technique to design experiments for model_selection ponce de recently bayesian techniques have been applied with success to neuroimaging and biochemical modeling existing_methods are primarily limited by computational bottlenecks as optimization is often practically intractable this study introduces an efficient method to design informative experiments for selecting biological dynamical_systems building on previous results we go beyond current_limitations by constructing a method that yields near optimal combinations of time points and measurable readouts formal efficiency guarantees of the method are proved by reduction to a well studied general setting the method is generally_applicable and has been primarily motivated by questions arising from the biological domain we empirically evaluate the performance of the method with models of glucose_tolerance and cell_signaling we apply the method to address challenging open problems of biological and medical relevance the manuscript is organized as follows we start by introducing relevant facts and notions to be used in the rest of the article theoretical results are followed by empirical evaluation and numerical comparison with competing techniques finally the method is evaluated and verified with glucose_tolerance and cell_signaling further details are presented in the supplementary_material to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

original_work in a complex field in which noisy_data and expensive experiments constitute the norm it is crucial to guide experimentation through rational_design here our main contribution is the introduction of a method that guarantees high informativeness with a polynomial number of evaluations of the information objective the main motivation of this study is biological but it is worth noting that the presented results for readout and time point selection are applicable to general dynamical_systems as a consequence of previous results from submodular optimization we could prove that the greedy method exhibits the best constant approximation factor unless p np to design experiments for the selection among alternative dynamical_systems this study proves that entirely rational selections can be made a priori with efficiency and solely on the basis of the accumulated domain_knowledge reported results show that near optimal experiments are effectively optimal in the application to glucose_tolerance the method outperforms the available alternatives in terms of empirical success_rate as shown for tor modeling in a practical_application we used the method presented here in a study revealing nuclear phosphorylation as the key control mechanism for the transcription_factor msn on stress release in saccharomyces_cerevisiae by optimization of equation the experimental_design was targeted to enable informative selection among models_representing various hypothetical mechanisms for the short_term msn dynamics in this application the combination of experimental_design and model_selection led to identification and prediction of previously_unknown and potentially generic principles for transcription_factor dynamics a distinct but relevant question remains_open how to reliably identify the parameters of the candidate models this issue goes beyond the scope of this study as it strictly belongs to the domain of system identification at the same time it is an aspect that deserves special_attention as design and modeling are part of the same hypothetico deductive process we conclude that the introduced method may be useful to guide intuition through quantitative indicators and thus accelerate scientific discovery
