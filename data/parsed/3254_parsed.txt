next generation variationhunter combinatorial algorithms for transposon_insertion discovery recent_years an increase in research activity for the detection of structural_variants svs and their association to human disease the advent_of technologies make it possible to extend the scope of structural_variation studies to a point previously unimaginable as exemplified by the genomes_project although various computational_methods have been described for the detection of svs no such algorithm is yet fully capable of discovering transposon insertions a very important class of svs to the study of human evolution and disease in this article we provide a complete and novel formulation to discover both loci and classes of transposons inserted into genomes sequenced with high_throughput in addition we also present conflict_resolution improvements to our earlier combinatorial sv_detection algorithm variationhunter by taking the diploid nature of the human_genome into consideration we test our algorithms with simulated_data from the venter genome huref and are able to discover of transposon_insertion events with precision of we also demonstrate that our conflict_resolution algorithm denoted as variationhunter cr outperforms current state of the art such as original variationhunter breakdancer and modil algorithms when tested on the genome of the yoruba african individual na availability the implementation of algorithm is available athuman genetic_variation can be defined in various size ranges the smallest type of variation termed single_nucleotide snps are those at the single base_pair level the international_hapmap genotyped human individuals for million snps and recently the genomes_project http www genomes org was initiated to characterize human genetic_variation with lower minor_allele by sequencing more than human_genomes more recently it was shown that structural_variation events significantly contribute to human_genome diversity many structural_variants svs are associated with genetic_diseases such as psoriasis and crohns_disease prompting an increased interest in structural_variation studies chen to whom correspondence should be addressed recently it was shown that the sv reconstruction is harder than de_novo of small_genomes and introduced an extensive framework for optimal genome re sequencing recently we developed a set of combinatorial algorithms to detect structural_variation using high_throughput sequencing_data with improved_sensitivity through interrogating the repeat and duplication rich segments of the human_genome in the maximum_parsimony structural_variation mpsv discovery problem was introduced this mpsv problem asks to compute unique mapping for each discordant paired_end in the reference_genome such that total number of implied svs is minimized we also previously presented a computational_analysis of read_depth to characterize segmental_duplications and predict absolute_copy and content of duplicated_genes see the review fromfor the details and strengths of different structural_variation discovery methods one type of structural_variation excluded from this analysis is the mobile element transposition mobile_elements or transposons are repetitive_elements in the genome that occupy of the human_genome including alu l and sva elements most of the transposons are fixed in the human lineage however around of the transposons are still active and the copy_number and loci of these active transposons vary in the genomes of different individuals many studies have demonstrated that the mobile_elements contribute to genome_evolution and human genetic_diversity an interesting case was shown by insertions of an alu element were posited to cause pseudogenization of the irgm gene at the split of new world and old world monkey lineages million_years mya by disrupting the open_reading orf a second transposon integration erv restored the orf mya in the common_ancestor of apes and humans demonstrating the first report on a resurrected gene the human irgm gene plays an important role in the immune system and is associated with crohns_disease mobile element transpositions are associated with the expansion of interspersed segmental_duplications and can promote both the creation of segmental_duplication in human_genomes and the alteration of gene_transcription by gene trapping and exonization another aspect that most structural_variation algorithms ignore is the diploid nature of the human_genome and gasv each chromosome has exactly two copies therefore all loci in the genome w l o g except segmental_duplications are
