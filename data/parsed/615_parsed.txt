systems_biology automatic_detection of changes in the dynamics of delayed stochastic gene_networks and in vivo production of rna_molecules in escherichia_coli motivation production and degradation of rna and proteins are stochastic processes difficulting the distinction between spurious fluctuations in their numbers and changes in the dynamics of a genetic circuit an accurate method of change detection is key to analyze plasticity and robustness of stochastic genetic_circuits results we use automatic change_point detection methods to detect non spurious changes in the dynamics of delayed stochastic models of gene_networks at run time we test the methods in detecting changes in mean and noise of protein numbers and in the switching frequency of a genetic switch we also detect changes following genes silencing in the dynamics of a model of the core gene_regulatory of saccharomyces_cerevisiae with genes finally from images we determine when rna_molecules tagged with fluorescent_proteins are first produced in escherichia_coli provided prior_knowledge on the time scale of the changes the methods detect them accurately and are robust to fluctuations in protein and rna levels gene_regulatory grns are stochastic however their behavior is to some extent robust e g when responding to environmental changes the behavior is determined by the structure of the genetic_circuits thus when structural changes occur in many cases there are changes in the dynamics of rna and protein numbers of some genes some such structural changes e g a mutation can be rare occurring once in a cells lifetime it is thus important to develop robust_methods for detecting permanent changes in the dynamics of genetic_circuits and distinguish these from spurious fluctuations in rna and protein numbers to whom correspondence should be addressed we apply automatic change detection methods to simulated and real_gene to recognize candidate change_points in rna and protein numbersdynamics automatic_detection of change_points is the discovering of points in time where the properties of the time series change earliest approaches were based on the behrens fisher problem a statistical hypothesis_test of equal means a widely used approximation to solve this problem is the welchs t test however these approaches assume normal_distributions typically causing them to be too sensitive for heavy tailed distributions the dynamics of rna and protein production are usually not normal like especially if a structural_change occurs in the grn during the observations we use two recent change_point detection methods namely the density_ratio method and the kernel change_point analysis our choice is based on their reported good performance compared with alternative_methods these methods use different approaches the density_ratio method has its roots in statistics and density estimation while the kernel change_point analysis is based on the theory of kernel machines and classification in our understanding they represent state of the art approaches to the problem to assess the accuracy of the methods knowing the ground_truth signal is needed for this we require realistic simulations of rna and protein expression dynamics the dynamics of the models ought to be as realistic as possible so as to mimic accurately the temporal_dynamics of rna and protein numbers in real cells recently a delayed stochastic modeling strategy of gene_expression and grns was proposed it is based on the delayed stochastic_simulation delayed ssa and thus it accounts for the key dynamical features of real grns namely the stochasticity of the chemical kinetics and the duration of events such as the promoter complex formation and transcription_elongation this modeling strategy was shown to match the dynamics of rna and protein production at the single_molecule level delayed stochastic models of grns can be simulated by sgnsim which also allows introducing changes in the structure of the grn at run time needed to test the change_point detection methods we apply and test the accuracy of the automatic_detection of change_points methods to model grns subject to a permanentgenetic networks are subject to various structural changes and external signals which alter their dynamics in various degrees the detection of changes requires observing the dynamics of gene_expression at the single_cell single_molecule level so_far very few direct_or methods allow this observation and usually the extraction of the data from the measurements is cumbersome further the ground_truth signal is commonly unknown further enhancing the need of using models to develop new methods for detecting changes in the dynamics of genetic_circuits changes in gene_expression can be complex and diverse e g in time scale to detect them it is necessary to combine the use of adequate algorithms to particular changes and provide information of the nature of the change one wishes to detect which requires prior_knowledge of the dynamics of gene_expression at the molecular level combined with the development of new data analysis methods to distinguish real changes in signals from spurious fluctuations we applied recently_developed point change detection methods to this problem we tested their ability in detecting changes at run time in the dynamics of stochastic models of grns the changes implemented mimic naturally_occurring ones a change in the mean expression_level of a gene can occur e g due to gene_duplication or to silencing of a gene expressing a repressor a change in noise in protein levels can occur e g due to changes in the rate of rna degradation a change in the switching frequency of a two gene switch can occur e g due to a change in the number or binding_affinity of the repressor proteins finally the silencing of a gene that is part a large gene network can occur as a response to an external signal and will affect the expression levels of multiple genes in the network in most of our test cases kcpa outperforms ulsif this is likely a result of the nature of the changes that we aimed to detect and of the dynamics of protein and rna levels ulsif has problems with cross_validated parameter selection and its results suffer from the sensitivity to the choice of parameter the best kernel for detection is the linear kernel this is probably because the changes in our examples are simple changes in mean levels or for the more complicated_cases models and the data can be cast to a change in mean level in theory the other kernels may detect more complex changes which is probably the cause for multiple false matches in our case future_studies may determine which algorithms are more appropriate to which type of change when applying kcpa to a model of an inferred core network of genes of s cerevisiae we found page
