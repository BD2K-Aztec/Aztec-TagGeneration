structural_bioinformatics reno regularized non parametric_analysis of protein lysate array data motivation the reverse_phase protein lysate arrays have been used to quantify the relative_expression of a protein in a number of cellular samples simultaneously to avoid quantification bias due to mis specification of commonly used parametric_models a nonparametric approach based on monotone response curves may be used the existing_methods however aggregate the protein concentration levels of replicates of each sample and therefore fail to account for within sample variability results we propose a method of regularization on protein concentration estimation at the level of individual dilution series to account for within sample or within group variability we use an efficient algorithm to optimize an approximate objective_function with a data adaptive approach to choose the level of shrinkage simulation_results show that the proposed method quantifies protein concentration levels well we show through the analysis of protein lysate array data from cell_lines of different cancer groups that accounting for within sample variability leads to better statistical_analysis protein microarray_technologies e g macbeath and have been developed to measure protein concentrations in a high_throughput fashion extensive reviews of this technology can be found in a single nitrocellulose coated array slide can measure concentrations of a common protein in hundreds of samples in the form of dilution series the samples are hybridized and label attached with primary and biotinylated secondary_antibodies and the protein concentrations are then measured using streptavadin linked labels that bind to the biotin the final_product of each array is an image file in which to whom correspondence should be addressed quantified spots represent the observed protein expression levels at various dilutions steps protein lysate array technology has shown its promise in a number of clinical studies e g in particular its applications to various cancer studies have been documented extensively see for example various procedures to improve the analysis of protein lysate arrays have been proposed recently for example proposed antibody mediated signal_amplification to increase the sensitivity of this technology introduced a variable slope normalization among arrays to help reduce loading bias and recover true correlation structures among proteins in this article we focus on the protein quantification problem of estimating the relative protein concentrations in the arrayed samples in this area the commercial analysis package microvigene http www vigenetech com products htm estimates the protein expression_level by fitting a four parameter logistic_model to each dilution series used a linear_model between the observed protein_expressions or at logarithmic scale and the underlying concentration levels modeled the mean of the observed expression_level as a sigmoidal curve and estimated the model_parameters via the non linear least_squares alternatively modeled the serial_dilution curve based on the sips model similar to the logistic_model to characterize the relationship between signals in successive dilution steps these methods can be considered as parametric on the contrary proposed a non parametric approach by assuming that the median of the observed protein expression is equal to a monotonically increasing function without a parametric form this non parametric method contained in a recently_developed statistical tool rppanalyzer for analyzing protein lysate array data is highly dataadaptive without bias due to mis specification of g simulation_studies and real experiments have shown the advantage of the nonparametric approach in producing robust results in a variety of scenarios however the existing_methods of estimation deteriorate in performance as the noise to signal ratio increases in the data in addition the non parametric estimates if used to estimate protein concentration at the level of individual dilution series tend to be unstable due to data sparsity our work aims at improving the accuracy of protein level quantification over the non parametric procedure described in hu by incorporating a method of regularization on estimates within each sample we start with a general description of the problem let y ijl be the observed expression_level for the j th replicate of the i th sample at the l th dilution step i m j n i and l t each replicate is a dilution series of t steps the relationship between y ijl and the unobserved protein concentration level x ij at the log scale can be modeled aswhere g is the protein specific response curve d l defines the corresponding dilution index at the l thfor some smoothing parameter subject to the constraint that g is a non decreasing_function note that x ij are identifiable only up to a constant and the relative differences between x ij s are of interest in protein concentration as pointed_out by yang and he the complexity of this quantification problem comes from the dimension of x ij which increases with the sample_size one assumption made in earlier work is that x ij are constant within the i th sample this assumption is practically useful because it reduces the dimensionality of the problem and ensures stable estimates however it could lead to bias in estimation and more importantly could mask or distort variability across replicates we propose to allow x ij to vary with j but regularize the estimation problem by using a penalty term on within sample variabilities as a result we shrink some of the replicate level estimates to common values but allow within sample variabilities to be retained in other samples as needed as with other regularization methods in statistics our proposed method aims to balance the bias variance trade_off in a data adaptive way the rest of the article is organized as follows we describe the new method regularized nonparametric reno analysis of lysate arrays in section we demonstrate the performance of the new estimator through simulation_studies in section and show how the proposed method leads to better significance testing in a real_data example in section some concluding_remarks are given in section in this article we propose a regularized estimation procedure in non parametric_analysis of the protein lysate array quantification which enables us to consider replicate specific quantities when the within sample variability is significant we use a simple approximation to the loss function so that the optimization can be carried_out by linear programs we propose a specialized cv method to select the tuning parameter that regulates the withinsample variability earlier methods of lysate array quantification have to aggregate the replicates in each sample to avoid unstable estimates and in doing so important information may get lost in the aggregation we demonstrate through simulated_and that the proposed method is helpful in providing additional information about within sample variabilities which has important implications in the subsequent statistical_analysis of the lysate array data note that the estimated calibration_curves from different methods are essentially the same and the differences are in the concentration estimates of individual samples funding
