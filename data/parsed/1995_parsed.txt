genetier prioritization of candidate_disease using tissue_specific gene_expression motivation in attempts to determine the genetic causes of human disease researchers are often faced with a large number of candidate_genes linkage_studies can point to a genomic_region containing hundreds of genes while the high_throughput approach will often identify a great number of non synonymous genetic_variants since systematic experimental_verification of each such candidate_gene is not feasible a method is needed to decide which genes are worth investigating further computational gene_prioritization presents itself as a solution to this problem systematically analyzing and sorting each gene from the most to least likely to be the disease_causing gene in a fraction of the time it would take a researcher to perform such queries manually results here we present gene tissue expression ranker genetier a new web_based application for candidate_gene genetier replaces knowledge based_inference traditionally used in candidate disease_gene applications with experimental_data from tissue_specific gene_expression and thus largely overcomes the bias toward the better characterized genes diseases that commonly afflict other methods we show that our approach is capable of accurate candidate_gene and illustrate its strengths_and using case study examples availability_and freely_available on the web atcurrent high_throughput methods used for disease_gene can generate very large volumes of data while the extraction of non synonymous potentially deleterious variants can be easily automated this often results in the identification of thousands of candidate_disease since the experimental_verification of an individual gene can be both difficult and time consuming some method to prioritize the order in which such verification is sought is often employed a common approach is to examine biological_databases and literature for information pertaining to each candidate disease gene in order to select the most promising genes this can be both slow and error_prone as the data are spread across multiple resources with no common structure nor can this type of analysis be quantified since the selection is based solely on the subjective impressions of the researcher the algorithm used by genetier assumes that a disease genes expression tends to be significantly_higher in affected_tissues compared with unaffected tissue to test the generality of this assumption we retrieved expression values from our database for all genes in our training_set see section and performed a two sample kolmogorovsmirnov test for non normally distributed data using an alternative hypothesis that the cumulative frequency distribution function of modified scores from unaffected tissues lies below that of modified scores from diseaseassociated tissues for rna sequencing_data this resulted in statistic d with respective p value e and for microarray_data d p value e the performance of genetier was assessed on a dataset comprised of known associations between disease genes and tissues expected to be affected by each genes dysfunction for each disease gene four sets of random genes were generated comprising and genes the disease genes were prioritized against the genes in the randomly_generated gene_sets and the results analyzed using roc_analysis roc_curves provide a way to visualize and compare classifier performance here the candidate_gene algorithm can be viewed as a non binary scoring classifier where disease linked_genes are positive instances and other candidates are negatives the valuesor ranksfrom the classifier output can be converted into binary positive_and scores using cut_off thresholds thus a confusion matrix can be calculated for every integer rank cut_off value from which comparison metrics such as sensitivity_and values are derived roc graphs allow the visualization of sensitivity versus specificity the line running from the origin to the maximum point of y x which corresponds to an area under the curve auc of represents a performance that is no better than random predictions points on a roc_curve that occur above this line represent an algorithm with better than random classifier performance while those below the line have worse than random results i e a bias toward classifying positives as negatives an algorithm with an auc of represents perfect classifier performance shows the resultant roc graphs whileshows the corresponding auc scores this analysis suggests that the algorithms performance was inversely_related to the number of nondisease genes in the analysis but does not decline in a linear manner in fact the differences in performance when assessed on candidate lists consisting of or candidates are minor and do not suggest that the maximum candidate gene_list size will be encountered in typical gene_mapping experiments overall the obtained auc values are sufficiently_high to suggest that disease genes are typically ranked higher than the randomly_selected genes in each data_set by this algorithm in order to illustrate the circumstances where our methodology either failed or succeeded we used a case study of the global expression_patterns for genes implicated in retinitis_pigmentosa omim a degenerative eye disease_causing severe vision_impairment shows the expression_profiles across multiple normal_tissues of five disease genes known to underlie retinitis_pigmentosa while tables and show the summary of the mean ranks obtained using our method the genes prpf and prpf show distinct tissue_specific expression in eye tissues with negligible expression in non ocular_tissue disease genes with similar expression_profiles are ranked very highly by our methodology while prpf is also highly_expressed in eye tissues unlike prpf and prpf its expression is not limited to ocular_tissues resulting in a reduced but still strongly suggestive ranking rom is expressed in a number of non ocular_tissues as well as in corneal_epithelial but still ranked highly this was in spite of its lower expression in corneal_epithelial than that of the prpf genes and comparable expression in adipose_tissue unsurprisingly in view of its ubiquitously low_expression the methodology failed to identify pr in order to ascertain whether our method is more appropriate for certain disease types we analyzed how well genetier performs across a range of tissues supplementaryhighlights that genetier can accurately prioritize genes across most tissue categories recognizing endocrine and integumentary system specific genestissue specific gene_expression profilesparticularly well with and of disease genes respectively ranked in the top however genes in the sensory category comprising mostly eye related_disorders ranked poorly the eye is a complex organ with many specialized tissue_types while the genetier database contains expression data from corneal_epithelial stromal_cells and murine lens these do not encompass all the diverse cell_types present in the eye consequently diseases of the eye that do not affect these tissues will not be correctly prioritized by our approach conversely diseases_affecting vision can be neurodegenerative in nature in which case the causativegene may not have a function in the eye finally we have considered which data typerna seq or microarrayenabled more accurate prioritization results we considered all diseases where both rnaseq and microarray_data were available for all the identified affected tissue_types supplementaryshows the roc_curves obtained when the dataset was prioritized together with random genes the difference in performance between rna_seq and microarray_data is minimal with rna sequencing_data giving better results roc versus but slightly worse than the combined score approach roc this is in concordance with a recent study by who found that while more differentially_expressed identified by rna_sequencing than microarray_studies could be verified by qpcr the gain was mostly from the improved quantification of low_abundance transcripts furthermore while sequencing_data do provide a small improvement over microarray_data in prioritization this is offset by a more limited public availability of sequencing_datasets there are currently microarray_datasets deposited in array express database in contrast to only rna sequencing_experiments accessed while a number of methods have been previously_employed for the prioritization of candidate_disease none are universally_applicable these methods tend to rely heavily on prior_knowledge about the disease phenotype and or genes making them unsuitable systems for classifying novel and or poorly_characterized genes the best performing methods have been shown to rely on a variety of information_sources to compensate for inadequacies in knowledge in any single domain however there is value to be found in approaches which distance themselves entirely from the guilt byassociation principle used by these methods which have an inherent bias toward well characterized genes the wide_range of open_access gene_expression data can serve to overcome the limitations of prior_knowledge based_approaches by substituting gene or disease specific information with tissue_specific experimental_data however implementations of this approach often exhibit certain limitations some implementations prioritize candidate_disease based on co expression with genes already known to be associated with the disease in question this requires the user to supply seed genes thus making the assumption that preexisting knowledge about the disease is either available or relevant to the particular disease phenotype this may not be the case for example omim currently contains several thousand disease entries for which no contributing genes are yet known conversely a number of network based_methods prioritize genes under the assumption that a disease gene will exist in a local network of genes which are highly differentially_expressed between affected and unaffected tissues however while this type of approach can be successful in disease specific studies it is difficult to generalize for wider use due to its reliance on differential_expression datasets between disease and control tissue_samples some implementations overcome these difficulties by requesting the user to supply their own data however this can be seen as a contradiction to the major aim of computational candidate prioritization which is to reduce the experimental burden on a researcher rather than requiring the user to perform further studies in this study we present a novel application for candidate disease_gene that aims to address the shortcomings discussed above genetier does not require the user to have any prior_knowledge of the disease other than the ability to unambiguously identify affected_tissues the application has been specifically_designed to require only minimal user input and takes care of conversions between a variety of commonly used gene identifiers and between human mouse orthologs we have taken advantage of both microarray expression and rna sequencing_data available in the public_domain to create an extensive tissue_specific expression database that can support a wide_variety of gene_prioritization queries organs are made up of many functionally diverse tissue cell_types and this can be reflected in the experimental_data therefore we have striven to collate data from multiple distinctive datasets to enable the user to make tissue cell_type queries which are not supported by many of the popular databases many popular gene_prioritization methods that rely on prior_knowledge about a disease use either text_mining approaches or gene_ontology to score candidates based on relevance to query currently there are still over a thousand human genes with no available go annotations and many more with shallow annotations while this presents a problem for disease gene inference by similarity the method described here would not be any less applicable for example at the time of writing no gene_ontology have yet been ascribed to the human cdr gene known to contribute to paraneoplastic cerebellar_degeneration omim this gene shows localized expression in brain_tissues in particular in the cerebellum and as such is scored highly by our method whereas approaches reliant on prior_knowledge are likely to fail however direct performance_comparisons between gene prioritization_tools are difficultwithout cross_validation any prioritization on known disease genes is meaningless and to the best of our knowledge no web gene_prioritization application provides a performance assessment mode while we have shown that genetier is capable of accurate disease_gene through roc_analysis with auc values of up to it should be noted that the disease gene is rarely ranked first in the output this ranking should therefore be used as a guide to the order in which candidate_genes should be analyzed further even so it must be noted that not all disease gene_expression conform to the assumptions underlying our model for example some disease genes show universally high or low gene_expression across all tissues see rp in indeed aberrant activation of genes which are normally repressed can result in a disease phenotype as is the case in many cancers however in order to detect these patterns the differential_expression change must be observed between the normal and affected states while including differential_expression data from normal and affected patients would no doubt improve genetier performance public availability of such data is mostly limited to a small number of well studied diseases and therefore would enhance the results for only a small proportion of cases furthermore as oellrich and smedley note in their analysis the site of gene_expression and the visible phenotype do not always coincide consequently the limitations of this method must be understood and taken into consideration when examining the final gene rankings this is especially true where the link between tissue and phenotype may not be immediately obvious for example congenital dysfibrinogenemia omim is a blood_clotting disorder caused by defective fibrinogen genes fgb fgg and fga circulating factors_affecting blood_clotting are synthesized by hepatocytes and indeed our data show that fibrinogen genes are highly and exclusively_expressed in the liver supplementary however genetier would not identity these disease genes if the user failed to take this into account and selected blood rather than liver as the affected tissue narcolepsy cataplexy orphanet is a sleep_disorder with multiple causative_genes identified genetier scores a number of these highly for example mog and znf due to localized expression in parts of the brain supplementary however the disease can have an autoimmune component and in some patients the phenotype has been attributed to the loss of neurons in the hypothalamus due to autoimmune attacks consequently our methodology fails to identify histocompatibility genes hla_dqb and hla_drb as causative_genes for the disease and may find other phenotypes arising from heterogeneous causes challenging supplementary similarly genetier will not be able to identify disease genes that are expressed exclusively in tissues not present in our dataset similarly diseases caused by genes that are expressed in response to either an environmental stimulus or within a short development time frame will not perform well if the appropriately stimulated tissue is absent from our dataset in spite of these challenges there are numerous cases where the observed phenotype correlates with the site of expression exceedingly well for example renal_tubular dysgenesis omim is characterized by a congenital_abnormality of the kidneys with low amniotic_fluid during pregnancy the protein associated with the disease ren is produced mostly by juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney the data in genetier database agree with this showing elevated expression in the kidney as well as a secondary major site of expression in the placenta supplementary our testing indicates that our gene_prioritization method is capable of meaningful candidate_gene and performs strongly in a substantial_proportion of cases tested genetier aims to highlight genes with tissue_specific to the user from among other candidate_genes in their dataset and as such will perform best for diseases with distinct localized phenotypes nevertheless a broad selection of tissues allows for scoring of complex phenotypes affecting any combination of tissues we believe genetier offers great utility value to the research_community and can effectively supplement the in silico toolbox of any researcher
