balestraweb efficient online evaluation of drug_target balestraweb is an online server that allows users to instantly make predictions about the potential occurrence of interactions between any given drugtarget pair or predict the most likely interaction_partners of any drug or target listed in the drugbank it also permits users to identify most similar drugs or most similar targets based on their interaction_patterns outputs help to develop hypotheses about drug_repurposing as well as potential side_effects availability_and balestraweb is accessible at http balestra csb pitt edu the tool is built using a probabilistic matrix fac torization method and drugbank v and the latent_variable are trained using the graphlab collaborative filtering toolkit the server is implemented using python flask numpy and scipy contemporary drug_discovery faces important challenges bringing a new molecular entity to the market is estimated to cost upward of billion us and the rate of new drug_discovery has steadily halved every years for the past_years one of the common suggestions brought forth to explain and remedy this trend is a paradigm_shift in drug_discovery from high_affinity on a single target toward modulation of cellular network states through multiple interactions the development of computational_methods that can efficiently assess potential new interactions for drug_repurposing thus became an important goal in quantitative systems network pharmacology research we recently_introduced a probabilistic matrix_factorization pmf method that can be applied to known drugtarget_interaction graphs for predicting new interactions here we introduce balestraweb a web_server that has been developed for allowing users to efficiently obtain results from the pmf analysis and assess the likelihood of interaction between any drugtarget pair similarity stitch is an extensive repository of protein and chemicals billion interactions including predictions based on chemical similarities of compounds however the interactions predicted by balestraweb are not based on a particular chemical or genomic similarity method but on the assessment of comparable interaction_patterns and as such they differ from or complement those predicted by sea or listed by stitch balestraweb provides users the ability to predict the most likely interaction_partners of any drug or target beyond those known and compiled in the drugbank the technology used to build the web_server scales linearly with the number of drugs or targets and is therefore easily scalable to larger datasets as they become available our plan is to regularly update the underlying engine and optimized_parameters by using the newly released data the modular_architecture of the software allows us to update the web_server to reflect changes as new data become available free fast and easy to use balestraweb enables researchers to help eliminate improbable drugtarget_interactions and efficiently focus their limited resources on selected drugs balestraweb architecture and underlying methodology the user input lower left is mapped onto the latent_factor vector s u i v j for targets learned by minimizing squared error regularized by frobenius norm see equation at top left the output right contains a score r representative of predicted interaction confidence along with a graphical_representation of the close neighborhood of the query drug sunitinib and or query target scn a in the drug_target association_network along with a table of known and predicted interactions similar features hold for drug drug and targettarget similarity_searches and outputs
