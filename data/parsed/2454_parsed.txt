inferring_gene by anova motivation to improve the understanding of molecular regulation events various approaches have been developed for deducing gene_regulatory from mrna_expression data results we present a new score for network_inference that is derived from an analysis_of candidate transcription_factor target_gene tf tg relationships are assumed more likely if the expression of tf and tg are mutually_dependent in at least a subset of the examined experiments we evaluate this dependency by a non parametric non linear_correlation it is fast easy to apply and does not require the discretization of the input_data in the recent dream blind assessment the arguably most comprehensive evaluation of inference methods our approach based on was rated the best performer on real expression compendia it also performs better than methods tested in other recently_published comparative assessments about half of our predicted novel predictions are true interactions as estimated from qpcr experiments performed for dream conclusions the score has a number of interesting_features that enable the efficient detection of gene regulatory_interactions for most experimental_setups it is an interesting alternative to other measures of dependency such as pearsons_correlation or mutual_information availability see http www bio ifi lmu de kueffner anova tar gz for code and example data the reconstruction of gene_regulatory grns from expression data can help to improve our understanding of molecular regulation events a variety of algorithms have been devised to predict gene regulatory_interactions frequently based on mutual dependencies between the expression of regulators and their targets see related work we propose to evaluate transcription_factor target_gene tf tg interactions by the measure a non linear_correlation derived from an analysis_of anova although has a number of interesting_features it has to our knowledge not been applied to network_inference or to bioinformatics in general to whom correspondence should be addressed a high proportion of our predicted novel interactions were confirmed by small_scale qpcr experiments performed by the dream organizers in addition our approach was evaluated as the best performer for the inference of real_datasets in the recent dream blind assessment http wiki c b columbia edu dream index php here participating teams applied a diverse set of inference methods to a variety of large real escherichia_coli saccharomyces_cerevisiae and artificial expression compendia with thousands of genes from several hundreds of microarray measurements the microarray_experiments consisted of various gene drug or environmental_perturbations that were in some cases carried_out as time courses after a brief summary of related work we describe the grn_inference setting introduce our inference approach based on the score and evaluate its properties and performance to infer gene_regulatory grns we rank the relevance of candidate relationships consisting of a tf and a tg by measuring the dependency between their respective expression_profiles for the detection of dependencies we proposed the measure that is derived from an analysis_of anova to our knowledge has not been applied to network_inference or to other problems in bioinformatics although it has a number of interesting_features like pearsons but in contrast to bayes conditional_probability tables or mutual_information does not require the discretization of the input_data this increases the robustness of our method as inappropriate discretization might lead to loss of signal in contrast to pearsons linear_correlation is a non parametric non linear_correlation it also detects local correlations that are only apparent in a subset of the measured conditions this increased sensitivity is due to the effective utilization of replicated measurements to model the measurement_error the recent dream blind assessment solicited the prediction of grns with thousands of genes from two real_datasets e coli and s cerevisiae and one artificial dataset the participating teams employed a variety of methods based on regression lasso random_forests bayesian_networks mutual_information and correlation in dream our approach was rated the best performer on the inference of real_networks and the second best performer on real and artificial networks combined especially for the inference of e coli interactions our approach performed significantly better than the methods evaluated in dream as well as in the large assessment of in contrast to e coli predictions for s cerevisiae received significantly_lower scores because the yeast gold_standard network is less reliable compared with e coli and artifical networks inference is substantially more difficult in s cerevisiae as here the expression of tf and their regulated_genes is hardly correlated indeed with an auc between and predictions were hardly better than guessing the difficulty of network_inference in s cerevisiae has also been recognized by many publications on network_inference approaches solely focus on e coli mordelet and some of the known e coli interactions identified by our approach were quite interesting biologically for instance an interaction between multiple antibiotic_resistance was active after antibiotic_treatment local correlation but not in growth phase experiments according to qpcr experiments that were performed as part of the dream conference of our novel predictions represent true interactions at a precision of we thus expect that our predictions contain previously unobserved true interactions
