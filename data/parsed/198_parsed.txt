genetics_and alchemy a reliable method for automated snp genotype_calling for small batch sizes and highly homozygous populations motivation the development of new high_throughput products requires a significant investment in testing and training samples to evaluate and optimize the product before it can be used reliably on new samples one reason for this is current methods for automated calling of genotypes are based on clustering_approaches which require a large number of samples to be analyzed simultaneously or an extensive training_dataset to seed clusters in systems where inbred samples are of primary interest current clustering_approaches perform poorly due to the inability to clearly identify a heterozygote cluster results as part of the development of two custom single_nucleotide genotyping products for oryza_sativa domestic rice we have developed a new genotype_calling algorithm called alchemy based on statistical_modeling of the raw intensity data rather than modelless clustering a novel feature of the model is the ability to estimate and incorporate inbreeding information on a per sample basis allowing accurate genotyping of both inbred and heterozygous samples even when analyzed simultaneously since clustering is not used explicitly alchemy performs well on small_sample with accuracy exceeding with as few as samples the number of single_nucleotide snps that can be genotyped in a single experiment has increased exponentially in the past_years with costs per data point declining at the same time this technological advance has been critical to the design and to whom correspondence should be addressed execution of cost_effective genome_wide gwas in humans and other well studied systems while most catalog products offered by companies such as illumina and affymetrix are developed for human genotyping the underlying technologies of the assays themselves and the manufacturing methods which produce such high_density products should be transferable to most diploid systems of interest and are currently being adapted for domesticated plants and animals the development of a custom genotyping product is still an expensive process especially if re sequencing for snp discovery must be performed even with a sufficient snp database on hand the development of a working assay may require dozens or even hundreds of samples to be run in order to identify which array features are working reliably and which simply do not perform well in the multiplexed environment human genotyping products from affymetrix and illumina now in their fifth generation or later are largely free of snps and probes which did not convert to working assays as previous generation products have identified these snps empirically and they have been removed from later generation products however a first generation custom product may see up to of the intended snp assays fail to generate accurate results and this may only be determined after or more samples have been run depending on the number of samples planned for the entire experiment the cost of the samples needed for development and quality_control procedures for custom genotyping products may easily form a significant fraction of the total experiment cost one limitation in custom genotyping array development is the requirement of many automated genotype_calling such as affymetrixs brlmm p to have a large number of samples from which three distinct clusters of genotypes aa ab bb can be reliably identified and clearly distinguished the methodology in many of these clustering_algorithms implicitly assumes the existence of all three clusters other published_methods attempt to statistically test whether or not two or three clusters best describes the data some more recent methods such as birdseed require or more samples with known genotypes to be assayed in advance to train the algorithm the brlmm p algorithm can accept training samples as priors or can be run without priorsin the development of the two genotyping products we have four types of samples which can be used to evaluate performance of the assays themselves and the alchemy genotype_calling method i reference samples ii replicate samples iii oryzasnp samples and iv samples which have been re sequenced by high_throughput illumina genomeanalyzer ii to a sufficient extent to determine the allele at a large majority of snp sites except where explicitly stated otherwise all validations were performed comparing either alchemy or the vendors software beadstudio and brlmm p run on the entire collection of illumina assays or affymetrix assays the reference samples are the two rice lines for which assembled genome_sequence is publicly_available the first nipponbare is a temperate japonica line which has been extensively sequenced and assembled into high_quality pseudo molecules the second is an indica variety which has been sequenced by sanger whole_genome and assembled using the nipponbare genome_sequence as a scaffold our samples bear the same name as these reference_genomes but are not identical to the lines sequenced as seen inreplicate the expected calls based on the nipponbare sequence to a high degree but diverge from the genome_sequence however since we have many replicates of these samples we find that there is high concordance across our reference samples and it seems likely that the differences seen between our and the genome_sequence reflect true differences resulting from different origins of the materials likewise the f genotypes which we predict from the nipponbare and genome_sequences also show differences with the alchemy calls as a consequence of the divergent lines next we looked at the samples run in replicate including the reference samples above in the illumina samples we have seven samples run at least twice including the reference samples with all pairs of replicates showing an average concordance of and average pairwise mutual call rate genotype called in both samples of this is also seen in the affymetrix samples where different samples run at least twice have an average pairwise concordance of and average mutual call rate of this indicates both the assays themselves and alchemy genotype_calls are consistent across many distinct samples because our snp discovery panel was limited to accessions across five subpopulations of domestic rice and we purposely selected snps that would be informative in at least or more subpopulations where possible there are no snps in the panel of lines studied here with a minor_allele however it is easy to construct a subset of samples such that a large percentage of snps will have only a single observation of the minor_allele homozygote to do this we selected one nipponbare control samplefor these lines from the sequence_data we can compare these expected genotypes to alchemy calls on average we find a high concordance average call rate with some of the lines having lower concordance being those derived from distinct plant materials or having lower coverage depth in re sequencing supplementary taken together these analyses broadly validate alchemys genotype_calls across many different rice samples next we asked whether or not alchemy was over fit to these specific genotyping products the vendors genotyping algorithms work well for human products and other supported products but did not perform well out of the box on our custom arrays and our samples as demonstrated above in the interest of promoting the development of new genotyping products in more systems we would like to have a genotyping algorithm that performs well across a broad range of vendors products systems and sample_sets requiring little or no empirical fine_tuning to obtain high_quality data to assess alchemys performance on a non rice dataset we obtained the publicly_available hapmap phase_ii published genotypes and the affymetrix human k genechip cel files that were run on these same samples and ran alchemy and brlmm p as expected brlmm p performs very well as it and its predecessor brlmm has been developed and tuned for affymetrix human genotyping products although alchemy does not perform as well as brlmm p on human hapmap samples it still performs very well even without specific tuning or trial anderror adjustments to improve accuracy or call rate these results taken together with the results above showing strong performance on two very different technologies suggests alchemy is a generalized method with broad applications especially for custom products where fine_tuned specialized algorithms are not available finally since custom products may require optimization of molecular_techniques and protocols to obtain optimal results we wanted to develop a method which produced accurate and usable results even if the total_sample was small to demonstrate alchemys ability to call small_sample we ran alchemy as well as the vendors software on a series of sample subsets and assessed the accuracy and call rates for our three reference samples nipponbare and the nipponbare x f additionally we ran each of the three reference samples alone to assess performance on a single sample because of the unfortunate discrepancy between our line and the line which was sequenced we gauge accuracy on the basis of agreement with the consensus alchemy calls for these samples across all replicates in the full dataset but restrict ourselves to snps with consensus calls which are consistent with mendelian transmission to the f in the full dataset in we find that alchemy quickly attains accuracy with as few as samples see alsofor a graphical_representation of additionally it performs very well on either homozygote sample alone but quite poorly on the heterozygote sample alone in contrast brlmm p performs very poorly on any of the three reference samples alone and poorly on small samples sizes brlmm p accuracy increases as sample_size increases as expected but surprisingly call rates decline similar results are observed with illumina beadstudio except call rates do not decline with larger_sample and beadstudio performs very well on either homozygote sample alone but not with the heterozygote sample alone supplementary the design of alchemy was motivated primarily by two concerns the poor_performance of the vendors software on inbred sample_sets and the requirement for a large number of samples to be simultaneously_analyzed to obtain accurate results as mentioned previously the two concerns are related as the main_reason many samples are required for clustering_algorithms is to ensure that each genotype cluster is well represented allowing its location and boundaries to be well defined thus if heterozygotes are rare or absent in the data due to inbreeding the heterozygote cluster cannot be reliably identified even if large_numbers of inbred samples are used to address this we have proposed a statistical_model to describe the raw intensity data which is the basic observation of both affymetrix and illumina genotyping_platforms the model is capable of making an inference even if only a single sample is analyzed but the parameters of the model are refined and optimized when several samples are available for simultaneous inference in addressing concern this approach is shown to be highly_successful with alchemy obtaining accuracy with as few as samples on the affymetrix k platform and larger number of samples continuing to improve call rates additionally the statistical treatment of the problem permits inbreeding to be explicitly considered and incorporated into the model in an appropriate way simultaneously estimating and optimizing the inbreeding_coefficient on a per sample basis allows both outbred and inbred samples to be analyzed simultaneously and improves both accuracy and call rates although not studied extensively here the posterior call probability produced by alchemy as a quality metric can conceivably be used directly in downstream population_genetic and quantitative_genetic statistical_analyses for the rice datasets and the human hapmap dataset the signal_to of the intensity data is strong enough that for most snps there is little uncertainty in the genotype call however in noisier data incorporating the probability of error estimated by alchemy for genotype_calls into statistical_analyses may allow for more accurate population_genetic inferences and improve both sensitivity_and of gwas we caution however that these probabilities are subjective due to the use of a bayesian_model and may not precisely correspond to actual observed error_rates the bayesian_model not only presumes the bimodal intensity_distribution but also hwe with inbreeding adjustment of genotype_frequencies across the sample set violation of either model assumption will introduce deviations between expected error_rates formed by summing p were p is the posterior_probability of the call versus observed error_rates this is particularly relevant for our rice samples which come from a highly_structured population where deviations from hwe frequencies are expected not only due to inbreeding but also from differences in allele_frequencies between subpopulations the results presented here show that alchemys performance is superior to either vendors standard_software on the two rice genotyping products considered additionally the strong performance on human hapmap data suggests that alchemy may work well on a wide_range of products we have also tested alchemy on currently unpublished_data from dogs in both affymetrix and illumina products and found a consistent high_level of performance at or exceeding the levels reported here while brlmm p outperforms alchemy on the hapmap samples it is important to note that we did not attempt to tune or alter alchemy for improved_performance on hapmap as the purpose was to test whether or not alchemy is already over fit to the rice genotyping_arrays for which it was developed compared to many other genotype_calling software_packages alchemy has relatively few options to tune its performance for specific datasets in part we consider this a feature rather than a weakness as the multitude of tuning parameters for programs such as brlmm p are bewildering to the user and potentiallyillumina rice
