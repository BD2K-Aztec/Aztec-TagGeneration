dasty a web framework for das motivation dasty is a highly interactive and extensible web_based framework it provides a rich application_programming upon which it is possible to develop specialized clients capable of retrieving information from das sources as well as from data providers not using the das protocol dasty provides significant improvements on previous web_based frameworks and is implemented using the das specification availability dasty is an open_source tool freely_available www ebi ac uk dasty under the terms of the gnu_general source and documentation can be found atthe distributed annotation system das defines a communication protocol used to exchange annotations on genomic or protein_sequences implicit in the conception of das is the notion of decentralization annotations should not be provided by single centralized databases but should instead be spread over multiple sites das relies on clientserver architecture das servers manage data distribution by following a standard protocol while manipulation and visualization are on the client side thus facilitating the development of tailored tools addressing specific requirements several clients are available for instance spice is a browser that displays protein_sequences structures and their corresponding annotations another client dasty provides a web_based interface that facilitates visualizing and comparing protein_sequence annotations from das servers these clients are addressing specific needs however none of them is providing a framework upon which tools can be built and integrated into a cohesive web environment dasty relies on a modular_architecture which facilitates development of specialized plug_ins dasty like dasty is a web_based das client however dasty is not just a client but to whom correspondence should be addressed a platform delivering a rich api over which tailored plug_ins can be built dasty inherits from dasty the modularity of its graphical_user gui additionally it provides a webbased framework for visualizing and manipulating information from das sources as well as other third_party data providers it facilitates delivering unified views upon which several manipulation facilities can be implemented it offers a public application_programming api that delivers methods for integrating visualizing and manipulating data_sources
