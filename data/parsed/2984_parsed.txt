mir go comparative functional analysis for micrornas mir go is a web_based for comparative_analyses of human mirna functions it includes two programs mirmut go and mirpair go mirmut go implements a knowledge based method to assess the functional effects of genetic and somatic_mutations in microrna seed regions the functional effects of a mutation are analysed by semantic comparison of enriched gene_ontology go annotations of the target gene_sets for the wild_type and mutated_alleles mirpair go compares the functions of two different mirnas based on the enriched functional_annotations of their target gene_sets availability_and the mir go web_server is available at http compbio uthsc edu mir go micrornas mirna are important post_transcriptional it has been estimated that of protein_coding are potential targets of mirna regulation the most important regulatory signal of a mirna the information guiding its target_recognition is primarily encoded in the seed_region nucleotides in mature mirna sequences because a mirna often have a large number of target_genes a mirna_seed mutation may affect the regulation of many genes simultaneously thus genetic and somatic_mutations in mirna seeds may have broad impacts on target gene_expression and have been linked to various diseases microrna functions can be predicted and annotated by linking the target_genes to diseases and gene_ontology go terms however such analyses are based only on wild_type mirnas and do not study the effects of mirna mutations the functional effects of a mirna_seed mutation can be assessed by comparative_analysis of predicted target_genes for the wild_type and mutated_alleles of the mirna differences and similarities in the enriched functional_annotations of the reference in this paper the set of target_genes for the wild_type mirna are called reference targets the set of target_genes for the mutated mirna are called derived targets the genes in both sets are called common targets and derived target_genes reflect the overall functional_impacts of the mutation here we developed the mir go web_server to provide a computational_tool for the assessment of functional_impacts of genetic and somatic_mutations in mirna_seed regions the first program of this web_server mirmut go allows users to analyse the changes of target_genes caused by mirna_seed mutations and view the functional_impacts of these changes in go graphs the second function of the web_server mirpair go allows users to perform comparative functional analysis of different mirnas with the advance in genomic technologies the number of newly_identified genetic and somatic_mutations in mirna seeds has been increasing very rapidly in recent_years there was virtually no known mirna_seed snps when we created the polymirts database and only snps were mapped to the human mirna_seed regions when we developed polymirts the number of human mirna_seed snps increased to in polymirts currently snps can be mapped to the seed regions of human mirnas using the genomic_coordinates of snps in dbsnp and the mirna data in mirbase somatic_mutations have also been found in mirna_seed regions there is a great need to analyse the functional_impacts of the mirna_seed mutations mir go provides a web_based to address this challenge it integrates mirna_target go enrichment_analysis and semantic comparison of functional_annotations to analyse the functional_impacts of mutations in mirna_seed regions it also uses the same workflow to compare the functions of different mirnas it is noteworthy that mir go can also be used to predict the functional_impacts of any hypothetical seed mutations or compare the functions of designed mirna sequence with existing mirnas which might be useful in artificial mirna design mir go relies on mirna_target prediction_tools to generate target gene_sets the default mirna_target prediction_tool of mir go is targetscan in a recent comprehensive assessments of mirna_target prediction_methods targetscan was one of the best predictors with an auc area_under of at the gene level although this is a reasonably good predictive_performance obviously mir go can benefit from more accurate mirna_target because mir go uses a modular framework better target prediction_tools can be easily incorporated when they become available
