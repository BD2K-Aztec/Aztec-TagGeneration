databases_and iann an event sharing platform for the life_sciences we present iann an open_source community driven platform for dissemination of life_science events such as courses conferences and workshops iann allows automatic visualisation and integration of customised event reports a central repository lies at the core of the platform curators add submitted events and these are subsequently accessed via web_services thus once an iann widget is incorporated into a website it permanently shows timely relevant_information as if it were native to the remote site at the same time announcements submitted to the repository are automatically disseminated to all portals that query the system to facilitate the visualization of announcements iann provides powerful filtering options and views integrated in google maps and google calendar all iann widgets are freely_available getting a clear overview of bioinformatics events is not a trivial task although several efforts have been made in this direction e g ensuring that information is accurate and reliable yet secure from malicious attack requires curators to sift carefully through internet content to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com to identify and annotate pertinent events in addition to collecting information from other portals emitting sources typically create announcements about their own events current methods for dissemination of events in the life_sciences are however fragmented and uncoordinated some announcements never reach parts of their intended target_audience and many spam unintended recipients ideally announcements should reach all potential event participants without troubling those for whom they are irrelevant or inappropriate in practice however announcements are typically posted simultaneously to several different sites in an attempt to reach the widest possible audience this process is both time consuming for those posting the announcements and bombards recipients with duplicate information about the same event from multiple sites it also makes_it to change the announcement details e g a deadline extension for submission of posters as it is practically impossible to ensure that updates are propagated to every resource to which the original announcement was sent in consequence recipients may be misinformed or confused by announcements of the same event with contradictory dates speaker changes and so on which may ultimately damage the reputation of the emitting source a central point that collects data from event organizers would address many of these problems and provide a valuable resource for life_science event organizers and participants course trainers and so on
