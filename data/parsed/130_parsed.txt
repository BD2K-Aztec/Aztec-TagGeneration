genetics_and adjustment for local_ancestry in genetic_association of admixed_populations motivation admixed_populations offer a unique_opportunity for mapping diseases that have large disease allele_frequency differences between ancestral_populations however association analysis in such populations is challenging because population_stratification may lead to association with loci unlinked to the disease_locus methods and results we show that local_ancestry at a test single_nucleotide snp may confound with the association_signal and ignoring it can lead to spurious association we demonstrate theoretically that adjustment for local_ancestry at the test snp is sufficient to remove the spurious association regardless of the mechanism of population_stratification whether due to local or global ancestry differences among study subjects however global ancestry adjustment procedures may not be effective we further develop two novel association tests that adjust for local_ancestry our first test is based on a conditional likelihood framework which models the distribution of the test snp given disease status and flanking marker genotypes a key_advantage of this test lies in its ability to incorporate different directions of association in the ancestral_populations our second test which is computationally simpler is based on logistic_regression with adjustment for local_ancestry proportion we conducted extensive simulations and found that the type_i of our tests are under control however the global adjustment procedures yielded inflated type_i when stratification is due to local_ancestry difference african_americans and hispanic americans represent the two largest racial minority groups in the usa comprising of to whom correspondence should be addressed the us population both groups are recently admixed and have inherited ancestry from more than one ancestral population such admixed_populations offer a unique_opportunity for mapping disease genes that have large allele_frequency differences between ancestral_populations recently admixture_mapping has become one of the main approaches for gene_mapping studies in admixed_populations however traditional admixture_mapping has a substantially lower_resolution than association analysis moreover admixture_mapping cannot identify disease_loci that have similar allele_frequencies or disease prevalences in the ancestral_populations with the increasing availability of large volumes of high_density genotyping_data generated in genome_wide gwas the analysis of admixed_populations is now moving toward snp association in admixed_populations the proportion of admixture may vary across individuals this variation can lead to associations of the disease with loci unlinked to the disease_locus a phenomenon well known as population_stratification which can produce both false_positive association_signals if not appropriately controlled over the past_decade various methods have been developed to deal with this population_stratification effect in general these methods can be classified into three categories i genomic control ii structured association and iii principal_components based_methods the genomic control approach attempts to correct for population_stratification by adjusting association_statistics with a single overall inflation_factor obtained from a set of random markers that are not associated with the phenotype of interest in contrast structured association methods assign the study subjects to estimated discrete subpopulations and then aggregates evidence of association within each subpopulation the current state of the art approach is the principal component based_approach implemented in eigenstrat which computes coefficients of principal_components using snps across the genome to control for population_structure page we showed that in genetic_association of admixed_populations local_ancestry difference between study subjects can confound with association_signal and lead to spurious_associations if not appropriately controlled we also showed theoretically that to remove the confounding_effect of local_ancestry it is sufficient to condition on local_ancestry at the test snp whereas conditioning on global ancestry may be ineffective to remove the spurious_associations due to the confounding_effect of local_ancestry we further proposed two novel association tests that adjust for local_ancestry at the test snp we conducted extensive simulations and evaluated the performance of different tests under various settings our simulation_results indicate that regardless of the mechanism of population_stratification whether due to local or global ancestry difference it is sufficient to control population_stratification by conditioning on local_ancestry at the test marker in contrast global ancestry adjustment procedures such as eigenstrat and logistic global cannot completely remove the effect of population_stratification induced by local_ancestry difference the reason is that global ancestry information as represented by a global ancestry proportion or a few principal_components obtained from all markers across the genome cannot accurately_reflect the amount of ancestry variation in local_regions we proposed two tests for association analysis in admixed_populations our first test lrt is based on a conditional likelihood framework which models the distribution of a test snp given disease status and flanking marker genotypes this conditional likelihood allows us to explicitly_model local_ancestry differences among study subjects and thus it eliminates the effect of population_stratification at the test snp our second test logistic local is based on a logistic regression_model that adjusts for local_ancestry proportion at the test snp although the lrt approach is computationally more involved than logistic local it is more flexible and is particularly useful when the directions of association are different in the ancestral_populations another advantage of the lrt approach is that in addition to testing_the as described in section we can test two other hypotheses h no diseasesnp association in population x and h no diseasesnp association in population y separately this can be achieved by testing h y respectively these tests allow a crossethnicity replication since evidence of disease association in the two ancestral_populations can be directly compared our tests are different from admixture_mapping in that we directly_assess the correlation between a phenotype and snp genotypes in contrast admixture_mapping examines the association between a phenotype and local_ancestry without fully using the actual genotypes at each snp therefore snps falling within the same ancestry block will share similar admixture_mapping signal which explains why admixture_mapping has substantially lower_resolution than direct snp association analysis since the association tests we proposed directly compare the allele_frequencies between cases and controls they can serve as a fine_mapping tool for regions identified from admixture_mapping studies as shown in our simulations another advantage of our tests is that unlike admixture_mapping which may miss disease variants with similar allele_frequencies in the ancestral_populations our tests are able to identify such variants since the allele_frequencies between cases and controls are directly compared therefore our tests can be used as a general tool for genetic_association our tests rely on the estimates of local_ancestry probabilities it is computationally_intensive to estimate these probabilities for gwas datasets in addition our lrt test requires the estimation of several parameters which is computationally more involved than logistic_regression for example with cases and controls it took the lrt test about days to finish the analysis of snps using a single_cpu however the computations can be parallelized across chromosomes and thus the computation is tractable even for very large_datasets if a computing cluster is available our methods treat estimated ancestry as plug in estimates in the likelihood calculation although simple such a two step procedure is not as efficient as approaches that estimate ancestry and disease model_parameters simultaneously another problem is that the disease_phenotypes are not used when estimating ancestry however near a disease_locus cases are more related in terms of their shared_ancestry than controls ignoring disease status essentially assumes that all individuals are no more related to one another than would be expected by chance and thus may lead to ancestry estimates that are biased towards the null how to jointly_model local_ancestry and disease status would merit further research our methods share similarity with a recent paper published by who proposed to correct for population_stratification using local principal_components pcs in principle this method can be applied to admixed_populations as well however local pcs can only approximate the local_ancestry and require a predefined window_size whereas for admixed_populations such as african_americans locus specific ancestry can be inferred accurately as noted by the local pc based_approach will be more appropriate for a population whose substructure is subtle due to either the lack of information on the ancestral population or when admixture has occurred within similar populations for example european_americans in summary we have proposed two novel association tests for admixed_populations we showed that dependence between local_ancestry and disease phenotype can lead to spurious_associations
