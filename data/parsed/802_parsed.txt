genetics_and bluesnp r package for highly scalable genome_wide using hadoop clusters computational workloads for genome_wide gwas are growing in scale and complexity outpacing the capabilities of single threaded software_designed for personal_computers the bluesnp r package implements gwas statistical_tests in the r programming_language and executes the calculations across computer clusters configured with apache hadoop a de facto standard framework for distributed data_processing using the mapreduce formalism bluesnp makes computationally_intensive analyses such as estimating empirical p values via data permutation and searching for expression_quantitative over thousands of genes feasible for large genotypephenotype datasets availability_and depending on the study_design and statistical methodology gwas statistics can be handily computed on a personal computer or require substantially greater computational_resources usually study_designs and statistical methodologies that entail massive computation are avoided for practical reasons yet there are times when intensive computation can not be avoided an example of a computationally_demanding task is estimating empirical p values via data permutation when a test_statistic does not follow a standard distribution up to permutations of the data can be required to assess genome_wide significance a massive computational_burden another example is in the analysis of expression_quantitative eqtl study_designs with tens_of of gene_expression phenotypes the superb genetics software plink is an open_source whole_genome association analysis program written in c that is extremely fast and efficient at computing commonplace association_statistics e g allelic test linear_regression etc however it can be a logistical challenge to run plink on computer clusters manually partitioning large jobs into sub parts and stitching together potentially thousands of output_files
