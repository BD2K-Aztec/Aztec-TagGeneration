large_scale binding ligand prediction by improved patch based method patch surfer motivation ligand_binding is a key aspect of the function of many proteins thus binding ligand prediction provides important insight in understanding the biological_function of proteins binding ligand prediction is also useful for drug_design and examining potential drug side_effects results we present a computational method_named patch surfer which predicts binding ligands for a protein pocket by representing and comparing pockets at the level of small local surface patches that characterize physicochemical_properties of the local_regions the method can identify binding_pockets of the same ligand even if they do not share globally similar shapes properties of local patches are represented by an efficient mathematical representation d zernike descriptor patch surfer has significant technical improvements over our previous prototype which includes a new feature that captures approximate patch position with a geodesic distance histogram moreover we constructed a large comprehensive database of ligand_binding that will be searched against by a query the benchmark shows better performance of patch surfer over existing_methods availability_and http kiharalab org patchsurfer small_molecules such as metabolites and drugs have important interactions with protein receptors regulating many different processes in biological_systems therefore predicting binding ligands can provide_important for elucidating protein functions predicting binding ligands for proteins can also provide useful information for computational drug_discovery drug side_effects and protein design by combining computational screening with experiments proteinligand interaction networks can be revealed in principle ligands for a protein can be predicted by identifying a global or local structure similar to known proteins findsite and galaxysite use a modeled structure by threading to predict binding ligands for a target protein global structure based_methods capture distant evolutionary_relationships that provide powerful information for function prediction however such methods have difficulty for cases where proteins of largely different global structures bind the same ligand_molecules local structure based_methods aim to identify similarity between a target pocket and known binding_sites local structure can be compared at different structure levels catalytic_site atlas and aft compare a few functional_residues in binding_sites where similarity is quantified with the root_mean rmsd of the residues pseudocenters of residues as well as atom level representation were also used however cases have been reported where binding_site residues for some ligand types are not always well conserved alternatively surface representations have been used for describing binding_pockets surface representations do not explicitly specify residue atom positions in pockets and thus are coarser representations the advantage of a surface representation is that it can attenuate a certain level of differences in pocket shapes which are commonly observed in pockets of the same ligand type ef seek constructs a triangle mesh to represent protein surface used a histogram of distances between nodes in a triangle mesh that represents a protein surface smap performs pocket alignment using delaunay tessellation and amino_acid comparison ilbind combines findsite and smap for inverse ligand binding_protein prediction besides binding ligand prediction_methods discussed earlier there are methods that predict binding_pocket location in proteins using various pocket descriptions those descriptions include grid representation atom triangles and a shape coach takes a consensus of multiple programs mathematical moment based_approaches have been identified to be suitable for molecular_surface representation moment based_methods can naturally control the resolution of the surface description and physicochemical_properties on the surface can be represented in the same way as surface shape thornton and her colleagues used spherical harmonics for describing binding_pockets in our earlier works pocket surfer global pocket shape and the surface electrostatic_potential are represented using d zernike descriptors dzd subsequently we proposed patch surfer which represents a pocket as a set of small local surface patches each of which is described by dzd the local patch representation of pockets enables the method to identify corresponding regions in pockets even if the global shapes of pockets are different although patch surfer compared favorably against the existing_methods in terms of prediction_accuracy it was tested on small_datasets with a limited number of ligand types in this work we compiled a large dataset of over non redundant pockets with different ligands with which our method was tested moreover the algorithm was significantly_improved in four more aspects first we introduced a new feature of a patch called the approximate patch position apps that describes the relative_position of the patch in a pocket second we use geodesic distance rather than euclidean_distance for computing distance between patches in a pocket third the procedure to identify corresponding patches in two pockets was revised so that the selected patch pairs are guaranteed to yield the minimum i e best score finally we also consider similarity of ligands when scores for each ligand are computed on the large dataset we show that patch surfer shows overall higher accuracy than the previous version as well as existing_methods
