structural_bioinformatics topology and prediction of rna pseudoknots motivation several dynamic_programming for predicting rna_structures with pseudoknots have been proposed that differ dramatically from one another in the classes of structures considered results here we use the natural topological classification of rna_structures in terms of irreducible components that are embeddable in the surfaces of fixed genus we add to the conventional secondary_structures four building_blocks of genus one in order to construct certain structures of arbitrarily high genus a corresponding unambiguous multiple context free grammar provides an efficient dynamic_programming for energy_minimization partition_function and stochastic sampling it admits a topology dependent parametrization of pseudoknot penalties that increases the sensitivity and positive_predictive of predicted base_pairs by compared with earlier approaches more general models based on building_blocks of higher genus are also discussed availability the source_code of gfold is freely_available atthe global conformation of rna_molecules is to a large extent determined by topological_constraints encoded at the level of secondary_structure i e by the mutual arrangements of the base_paired helices in this context secondary_structure is understood in a wider sense that includes pseudoknots although the vast_majority of rnas has simple to whom correspondence should be addressed i e pseudoknot free secondary_structure pseudobase lists more than records of pseudoknots determined by a variety of experimental and computational_techniques including crystallography nuclear_magnetic mutational experiments and comparative_sequence in many cases they are crucial for molecular_function examples_include the catalytic cores of several ribozymes programmed frameshifting and telomerase_activity reviewed in staple and butcher secondary_structures can been interpreted as matchings in a graph of permissible base_pairs the energy of rna_folding is dominated by the stacking of adjacent base_pairs not by the hydrogen_bonds of the individual base_pairs in contrast to maximum weighted matching the general rna_folding problem with a stacking based energy function is npcomplete the most commonly used rna_secondary prediction_tools including mfold and the vienna rna package therefore exclude pseudoknots polynomial time dynamic_programming dp algorithms can be devised however for certain restricted classes of pseudoknots in contrast to the o n space and o n time solution for simple secondary_structures however most of these approaches are computationally much more demanding the design of pseudoknot folding algorithms thus has been governed more by the need to limit computational_cost and achieve a manageable complexity of the recursion than the conscious choice of a particularly natural search_space of rna_structures as a case in point the class of structures underlying the algorithm by rivas and eddy r estructures pknot r e was characterized only in a subsequent publication the following references provide a certainly incomplete list of dp approaches to rna_structure using different structure classes characterized in terms of recursion equations and or stochastic grammars akutsupage combinatorial models of pseudoknotted rna_structures are limited in two ways on the one hand exact algorithmic folding can be constructed only for certain types of structures on the other hand the larger the structure sets are the more base_pairing patterns are contained in them that cannot be realized in nature due to steric constraints algorithm design so_far has been mostly driven by the desire to reduce computational_complexity the idea behind gfold in contrast is to define a more suitable class of structures that can be generated by nesting and concatenating a small number of elementary building_blocks this recursive structure is captured by a fairly simple unambiguous multiple context free grammar that translates in a canonical way to dp algorithms for computing the minimum energy structure and the partition_function in o n time and o n space in addition to mfe folding we have implemented the computation of base_pairing probabilities and a stochastic backtracing recursion thus providing the major functionalities of rna_secondary software for a very natural class of pseudoknotted structures the structures considered here strike a balance between the generality necessary to cover almost all known pseudoknotted structures and the restriction to topologically elementary structures that have a good chance to actually correspond to a feasible spatial_structure from a mathematical point_of the characterization of structures in terms of irreducible components with given topological genus appears particularly natural and promises to reflect closely the ease with which a structure can be embedded in three dimensions in addition the grammar underlying gfold naturally distinguishes different types of pseudoknots and admits different energy parameters for them we observe that this additional freedom of the parametrization leads to a substantial increase of sensitivity of type k pseudoknots and ppv compared wit the usage of a common penalty for each crossing of gap matrices in terms of prediction_accuracy gfold thus compares_favorably also with the leading alternative dp approaches to pseudoknotted structures
