genescissors a comprehensive approach to detecting and correcting spurious transcriptome inference owing to rna_seq misalignment motivation rna_seq techniques provide an unparalleled means for exploring a transcriptome with deep coverage and base_pair level resolution various analysis tools have been developed to align and assemble rna_seq such as the widely used tophat cufflinks pipeline a common observation is that a sizable fraction of the frag ments reads align to multiple_locations of the genome these multiple_alignments pose substantial challenges to existing rna_seq analysis tools inappropriate treatment may result in reporting spurious expressed genes false_positives and missing the real expressed genes false_negatives such errors impact the subsequent analysis such as differential_expression in our study we observe that of transcripts reported by tophat cufflinks pipeline correspond to annotated nonfunctional pseudogenes moreover of reported transcripts are not annotated in the ensembl_database these genes could be either novel expressed genes or false_discoveries results we examine the underlying genomic_features that lead to multiple_alignments and investigate how they generate systematic errors in rna_seq analysis we develop a general tool genescissors which exploits machine_learning guided by biological_knowledge to detect and correct spurious transcriptome inference by existing rna_seq analysis methods in our simulated study gen escissors can predict spurious transcriptome calls owing to misalign ment with an accuracy close to it provides substantial improvement over the widely used tophat cufflinks or mapsplice cufflinks pipelines in both precision and f measurement on real_data genescissors reports less pseudogenes and more expressed and annotated transcripts when compared with the tophat cufflinks pipeline in addition among the unannotated transcripts reported by tophat cufflinks genescissors finds that of them are false_positives availability the software can be downloaded atrna seq techniques provide an efficient means for measuring transcriptome_data with high_resolution and deep coverage millions of short_reads sequenced from cdna provide_unique a transcriptome at the nucleotide level and mitigate many of the limitations of microarray_data although there are still many remaining unsolved_problems new discoveries based on rna_seq analysis ranging from genomic_imprinting to differential_expression promise an exciting future current rna_seq analysis_pipelines typically contain two major components an aligner and an assembler an rna_seq aligner e g tophat splicemap and mapsplice attempts to determine where in the genome a given sequence comes from an assembler e g cufflinks and scripture addresses the problems of which transcripts are present and estimating their abundances existing rna_seq pipelines can be divided_into two major categories align first pipelines and assembly first pipelines assembly first pipelines attempt to assemble and quantify the complete transcriptome without a reference several algorithms such as trinity and transabyss have been developed however alignment to a reference_genome is still necessary to interpret the results from an assembly first pipeline and to relate them to existing knowledge the assembly first pipeline is compute intensive and may require several days to complete in align first pipelines a high_quality reference_genome serves as a scaffold for inferring the source of rna_seq fragments current alignment approaches are both computationally_efficient and easily parallelized thus the align first rna_seq analysis can be finished within hours even on a normal desktop machine therefore align first pipelines such as tophat cufflinks or mapsplice cufflinks are generally preferred when a suitable reference_genome is available we first describe a series of modifications made to open_source rna_seq analysis tools to support genescissors then we describe the various datasets used for evaluation we evaluated two standard pipelines that do not use genescissors one using tophat and the second using mapsplice as an aligner we then added genescissors to each pipeline to improve the alignment results and we refer to these as genescissors tophat and genescissors mapsplice pipelines all four pipelines use cufflinks as the transcriptome assembler
