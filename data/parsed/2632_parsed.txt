sequence_analysis kappa a simple_algorithm for discovery and clustering of proteins defined by a key amino_acid pattern a case study of the cysteine_rich proteins motivation proteins defined by a key amino_acid pattern are key_players in the exchange of signals between bacteria animals and plants as well as important mediators for cellcell communication within a single_organism their description and characterization open the way to a better knowledge of molecular signalling in a broad range of organisms and to possible application in medical and agricultural_research the contrasted pattern of evolution in these proteins makes_it to detect and cluster them with classical sequence_based search tools here we introduce key aminoacid pattern based protein analyzer kappa a new multi_platform program to detect them in a given set of proteins analyze their pattern and cluster them by comparison to reference patterns ab_initio search or internal pairwise_comparison de_novo search results in this study we use the concrete example of cysteine_rich proteins crps to show that the similarity of two cysteine patterns can be precisely and efficiently assessed by a quantitative tool created for kappa the j score we also demonstrate the clear advantage of kappa over other classical sequence_search tools for ab_initio search of new crps eventually we present de_novo clustering and subclustering functionalities that allow to rapidly generate consistent groups of crps without a seed reference availability_and kappa executables are available for linux windows and mac os at http kappa sequence_search sourceforge net in recent_years novel types of proteins defined by a key amino_acid patternoften referred to as x rich proteinshave emerged as important and diversified actors of molecular signalling in animals and plants although glycine_rich proteins proline_rich peptides and leucine rich repeatscontaining proteins are nowadays the subject of increasing research cysteine_rich proteins crps still remain the most extensively_studied ones although traditional sequence_search tools were successfully used to characterize the diversity of crps in various organisms implementation of numerous manual data curation steps was always necessary with the drawback of being both tedious and timeconsuming moreover manual intervention always introduces the risk of a subjective hence potentially skewed or biased analysis in this article we introduce key aminoacid pattern based protein analyzer kappa a new automated sequence_search program dedicated to the discovery and clustering of x rich proteins and we assess its performance on plant crps although quite heterogeneous crps share three common features i a small_size amino_acids ii the presence of a signal_peptide at their n termini to allow secretion iii a mature_protein comprising six or more cysteines usually from to they are involved in a wide_range of functions in living_organisms for instance antimicrobial_peptides amps such as defensins are broadly studied for their role in human innate_immunity against viruses bacteria and fungi and in plant_responses to pathogens plantbacteria symbiotic equilibrium relies on crps as well van_de while venoms from snakes spiders and scorpions have also adopted the crps as neurotoxins and myonecrotic agents thus characterization of these communication mediators opens the way to future applications for human_health and agronomy in addition to their inter organism communication functions crps appear to be important messengers for cellcell signalling within a single individual they are particularly involved in the control of developmental_processes such as seed root and stomata development but also in sexual_reproduction in plants and in animals numerous families of crps like defensins thionins albumins snakins lipid_transfer rapid alkalinization factors ralfs etc have already been described each of them being characterized by a precise cysteine spacing pattern in several plant_species these crps can represent up to of the total genome describing their diversity and evolution now becomes a major stake in plant animal and microbe biology the structural particularities of crps are a challenging issue for bioinformaticians on the one hand the cysteine backbonewhich governs maintenance of disulfide_bonds hence the d structure of proteinsis highly_conserved in a given crp family even between distant_species for instance all defensins share a c core and a cysteine stabilized cs ab motif on the other hand the remaining residues in the sequenceinvolved in fine and specific recognition functionscan exhibit a fast evolutive speed often underlined by a positive_selection hence global sequence_identity can be extremely_low in a given crp family supplementary as shown in our study this dual evolutive pattern makes_it to discover paralogues and orthologues of already known crps with classical ab_initio sequence similarity_search tools in addition the cysteine backbone itself can evolvethough at a lesser speedand give rise to new families of crps that may be specific to a given taxon literature suggests that crps have been largely under predicted it is therefore essential to be able to detect and cluster crps de_novo without necessarily relying on a set of reference proteins the kappa workflow presented in supplementary meets this sequence_search challenge by extracting and comparing cysteine patterns by means of a quantitative similarity_index called j score this mapping step allows to detect crps that are similar to reference patterns ab_initio search or to cluster crps having similar patterns without relying on a reference de_novo search a blast_based subclustering step then allows to refine clustering analyzing the remaining amino_acids of the sequence and to visualize output groups of crps graphically kappa is a free program coded in python and is executable on most of existing operating_systems linux mac os windows it supports sequence_search parallelization by multithreading unix manual pages and a complete users guide are also available by providing an automated pipeline specifically dedicated to the evolutive specificities of proteins defined by a key amino_acid pattern like crps kappa fills a gap in the landscape of sequence_search computational_tools supplementarypresents salient advantages of kappa over more conventional approaches the j score appears to be a robust quantitative and objective tool to describe cysteine pattern similarity and explore all its aspects block identity i accounts for subtle modifications of cysteine spacing within a given family while pattern persistence p allows to investigate emergence of new groups of crps within a given taxon numerous families of crps have been detected and characterized so_far in a small number of model_organisms moreover the number and availability of new sequenced proteomes is quickly growing especially for non model_organisms considering the functional_importance of crps in plants and animals there is an increasing need to characterize their orthologues in these new proteomes focusing on the cysteine spacing with the j score the kappa ab_initio search function made it possible not only to detect new members of crp families within reference species themselves but also orthologues belonging to more distant_species furthermore the ab_initio search is also flexible since mapping parameters especially stringency options enable users to choose an optimal research framework one can indeed decide to be strict in the similarity_search using a high j score threshold or high stringency parameters or more permissive and detect new like proteins traditional sequence_search approaches such as blastp do not make a difference between key_residues and the rest of the sequence hence true homologues of input crps are intermingled with non related low similarity sequences although hmmer and psi phi blast can give more weight to cysteines and other conserved_residues they are less performant in dealing automatically with extensive divergence of blocks between cysteines and with fine modifications of the cysteine spacing itself this is why previous_reports dealing with crps always implemented curation steps relying on manual_review of data or home made scripts to obtain a consistent final protein dataset though often leading to correct results this time consuming approach is suboptimal when dealing with large_scale proteome_wide studies kappa addresses this issue by providing a fast and accurate analysis_pipeline based on quantitative_criteria moreover the optimization functionality makes it easy to determine the best parameters for a given sequence_search experiment besides providing an automated pipeline kappa also innovates by relieving the user of the need for reference cysteine patterns indeed the de_novo search and clustering function applied to a whole proteome can uncover totally new families of crps without a reference in the challenging case of proteins defined by a key amino_acid pattern kappa provides a new and accurate detection method over hmmer based sequence search_strategies implemented in previous crp studies and in gene_finding pipelines such as spada implementation of kappa on available proteomes opens the way to a better and quicker understanding of the diversity evolution and functions these peculiar proteins as shown for the crps egz proteins and sprr s
