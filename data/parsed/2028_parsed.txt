genome_wide inferring gene phenotype relationship by walking on the heterogeneous network motivation clinical diseases are characterized by distinct phenotypes to identify disease genes is to elucidate the gene phenotype relationships mutations in functionally_related may result in similar_phenotypes it is reasonable to predict disease_causing by integrating phenotypic_data and genomic_data some genetic_diseases are genetically or phenotypically similar they may share the common pathogenetic_mechanisms identifying the relationship between diseases will facilitate better understanding of the pathogenetic_mechanism of diseases results in this article we constructed a heterogeneous network by connecting the gene network and phenotype network using the phenotypegene relationship information from the omim database we extended the random_walk with restart algorithm to the heterogeneous network the algorithm prioritizes the genes and phenotypes simultaneously we use leave_one to evaluate the ability of finding the genephenotype relationship results showed improved_performance than previous_works we also used the algorithm to disclose hidden disease associations that cannot be found by gene network or phenotype network alone we identified hidden disease associations most of which were supported by literature evidence availability the matlab_code of the program is available atelucidating the inherited basis of human disease involves linking genomic_variation to clinical phenotype establishing this relationship however can be challenging for several reasons the pleiotropy of genes the genetic_heterogeneity of diseases and the limited number of cases most current efforts at diseasegene identification involving linkage_analysis and association studies result in a genomic interval of cm containing up to several hundreds of genes these candidate_genes need to be further investigated to identify disease_causing a number of methods have been proposed to prioritize candidate to whom correspondence should be addressed genes based on different kinds of genomic_data such as sequencebased features functional_annotation data and protein interaction data these algorithms typically prioritize_candidate based on their similarity to known disease genes though these methods perform well they still have some limitations the first limitation comes from the incompleteness and noise of genomic data_sources some integration algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem the other problem is the ambiguous boundary between different diseases clinical disease often encompass a variety of phenotypes and biological_mechanisms making_it to define the boundary between diseases traditionally diseases have been categorized on the basis of pathophysiology or on etiology but often these characterizations break down and more ad_hoc approaches aroused resulting in the celebrated debate between splitters and lumpers the ambiguous boundary between different diseases prevents the direct inference of genedisease association for example the lebers congenital amaurosis lca turns out to be highly_heterogeneous on a molecular basis but these molecular_subtypes appear clinically homogeneous using all the lca genes to prioritize a list of genes responsible to a subtype of lca may not be correct most recently two algorithms have been proposed to identify genephenotype relationship instead of finding the genedisease relationship directly their assumption is that similar_phenotypes are caused by functionally_related assign candidate_gene to protein_complexes and then rank these complexes using phenotypic_data finally candidate_genes are ranked based on the phenotypes associated with the protein_complexes employ the regression_model named cipher to quantify the concordance between the candidate_gene and the target phenotype candidate_genes are then ranked by the concordance score cipher performed better thanon the overlapped benchmark data in this work we propose a rwrh random_walk with restart on heterogeneous network algorithm to infer the genephenotype relationship we connect the gene network and phenotype network by genephenotype relationship and constructed a heterogeneous network then we extend the random_walk with restart rwr algorithm to the heterogeneous network using the target phenotype and corresponding disease genes as seed nodes in the prioritization of candidate_genes we attempt to make better use of the phenotypic_data on benchmark_dataset the proposed algorithmpage
