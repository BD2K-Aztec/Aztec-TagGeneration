high_throughput prediction of protein antigenicity using protein microarray_data motivation discovery of novel protective antigens is fundamental to the development of vaccines for existing and emerging pathogens most computational_methods for predicting protein antigenicity rely directly on homology with previously_characterized protective antigens however homology based_methods will fail to discover truly novel protective antigens thus there is a significant need for homology free methods capable of screening entire proteomes for the antigens most likely to generate a protective humoral_immune identification of antigen proteins capable of triggering a significant humoral_immune system response is important for addressing fundamental_questions in immunology virology and bacteriology it is also important for practical purposes ranging from diagnostic applications to vaccine_design the goal of this article is to develop and test a predictor of protein antigenicity that can be used on a high_throughput scale on existing or new proteomes to identify key antigenic proteins that may have protective qualities and may be used in vaccine_design applications the predictor is developed to whom correspondence should be addressed by applying machine_learning to training data resulting from a unique high_throughput proteomic chip technology originally developed in the felgner laboratory as well as data extracted from the literature and public_databases from the outset it must be recognized that the notion of protein antigen is similar to many other notions in biology e g gene consciousness that are very useful but not tightly defined given the complexity variability and flexibility of the immune system at one extreme one could take the position that every protein has the potential of being antigenic and of triggering a humoral_immune on the other hand it is well known that immune_systems respond differentially to the various proteins of a pathogen and that there are commonalities among the humoral_immune of different individuals exposed to the same pathogen within the proteins of a pathogen considered to be antigenic one can further distinguish several overlapping subclasses with fuzzy boundaries such as protective antigens serodiagnostic antigens and crossreactive antigens to a first degree of approximation protective antigens are important for conferring protection serodiagnostic antigens are associated with a differential humoral_antibody between naive and exposed individuals and are important for diagnostics purposes and cross_reactive antigens are associated with a strong humoral_antibody in both naive and exposed individuals the primary_focus of this work is on protective_antigen prediction protecting populations against infectious pathogens is an important priority and vaccination is widely_recognized as one of the most reliable preventive approaches by simulating the presence of a given pathogen a vaccine elicits a specific protective_immune although most proteins produced by a given pathogen can be considered to be antigens only some denoted protective antigens induce an effective immune_response against the whole pathogen these protective antigens are usually surfaceexposed or exported proteins accessible to the immune system for safety purposes the historical trend has been toward creating subunit_vaccines or epitope vaccines containing only full or partial protective antigens as opposed to early vaccines based on attenuated whole pathogens identification of protective antigenic proteins or determinants is therefore a top priority in current vaccine_development projects thanks to advances in genomic technologies pathogen genomes can now be rapidly obtained opening the door for in silico screening of a pathogens entire proteomeprediction of the most antigenic proteins produced by a pathogen is an important and difficult problem such predictors could be used to identify the best vaccine_candidates for a pathogen or for diagnostic_tests one key issue associated with the prediction task is the difficulty of classifying antigenic and non antigenic proteins on a large_scale and the lack of public_databases dedicated to this purpose in this work we have used reactivity data obtained by protein microarray_data analysis to prepare relatively large sets of examples from these protein_sets and known protective antigens we have designed a two stage architecture to predict protein antigenicity from the primary sequence the resulting predictor antigenpro is the first sequence_based predictor trained using a large non redundant dataset mainly obtained by protein microarray_data analysis in addition antigenpro is the only alignment_free predictor not designed for a specific pathogen category the results obtained during the evaluation experiments provide several interesting conclusions first despite the inherent noise in protein microarray_data it can be used to effectively categorize both antigen and non antigenic proteins for training purposes the results demonstrate that this source of data can be used effectively for this problem of the known protective antigens are correctly_classified when the model is trained only on balanced protein microarray_datasets and an unbiased decision threshold of is used in addition the cross_validation results indicate that antigenpro can predict protein antigenicity from sequence alone with accuracy that is significantly better than random these cross_validation results also show that it significantly_outperforms vaxijen the only previously_reported method that does not directly rely on homology to known protective antigens the results on the external_validation dataset demonstrate that antigenpro performs well when ranking entire proteomes according to likely antigenicity when compared with vaxijen and signalp in addition the method presented here can rapidly take advantage of the massive amount of data that will be available thanks to the high_throughput protein microarray_technology developed for studying the humoral_immune to pathogen infections antigenpro is available
