jflow a workflow management system for web_applications biologists produce large_data and are in demand of rich and simple web portals in which they can upload and analyze their files providing such tools requires to mask the complexity induced by the needed high_performance hpc environment the connection between interface and computing infrastructure is usually specific to each portal with jflow we introduce a workflow management system wms composed of jquery plug_ins which can easily be embedded in any web_application and a python_library providing all requested features to setup run and monitor workflows building rich web environments aimed at helping scientists analyze their data is a common trend in bioinformatics specialized web portals such as mg rast metavir or ng provide multiple services and analysis tools in an integrated manner for specific experiments or data types these applications require wms features to manage and execute their computational_pipelines generic wms such as galaxy ergatis or mobyle provide a user_friendly graphical_interface easing workflow creation and execution unfortunately such environments come with their own interface complicating their integration within already existing web_tools other wms such as weaver snakemake ruffus or cosmos provide a framework or a domain specific language to developers wanting to build and run workflows these software_packages offer the flexibility and power of a high_level programming_language but they do not provide a user_interface enable component and workflow definition jflow combines a user_friendly interface with an intuitive python api it is to our knowledge the only wms designed to be embedded in any web_application thanks to its organization as jquery http jquery com plug_ins jflow is a simple and efficient solution to embed wms features within a web_application it is to our knowledge the only wms designed with this purpose it is already embedded in rnabrowse and ng where it has been used to process more than sequencing runs on a cores hpc environment jflow integration a a piece of the ng html code source in which is positioned an empty div to build the activewf plug in and a modal box for the wfstatus plug in b the jquery code in charge to build jflow plug_ins and manage user action when the select activewf event is thrown from activewfdiv a function is called with two parameters event and workflow the last parameter stores all the workflows information such as its name and its id used in this example to update the modal box title and to build the wfstatus plug in c the status of the illumina qc workflow with the id displayed as a graph in the ng application
