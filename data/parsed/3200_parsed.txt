sequence_analysis navigating the unexplored seascape of pre mirna candidates in single_genome approaches motivation the computational search for novel microrna mirna_precursors often involves some sort of structural analysis with the aim of identifying which type of structures are prone to being recognized and processed by the cellular mirna maturation machinery a natural way to tackle this problem is to perform clustering over the candidate structures along with known mirna precursor structures mixed clusters allow then the identification of candidates that are similar to known precursors given the large number of pre mirna candidates that can be identified in single_genome approaches even after applying several filters for precursor robustness and stability a conventional structural clustering approach is unfeasible results we propose a method to represent candidate structures in a feature_space which summarizes key sequence structure characteristics of each candidate we demonstrate that proximity in this feature_space is related to sequence structure similarity and we select candidates that have a high similarity to known precursors additional filtering steps are then applied to further reduce the number of candidates to those with greater transcriptional potential our method is compared with another single_genome method tripletsvm in two datasets showing better performance in one and comparable_performance in the other for larger training_sets additionally we show that our approach allows for a better interpretation of the results availability_and the mindist method is implemented using perl scripts and is freely_available www cramicrornas mirnas constitute one of several classes of small_rnas found in plant and animal branches of eukaryota since the discovery of the first mirnas in caenorhabditis_elegans an abundant number of these regulatory_rnas ranging from to nt in length have been discovered and their underlying_mechanisms investigated for an overview see e g mirnas originate from the maturation of larger precursors of approximately nt called pre mirnas an important feature of pre mirnas that elicits their recognition by the mirna processing machinery is their secondary_structure pre mirnas typically exhibit a stem_loop with few internal loops or asymmetric bulges but the variety of structures that are efficiently recognized has escaped any strict characterization previously we proposed a combination of measures that distinguishes true pre mirnas from the large number of stem loops that can be found in metazoan genomes however the number of precursor candidates in the order of a few hundred thousand obtained above the optimal cutoff of the score which combines measures of stability and robustness is still impractically large to be subjected to experimental confirmation see the cravela framework website for further details http www cravela org despite the fact that all these candidates consist of or contain stem loops the details of their secondary_structure have not been subjected to a thorough analysis the most immediate approach to analyzing the variety of pre mirnas in our candidate set is to seek the identification of structural families amongst the precursor candidates although mirnas have been grouped into families according to their sequence_similarity in the mirbase database this approach does not give enough insight as to the structural_features that are important for the recognition by the mirna processing machinery hence the grouping has to be performed according to sequence and structure various algorithmic approaches have been introduced to determine structural_similarities and to derive consensus structure patterns for structural rnas with low sequence_identity a first approach toward the clustering of mirnas has been achieved in where to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e

all these approaches suffer from a high_computational with a time requirement typically between o n and o n it is thus computationally unfeasible to cluster hundreds of thousands of candidates using this approach thus instead of trying to cluster the candidate set we summarize the structural and sequence_features of each candidate using a vectorial representation and attempt to identify the region of the feature_space most likely to contain hairpins recognized by the cellular mirna processing machinery furthermore using samples of the candidate set we show that the relative positions of the representations of the candidates in the feature_space are reminiscent of the partitions derived from a conventional clustering performed with the state of the art sequence structure alignment_tool locarna and most importantly we observe that known precursors are represented in a limited portion of the feature_space we use this approach to analyse a set of robust and stable hairpins extracted from a genome_wide scan of anopheles_gambiae and drosophila_melanogaster greatly reducing the number of candidates a further reduction is achieved by assessing the transcriptional potential of each remaining candidate and by additionally restricting our analysis to candidates with the potential of being part of mirna genomic clusters we obtain a dataset which is small enough to be subjected to experimental_verification we have presented a method to assess the sequence structure similarity of a large dataset of hairpins in search for novel pre mirnas and we have placed these candidates in a multidimensional space in a way that reflects their structural_characteristics the portion of the multidimensional space selected around the known pre mirnas purports to include most structures which have the potential of being efficiently recognized by the cellular mirna processing machinery the fact that this region is very dense in terms of the number of precursor candidates it contains tells us that a large number of genome locations have the potential to generate stable and robust structures which present sequence structure similarities to known pre mirnas the use of annotation_information helps reducing the number of selected candidates but after this filtering step which is nevertheless dependent on the quality and breadth of the available annotation data they remain in the tens_of therefore there is either an exceedingly large number of pre mirnas in these datasets or more plausibly most of these candidates are not efficiently transcribed but could otherwise be recognized as mirna_precursors the initial set of candidates extracted from the genomes of a gambiae and d melanogaster and described in mendes et_al consisted of and candidates respectively the total number of candidates after applying stability and robustness measures described in earlier work and the structural analysis along with the annotation filtering detailed in this article is reduced by two orders_of to and unlike many machine_learning to the identification of mirna_precursors that use features of the sequence and secondary_structure to provide a classifier our approach does not need to postulate a set of negative_examples in fact we contend that if the purpose is to characterize the structures which have the potential of being recognized by the enzymes involved in mirna maturation one needs to reduce ones dependence on the positive set as well because it will most likely not be representativeit suffices to observe that the set of recognizable structures is surely larger than the set of all the pre mirnas contained in the genome and that these two sets are subject to different evolutionary_constraints in our work information about known precursors is used merely to pinpoint a region of interest in our multidimensional representation of sequence structure features admittedly this approach is not guaranteed to identify the entire portion of the feature_space where structures recognizable by the mirna processing machinery are located because such a subspace is surely much larger than the examples that could ever be instantiated in any genome however our method outperforms a machine_learning approach based on a svm in one dataset and has comparable_performance with the other for larger training_sets for sample groups with a greater number of positive examples it outperforms the machine_learning in both datasets one can further limit the candidates to those occurring in the genomic vicinity of known precursors and which could therefore be part of mirna clusters together with pre documented pre mirnas this approach produces a greatly_reduced set of candidates for a gambiae and for d melanogaster even using a very liberal definition of mirna cluster this significant reduction of the number of candidates albeit at the expense of the ability to identify novel mirnas located elsewhere in the genome elicits both the possibility of experimental_validation and further detailed computational_analyses to this effect it was possible to identify several plausible mirna clusters with structurally_similar stem loops
