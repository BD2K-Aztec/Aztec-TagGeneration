sequence_analysis abra improved coding indel detection via assembly based realignment motivation variant detection from next_generation ngs_data is an increasingly vital aspect of disease diagnosis treatment and research commonly used ngs variant analysis tools generally rely on accurately mapped short_reads to identify somatic variants and germ_line genotypes existing ngs read_mappers have difficulty accurately mapping short_reads containing complex variation i e more than a single base change thus making identification of such variants difficult or impossible insertions_and indels in particular have been an area of great difficulty indels are frequent and can have substantial impact on function which makes their detection all the more imperative results we present abra an assembly based realigner which uses an efficient and flexible localized de_novo followed by global realignment to more accurately remap reads this results in enhanced_performance for indel detection as well as improved accuracy in variant allele frequency_estimation a number of realignment or assembly methods have been proposed to overcome the alignment errors and reference bias that limit indel detection short_read micro aligner locally realigns reads to regionally assembled variant graphs pindel uses a pattern growth approach to detect indels dindel realigns reads to candidate haplotypes and uses a bayesian_method to call indels up to bp in length the genome_analysis gatk s indelrealigner seeks to minimize the number of mismatching bases via local realignment whole_genome de_novo approaches include fermi and cortex var soapindel performs localized assembly and calling on regions containing reads where only one half of a paired_read is mapped clipping reveals structure crest uses soft clipped reads and localized assembly to identify somatic structural_variants targeted iterative graph routing assembler tigra uses targeted assembly to produce contigs from putative breakpoints additional proprietary localized assembly methods have been developed by complete genomics and foundation medicine our newly_developed tool called abra accepts a sequence_alignment sam bam_file as input and produces a realigned bam_file as output allowing flexibility in selection of variant_calling and other downstream_analysis global realignment allows reads that are unaligned or improperly mapped to be moved to a correct location abra detects variation that is not present in the original read_alignments and improves allele_frequency estimates for variation that is present abra can be used to enhance both germ_line and somatic variant detection and works with paired_end as well as single_end data abra improves on next_generation read_alignments providing enhanced_performance in detection of indels as well as greater_accuracy in variant allele frequency_estimation abra accepts bam_files as input and outputs realigned bam_files
