structural_bioinformatics seabed small_molecule activity scanner web_service based motivation the seabed web_server integrates a variety of docking and qsar techniques in a user_friendly environment seabed goes beyond the basic docking and qsar web_tools and implements extended functionalities like receptor preparation library editing flexible ensemble docking hybrid docking qsar experiments or virtual_screening on protein mutants seabed is not a monolithic workflow tool but software as a service platform in silico methods such as molecular_docking and quantitative activity relationship qsar are gaining an increased role in drug_discovery qsar approaches are predictive_models trained to distinguish compounds from molecular_descriptors molecular_docking tries to recover active ligands by finding the best possible fitting of compounds to a d binding_site qsar is faster and often more robust than docking approaches but is limited to suggesting molecules close to those of proven activity docking requires knowledge of the structure of biological target is computationally very demanding and is less robust than qsar but can make suggestions for new drug scaffolds we are then looking at two complementary techniques and it is not a surprise that during daily_practice drug designers are continuously using both approaches which is largely facilitated by commercial programs and a non negligible list of open_source and web_services seabed is a web_server that automates different tools for virtual_screening this includes classical qsar with a large variety of machine_learning tools or molecular_docking with many features for target and ligandbinding characterization the server allows a unique integration of molecular_dynamics information in flexible ensemble docking enriched with essential dynamics md edmd sampling it also enables us to combine in a single project docking and qsar following the ideas in and to incorporate genetic_variability into the docking process the modular nature of seabed see supplementaryand supplementary data allows an easy extension to incorporate additional modules users can automate docking qsar structure ensemble docking hybrid docking qsar and docking of protein mutants supplementary table s provides an estimated processing time for each feature the server is complemented with other functionalities to prepare the receptor and the compound libraries receptor and compounds can be uploaded by the user or extracted from public_databases
