protael protein data visualization library for the web protael is a javascript_library for creating interactive_visualizations of biological_sequences and various associated data it allows users to generate high_quality vector_graphics svg and integrate it into web_pages availability_and protael distribution documentation and examples are freely_available atpredictive methods of bioinformatics address the gap between the explosive_growth of sequence_data and experimental_characterization of biomolecules the number and accuracy of prediction_methods are increasing but the individual algorithms are often implemented as separate programs and webservers from a user point_of this creates a need for shopping around and then often manual integration of the results into a comprehensive bioinformatics characterization of a protein at the same time servers which automatically combine results of different prediction_algorithms require graphical tools to integrate different types of proteinrelated data and predictions into a single visualization while there are many excellent biological sequence visualization_tools most of them are tightly_coupled with the specific data_sources and websites and cannot be easily reused by other resource at the time of writing we are aware of several reusable visualization libraries for the web including pviz rscb protein feature viewer http andreasprlic github io proteinfeatureview biojs featureviewer and mason for feature annotations and snipviz and jsav for multiple_sequence to enable fully customizable visualization of protein sequence_features predictions annotations various posttranslational_modifications and alignments with known structures including their local structural_features we developed protaela reusable and extendable library to display heterogeneous linear protein related data on the web the library is written in javascript and uses cascading style sheets css to define styles of the graphics elements the visualization content is fully controlled by a single json object protael is compatible with all modern browsers on desktop and mobile systems and does not require any additional plugin installation protael visualization is currently focused on proteins but it can also be used and customized for nucleic_acids generated svg visualization allows unrestricted scaling and provides vector images protael is used to visualize protein data in cancer d xtalpred pdbflex http pdbflex org webservers and to display alignments of nucleotide_sequences in bnaber
