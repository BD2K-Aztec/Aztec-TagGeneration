gene_expression on non detects in qpcr data motivation quantitative_real qpcr is one of the most widely used methods to measure gene_expression despite extensive research in qpcr laboratory protocols normalization and statistical_analysis little attention has been given to qpcr non detectsthose reactions failing to produce a minimum amount of signal results we show that the common methods of handling qpcr non detects lead to biased inference furthermore we show that non detects do not represent data missing completely at random and likely represent missing_data occurring not at random we propose a model of the missing_data mechanism and develop a method to directly model non detects as missing_data finally we show that our approach results in a sizeable reduction in bias when estimating both absolute and differential_gene availability_and the proposed algorithm is implemented in the r package nondetects this package also contains the raw_data for the three example datasets used in this manuscript the package is freely_available mnmccall com software and as part of the bioconductor_project contact quantitative_real qpcr remains_the for measuring gene_expression due to a combination of greater sensitivity and lower cost than gene_expression or rna_sequencing it is commonly used to validate results from high_throughput studies and to develop clinical biomarkers recently qpcr based_technologies have been developed to simultaneously measure thousands of transcripts e g the taqman openarray real_time plates contain wells these plates have been used for example to simultaneously measure the expression of all micrornas in a sample the increased use of qpcr has prompted research_examining qpcr laboratory protocols and more recently normalization and statistical_analysis strategies in the minimum information for publication of quantitative realtime pcr experiments miqe guidelines were published these guidelines are designed to encourage better experimental practice allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qpcr results briefly qpcr is used to measure the expression of a set of target_genes in a given sample through repeated cycles of sequence specific dna_amplification followed by expression measurements between subsequent cycles the amount of each target transcript approximately doubles during the exponential_phase of amplification the cycle at which the observed expression first exceeds a fixed threshold is commonly called the threshold cycle ct or quantification cycle cq the latter is the miqepreferred nomenclature but is not currently widely used these ct values represent a quantitative assessment of gene_expression and are often treated as the raw_data for subsequent analyses however relatively little attention has been given to handling non detectsthose reactions failing to attain the prespecified minimum signal_intensity currently there is no consensus manner in which to handle these non detects in subsequent analyses the default in the applied_biosystems dataassist v software is to set non detects equal to the number of pcr cycles performed typically one has the option of setting a lower maximum allowable ct value to which any greater value is set or excluding these values from subsequent calculations life integromics realtime statminer distinguishes between two types of non detectsundetermined values are those that do not exceed the ct threshold and absent values are those for which no reaction occurred realtime statminder handles non detects by setting undetermined values to a maximum ct e g and absent values to the median of the detected replicates researchers have also developed their own methods to handle non detects that combine filtering and thresholding for example summarizing replicates with a value of when the majority are non detects and with an average of the detected ct values otherwise in this manuscript we have shown that the default procedure of replacing qpcr non detects with the maximum pcr cycle number typically introduces a large bias in subsequent inference we have carefully_examined the nature of non detects and shown that they likely represent data missing not at random furthermore we have shown that many non detects represent an amplification failure rather than a true ct value finally we propose a relatively simple em_algorithm and show that it is able to greatly reduce the bias caused by non detects the flexibility of our approach allows one to easily tailor the method described here to ones own analyses specifically one could easily use a different normalization procedure or perform a more complex statistical_analysis additionally any analysis based on imputed values rather than direct estimation of a parameter of interest would benefit from a multiple_imputation procedure
