systems_biology ocsana optimal combinations of interventions from network_analysis targeted_therapies interfering with specifically one protein activity are promising strategies in the treatment of diseases like cancer however accumulated empirical experience has shown that targeting_multiple proteins in signaling_networks involved in the disease is often necessary thus one important problem in biomedical_research is the design and prioritization of optimal combinations of interventions to repress a pathological behavior while minimizing side_effects ocsana optimal combinations of interventions from network_analysis is a new software_designed to identify and prioritize optimal and minimal combinations of interventions to disrupt the paths between source nodes and target nodes when specified by the user ocsana seeks to additionally minimize the side_effects that a combination of interventions can cause on specified off target nodes with the crucial ability to cope with very large_networks ocsana includes an exact solution and a novel selective enumeration approach for the combina torial interventions problem availability the latest_version of ocsana implemented as a plugin for cytoscape and distributed under lgpl_license is available together with source_code at http bioinfo curie fr projects ocsana cellular_functions and activities are governed by complex signaling and regulatory_networks diseases arise from abnormal behavior in these networks thus the design of targeted_therapies from a systems_biology approach aims to identify which molecules to intervene in these networks to repress a pathological behavior while minimizing side_effects accumulated empirical experience has shown that combination or multicomponent interventions are necessary to cope with the redundancy and multi functionality that characterize biological_networks redundancy requires for several pathways to be targeted as alternate routes can compensate the disrupted pathways function multi functionality implies that intervening molecules that play_a in the cell may cause side_effects requiring alternative points of intervention some methods have been proposed to address some aspects of this problem hadicke however limited scalability of the methods and the lack of a prioritization criterion are hindering factors for their applicability to large biological_networks we introduce ocsana a software for the identification and prioritization of optimal minimal combinations of interventions cis we define a ci as a set of nodes such that each elementary path a path from source to target node contains at least one node from this set this ci set indicates the nodes to be intervened to disrupt all the identified elementary paths the interventions can be knock outs deletion of genes proteins and knock ins overexpressions of genes proteins a ci is minimal if no proper subset of the ci is a ci itself and its optimality is defined in terms of a heuristic scoring see section to ensure the methods scalability ocsana includes an exact solution via an adaptation of berges algorithm and a novel selective enumeration approach based on a weightedgreedy algorithm the exact solution computes all minimal cis of all sizes and similar to hadicke it is adapted to compute all cis up to a specified size the selective enumeration computes optimal minimal cis up to a specified size and it can be parametrized to identify such cis sets by full enumeration
