structural_bioinformatics findgeo a tool for determining metal coordination_geometry metals are essential for the structure and function of many proteins and nucleic_acids the geometrical arrangement of the atoms that coordinate a metal in a biological macromolecule is an important_determinant of the specificity and role of that metal at present however this information can be retrieved only from the literature which sometimes contains an improper or incorrect description of the geometry and often lacks it altogether thus we developed findgeo to quickly and easily determine the coordination_geometry of selected or all metals in a given structure findgeo works by superimposing the metal coordinating atoms in the input structure to a library of templates with alternative ideal geometries which are ranked by rmsd to identify the best geometry assignment availability findgeo is freely_available as a web_service and as a stand alone program atit is well established that some metals are essential for living_organisms a major reason for this is that a considerable fraction of proteins are metalloproteins metals can play_diverse in metalloproteins in part because proteins are able to form metal_binding that modulate the properties of metals so as to achieve specific functions the geometric_structure is recognized to be crucial for the specificity and activity of metal_sites metals are also closely involved in nucleic_acid chemistry besides being essential to stabilize the phosphate sugar backbone of dna and rna metals serve crucial_functions e g in rna_folding and ribozyme catalysis nucleic_acids can also achieve a remarkable degree of metal selectivity which depends among other factors on coordination_geometry in this scenario it is perhaps surprising that there is no tool available to determine the coordination_geometry of metals in biological_macromolecules or in small complexes with known structure we thus present here findgeo a tool for this purpose which is freely_available both as a web_service and as a stand alone program at present information on metal coordination_geometry can be retrieved only by exploring the primary literature which however sometimes contains to whom correspondence should be addressed an improper or incorrect description of the geometry and often lacks it altogether therefore the use of findgeo will benefit scientists by minimizing errors in the assignment of geometries promoting a uniform terminology and classification of geometries and thus providing a reliable basis for structurefunction relationship studies where coordination_geometry is a relevant parameter
