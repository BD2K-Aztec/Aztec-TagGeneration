genome_analysis cisexpress motif_detection in dna_sequences motivation one of the major challenges for contemporary bioinfor_matics is the analysis and accurate annotation of genomic_datasets to enable extraction of useful information about the functional role of dna_sequences this article_describes a novel genome_wide statistical_approach to the detection of specific dna_sequence based on similarities between the promoters of similarly expressed genes this new tool cisexpress is especially designed for use with large_datasets such as those generated by publicly_accessible whole_genome and transcriptome projects cisexpress uses a task farming algorithm to exploit all available computational cores within a shared memory node we demonstrate the robust nature and validity of the proposed method it is applicable for use with a wide_range of gen_omic databases for any species of interest availability cisexpress is available at www cisexpress org the amount of raw_data available in publicly_accessible genomic_databases is growing_exponentially in the form of massive linear arrays of dna_sequences robust analysis and accurate annotation of these datasets are needed to extract useful information about the functional role of the dna_sequences one of the key goals of genome_analysis is the identification of putative genome function especially the detection of potential dna cis_regulatory with high_confidence identifying the regulatory_motifs bound by transcription_factors can provide crucial insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional_regulation by correctly identifying regulatory_motifs it is possible to predict the expression of the genes under specific_circumstances or in specific tissues furthermore molecular_mechanisms of genetic_diseases caused by the incorrect expression of some genes can be discovered it has been recently demonstrated that in the case of the mouse_genome many in vitro derived motifs performed_similarly to motifs derived from in vivo data however major problems in studying the specificity of the binding of transcription_factors to dna motifs include a lack of data and deficiencies in predictive_models for motif_detection several efforts have been made to compare existing_methods for computational_identification of regulatory_patterns these benchmarking studies suggested that prediction of regulatory_elements remains a challenge for computational_biologists and that more work is required to optimize the algorithms used although different programs may perform better for individual_datasets no single method_takes all relevant elements into consideration users are advised to use a combination of several motif_finding tools for best results for this reason we decided to develop a novel tool called cisexpress which is designed to achieve more effective analysis of large_datasets in a manner that is both cost_effective and highly_robust in its predictive capacity
