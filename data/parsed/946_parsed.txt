data_and chembench a cheminformatics workbench motivation advances in the field of cheminformatics have been hindered by a lack of freely_available tools we have created chembench a publicly_available cheminformatics portal for analyzing experimental chemical structureactivity data chembench provides a broad range of tools for data visualization and embeds a rigorous workflow for creating and validating predictive quantitative structureactivity relationship models and using them for virtual_screening of chemical libraries to prioritize the compound selection for drug_discovery and or chemical safety_assessment availability freely_accessible at http chembench within the last decade cheminformatics has emerged as a burgeoning discipline combining computational statistical and informational methodologies with key_concepts in chemistry and biology cheminformatics addresses the fundamental problem of structureactivity property relationships as applied to many areas of chemical and biological_research providing the ability to use models for imputation of target activities or properties of untested compounds opportunities for cheminformatics research have grown significantly with the advent of parallel chemical_synthesis and high_throughput and publicly_available data from projects such as the molecular libraries initiative for instance pubchem http pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov currently contains nearly million chemical compound records almost one million of these have been tested in over bioassays with nearly found active many other similarly structured databases have emerged recently providing a corpus of data rivaling the size and complexity of biological_databases that established the need for bioinformatics despite the abundance of databases of biologically_active in the public_domain the data remain largely underexplored because of the dearth of public_domain tools for data analysis along with other recently emerging tools and toolkits such as cdk and ochem http ochem eu chembench is poised to advance experimental research in chemical genomics drug_discovery and chemical safety_assessment to whom correspondence should be addressed chembench supports the following cheminformatics data analysis tasks structured as modules each module can be used independently or as part of an integrated study_design bullet dataset creation chembench allows users to upload store and standardize a set of chemical_structures to enable the qsar modeling of a dataset activity data for each compound must also be provided available descriptors are generated for each compound upon upload an external set to validate models can be selected manually or automatically bullet dataset visualization several tools are available the user can view the chemical_structures examine the distribution of activities and generate a structureactivity heat map using either tanimoto similarity or mahalanobis_distance measure to check for obvious relationships between global compound similarity and activity bullet modeling the modeling function allows the user to select a modeling dataset either one of his uploaded datasets or a provided benchmark set and build an ensemble of statistically validated models i e a predictor of the target property chembench currently supports model_building with knn and random_forest techniques support_vector are currently under development as listed in section several commercial packages are used for descriptor generation bullet model validation when selecting a completed predictor the user is provided with the detailed statistics for estimating the
