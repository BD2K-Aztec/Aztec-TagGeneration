pdid database of molecular level putative protein drug_interactions in the structural human_proteome motivation many drugs interact with numerous proteins besides their intended therapeutic_targets and a substantial portion of these interactions is yet to be elucidated proteindrug interaction_database pdid addresses incompleteness of these data by providing access to putative protein drug_interactions that cover the entire structural human_proteome results pdid covers structures from proteins and houses putative interactions generated from close to million accurate all atom structure based_predictions for several dozens of popular drugs the predictions were generated with three modern_methods ilbind smap and efindsite they are accompanied by propensity_scores that quantify likelihood of interactions and coordinates of the putative location of the binding drugs in the corresponding protein_structures pdid complements the current databases that focus on the curated interactions and the biodrugscreen database that relies on docking to find putative interactions moreover we also include experimentally curated interactions which are linked to their sources drugbank bindingdb and protein_data our database can be used to facilitate studies related to polypharmacology of drugs including repurposing and explaining side_effects of drugs availability_and pdid database is freely_available atmajority of the molecular_targets of drugs are proteins and there are several databases of the already characterized proteindrug interactions drugbank provides access to biochemical and pharmacological information about a large set of drugs including food_and fda_approved compounds and their known protein targets therapeutic target_database offers a comprehensive coverage of over drugs including close to experimental drugs and their interactions with protein targets this database also links targets and drugs to about diseases other databases expand beyond the drug molecules to cover small drug like ligands bindingdb gives experimentally v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com measured binding_affinities between about known protein targets and a large set of almost half a million of small ligands chembl contains structures physicochemical_properties and bioactivity e g binding_constants pharmacology data of drug like small_molecules the current release of chembl incorporates million distinct compounds and million bioactivity data_points which are mapped to over thousand protein targets where the corresponding binding_sites are defined at varying levels of granularity protein protein domain or residue_level supertarget includes about protein targets from several dozens of species and close to drug like compounds it integrates drug related information from bindingdb drugbank and the supercyp database of cytochromedrug interactions adverse_drug from sider drug_metabolism and pathways and gene_ontology go terms for the target_proteins the promiscuous database von integrates data from drugbank supertarget and supercyp and covers about protein targets and over thousands drug like compounds that are annotated with side_effects this database also provides facilities that can be used to predict novel targets based on structural_similarity between drugs and between side effect profiles of drugs stitch combines information from many sources of experimentally and manually_curated interactions between small ligands and proteins including chembl protein_data pdb drugbank therapeutic target_database text_mining of articles from medline and pubmed and several other resources it currently houses data on chemicals and million proteins the recently released intside database links about drugs with their human protein targets collected from drugbank and stitch and with close to side_effects and other annotations of associated diseases pathways and cellular_functions although most of these resources summarize the interactions at the protein or residue_level scpdb includes molecular level all atom information for native binding_sites in proteins structures collected from pdb that are suitable for docking of drug like ligands it includes molecular level details of about binding_sites all atom annotation of binding_sites and list of ligand_binding residues grouped by various types of bonds and binding_modes all atom position of ligand inside the site in proteins and summary of physicochemical_properties of approximately drug like ligands however many of the established drugs interact not only with the intended therapeutic_target protein s but also with other protein targets off targets individual compounds were shown to on average target proteins given a high degree of incompleteness of this information the number of off targets is likely substantially_higher to compare drugbank includes proteindrug interactions for drugs with the average number of targets per drug at which further substantiates incompleteness of the currently available data moreover this polypharmacology can be both beneficial if a given drug can be repurposed for a different disease and harmful leading to side_effects a couple of high profile examples_include imatinib that was repurposed for treatment of gastrointestinal_stromal and sorafenib for the kidney and liver cancers the incompleteness of the data combined with the importance of polypharmacology motivates research toward elucidation of novel proteindrug interactions conventional non computational_methods for the identification of novel off targets rely on an in vitro counter screen of a given drug against a large set of enzymes and receptors recognizing corresponding implications related to side_effects pharmaceutical_companies have implemented screening protocols for the drugs that they currently develop for instance novartis screens against interactions with a panel of targets associated with serious side_effects and high hit_rates pfizer screens against between and targets and roche uses a panel of targets compared with the experimental screens computational_methods that find novel drug_targets are more cost and time effective allow screening of a larger number of targets and provide insights into the molecular level mechanisms of proteindrug interactions these in silico methods are successful in the context of drug_repositioning and identification of off targets a couple of databases that focus on the putative proteindrug and druggable proteinprotein_interactions ppis were recently released biodrugscreen stores results of docking of about small drug like molecules against known proteins targets in human which were annotated based on drugbank and hcpin databases docking was ran for close to cavities on the surfaces of these proteins for the total of about million receptorligand complexes druggable protein_protein assessment system dr pias is a database of druggable ppis predicted by a machine_learning this database lists druggable interactions predicted from over thousand ppis in human mouse and rat but they are not associated with specific compounds we developed proteindrug interaction_database pdid that complements existing repositories and addresses the lack of access to a comprehensive set of putative proteindrug interactions based on close to million of all atom predictions over the entire structural human_proteome thousand structures for over proteins pdid provides access to all putative targets between and depending on the prediction method used of several dozens of popular drugs unique features of our database are bullet it incorporates accurate_predictions generated by three methods ilbind smap and efindsite which are complementary and independent of docking that was used in the biodrugscreen database bullet it uniformly covers the entire structural human_proteome bullet it includes molecular level information on localization of the putative_binding in the structures of the corresponding protein targets bullet it includes comprehensive annotations of known drug_targets that are linked to their sources drugbank bindingdb and pdb the methods that we use were shown empirically to provide high_quality predictions of drug_targets and their results were already successfully used to predict novel off targets examples_include applications to find new off targets of estrogen_receptor modulators cholesteryl_ester inhibitors comtan inhibitors of trypanosoma_brucei rna_editing ligase nelfinavir raloxifene and cyclosporine a numerous drugs are highly promiscuous and we do not know many of their targets pdid database addresses this issue by providing access to a complete set of putative proteindrug interactions and a set of known proteindrug interactions in the structural human_proteome our database includes data that otherwise would be accessible only to individuals and research groups with significant computational expertise and resources the putative interactions were generated by three accurate predictors ilbind smap and efindsite that were shown to produce results that led to finding new drug_targets and which complement the existing biodrugscreen database that relies on docking the databasealso integrates annotations of known protein targets collected across drugbank bindingdb and pdb links proteins to the corresponding records in uniprot and provides coordinates of the location of binding_sites in the structures of the putative drug_targets pdid can be used to systematically catalog proteindrug interactions and to facilitate various studies related to polypharmacology of drugs such as explaining side_effects caused by interactions with off targets and for the drug_repurposing relevant recent examples_include use of predictions with ilbind to find three novel off targets of cyclosporine a that explain nephrotoxicity associated with use of this immunosuppressant another example involves repurposing of raloxifene which is used for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis as a potential compound to treat pseudomonas_aeruginosa infections based on predictions with the smap method
