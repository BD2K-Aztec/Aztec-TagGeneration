data_and myminer a web_application for computer_assisted biocuration and text annotation motivation the exponential_growth of scientific_literature has resulted in a massive amount of unstructured natural_language data that cannot be directly handled by means of bioinformatics_tools such tools generally require structured data often generated through a cumbersome process of manual literature curation herein we present myminer a free and user_friendly text annotation tool aimed to assist in carrying out the main biocuration tasks and to provide labelled data for the development of text_mining systems myminer allows easy classification and labelling of textual data according to user specified classes as well as predefined biological_entities the usefulness and efficiency of this application have been tested for a range of real_life annotation scenarios of various research topics scientific_literature is one of the main sources of knowledge on which working hypotheses are built to organize and represent biological_information for researchers as well as for bioinformatics analyses many literature biocuration efforts have been carried_out their aim is to extract biologically relevant_information from articles and transform it into structured database records with regard to the rapid literature growth text_mining efforts are becoming increasingly important to speed up this process powerful infrastructures such as gate general architecture for text engineering usually require a good degree of technical expertise and sometimes even basic_knowledge of computational linguistics making them challenging to use for biocuration purposes to develop text_mining systems it is crucial to produce high_quality labelled textual data that can serve as training and test datasets at present most biomedical_text applications methods utilize a restricted number of annotated text data corpora prepared by biology domain_experts to help increasing this number we have implemented myminer an online annotation tool intended for expert biologists with no programming_skills compared to other applications e g brat pubtator knowtator ncbo annotator and domeo swan supplementary myminer provides within one single web_based application user_interfaces to classify documents compare classification efficiencies detect entities to annotate texts and link them to identifiers myminer is an online application designed to allow biologists and non it experts to semi automatically classify and annotate biomedical information in text with the help of text_mining tools it allows validating these automatically generated results as it provides a simple interface to manipulate the recognized bio entities and permits the addition of new labels for manual tagging this system can be exploited to efficiently label text for document classification and prioritization tasks for entity recognition purposes and for manual_annotation of relationships between entities it has been used during various annotation efforts by diverse groups of biomedical_scientists during the past_years myminer has been used by unique visitors on the myminer webpage we provide a comprehensive set of related systems to point visitors to complementary software the myminer repository offers the possibility to host and share corpora provided by the user community
