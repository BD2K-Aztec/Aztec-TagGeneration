systems_biology state reduction for network intervention in probabilistic boolean_networks motivation a key goal of studying biological_systems is to design therapeutic intervention_strategies probabilistic boolean_networks pbns constitute a mathematical_model which enables modeling predicting and intervening in their long_run behavior using markov_chain theory the long_run dynamics of a pbn as represented by its steady_state distribution ssd can guide the design of effective intervention_strategies for the modeled systems a major_obstacle for its application is the large state_space of the underlying markov_chain which poses a serious computational challenge hence it is critical to reduce the model_complexity of pbns for practical_applications results we propose a strategy to reduce the state_space of the underlying markov_chain of a pbn based on a criterion that the reduction least distorts the proportional change of stationary masses for critical states for instance the network attractors in comparison to previous reduction methods we reduce the state_space directly without deleting genes we then derive stationary_control on the reduced network that can be naturally induced back to the original network computational_experiments study the effects of the reduction on model_complexity and the performance of designed control policies which is measured by the shift of stationary mass away from undesirable states those associated with undesirable phenotypes we consider randomly_generated networks as well as a gene gastrointestinal_cancer network which if not reduced has a transition probability matrix such a dimension is too large for direct_application of many previously_proposed pbn intervention_strategies to date probabilistic boolean_networks form one of the widely_accepted mathematical_models for cellular_systems one of their important_applications is to design to whom correspondence should be addressed intervention_strategies that beneficially alter cell dynamics through studying the long_run network behavior since the probabilistic description of a pbn is an ergodic and irreducible finite markov_chain mc it possesses a steady_state distribution ssd reflecting its long_run dynamics different stochastic control policies have been employed to change the long_run dynamics so as to reduce the risk of entering aberrant states and thereby alter the extant cell_behavior however owing to the inherent computational_complexity of optimal_control methods using markov_chain theory it is often computationally prohibitive to achieve optimal_control policies for large_networks several approximate and greedy algorithms have been proposed to find suboptimal solutions but many of them still have complexity that increases exponentially with the number of genes in the network hence there is a need for size reducing mappings that produce more tractable models whose stationary_control induce suboptimal stationary_control on the original network this article proposes a greedy procedure to reduce the network state_space we study the effects of the proposed reduction with respect to the changes of the long_run network_dynamics and intervention performance of stationary_control derived using long_run network_dynamics whereas the available reduction mappings consider deleting genes to reduce the state_space we focus on deleting states by changing the regulatory rules and thereafter the transition probability matrix of the original network in a way that does not interfere with the trajectories of the critical states in the network for example its attractors we reduce the state_space based on the structure of the basins of attraction boas in a network as the boas before and after this state reduction procedure remain similar the long_run dynamics especially the proportion of stationary masses for critical states also remains similar hence we can design stationary_control on the reduced network based on long_run dynamics similar to those inand then from these induce stationary policies on the original network our in silico experiments show that the induced control policies achieve substantial beneficial shift of stationary mass of the original network toward desirable phenotypes using randomly_generated networks as well as a larger real_world network designed from a gastrointestinal_cancer dataset we now study the effects of the proposed state reduction algorithm with respect to both the approximation of long_run dynamics and intervention performance
