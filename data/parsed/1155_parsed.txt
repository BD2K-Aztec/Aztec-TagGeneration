genome_analysis contra copy_number analysis for targeted_resequencing motivation in light of the increasing adoption of targeted_resequencing tr as a cost_effective strategy to identify disease_causing a robust method for copy_number cnv analysis is needed to maximize the value of this promising technology results we present a method for cnv_detection for tr data including whole exome_capture data our method calls copy_number gains_and for each target_region based on normalized depth of coverage our key strategies_include the use of base level log ratios to remove gc_content bias correction for an imbalanced library size effect on log ratios and the estimation of log_ratio variations via binning and interpolation our methods are made available via contra copy_number targeted_resequencing analysis a software_package that takes standard alignment formats bam sam and outputs in variant_call vcf for easy integration with other next_generation analysis packages we assessed our methods using samples from seven different target enrichment assays and evaluated our results using simulated_data and real germline data with known cnv genotypes availability_and source_code and sample data are freely_available under gnu license gplv at http contra cnv sourceforge net targeted_resequencing tr including whole_exome is becoming widely_adopted as a cost_effective way to interrogate specific_genomic across a large number of samples a technique particularly useful for the study of genetic causes of cancer and other diseases a number of studies have demonstrated success in the application of tr to the identification of diseasecausing variants including variants associated with a rare mendelian disorder freemansheldon syndrome inherited mutations for breast_and and to whom correspondence should be addressed a single non sense mutation that causes a syndromic form of cleft_palate the primary objective of tr as in above studies is the detection of single_nucleotide snvs and short bp insertions_and indels within the targeted_regions inherent_limitations on sequence_alignment of short_reads prohibit the detection of larger indels and therefore many potential disease_causing copy_number cnvs are not accessible from tr data while whole_genome and single_nucleotide snp_genotyping microarrays are more appropriate tools for genome_wide cnv interrogations it is imperative that robust cnv analysis methods be developed for tr data in order to maximize the utility of the rapidly increasing amount of tr data that are being generated globally cnv_detection methods have been developed for whole_genome and incorporate three main aspects the estimation of copy_number breakpoint locations by segmentation using depth of coverage doc the incorporation of paired_end or mate_pair information to enhance detection accuracies a submitted for publication and the reduction of representation biases due to gc_content and other physio chemical characteristics segmentation and bias reduction have been applied to tr data on large target_regions kb however the size of a target_region in most tr projects is typically small ranging from to bp as in exon or wholeexome capture in addition genomic distribution of target_regions is often sparse and uneven due to the size of intronic segments and the arbitrary locations of the genes of interest the small_size sparseness and non contiguous nature of target_regions pose_challenges to the application of existing cnv methods on tr data even if the doc is high in the target_regions data resolution would be too low to make reasonable segmentation and bias reduction on a whole genome_scale it has also been reported that the underlying assumptions made for cnv estimation in whole_genome fail to hold in the exome_sequencing setting more specifically the assumptions that genome_wide read_depth is normally distributed and that segmentation search_space is continuous fail to apply for exon capture data to date a limited number of methods have been published for the cnv analysis of tr data exome cnv was designed specifically for whole exome_capture the technical variation of coverage across five human and one mouse exome_capture platforms were compared the one platform that exhibits a distinct coverage distribution is the older arraybased capture platform seqcap array with a slope larger than all other platforms in the log mean variance plot its association with larger doc variations is also apparent from the chromosome wide log_ratio plots making it unsuitable for cnv and other doc based analyses other solution based capture platforms are comparable with ez exome v being the most stable in our sample cohort our comparison of log_ratio plots between single_end and paired_end seqcap array data shows no remarkable_differences however we have no access to further single_end data to make similar comparisons for other platforms given the reduction in sequencing cost it is expected that sequencing_data will be predominantly paired_end the use of a matched control versus that of a control set was also compared in terms of log_ratio variation as expected using multiple samples to create a baseline coverage helps to reduce doc variations and in turn log_ratio variations improving cnv_detection sensitivity as shown in increasing the number of samples in the control set would reduce the sd of log ratios at any given coverage until a minimum_level of sd is reached therefore even when a matched control is available a secondary analysis using multiple unmatched normal samples as the control can be performed in additional to a paired analysis to improve the detection of true_positives the main difference between contra and exome cnv is their approach to calling a region significant exome cnv models the log ratios using a gearyhinkley transformation based on an approximation that doc has a normal distribution of equal mean and variance this model makes the assumption that doc follows a poisson_distribution which converges to normal with sufficient doc there are two limitations of this approach i low doc regions are not properly addressed and ii a poisson_model fails to capture the increasing variance at high doc a characteristic that is evident from the mean variance plot of our data and that has been discussed in the context of rna_seq and a negative_binomial contra on the other hand was developed based on empirical relationships between log ratios and doc that have been observed to be consistent across multiple target enrichment platforms it relies on the case sample being largely copy_number neutral through which a null_distribution of log ratios is estimated and outlying events cnvs detected this assumption has been demonstrated to hold sufficiently well for normal individuals in our evaluation using hapmap data for non diploid samples the limitation of contra is a reduced sensitivity in cnv_detection when a large proportion of the target_regions are associated with a copy_number change such as in a small custom capture of tumor material supplementary_materials however this limitation is eased in the case of wholeexome capture where a large proportion of copy_number neutral regions can be achieved furthermore this limitation does not apply to family and population studies where cnv events are expected to be rare the inherent limitation of tr data regardless of analysis methods lies in the high variation of doc such a high variation makes the detection of a single copy_number gain a very difficult_task as apparent from where the cloud of null data spreads across the log_ratio line fold_change the detection of hemizygous deletions would perform better as it corresponds to a fold_change log_ratio but would be challenging for regions with coverage less than x in addition to cnv_calls at the region exon level contra offers a function to predict large cnvs spanning multiple regions however care must be given to the interpretation of these large predictions a large cnv segment often consists of a percentage of regions that have inconclusive cnv status high p values they may correspond to either copy_number neutral regions or low coverage regions the strategy employed by contra is to set a threshold on this percentage above which no cnv call is made on the other hand the strategy used by exome cnv is to add up doc across the regions and then assess the overall log_ratio heavily biasing toward those regions with high coverage neither of these methods adequately addresses the sparseness and non contiguous nature of target_regions an inherent limitation of tr data that restricts practical prediction to be made at the region level for this reason while tr or exome_sequencing is appropriate for predicting novel single_exon cnvs and screening for known cnvs other technologies such as genotyping microarrays must be used for the accurate_predictions of larger cnvs for the upstream processing of sequence_data contra imposes no requirements on the methods used but it is recommended that multi mapped_reads and pcr duplicates be removed to reduce signal noise in doc downstream_analysis after cnv_detection includes the removal of known cnps from candidate cnv regions using public resources such as the copy_number project http www sanger ac uk humgen cnv this is particularly useful when a pooled control strategy is used targeted_resequencing data across seven capture platforms have been assessed in terms of coverage and log_ratio variations we have developed a method for the detection of cnv based on empirical relationships between log_ratio and coverage contra outperforms an existing algorithm based on a simulated dataset and is particularly suitable for population and family studies our methods are available as a software_package contra via http contra cnv sourceforge net
