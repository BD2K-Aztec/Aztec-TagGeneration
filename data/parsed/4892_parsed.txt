sequence_analysis wavecnv allele specific copy_number in primary_tumors and xenograft_models from next_generation motivation copy_number cnvs are a major source of genomic variability and are especially significant in cancer until recently microarray_technologies have been used to characterize cnvs in genomes however advances in next_generation offer significant opportunities to deduce copy_number directly from genome sequencing_data unfortunately cancer_genomes differ from normal genomes in several aspects that make them far less amenable to copy_number detection for example cancer_genomes are often aneuploid and an admixture of diploid non tumor cell_fractions also patient_derived models can be laden with mouse contamination that strongly affects accurate assignment of copy_number hence there is a need to develop analytical_tools that can take into account cancer specific parameters for detecting cnvs directly from genome sequencing_data results we have developed wavecnv a software_package to identify copy_number by detecting breakpoints of cnvs using translation invariant discrete wavelet transforms and assign digitized copy_numbers to each event using next_generation data we also assign alleles specifying the chromosomal ratio following duplication loss we verified copy_number calls using both microarray correlation_coefficient and quantitative_polymerase correlation_coefficient and found them to be highly concordant we demonstrate its utility in pancreatic primary and xenograft sequencing_data availability_and source_code and executables are available at https github com wavecnv the segmentation_algorithm is implemented in matlab and copy_number assignment is implemented perl contact dna copy_number cnvs are associated with a wide_range of diseases_including where detection of copy_number has led to guided therapeutic_interventions for example amplification of the erbb locus is used to identify patients for trastuzumab treatment although comparative_genome cgh microarrays have an intrinsic kilobase kb resolution for cnv_detection the advent of highthroughput next_generation ngs_technologies offers us the potential to probe genomic structural_variation at base_pair level however with the increase in signal resolution comes a substantially increased noise signature and the problem of how to remove false_positives recent efforts by various groups have attempted to mitigate the noise by carrying out a smoothing binning of the sequencing read_depth on scales of tens to hundreds of base_pairs and examining this smoothed read_depth the smoothing process is performed on a set arbitrary scale which can smooth out physically interesting_features of a signal this is of significant concern for cancer_genomes which are known to have unstable genomes that constantly evolve smoothing methods also assume that the noise signature of the signal is overwhelmingly concentrated on a single base_pair genomic_scale high_frequency and ignores the possibility of strong long_range low_frequency systemic correlated noise that may increase the false_positive of any detection algorithm another recent effort varbin uses a variable binning approach to take into account an uneven_distribution of mappable reads although this method is suitable for low or sparse coverage as illustrated in single_cell it does not fully harness the available basepair scale genomic resolution assignment of digitized copy_number to genomic_segments in tumors is further complicated in cancer_genomes due to a number of sample specific confounding_factors for example primary tumor_tissues may contain low tumor cellularity due to an admixture of diploid non tumor_cell fraction in patient samples including pancreatic_cancer where tumor cellularity can vary from to thus making the detection of cancer driver_mutations difficult in addition to primary_tumors patient derived samples grown in mouse to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded as joint which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com xenograft pdx models are being increasingly used in pre clinical_settings to understand tumor_biology and therapy response assignment of digitized copy_number to cnvs in these models becomes increasingly difficult due to mouse contamination of the tumor_samples that introduces noise in the sequencing_coverage as well as allele_frequencies for snvs both of which are integral to cnv_calling methods although algorithms such as qpure genocn ascat van and absolute model for stromal contamination and ploidy estimation on snp_array they do not function for genome sequencing_data also these methods cannot correct for the additional effects of xenograft mouse contamination to fill this need we have developed wavecnv a tool that uses dna sequencing_data to model for complex cancer_genomes the algorithm estimates ploidy tumor cellularity in primary_tumors mouse content in xenograft_models and assigns digitized copy_numbers and alleles to indicate which parental chromosome pair was affected by each copy_number event also to overcome limitations associated with binning based_approaches we use the well established theory of wavelets to take full advantage of the genomic resolution available in sequencing_data illustrates the overall flowchart of data generation and copy_number modeling we identified somatic copy_number in pancreatic_cancer genome sequencing_data using wavecnv the size of cnv events varied from bp to mb supplementarylists these events along with their verification status using alternate platforms and supplementaryillustrates the size_distribution of those events we have developed a computational algorithm to detect cnv boundaries from whole_genome sequencing_data and assigned digitized copy_number by modeling for sample specific confounding_factor such as aneuploidy normal_diploid contamination of primary_tumors and mouse contamination in xenograft_models the segmentation_algorithm based on wavelet_transform provides a unique_opportunity to probe the genome in any the second part of wavecnv provides a statistical_framework to assign cn and merge neighboring events carrying the same copy_number this corrects for false shearing of copy_number events that may arise due to poor_quality of sequencing_data a key_component of wavecnv is the matchednormal based copy_number correction being aware of the diploid control ensures that any systemic artifacts that may appear in both tumor and normal genomes including platform specific_biases unsequenceable regions and so forth are effectively removed or corrected for this resulted in a high concordance between somatic cn calls from our algorithm in sequencing_data to both microarray_data and qpcr xenograft_models for many types of primary_tumors have increasingly become useful tools to understand cancer_biology and to test therapeutic_targets our model estimates mouse contamination and the reported allele and copy_number reflects the correction for mouse contamination the mouse contamination estimate matches well with our mouse specific qpcr data on the same note most directly sequenced primary tumor_samples contain stromal contamination and our algorithm can quantify and model for the presence of contaminating diploid cells in that sequencing_data our segmentation_algorithm is unique from its methodology perspective and can potentially improve the boundary assignments on the smaller cnv events found via whole_genome in addition the assignment of specific_alleles to copy_number losses gains can give researchers the ability to explore relationships between selected sequence mutations and structural_variation for example in pancreatic_cancer a kras activating point_mutation is often coupled with duplication_events thus amplifying the effect of this oncogene being able to identify similar correlations based on reports from our algorithm could prove useful in prioritizing specific genes for further study
