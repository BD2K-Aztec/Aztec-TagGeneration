data_and tmvar a text_mining approach for extracting sequence_variants in biomedical_literature motivation text_mining mutation information from the literature becomes a critical part of the bioinformatics_approach for the analysis and interpretation of sequence_variations in complex_diseases in the post genomic era it has also been used for assisting the creation of disease related mutation databases most of existing_approaches are rule_based and focus on limited types of sequence_variations such as protein point_mutations thus extending their extraction scope requires significant manual efforts in examining new instances and developing corresponding rules as such new automatic approaches are greatly needed for extracting different kinds of mutations with high_accuracy results here we report tmvar a text_mining approach based on conditional_random crf for extracting a wide_range of sequence_variants described at protein dna and rna levels according to a standard nomenclature developed by the human genome_variation society by doing so we cover several important types of mutations that were not considered in past_studies using a novel crf label model and feature_set our method achieves higher performance than a state of the art method on both our corpus versus in f measure and their own gold_standard versus in f measure these results suggest that tmvar is a high performance method for mutation extraction from biomedical_literature availability tmvar software and its corpus of manually_curated abstracts are available for download at http www ncbi nlm nih gov cbbresearch lu pub tmvar in the past_years the focus of biological_research has shifted from individual genes and proteins toward the study of entire biological_systems one of the most important research issues is gene protein and disease relationship analysis sequence_variation plays the key role between gene and disease therefore identifying sequence_variation is one of the major approaches for characterizing genedisease relationships with many study results subsequently reported in scientific_publications as such textmining mutation related information from the literature has become an increasingly important task in many downstream bioinformatics applications such as the curation of mutationrelated biological_databases the systematic study of biological_effects of protein mutations and the interpretation of individual_genomes toward personalized_medicine in pharmacogenomics research despite some reported success in identifying specific mutation types or identifiers such as dbsnp rs numbers mutation identification from free_text in general remains a challenge because most mutations are not described in accordance with standard nomenclature in our corpus and only few are mentioned with standard database_identifiers such as dbsnp rs numbers in our corpus to the opposite it is common to see the same mutation described in many different non standard ways in the literature which makes it similar to the named_entity task in biomedicine in response recently a number of automatic systems have been developed for extracting mutation mentions from the biomedical_literature and some investigated further with respect to mutations associations with genes diseases and other related information despite different scopes with regard to methods for mutation detection most systems rely on manually derived regular expressions for instance for detecting protein point_mutations e g a g from text developed mutationfinder which contains regular expression_patterns and achieves state of theart performance of in f measure compared with the overwhelmingly used rule_based systems vtag stands out with a machine_learning approach and reports an f measure of on their evaluation data we refer readers tofor a summary of previous implementations for mutation extraction following vtag and other previous_studies on biomedical named_entities dog an and lu b we formulated the problem of named_entity as a sequence labeling problem therefore a conditional_random crf model was naturally chosen as our learning algorithm however as detailed in our method description we developed a new crf model with labels to whom correspondence should be addressed as opposed to the traditional bio model as well as a set of novel features in this work as shown in section both designs helped improve extraction performance and made our method compare favorably with the state of the art in addition our work is also unique in extracting mutations of many types that are not considered by previous methods existing_methods such as mutationfinder either exclusively aim for extracting point_mutations in proteins or are limited to a few mutation types such as substitution and deletion in both proteins and genes to our best knowledge this work is the first attempt to identify various mutation types according to a standard nomenclature endorsed by the human genomic_variation society hgvs for the description of sequence_variants mutations finally similar to mutationfinder along with a public tool for mutation extraction we also contribute to the text_mining community a large corpus pubmed_abstracts of manually_annotated raw and normalized mutation mentions a raw mutation extraction is normalized when individual mutation components are identified and standardized when applicable for instance arg ter pmid is normalized as pjrj jx to denote the replacement of an arginine_residue at position by termination_codon where a single letter p is added to indicate the mutation_type and the standard one letter codes are used with their respective positions in the normalized notation to represent the wild_type residue as noted earlier in the text our corpus covers many kinds of mutations not previously_considered such as p pro hisfsx pmid and ivs g a pmid in summary we introduced a crf based machine_learning for mutation extraction from text with highthree labels b i o four labels b i e o eleven labels a t p w m f s d r i o performance our method complements and extends existing_methods in extracting a wide_range of different types of sequence_variants in scientific_publications there are several future_directions for extending this work first tmvar is shown to be accurate on pubmed_abstracts in this study although tmvar is also applicable to full text future study is warranted to determine its actual_performance on different text genres second despite the fact this work in itself can be used and integrated by other research just like any other standalone mutation extraction tools e g mutationfinder it is useful to extract and associate contextual_information e g gene protein_sequence to the extracted mutations third given our high extraction performance we are interested in exploring direct applications of this work in the framework of computer_assisted biocuration indeed we have started discussing potential_opportunities of contributing our computer generated results to dbsnp l phan personal communication finally together with our ability to recognize proteins and diseases dog an and lu a b we would like to investigate automatic_methods for characterizing de facto relationships between sequence_variations in complex_diseases buried in the biomedical_literature
