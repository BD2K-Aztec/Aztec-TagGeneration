data_and boosting automatic event_extraction from the literature using domain adaptation and coreference resolution motivation in recent_years several biomedical event_extraction ee systems have been developed however the nature of the annotated training corpora as well as the training_process itself can limit the performance levels of the trained ee systems in particular most event annotated corpora do not deal adequately with coreference this impacts on the trained systems ability to recognize biomedical entities thus affecting their performance in extracting events accurately additionally the fact that most ee systems are trained on a single annotated corpus further restricts their coverage results we have enhanced our existing ee system eventmine in two ways first we developed a new coreference resolution cr system and integrated it with eventmine the standalone performance of our cr system in resolving anaphoric references to proteins is considerably_higher than the best ranked system in the coref subtask of the bionlp shared task secondly the improved eventmine incorporates domain adaptation da methods which extend ee coverage by allowing several different annotated corpora to be used during training combined with a novel set of methods to increase the generality and efficiency of eventmine the integration of both cr and da have resulted in significant improvements in ee ranging between and f score the enhanced eventmine outperforms the highest ranked systems from the bionlp shared task and from the genia and infectious_diseases subtasks of the bionlp shared task the focus of text_mining systems in biomedicine has recently shifted from extracting named_entities of biological_relevance to recognizing relations and events biomedical event_extraction ee systems have already been integrated with a number of applications such as semantic search association mining for knowledge_discovery bioprocess extraction and pathway reconstruction the increasing requirement for high performance ee systems has motivated the development of several event annotated to whom correspondence should be addressed corpora to facilitate their training e g genia bioinfer grec bionlp shared tasks st and st events are structured descriptions of biological_processes involving complex relationships e g angiogenesis metabolism and reactions between biomedical entities and are highly dependent on context events usually consist of triggers which are often verbs e g inhibit or nominalizations e g inhibition and their typed arguments which can be biomedical entities e g gene or other events e g regulation typically ee systems find both triggers and associated arguments which can present a number of challenges triggers are expressed in diverse ways and their exact interpretation can depend upon context e g expression of is an event of type gene_expression but expression of is of type transcription furthermore event arguments can be difficult to detect since triggers are sublanguage dependent their exact syntactic arguments are dictated by the domain ee systems are thus highly dependent on the availability of training_sets and external resources e g dictionaries that can expand the trigger candidates in the training_set with semantically similar alternatives generally machine_learning are applied to syntactic parse results to disambiguate event_types according to their surrounding contexts and to identify relations between the syntactic and semantic arguments of triggers there are two important issues that are scarcely dealt with by existing ee systems first the usual method of training on only a single annotated corpus can limit the coverage and scalability of the system secondly coreference resolution cr is required for the correct interpretation of certain event arguments this is illustrated in in which there are two coreferential links the first link involves the mention this gene and its antecedent junb whereas the second concerns the mention that and its antecedent expression there are two gene_expression events in the sentence i e jun b expression and jun c expression which can only be correctly recognized if these coreferential links are identified and resolved this article reports on two enhancements that have been made to an existing ee system eventmine to address the issues outlined above first we constructed a new cr system whose performance in resolving anaphoric references to events are represented as dotted rectangles with event_types within events solid rectangles represent participants whereas trigger expressions are shown with a white background argument roles with a grey background and arguments with a black background the oval denotes an event modification in this case speculation genes and proteins considerably exceeds that of the best participating system in the protein coreference task coref of st which focussed on protein gene name cr subsequent integration of our new cr system with eventmine clearly demonstrates an improvement in state of the art ee performance on several event corpora secondly our incorporation of domain adaptation da methods into eventmine which make it possible to use information from multiple annotated corpora when training the system have been shown to further boost ee performance the enhanced version of eventmine incorporating both cr and da outperforms the highest ranked systems participating in st and the genia and infectious_diseases id subtasks of st this article has reported on a number of enhancements to the eventmine ee system first several methods were incorporated to increase both the generality and efficiency of the system secondly a newly constructed rule_based cr system was integrated into eventmine and da methods were applied to utilize information from multiple annotated corpora the cr system considerably outperformed systems that participated in the ge coref task the incorporation of cr and da into the ee process significantly_improved the performance of eventmine on four different eventannotated corpora demonstrating the adaptable nature of the system the results surpass those of systems that participated in the ge task of st and the ge and id tasks of st as future work we will explore further novel ways of integrating external resources by reducing the effect of differences among corpora we will also investigate how eventmine can be embedded into other applications e g semantic search_engines and pathway curation and reconstruction systems
