flowphyto enabling automated analysis of microscopic algae from continuous flow_cytometric data motivation flow_cytometry is a widely used technique among biologists to study the abundances of populations of microscopic algae living in aquatic_environments a new generation of high_frequency flow_cytometers collects up to several hundred samples per day and can run continuously for several weeks automated computational_methods are needed to analyze the different phytoplankton populations present in each sample software_packages in the programming environment r provide_powerful for conducting such analyses results we introduce flowphyto an r package that performs aggregate statistics on virtually unlimited collections of raw flow_cytometry files and provides a memory_efficient parallelized solution for analyzing high_throughput flow_cytometric data availability freely_accessible atphytoplankton are microscopic algae that are at the foundation of the marine food_web and can influence earths climate flow_cytometry has provided new insights into phytoplankton ecology in freshwater and marine_environments it creates fingerprints of phytopkankton cells based on their ability to scatter or re emit specific wavelengths of light this light can be detected and used to estimate cell size and the composition of photosynthetic pigments that are used to distinguish different phytoplankton populations in the last decade several high_frequency flow_cytometers have been developed to study phytoplankton community_structure at very fine spatial_and collecting several hundreds of samples per day for several weeks one of the largest flow_cytometry datasets publicly_available to marine biologists is produced by a new generation of flow_cytometer created at the university of washington called seaflow that continuously measures phytoplankton composition and abundance the instrument generates the equivalent of samples representing a dataset of gb after a typical week_long oceanographic cruise software_tools for automated data analysis and visualization of phytoplankton populations is therefore essential we describe the r package flowphyto which provides aflowphyto provides an efficient approach for the analysis of highthroughput flow_cytometry data although this approach provides an unique_solution for the analysis of seaflow data repository it is also compatible with standard flow_cytometry data
