genetics_and relateadmix a software_tool for estimating relatedness between admixed individuals motivation pairwise relatedness plays an important role in a range of genetic research_fields however currently only few estimators exist for individuals that are admixed i e have ancestry from more than one population and these estimators fail in some situations results we present a new software_tool relateadmix for obtaining maximum_likelihood of pairwise relatedness from genetic data between admixed individuals we show using simulated_data that it gives rise to better estimates than three state of the art software_tools reap king and plink while still being fast enough to be applicable to large_datasets genetic_relatedness between pairs of individuals plays an important role within several fields of genetic research including forensic and medical_genetics for example most genome_wide are based on the assumption that all individuals analyzed are unrelated and if related individuals are not removed or controlled for they can lead to highly inflated false_positive relatedness between a pair of individuals is usually described using the concept of identity by descent ibd which is genetic identity due to recent common_ancestry more specifically relatedness between two non inbred individuals is often described by the fractions k k and k of the genome in which the two individuals share or alleles ibd respectively further relatedness is sometimes summarized as the coefficient of relatedness r or the kinship coefficient r which can both be calculated from k k and k as r k k there are numerous estimators for k k k r and based on genetic data from individuals whose potential family relations are unknown both method of moments estimators and maximum_likelihood ml estimators additionally there are several hidden_markov based_methods that estimate ibd_sharing locally along the genome e g which if applied to whole genomes also provide relatedness estimates however all of these estimators are based on an assumption that the analyzed individuals are from a homogeneous_population and it has been shown that when this assumption is violated it can lead to a marked misestimation of their relatedness motivated by this recently_proposed a method of moments estimator for pairwise relatedness in admixed_populations implemented in the software reap and an estimator for the kinship coefficient in structured populations was included in the software king here we present a new ml based software_tool relateadmix for estimating k k and k from single_nucleotide data estimated admixture proportions and allele_frequencies assuming no inbreeding we obtain more accurate results than both reap king and the often used software plink which does not take admixture into account
