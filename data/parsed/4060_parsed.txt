robust linear regression_methods in association studies motivation it is well known that data deficiencies such as coding rounding errors outliers or missing_values may lead to misleading_results for many statistical_methods robust statistical_methods are designed to accommodate certain types of those deficiencies allowing for reliable results under various conditions we analyze the case of statistical_tests to detect associations between genomic individual variations snp and quantitative_traits when deviations from the normality assumption are observed we consider the classical analysis_of tests for the parameters of the appropriate linear_model and a robust version of those tests based on m regression we then compare their empirical power and level using simulated_data with several degrees of contamination results data normality is nothing but a mathematical convenience in practice experiments usually yield data with non conforming observations in the presence of this type of data classical least_squares statistical_methods perform poorly giving biased_estimates raising the number of spurious_associations and often failing to detect true ones we show through a simulation_study and a real_data example that the robust methodology can be more powerful and thus more adequate for association studies than the classical_approach availability the code of the robustified version of function lmekin from the r package kinship is provided as supplementary_material genetic_association aim to identify genetic_polymorphisms that cause phenotypic_variation for a trait of interest or that are in linkage_disequilibrium with the causative genetic_variant we focus our analysis on biallelic genetic_variants such as single_nucleotide snps in this case the unit of analysis can be regarded as a three category variable for instance a snp with alleles a adenine and g guanine has categories aa ag and gg we are interested in using a number of genotyped snps in a gene or region to detect the genetic_factors underlying a quantitative to whom correspondence should be addressed trait of interest that does not follow simple mendelian patterns of inheritance the most straightforward and still more favoured approach in association studies though raising multiple testing problems is to perform a single snp test for every genotyped snp via regression or analysis_of anova methods used a linear_model to test the association between snps in eight candidate_genes and agespecific growth_rate in the artic charr used mixed_linear to test for association between snps from candidate_genes and some wood properties in pinus taeda used a mixed random_effects linear_model to test for the association between a collection of snps and some teosinte traits used a linear_model to test for the association between snps from candidate_genes and several traits of boar though the single snp approach may be considered if we are looking for a single causal_variant it is not very efficient when the snps have limited ld with that causal_variant meaning smaller power moreover quantitative_traits are usually controlled by several and sometimes many genes thus a joint analysis of snps may be more adequate being much more informative than single snp analysis however it also may lose power due to the usually large number of degrees_of involved ideally one should make use of the information provided by multiple_snps capturing as much of the genetic_variance as possible without raising the degrees_of too much and thus not compromising power note that the joint analysis of snps multiple snp approach can only be applied to situations where the number of explanatory_variables is much smaller than the number of individuals therefore implying that in a genome_wide context a preliminary step of dimension_reduction is necessary there is an extensive literature on how two specific data problemsld and population_structure ps may affect both the power to detect true associations as well as the number_of therefore distorting the conclusions when testing for association between a quantitative_trait and a set of candidate snps in a population_based study we also find in literature many methods for overcoming these problems another frequent data problem which may have the same sort of undesirable_effects is non normality and or presence of outliers in the phenotypic_data this problem is far less studiedin sections and we compared the performance of classic robust and non parametric methodologies in association studies in a particular simulation frame we showed that under the null without contamination the four methods considered have control of the fwer at the desired_level we acknowledged not only the tendency of both the classic and wilcoxon approaches towards inflated type_i but also that the robust approach proposed huber m regression plus wald type tests to assess association is not as sensitive to outlier contamination as the classical_approach and is more powerful than the rank transform approach to detect snp trait associations despite the fact that the wilcoxon approach kept close to the robust methodology in terms of power its tendency to inflated type_i and computational issues indicate that for an association study involving a small number of independent snps to be tested as in the simulation_study the robust multiple snp linear_model is preferable over the remaining approaches in section we applied the classic and robust methodologies to a published real_dataset this dataset was not in the conditions of the simulation_study and was therefore treated accordingly results showed the presence of outliers and therefore the non normality of
