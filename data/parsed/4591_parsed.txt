the effects of feedback_loops on disease comorbidity in human signaling_networks motivation in general diseases are more likely to be comorbid if they share associated genes or molecular_interactions in a cellular_process however there are still a number of pairs of diseases which show relatively high_comorbidity but do not share any associated genes or interactions this observation raises the need for a novel factor which can explain the underlying mechanism of comorbidity we here consider a feedback_loop fbl structure ubiquitously found in the human cell signaling_network as a key motif to explain the comorbidity phenomenon since it is well known to have effects on network_dynamics results for every pair of diseases we examined its comorbidity and length of all fbls involved by the disease associated genes in the human cell signaling_network we found that there is a negative relationship between comorbidity and length of involved fbls this indicates that a disease pair is more likely to comorbid if they are connected with fbls of shorter length we additionally showed that such a negative relationship is more obvious when the number of positive involved fbls is larger than that of negative involved fbls moreover we observed that the negative relationship between comorbidity and length of involved fbls holds especially for disease pairs that do not share any disease associated genes finally we proved all these results through intensive simulations based on a boolean_network when two disorders or illnesses occur in the same person simultaneously or one after the other they are called comorbid it is reported that of the elderly_population has three or more chronic_conditions which explains the importance of understanding disease comorbidity there have been many studies observing the comorbidity phenomenon some studies have found high_comorbidity rates of certain pairs of diseases and addressed statistical results of prevalence and mortality of specified regions other studies attempted to quantify the effect of a disease on other to whom correspondence should be addressed diseases by introducing comorbidity measures in a recent study of illness progression a database was also constructed to summarize statistical correlations between phenotypic diseases from histories of more than million patients in a phenotypic disease network another class of previous_studies investigated factors to explain the cause of comorbidity for example constructed a human disease network in which a pair of diseases are linked when they share_common disease_causing and showed a common genetic_origin of many diseases from this constructed network in another study found statistically_significant correlations between an underlying_structure of cellular_networks and comorbidity patterns in the human population by combining information on protein interactions disease gene_associations and population level disease patterns extracted from medicare data in that paper the authors showed_positive between the degree of comorbidity the number of shared genes and the number of shared protein interactions a bipartite_graph was also constructed in which nodes represent diseases and two diseases are linked if mutated enzymes associated with them catalyze adjacent metabolic_reactions based on this graph it was shown that two connected metabolic_diseases sharing some pathways tend to show significant comorbidity this result is consistent with a general proteomic notion that diseases may be related if they share protein interactions or proteins acting on the same pathway taken together it can be generally_accepted that diseases that share associated genes or molecular_interactions in a cellular_process are more likely to be comorbid however it is interesting that many pairs of diseases show high_comorbidity even though they do not share any associated genes or interactions therefore there is still a pressing need to find other factors which is related to comorbidity in this study we consider a fbl fbl structure as a novel factor to explain the comorbidity phenomenon fbls are a well known critical motif to affect dynamics in biological_networks in particular fbls were shown to play_an in robustly sustaining steady_state of networks against perturbations in this regard we investigated the relationship between comorbidity and fbls involved with disease associated genes in a human signaling_network using integrated data from a diseasegene association database and a human cell signaling_network we show that there is a negative relationship between comorbidity and the length ofpage high_comorbidity between disease pairs such as diabetes_mellitus and obesity or hypertension and spasms have been observed previous_studies explained that such a phenomenon was mostly due to mutational defects of a common disease gene shared by those diseases however many pairs of other diseases that do not share any associated gene have also been found and this may be because complex molecular_interaction spread the disorder of a gene to the other genes therefore careful analysis of signaling_pathways at the system level is needed to understand the comorbidity mechanism in particular we considered fbls as an important structural_feature for comorbidity since many previous_studies have revealed that they can make the network_dynamics complicated and nonlinear in this regard we investigated the effect of fbls in the human cell signaling_network on comorbidity and showed that disease pairs connected with a fbl of shorter length make the comorbidity higher than those connected with an fbl of longer length in other words a pair of diseases is more likely to be comorbid when their associated genes are involved in fbls of relatively short lengths moreover we showed that such a relationship is apparent when the number of positive involved fbls is larger than that of negative involved fbls in addition it was also shown that a pair of diseases connected with fbls of relatively short_length can be highly comorbid especially when they do not share any gene through intensive simulations based on boolean_networks we proved the relationship between fbls and comorbidity is a fundamental property with respect to network_dynamics in synthetic_biology the findings of this article can be useful in order to control mutual effectiveness between components of an artificial cell also the findings of this study can be considered evidence showing the usefulness of a boolean_network in studying the dynamics of biological_networks in addition it will be a significant future study to find out a more realistic measure than mutual effectiveness to simulate comorbidity phenomenon in a boolean_network
