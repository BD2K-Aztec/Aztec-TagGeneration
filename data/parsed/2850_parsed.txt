medusa a multi draft based scaffolder downloaded from motivation completing the genome_sequence of an organism is an important task in comparative functional and structural_genomics however this remains a challenging issue from both a computational and an experimental viewpoint genome scaffolding i e the process of ordering and orientating contigs of de_novo assemblies usually represents the first step in most genome finishing pipelines results in this article we present medusa multi draft based scaffolder an algorithm for genome scaffolding medusa exploits information obtained from a set of draft or closed genomes from related organisms to determine the correct order and orientation of the contigs medusa formalizes the scaffolding_problem by means of a combinatorial_optimization formulation on graphs and implements an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm to solve it in contrast to currently used scaffolders it does not require either prior_knowledge on the microrganisms dataset under analysis e g their phylogenetic_relationships or the availability of paired_end libraries this makes usability and running time two additional important features of our method moreover benchmarks and tests on real bacterial datasets showed that medusa is highly_accurate and in most cases outperforms traditional scaffolders the possibility to use medusa on eukaryotic data_sets has also been evaluated leading to interesting_results availability_and medusa web_server the de_novo of short_read sequencing_data usually leads to a fragmented set of genomic_sequences contigs ordering and orientating such contigs scaffolding represents the first non trivial step towards genome finishing and usually requires extensive processing and manual editing of large blocks of sequence the preferred approach to genome scaffolding is currently based on assembling the sequenced_reads into contigs and then using paired_end information to join them into scaffolds most of the software based on such approach have several preparatory steps in which read and contig libraries are first converted to a specific format then mapped against each other by means of an external aligner e g bwa or bowtie and finally used to possibly join contigs together at the end of this pipeline a scaffolding graph is usually constructed and a plethora of different methods can be used to analyse the graph and produce the resulting scaffold structure currently available methods software include sopra scarpa mip opera grass and sspace a recent survey analyses and benchmarks most of these recent and sophisticated scaffolding software the authors showed that in general they are not satisfying either in terms of usability or in terms of the quality of the solution leading to the conclusion that there is still scope for improvements in this area an alternative approach for scaffolding genomes relies on the use of a complete closed reference_genome to guide the ordering and the orientating of the contigs many available methods exist for mapping and then scaffolding the generated draft contigs this approach is also used in some specific_contexts such as for ancient dna_fragments reconstruction where read information is not available or reliable these software differ in terms of their overall strategy and implementation but in general i they allow for only a single reference_genome ii when multiple_genomes are allowed generally these have to be closed and iii a reference phylogeny accounting for the evolutionary_relationships among the selected taxa is to be provided to guide a multi reference genomesbased scaffolding none of the aforementioned approaches is capable of ignoring all of these constraints that taken together represent_important practical limitations indeed with the exception of model_organisms reliable closed reference_genomes are not always available moreover especially in the case of bacteria genomic_rearrangements among closely_related organisms may introduce important structural_differences hampering the scaffolding procedure based on a single_genome as reference finally the requirement of a reliable phylogenetic_reconstruction can pose a significant challenge since it is not always straightforward for some bacterial_taxa for which the large genetic_variability in gene content inside a same species can lead to different phylogenies depending on which molecular_marker and or approach is used to overcome the difficulties that characterize currently available methods we developed medusa multi draft based scaffolder an algorithm for scaffolding draft_genomes by ordering and orientating a set of de_novo obtained contigs and thus speeding up genome finishing unlike most of the other software medusa i formalizes the scaffolding_problem by means of a combinatorial_optimization formulation on graphs and implements an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm to solve it ii allows for multiple reference_genomes to be used during scaffolding iii does not require prior_knowledge on the evolutionary_relationships i e a phylogenetic_tree among the reference_set of organisms and iv can handle both draft and complete reference_genomes this latter point is of great_importance in practice since in current public_databases the availability of draft_genomes greatly exceeds that of completely_sequenced ones moreover since retrieving the additional information needed by the aforementioned scaffolders can be a challenging_task an algorithm that does not rely on such prior_knowledge is of great interest and allows the inclusion of a larger set of genomes for the scaffolding process the strategy of medusa is based on the intuition that a set of genomes related to the target one can be used for assigning a relative_position to each contig and that this kind of information is easily available in practice specifically those contigs mapping on adjacent_regions in these other genomes are considered to be neighbours in the resulting scaffold medusa formalizes such scaffolding_problem as a path cover problem in a graph and solves it with ad_hoc optimization techniques the underlying algorithm has been implemented both in the form of a command_line software and a web_server testing medusa on bacterial and eukaryotic datasets revealed that our software performs very well in comparison to others currently available and answers some of the implicit requests pointed_out byin their review i e usability and accuracy of the obtained results
