structural_bioinformatics efficient initial volume determination from electron microscopy_images of single particles motivation structural_information of macromolecular_complexes provides key insights into the way they carry out their biological_functions the reconstruction_process leading to the final d map requires an approximate initial model generation of an initial model is still an open and challenging_problem in single_particle analysis results we present a fast and efficient approach to obtain a reliable low_resolution estimation of the d structure of a macromolecule without any a priori_knowledge addressing the well known issue of initial volume_estimation in the field of single_particle analysis the input of the algorithm is a set of class average images obtained from individual projections of a biological object at random and unknown orientations by transmission_electron micrographs the proposed method is based on an initial non lineal dimensionality_reduction approach which allows to automatically selecting representative small sets of class average images capturing the most of the structural_information of the particle under study these reduced sets are then used to generate volumes from random orientation assignments the best volume is determined from these guesses using a random_sample consensus ransac approach we have tested our proposed algorithm which we will term d ransac with simulated and experimental_data obtaining satisfactory_results under the low signal to noise_conditions typical of cryo_electron availability the algorithm is freely_available as part of the xmipp package http single_particle analysis spa techniques can obtain d maps of biological complexes at near atomic_resolution by combining tens_of of projection images obtained with a transmission_electron tem in general the reconstruction_process leading to the final d map requires the use of an approximate initial model the fully_automatic and efficient determination of this initial volume either for symmetric or asymmetric structures is still an open and challenging_problem in spa as indicated by the existence of an ample literature on this matter many previous attempts to the initial model problem have been reported on the one hand in the random conical tilt and orthogonal tilt methods the alignment problem is simplified by acquiring micrographs as tilt pairs or by using multiple different tilts with known tilt_angles on the other hand we observe a large variety of methods based on common lines that in principle they allow for an initial model estimation without tilting of the specimen computer generated shapes or reconstructions from one image of a particle assuming a certain symmetry have also been used to define initial volumes another line of research is based on the introduction of a random model strategy based on first assigning random orientations to class averages in this latter case an initial d reconstruction is obtained from these random angular assignments which is finally refined by a projection matching strategy following this approach sanzpresented a random model method that allows ab_initio generation of starting models from raw experimental images several initial models were generated assigning initially a random orientation to each imaged particle recently have presented a method based on a probabilistic initial d model generation procedure which uses projection images instead of class averages furthermore in it presented optimod a method that incorporates multiple automated algorithms for determining orientations using common lines methodologies and at the same time provides criteria for scoring their results this approach generates multiple maps using algorithm specific randomization the initial model problem is still and in spite of the multiple algorithms so_far proposed widely_accepted as a real issue in spa with methods demanding no trivial choices of input_parameters and being computationally_expensive indeed in the way of defining highthroughput approaches in d em we really need fast simple and accurate methods which are indeed the motivation of this to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com work in this way we will describe in detail d ransac presenting its good performance on a wide_range of specimens using the same parameters for all cases making the case of simplicity and obtaining final results in a matter of minutes on a typical laptop computer our proposed approach consists in a novel random modelling strategy based on an initial dimensionality_reduction method together with the ransac algorithm which makes this approach efficient from a computational point_of the method can be used to produce lowresolution initial volumes of symmetric or asymmetric biological complexes in this section we provide results obtained with simulated and experimental_data that show the effectiveness of the proposed method
