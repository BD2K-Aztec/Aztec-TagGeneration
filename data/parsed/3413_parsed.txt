genome_analysis pangp a tool for quickly analyzing bacterial pan_genome profile pan_genome analyses have shed light on the dynamics and evolution of bacterial_genome from the point of population the explosive_growth of bacterial genome_sequence also brought an extremely big_challenge to pan_genome profile analysis we developed a tool named pangp to complete pan_genome profile analysis for large_scale strains efficiently pangp has integrated two sampling algorithms totally random tr and distance guide dg the dg algorithm drew sample strain combinations on the basis of genome diversity of bacterial_population the performance of these two algorithms have been evaluated on four bacteria populations with strain numbers varying from to and the dg algorithm exhibited overwhelming advantage on accuracy and stability than the tr algorithm availability pangp was developed with a user_friendly graphic interface and it was available at http pangp since the conception pan_genome was introduced in pan_genome had shed light on the genomic_diversity and evolution of bacterial_genome to make pangenome analyses more expediently several software_tools were designed panseq could identify single_nucleotide on core_genome and strains specific region and pgap was designed to perform five analytic functions with only one command at the same time a series of mathematic models had been proposed to characterize pangenome profile of bacteria such as the streptococcus_agalactiae pan_genome model the haemophilus_influenzae pan_genome model heaps law model and infinitely many genes model all current models could well depict the pan_genome profile of a launch of bacteria with their time complexity o n n where n is the strain number in this article we developed two sampling algorithms to efficiently perform pan_genome profile analysis for larger scale genomes these two algorithms were integrated in the software with a graphic interface pangp
