sequence_analysis adjusting scoring_matrices to correct overextended alignments motivation sequence_similarity performed with blast ssearch and fasta achieve high_sensitivity by using scoring_matrices e g blosum that target low identity alignments although such scoring_matrices can effectively_identify distant homo logs they can also produce local_alignments that extend beyond the homologous regions results we measured local_alignment start stop boundary accuracy using a set of queries where the correct alignment boundaries were known and found that of blastp and of ssearch alignment boundaries were overextended overextended alignments include non homologous_sequences they occur most frequently between sequences that are more closely_related identity adjusting the scoring_matrix to reflect the identity of the homologous_sequence can correct higher identity overextended alignment boundaries in addition the scoring_matrix that produced a correct alignment could be reliably predicted based on the sequence_identity seen in the original blosum alignment realigning with the predicted scoring_matrix corrected of all overextended alignments resulting in more correct alignments than using blosum alone availability refprotdom rpd sequences and the fasta software are available from http faculty virginia edu wrpearson fasta sequence similarity_search algorithms are used to identify evolutionary homologs and to generate hypotheses for the function of unknown_proteins these algorithms assign homology between sequences achieving statistically_significant similarity_scores with high_fidelity even between highly_divergent sequences sharing low similarity however the same methodology that provides for the sensitive identification of homology at low identity can also lead to alignments that include non homologous_sequence adjacent to or between higher identity homologous_sequences homologous overextension was first identified as a source of error during iterative similarity_searches overextension occurs when alignments extend past the boundaries of the homologous_region in the library query or both sequences leading to the inclusion of non homologous_sequence in an alignment the inclusion of non homologous_sequence has been identified in alignments between highly identical dna_sequences and has been termed the mosaic effect overextension occurs because local sequence_alignment boundaries depend on the scoring_matrix the popular blastp tool along with other sequence_alignment tools e g ssearch and fasta creates local_alignments between similar sequences using scoring_matrices scoring_matrices assign a similarity_score to each pair of aligned amino_acids based on the probability that the amino_acid transition has occurred more often through evolution than by chance amino_acid that are common through evolution are assigned high similarity_scores whereas rare replacements are assigned negative scores scoring_matrices have an implicit evolutionary model which allows different matrices to target different evolutionary_distances scoring_matrices that target long evolutionary times deep scoring_matrices allow more amino_acid and gaps whereas shallower matrices favor higher sequence_identity and have higher gap penalties the scoring_matrix dictates the local_alignment boundaries increasing or decreasing the length of the optimal local_alignment reduces the total alignment score likewise changing the scoring_matrix can result in a different alignment ideally a local_alignment of homologous domains in different sequence contexts will align every residue in the homologous_region and no residues outside the domain boundaries so that the alignment boundaries reflect the domain boundaries overextended alignments include additional sequence from outside the homologous domain boundaries for example inartificial randomly shuffled sequence from the query appears to be homologous to a real protein in this article we show that scoring_matrices have preferred alignment identities and alignment lengths and that blosum can produce overextended alignments most often between sequences with identity we also show that using the correct scoring_matrix can produce more accurate alignment boundaries finally we show that we can produce more accurate alignment boundaries even without true domain boundary knowledge by using the initial blosum alignment identity to specify a more appropriate scoring_matrix mismatches between the sequence_identity of aligned homologous domains and the target identity of the scoring_matrix used to produce the local sequence_alignment can lead to overextended alignments figs and similarity scoring_matrices have preferred alignment lengths and identity deep scoring_matrices create longer alignments and have lower target identity compared with shallower matrices alignments created by blosum most often between sequences with higher identity can extend past the boundaries of the homologous domain to include non homologous_sequence using a shallower scoring_matrix that targets the correct sequence_identity can correct overextension predicting the scoring_matrix that will lead to a better alignment using initial possibly overextended identity given by blosum can correct overextended alignments in our rpd database of overextended alignments were corrected to within ae residues or of the alignments with high enough identity to be considered for realignment however realignment has a cost a fraction of correctly aligned domains are incompletely realigned the observation that deep scoring_matrices produce overextended alignments between domains that are less evolutionarily distant have higher identity than the scoring_matrix target identity is not surprising though the relationship between alignment boundaries in contrast to internal alignment_accuracy and scoring_matrices has not been extensively_studied traditional internal alignment_accuracy decreases as evolutionary distance increases different sequences are difficult to align accurately in contrast alignment overextension occurs most often when closely_related sequences are aligned and thus becomes more frequent as sequence_databases grow as log odds matrices every scoring_matrix has a target evolutionary distance or percent identity which can be approximated from the homologous replacement frequencies that are the numerator of the log odds_ratio as evolutionary distance and the number of replacements increase the replacement frequencies for identities decrease and the non identical replacement frequencies increase which reduces the target identity of the matrix when aligning random_sequences overextension occurs when a scoring_matrix that models a longer period of evolution a deeper scoring_matrix by allowing more mutations is used to align sequences with less evolutionary_change a deep scoring_matrix produces a less identical alignment because it accepts more amino_acid gap penalties also modify alignment_length and identity increased gap penalties produce shorter higher identity alignments whereas lower gap penalties produce longer lower identity alignments lower mismatch penalties and lower gap penalties in deep matrices allow the local_alignment algorithm to add additional identities that are occurring by chance from non homologous_sequence for the sake of modest increases in score thus in of the score was produced by of the alignment overextended alignments are locally optimal but they are not biologically correct rpd was designed to simulate the most common similarity searchsearches against full_length proteins in a comprehensive sequence database rpd sequences were selected from the set of sequences annotated by pfam release which samples both swissprot and trembl protein_sequences the rpd library is large sequences and diverse queries were engineered from long residues protein_domains allowing blosum searches to identify distant homologs these domains are surrounded by shuffled protein_sequence providing known alignment boundaries alignments that extend into the flanking random_sequence are thus guaranteed to be nonhomologous our initial searches with independent embedded domain queries produced both incomplete alignments blastp ssearch both with blosum and overextended alignments blastp ssearch incomplete alignments reflect the reduced sensitivity of pairwise_alignment compared with the hmm based_methods used to annotate the pfam domains in rpd and the fact that in the diverse set of homologous rpd domains half of the detectable homologs share_sequence in characterizing alignment boundaries in the query domain searches we consider far more distant alignments than would typically be examined during the genome annotation_process where sequences sharing at least identity might be used to transfer annotation restricting the analysis to the top significant hits for each query increases the median alignment identity to which in turn decreases incomplete alignments to and increases the overextension to restricting the analysis to the top homologs further decreases incomplete alignment to whereas increasing overextension to when the thresholds inare used to correct thetop alignments for each query overextension is corrected of the time whereas incomplete alignments are produced only about of the time for the top overextension is corrected of the time whereas alignments become incomplete only of the time we believe our estimates of alignment overextension of alignments are conservative both because sequence_databases are growing allowing similarity_searches to identify closer homologs and because many proteins comprise multiple domains in this study we examine alignment overextension from a single domain many proteins contain multiple domains separated by non homologous regions proteins that contain multiple widely dispersed common domains like ankyrin fn or sh_domains will have many more chances to overextend across non homologous regions although we understand why high identity alignments might overextend when aligned with low targetidentity scoring_matrices like blosum matrix targetidentity mismatch only accounts for about half of the overextensions we observed in our diverse sequence set of overextensions occur in alignments that are identical unfortunately we cannot predict which lower identity alignments will overextend the amount of overextension does not correlate well with the difference between alignment identity and scoring_matrix target identity likewise overextension does not occur significantly more often in domains that have more identity at their ends the increased frequency of overextended boundaries in alignments between high identity sequences is the only meaningful trend that we identified in contrast to high identity overextension where the difference in targetidentity between the homologous_region and the scoring_matrix can explain overextension low identity overextension may simply reflect the propensity of deep matrices to produce long alignments even between unrelated sequences the long alignments inare not statistically_significant but when they occur by chance near a low identity homologous domain they can contribute to overextension overextension occurs more frequently in higher identity alignments because of targetidentity mismatch but the majority of overextension we measured occurs by chance in low identity alignments because most of our alignments are low identity in this study we have focused on overextension in pairwise_alignments because pairwise similarity_searches are widely used to annotate newly_sequenced alignment overextension also occurs with model based searches like psi_blast we initially identified overextension as the major cause of model contamination with psi_blast our strategy for reducing overextensionre alignment with a more correct scoring matrixis most easily applied to pairwise_alignment because a traditional nonposition specific scoring_matrix like blosum or vt has an easily characterized target identity and the alignment between two sequences has a natural evolutionary distance it is more difficult_to the distance between a sequence and a position_specific or hmm and it is unclear how such models might be scaled to reduce overextension the expansion of modern protein databases has led to an increase in the identification of higher identity homologs accurate function prediction requires a higher_level of sequence_identity and an accurate alignment two factors that are at odds with deep scoring_matrices with modern comprehensive databases it is common to identify many homologs that are identical in our diverse rpd protein set the median sequence_identity for the top homologs was much higher than the target identity range for blosum with more high identity homologs and increased sequence and structural annotation pairwise_alignments can provide essential insights to the function of novel proteins but only if the alignment boundaries are accurate
