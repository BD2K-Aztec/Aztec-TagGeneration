gene_expression profilechaser searching microarray repositories based on genome_wide patterns of differential_expression we introduce profilechaser a web_server that allows for querying the gene_expression based on genome_wide patterns of differential_expression using a novel content based_approach profilechaser retrieves expression_profiles that match the differentially_regulated transcriptional_programs in a user supplied experiment this analysis_identifies statistical links to similar expression experiments from the vast_array of publicly_available data on diseases drugs phenotypes and other experimental_conditions the introduction of the dna_microarray and other genome level technologies has provided an unprecedented systems level view of cellular transcription this detailed characterization of gene_expression provides a unique_opportunity for data_driven discovery of connections between biological conditions and phenotypes past work has demonstrated the utility of gene_expression based discovery in predicting the mechanisms of genetic and chemical perturbations and linking drugs and diseases even when integrating data across different platforms and cell_types while these studies have demonstrated the power of gene_expression based_approaches to biological hypothesis_generation few tools exist to exploit the primary molecular data cataloged in repositories such as the gene_expression geo here we introduce profilechaser a web_server that allows for content based gene_expression search with a user supplied experiment our tool mines geo datasets for experiments that differentially regulate the same transcriptional_programs profilechaser provides an accessible and powerful interface for leveraging public data to inform new to whom correspondence should be addressed experiments and predict novel associations between diseases drugs genotypes and phenotypes to illustrate the utility of our method we queried profilechaser to find experiments that resemble the treatment of mcf_breast with estradiol the natural ligand of estrogen_receptor gds the top matching comparisons included several variations of this experiment performed by separate groups supplementary in addition profilechaser identified other experimental contexts involving hormone_induced proliferation including cytotoxic t cell response to interleukin gds and primary prostate response to testosterone treatment gds an examination of significant genes confirmed that proliferation linked these biological conditions in the comparison of gds with gds for instance the second most significant gene encoded ki the canonical proliferation marker supplementary next we used the comparison of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic breast cancer_cells gds to identify compounds that might specifically target these cell_subpopulations supplementary the comparison of dasatinib resistant versus dasatinib sensitive prostate_cancer scored significantly suggesting that tumorigenic breast cancer_cells might be sensitive to this src inhibitor treating basal breast_cancer with dasatinib significantly_decreases the proportion of aldh positive tumorigenic cells supporting this hypothesis finally we recently used these methods to search geo for datasets that resembled the comparison of neural_stem from wild_type and foxo mice we identified four matching profiles that linked foxo to hypoxia a relationship validated by recent experimental work with our collaborators thus experiments retrieved by profilechaser provide statistical_evidence for associations that may be verified by further experimental or computational_analyses profilechaser comparisons are defined by geo annotations and thus interpretation of results may not be straightforward in particular experimental_designs with multiple factors may confound analysis supplementary subset names assigned by geo may also be misleading to properly interpret results users should examine the design of each experiment using the geo web_interface and references therein profilechaser cannot take advantage of potential paired sample information and de profiles generated from the same experiment are not independent since they contain overlapping samples finally users should note that the absence of a positive result does not imply that two conditions are unrelated the ability to query geo based on differential_expression will allow for the identification of new associations between diseases drugs genotypes and phenotypes future work will expand profilechaser to incorporate other sources of gene_expression data including european_bioinformatics arrayexpress
