genome_analysis cisgenome browser a flexible tool for genomic_data visualization we present an open_source platform independent tool called cisgenome browser which can work together with any other data analysis program to serve as a flexible component for genomic_data visualization it can also work by itself as a standalone genome_browser by working as a lightweight web_server cisgenome browser is a convenient tool for data_sharing between labs it has features that are specifically_designed for ultra high_throughput sequencing_data visualization for the past_decade the advent_of technologies such as microarrays and the more recent ultra high_throughput have given rise to fruitful research on large_scale genomic_data analysis as a result numerous software_tools have been developed and widely used since genomic_data is usually very large and complex visualization_tools are always essential for data examination and interpretation there are two major approaches for genomic_data visualization one approach is to provide built in data visualization components together with data analysis tools a typical example is dnachip analyzer dchip whose convenient visualization functions contribute greatly to its popularity this type of approach usually gives the best user experience since the data visualization components are specifically_designed for the results that are generated by the data analysis tools they can work together seamlessly however only a small fraction of data analysis tools have built in visualization components because the programming of a good visualization component requires expertise and is also often very time consuming for these reasons most of the data analysis tools use the second approach where the programs generate output_files in specific formats that can subsequently be imported and visualized by external data visualization_tools such as affymetrix integrated genome_browser analyzed by graphical data analysis environments such as excel matlab or r or uploaded onto web_based browsers e g ucsc_genome all these approaches require additional operations or even programming to load and examine the data if uploading the data onto a web_based browser the transfer of a large to whom correspondence should be addressed amount of data via the internet is often a bottleneck limiting the ability of researchers to examine their data thoroughly to better facilitate genomic_data visualization we present a flexible genomic_data visualization_tool called cisgenome browser which has a specifically_designed feature besides being manually operated by a user it can also be easily controlled by a third_party program regardless of the programming_language in which the thirdparty program is written this feature makes cisgenome browser a flexible and universal data visualization_tool any data analysis tool can simply output its results in formats that cisgenome browser can interpret and then calls cisgenome browser to visually present the results to the users the whole procedure can be made automatic and transparent which gives the illusion to the users that the data analysis program and cisgenome browser work together as a single piece of software
