gene_expression global modeling of transcriptional_responses in interaction networks motivation cell biological_processes are regulated through a complex network of interactions between genes and their products the processes their activating conditions and the associated tran scriptional responses are often unknown organism wide modeling of network activation can reveal unique and shared mechanisms between tissues and potentially as yet unknown processes the same method can also be applied to cell biological conditions in one or more tissues results we introduce a novel approach for organism wide discovery and analysis of transcriptional_responses in interaction networks the method searches for local connected regions in a network that exhibit coordinated transcriptional_response in a subset of tissues known interactions between genes are used to limit the search_space and to guide the analysis validation on a human pathway network reveals physiologically coherent responses functional relatedness between tissues and coordinated context specific regulation of the genes availability implementation is freely_available in r and matlab atcoordinated activation and inactivation of genes through molecular_interactions determines cell function changes in cell biological conditions induce changes in the expression levels of co regulated_genes in order to produce specific physiological_responses a huge body of information concerning cell biological_processes is available in public_repositories including gene ontologies pathway_models regulatory information and protein interactions less is known about the contexts in which these processes are activated and how individual processes are reflected in gene_expression although gene_expression provide only an indirect view to physiological_processes their wide to whom correspondence should be addressed availability provides a unique resource for investigating gene coregulation on a genome and organism wide scale this allows the detection of transcriptional_responses that are shared by multiple tissues suggesting shared physiological mechanism with potential biomedical implications as demonstrated by the connectivity_map where a number of chemical perturbations on a cancer cell_line were used to reveal shared transcriptional_responses between conditions to enhance screening of therapeutic_targets in this work we study transcriptional_responses of different tissues but the same methods can be directly used for modeling sets of cellular conditions within a single or multiple tissues as well transcriptional_responses have been modeled using so_called gene_expression a signature describes a co expression state of the genes associated with particular physiological_states well characterized signatures have proven to be accurate biomarkers in clinical_trials and hence reliable indicators of cells physiological_state disease associated signatures are often coherent across tissues or platforms commercial signatures are available for routine_clinical nuyten and van and other applications have been suggested recently the established signatures are typically designed to provide optimal classification_performance between two particular conditions the problem with the classification based signatures is that their associations to the underlying physiological_processes are not well understood our goal is to enhance the understanding by deriving transcriptional signatures that are explicitly connected to well characterized processes through the network we introduce and validate a novel approach for organismwide discovery and analysis of transcriptional_response patterns in interaction networks our algorithm has been designed to detect and model local_regions in a network each of which exhibits coordinated transcriptional_response in a subset of measurements in this study the method is applied to investigate transcriptional_responses of the network across a versatile collection of tissues across normal human_body the algorithm is independent of predefined classifications for genes or tissues organism wide analysis can reveal unique and shared mechanisms between disparate tissues and potentially as yet unknown processes the proposed netresponse algorithm provides an efficient model based tool for simultaneous feature_selection and class_discovery that utilizes known interactions between genes to guide the analysis related approaches include cmonkey and a modified_version of samba biclustering organism wide analysis of transcriptional_responses in a human pathway interaction_network reveals physiologically coherent activation patterns and tissue_specific regulation one of the subnetworks and its tissue_specific responses as detected by the netresponse algorithm is shown the expression of each gene is visualized with respect to its mean level of expression across all samples however these are application oriented tools that rely on additional organism specific information and their implementation is currently not available for most organisms including human we provide a general_purpose algorithm whose applicability is not limited to particular organisms netresponse makes it possible to perform data_driven identification of functionally coherent network_components and their tissue_specific responses this is useful since the commonly used alternatives predefined gene_sets or pathways are collections of intertwined processes rather than coherent functional entities this has complicated their use in gene_expression analysis and methods have consequently been suggested to identify the key condition responsive_genes of predefined gene_sets or to decompose predefined pathways into smaller functional_modules represented by gene_expression our network based search_procedure detects the coordinately_regulated gene_sets in a data_driven manner gene_expression provides functional information of the network that is missing in purely graph oriented approaches for studying cell biological_networks the network brings in prior information of gene function and connects the responses more closely to known processes than purely gene_expression based_methods such as biclustering subspace clustering or other feature_selection approaches a key difference to previous network based clustering_methods including matisse and related approaches is that they assume a single correlated response between all genes in a module netresponse additionally models tissue_specific responses of the network this allows a more expressive definition of a functional module or a signature we validate the algorithm by modeling transcriptional_responses in a human pathway interaction_network across an organism wide collection of tissues in normal human_body the results highlight functional relatedness between tissues providing a global view on cell biological_network activation patterns the validation results reported below demonstrate that the netresponse algorithm is readily_applicable for modeling transcriptional_responses in interaction networks on an organism wide scale while biomedical implications of the findings require further investigation netresponse detects a number of physiologically coherent and reproducible transcriptional_responses in the network and highlights functional relatedness between tissues it also outperformed the comparison methods in terms of reproducibility of the findings cell biological_networks may cover thousands of genes but any change in the physiological context typically affects only a small part of the network while gene function and interactions are often subject to context specific regulation they are typically studied only in particular experimental_conditions organism wide analysis could reveal highly_specialized functions that are activated only in one or a few tissues detection of shared responses between the tissues can reveal previously_unknown functional_connections and help to formulate novel hypotheses of gene function in previously unexplored contexts we provide a well defined algorithm for such analysis the results support the validity of the model netresponse detected the largest number of responses without compromising physiological coherence or reproducibility of the findings compared with the alternatives the most highly_reproducible results were obtained by netresponse further analysis is needed to establish the physiological role of the findings netresponse is readily_applicable for modeling tissue_specific responses in cell biological_networks including pathways protein interactions and regulatory_networks the network connects the responses to well characterized processes and provides readily interpretable results that are less biased toward known biological_phenomena than methods based on predefined gene_sets that are routinely used in gene_expression studies to bring in prior information of gene function and to increase_statistical however these are often collections of intertwined processes rather than coherent functional entities for example pathways from kegg may contain hundreds of genes while only a small part of a pathway may be affected by changes in physiological_conditions this has complicated the use of predefined gene_sets in gene_expression studies demonstrated that taking_into aspects of pathway topology such as gene and interaction types can improve the estimation of pathway activity while their spia algorithm measures the activity of known pathways between two predefined conditions our algorithm searches for potentially unknown functional_modules and detects their association to multiple conditions or tissues simultaneously this is useful since biomedical pathways are human made descriptions of cellular_processes often consisting of smaller partially independent modules our data_driven search_procedure can rigorously identify functionally coherent network modules where the interacting genes show coordinated responses joint modeling increases statistical_power that is useful since gene_expression and many interaction data types such as proteinprotein_interactions have high noise levels the probabilistic formulation accounts for biological and measurement noise in a principled manner certain types of interaction data such as transcription_factor binding or protein interactions are directly based on measurements this can potentially help to discover as yet unknown processes that are not described in the pathway_databases false_negative interactions form a limitation for the current model because joint responses of co regulated_genes can be modeled only when they form a connected subnetwork the need for principled methods for analyzing large_scale collections of gene_expression data is increasing with their availability versatile gene_expression atlases contain valuable information about shared and unique mechanisms between disparate tissues which is not available in smaller and more specific experiments for example demonstrated that large_scale screening of cell_lines under diverse conditions can enhance the finding of therapeutic_targets our model is directly applicable in similar exploratory tasks providing tools for organism wide analysis of transcriptional_activity in normal_human cancer and other diseases in a genome and organism wide scale similar collections are available for several model_organisms including mouse yeast and plants a key_advantage of our approach compared with methods that perform targeted comparisons between predefined conditions is that it allows systematic organism wide investigation when the responses and the associated tissues are unknown the motivation is similar to samba and other biclustering approaches that detect groups of genes that show coordinated response in a subset of tissues but the network ties the findings more tightly to cell biological_processes in our model this can focus the analysis and improve interpretability since the non parametric mixture_model adjusts model_complexity with sample_size our algorithm is potentially applicable also in smaller and more targeted datasets for example it could potentially advance disease subtype discovery by revealing differential network activation in subsets of patients
