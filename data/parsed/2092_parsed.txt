sequence_analysis golgip prediction of golgi resident proteins in plants we present a novel golgi prediction server golgip for computational_prediction of both membrane and non membrane associated golgi resident proteins in plants we have employed a support_vector based classification_method for the prediction of such golgi proteins based on three types of information dipeptide composition transmembrane_domain s tmds and functional_domain s of a protein where the functional_domain information is generated through searching against the conserved domains database and the tmd information includes the number of tmds the length of tmd and the number of tmds at the n terminus of a protein using golgip we have made genome_scale predictions of golgi resident proteins in plant_genomes and have made the preliminary_analysis of the predicted data availability the golgip web_service is publically available atthe golgi_apparatus is an essential cellular organelle found in most if not all eukaryotic_cells serving as an intermediate station of the secretory_pathway that transports proteins out of a cell besides golgi is also a major site for protein post_translational e g glycosylation and synthesis of various polysaccharides the plant_cell are mainly comprised of lignins glycosylated proteins and polysaccharides most of which are synthesized in golgi identification of the golgi resident proteins represents a very challenging and a highly important problem for the understanding of the biological_processes taking_place in golgi although there are mouse and human golgi resident proteins identified only a little over plant golgi proteins have been experimentally_identified a key challenging issue is that plant golgi proteins do not seem to have obvious targeting signals as proteins targeted at other cellular_compartments such as nucleus or extra_cellular space most of the existing computational_tools for subcellular_localization predictions are designed for the general subcellular_localization prediction and their predictions for golgiresident proteins are less than adequate only one program has been specifically_designed for the prediction to whom correspondence should be addressed of golgi localized proteins but it focuses only on transmembrane golgi proteins the issue is that only of golgi proteins of arabidopsis_thaliana are estimated to contain transmembrane_regions indicating the inadequacy of the current programs based on this consideration we have designed a support_vector svm based_classifier called golgip to predict both golgi localized transmembrane_proteins and non transmembrane_proteins golgip currently provides multiple models for predicting plant golgi proteins based on the specific needs of a user the performances are sorted by mcc
