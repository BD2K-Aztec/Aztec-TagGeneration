genome_analysis detection of active transcription_factor with the combination of dnase hypersensitivity and histone_modifications motivation the identification of active transcriptional regulatory_elements is crucial to understand regulatory_networks driving cellular_processes such as cell development and the onset of diseases it has recently been shown that chromatin_structure information such as dnase_i dhs or histone_modifications significantly_improves cell specific predictions of transcription_factor however no method has so_far successfully combined both dhs and histone_modification data to perform active binding_site results we propose here a method based on hidden_markov to integrate dhs and histone_modifications occupancy for the detection of open_chromatin and active binding_sites we have created a framework that includes treatment of genomic signals model training and genome wide_application in a comparative_analysis our method obtained a good trade_off between sensitivity versus specificity and superior area under the curve statistics than competing_methods moreover our technique does not require further training or sequence_information to generate binding location predictions therefore the method can be easily applied on new cell_types and allow flexible downstream_analysis such as de_novo motif_finding transcriptional_regulation orchestrates the proper temporal and spatial expression of genes the identification of transcriptional regulatory_elements such as transcription_factor tfbss is crucial to understand regulatory_networks driving cellular_processes such as cell development and the onset of diseases the standard approach is the use of sequence_based bioinformatics_methods which search over the genome for motif predicted binding_sites mpbss representing the dna_binding sequence of a transcription_factor tf this binding_affinity is usually represented by models such as position_weight pwms however motifs are generally short and have low information content moreover the presence of a sequence_motif does not imply actual tf_binding in that particular cell_type as a result sequence_based return myriads of putative tfbss of which only a small fraction is functional in a particular context chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq allows the detection of tfbss in vivo on a genomewide level however success of chip_seq assays depends on the existence of a good antibody against the tfs of interest and on the availability of large_numbers of cells these two conditions are not always met in particular for primary cells therefore chip_seq based studies are restricted to the analysis of a small selection of tfs and cell_types or require the effort of large consortia encode_project another solution is to explore the fact that an open chromatin_structure is crucial and a prerequisite to the cell_type binding of a tf to dna for example regions with histone_modification marks h_k and h_k highlight active promoter and enhancer_elements more detailed studies have demonstrated that active tfbss occur between two regions with high active histone_marks peak dip peak pattern a classical method to detect active regulatory_elements dnase_i has also been recently combined with sequencing to indicate open_chromatin on a genome_wide scale dnase_seq allows the identification of putative active tfbss at base_pair level resolution i e bp regions within two dnase_seq peaks represent the so_called footprints where tfs are likely to be bound while dnase_seq returns the exact position where dna was nicked by dnase_i enzyme chip_seq returns sequences centered on the protein to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com interacting with dna therefore dnase_seq gives a more precise estimate of open chromatin than histone_modification chip_seq as reflected in the sharpness of the signal of dnaseseq in comparison with h_k chip_seq signal see a recent evaluation of dnase_seq on cell_types indicated that dnase_i digestion patterns describe the topology of protein dna_binding interfaces and allowed the finding of novel motifs several computational_approaches explore open chromatin evidence from chip_seq or dnase_i dhs sites to restrict the search_space of sequence_based analysis they show a clear advantage in detecting active tfbss as indicated by chip_seq evidence in comparison with pure sequence_based methods for detection of active tfbss can be categorized in two main classes site centric cuellar and centipede and segmentation based boyle neph and hmms site centric approaches require the identification of all mpbss of a given tf to classify them as active or inactive one advantage of the latter methods is that they have an ideal spatial specificity on the other hand they require sequence binding_affinity information pwm of the tfs to be known a priori on the other hand segmentationbased approaches can be used for de_novo motif_detection previous_studies that footprints allowed the automatic creation of high_sensitivity tf models and the discovery of hundreds of novel motifs such studies would benefit from segmentation based_methods with good spatial specificity moreover segmentationbased methods tend to reduce computational_complexity as they decrease drastically the genomic space used for motif_detection however it is important to mention that the interpretation of such reduced genomic space would still require knowledge of proteins binding sequence affinity while centipede obtained good auc results the methods performance was too dependent on regularization parameters moreover for large input_files tfs with a large number of pwm hits the method required up to days core of computing and gb of memory on a single tf and cellular condition the most computational expensive segmentation_method dhhmm requires days core for predicting footprints and active binding_sites over all tfs from jaspar in one cell_type another important aspect is the proposed combined use of dhs and histone_modifications shapes around the tfbss cuellar method is based on obtaining read_counts around the tfbss clearly such method cannot take the local shape profiles into account for example it cannot distinguish the dhs peaks with the footprint signals and would detect any tfbs inside a region with high dhs levels as the regions indicated in our experimental_results the poor_specificity of the method while centipede used the local profiles of the dhs signal it used simple read_count statistics for the histone_modification signals therefore it is unable to detect the valley shapes indicated in not surprisingly no improvements were possible with the use of histone_modifications using centipede as indicated in pique the dhhmm model could show improved results by using the local profiles of dhs and histone_modification signals moreover dh hmm footprints cover a higher percentage of dhs regions than other segmentation based_methods recent_studies have also indicated that the histone_modification profiles centered on dhs sites can be clustered and these clusters can also have asymmetric shapes where there is lower evidence of histone_marks downstream or upstream of the dhs we have also tested variants of the dh hmm to capture such asymmetric signals but no significant_improvement was obtained as show in supplementary the slope signals have high values changes even on low histone_modification values and are responsible for the correct characterization of such asymmetric peaks lastly the hmms displayed robustness in the training evaluation on distinct cell_types this indicates that no further training of the hmms and time intensive manual_annotation of genomic_regions are required this is achieved by addressing both within and between dataset variability with our normalization pipeline
