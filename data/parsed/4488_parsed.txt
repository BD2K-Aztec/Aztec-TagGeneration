svdetect a tool to identify genomic structural_variations from paired_end and mate_pair sequencing_data we present svdetect a program designed to identify genomic structural_variations from paired_end and mate_pair next_generation data produced by the illumina ga and abi solid platforms applying both sliding_window and clustering strategies we use anomalously mapped read_pairs provided by current short_read to localize genomic_rearrangements and classify them according to their type e g large insertions_deletions inversions duplications and balanced or unbalanced inter chromosomal_translocations svdetect outputs predicted structural_variants in various file_formats for appropriate graphical visualization availability source_code and sample data are available atthe identification of genomic structural_variations is a key_step in understanding human genetic_diversity and evolution as well as disease_etiology numerous genetic_diseases including cancer have been associated with structural_variants although array based techniques have been successful in many studies for detecting svs the relatively low_resolution in the detection of breakpoints and the characterization of small svs remained challenging with the arrival of high_throughput such as the illumina_genome or the applied_biosystems solid system using short insert pairedend or mate paired_reads referred here as paired ends has improved our ability to detect svs with a priori information from paired ends such as order orientation and insert_size of pairs as constraints during read_alignment to the reference_genome anomalously mapped pairs indicate potential genomic_variations from the reference the need for algorithms specifically_designed for sv prediction from paired_end pem data has recently led to the development of new software_packages including to whom correspondence should be addressed gasv breakdancer and others see review here we present a new freely_available program called svdetect for sv_detection and type prediction from pem data svdetect identifies different types of svs e g large insertionsdeletions and inversions with both clustering and sliding_window strategies and helps to visualize them at the genomic_scale compared to other tools the novelty of our method consists in its multiple ability to i analyze both paired_end and mate_pair sequencing_data ii use unique pem constraints to improve sv_detection iii predict various types of tandem_duplication and to distinguish between balanced and unbalanced rearrangements iv compare svs across multiple samples v construct copy_number profiles and vi create various output file_formats for graphical views of sv
