systems_biology biographer web_based editing and rendering of sbgn compliant biochemical_networks motivation the rapid accumulation of knowledge in the field of systems_biology during the past_years requires advanced but simple to use methods for the visualization of information in a struc tured and easily comprehensible manner results we have developed biographer a web_based renderer and editor for reaction_networks which can be integrated as a library into tools dealing with network related information our software enables visualizations based on the emerging standard systems_biology it is able to import networks encoded in various formats such as sbml sbgn ml and jsbgn a custom lightweight exchange format the core package is implemented in html css and javascript and can be used within any kind of web_based project it features interactive graph editing tools and automatic graph layout algorithms in addition we provide a standalone graph editor and a web_server which contains enhanced features like web_services for the import and export of models and visualizations in different formats availability the biographer tool can be used at and downloaded from the web_page http biographer biologie hu berlin de the different software_packages including a server indepenent version as well as a web_server for windows and linux based systems are available atthe web_resource pathguide currently lists databases for pathway diagrams of biochemical_reaction each using different means of visualization and containing at least a two digit number of network graphs although other scientific areas have used universal visual languages for decades e g circuit diagrams in electrical engineering or uml in software engineering systems_biology was missing unified network visualizations until the introduction of the systems_biology sbgn sbgn provides standardized glyphs for the representation of cellular_networks in three different languages activity flow diagrams depicting the flow of information through a network entity relationship diagrams showing possible interactions of network_components and process descriptions pd highlighting the temporal_order of such interactions all of which are fully supported by biographer several tools supporting sbgn compliant visualization are already available however they suffer from limitations desktop applications like celldesigner pathvisio van and sbgn ed require the user to install them in their operating system creating a barrier for their initial use web_based visualization_tools do not provide ready to use libraries e g reactome and or do not adhere to representation standards e g kegg such libraries would be of great help in the development of novel tools supporting sbgn compliant visualizations the libsbgn van enables basic manipulations of sbgn ml files a textbased exchange format for sbgn graphics but it does not provide methods for interactive_visualizations the biographer project is trying to address these needs by providing an open_source web_based sbgn renderer and editor it includes a web_service for rendering sbgn and a core library based on html that can easily be integrated into other tools and web resources our software has been tested within different environments and works in up to date browsers like firefox and chrome
