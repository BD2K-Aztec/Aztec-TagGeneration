structural_bioinformatics improving structure alignment based prediction of scop families using vorolign kernels motivation the slow_growth of expert curated databases compared to experimental databases makes it necessary to build upon highly_accurate automated processing pipelines to make the most of the data until curation becomes available we address this problem in the context of protein_structures and their classification into structural and functional_classes more specifically the structural_classification of proteins scop structural alignment_methods like vorolign already provide good classification results but effectively work in a nearest_neighbor mode model based in contrast to instance based_approaches so_far have been shown to be of limited values due to small classes arising in such classification_schemes results in this article we describe how kernels defined in terms of vorolign scores can be used in svm learning and explore variants of combined instance based and model based learning up to exclusively model based learning our results suggest that kernels based on vorolign scores are effective and that model based learning can yield highly_competitive classification results for the prediction of scop families availability the code is made available at http wwwkramer in tum de research applications vorolign kernel with the ever increasing number of known protein_structures the assignment of individual_domains to structural_classes has become a crucial task in computational_biology for this purpose several protein databases like scop and cath have been created over the past_few trying to categorize protein_structures into various hierarchical classes that reflect certain common evolutionary or structural_properties ranging from manual_inspection of protein topologies and sequences to fully_automatic assignment methods they are built upon diverse approaches and employ various criteria and orders of generality to assign the class of a target protein one of the most important and best regarded databases is scop structural_classification of proteins an originally completely to whom correspondence should be addressed manually built hierarchical class structure although a certain degree of automation has been introduced since its first release in order to cope with the heavily increasing number of newly_discovered protein_structures it still features the highest degree of human expert_knowledge this has ambivalent effects on the one hand it has made scop become a point of reference for comparing the quality of protein classification methods in a variety of research_areas and it also comes with the disadvantage of leading to a slow update process since its publication scop followed about an annual release cycle so that novel protein_structures are not available for prediction efforts relying on protein_structure classifications with the introduction of structural alignment_algorithms like vorolign and ppm it was recently shown for comprehensive test_sets that automatic predictions solely relying on structure alignment scores can achieve classification_accuracies beyond for the higher levels of scop and around on the family level another recent method autoscop directly aims at predicting the future scop classification by employing a sequence pattern based filter and vorolign as a plug in and achieved_accuracy also on the family level in the cases those protein similarity_measures have been used as classifiers so_far it has always been in an instance based way i e the structure with the highest similarity was determined and its respective class assigned to the target protein model based machine_learning were assumed not to be suitable as classes with only one or a few members would have to be generalized this is whyrecently introduced a simple classification_scheme called punting which combines models and instance based learning by trying to use models for larger classes and a besthit approach otherwise in the following we not only show how punting can be improved but also introduce a variety of alternatives including one that discards instance based learning altogether their subsequent evaluation leads to classification_accuracies representing statistically_highly improvements over any previous approach used for the same datasets so_far it should still be noted that although this article exclusively uses vorolign as an alignment algorithm and scop families as the prediction target the proposed methods can be applied to basically any structural_similarity measure and classification_problems with small class sizes e g protein_function comparison of scop and cath vorolign was only chosen for its good performance and comparably low computational requirements in the context of structure based scop domain classification we have presented a new practical approach to dealing with indefinite similarity_measures several new ways to integrate both model and instance based learning and showed that even the exclusive use of models is not only possible but also preferable to combinations with a best_hit approach our results for the latter pose statistically_highly increases in accuracy compared to any other method evaluated on the same data so_far future work could further investigate the whole new class of transformations of possibly indefinite similarity_measures into svm compatible kernels the generality of the methods also allows to largely extend their scope of application to e g protein_function furthermore while we cannot rule out the influence of bias arising from the redundancy reduction of the datasets our results indicate that the performance of best_hit on real_world scop test data will substantially and unpredictably change if structural_classes up to a certain size are excluded thus even if models show better accuracy than best_hit for a certain minimal class size this might no longer be the case if this size or the dataset is changed as schemes integrating best_hit and models highly depend on the superiority of models over best_hit for a given minimum class size we argue that their performance in comparison to the exclusive use of best_hit can only be evaluated by shifting this size and using multiple datasets
