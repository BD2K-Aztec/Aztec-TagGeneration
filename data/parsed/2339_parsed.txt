idhs el identifying dnase_i by fusing three different modes of pseudo nucleotide_composition into an ensemble learning framework motivation regulatory_dna are associated with dnase_i dhss accordingly identification of dhss will provide useful insights for in depth investigation into the function of noncoding genomic_regions results in this study using the strategy of ensemble learning framework we proposed a new pre dictor called idhs el for identifying the location of dhs in human_genome it was formed by fusing three individual random_forest rf classifiers into an ensemble predictor the three rf operators were respectively based on the three special modes of the general pseudo nucleotide_composition pseknc i kmer ii reverse complement kmer and iii pseudo dinucleotide composition it has been demonstrated that the new predictor remarkably outperforms the relevant state of the art methods in both accuracy and stability availability_and for the convenience of most experimental scientists a web ser ver for idhs el is established at http bioinformatics hitsz edu cn idhs el which is the first web_server predictor ever established for identifying dhss and by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details we anticipate that idhs el will become a very useful high_throughput tool for genome_analysis in genetics dnase_i dhss are the regions of chromatin that are sensitive to cleavage by the dnase_i enzyme in these specific regions of the genome chromatin has lost its condensed structure as a consequence the corresponding dna region will become more exposing and easier to be accessible by enzymes such as dnase_i and hence enhance its degradation these accessible chromatin zones are functionally_related to transcriptional_activity because of the necessity to bind with proteins such as transcription_factors since its discovery about years_ago dhss have been used as the markers for detecting the regulatory dna regions in general these specific regions are usually nucleosome free and associated with a wide_variety of genomic regulatory_elements such accordingly one effective approach for discovering functional dna elements from the noncoding sequences is to identify dhss the gold_standard approach for identifying dhs is the southern_blot technique but it is a tricky time consuming and inaccurate to acquire the dhs information by using the southern_blot approach in by combining the dnase_i digestion and high_throughput the dnase_seq technique was proposed leading to a remarkable enhance in resolution unfortunately there is no effective methodology for analysing the dnase_seq data therefore one has to resort to the computational_approaches for identifying dhss in fact some efforts have been made in this regard for example proposed a predictor based on the support_vector svm in which the nucleotide_composition was used to formulate the feature_vector for predicting dhss in k cell_line recently by using the pseudo nucleotide_composition pseknc which was developed based on the idea of pseudo amino_acid for proteins feng et_al proposed a more powerful predictor to identify dhss by incorporating both the local and global sequence_order effects of dna although the aforementioned computational_approaches yielded quite encouraging_results and they did stimulate the development of this area some further work is needed due to the following reasons i these existing_methods were based on different features extracted from a dna_sequence and hence lacking the elegance and efficiency of uniform treatment in other words a new framework is needed to combine them into one framework ii none of these methods has ever provided a web_server or stand alone tool and hence their practical usage value is quite limited particularly for the majority of experimental biologists this study was initiated in an attempt to address these shortcomings by developing a more powerful and also more uniform predictor for identifying dhss as manifested in a series of recent_publications to develop a really useful sequence_based statistical predictor for a biological system and also to make the developing process logically clearer and easier to follow according to chous five step guidelines we should make the following five procedures crystal clear i benchmark_dataset ii sample representation iii operation engine iv cross_validation v web_server below let us describe how to deal with these steps one by one
