a folding algorithm for extended rna_secondary motivation rna_secondary contains many non canonical base_pairs of different pair families successful prediction of these structural_features leads to improved secondary_structures with applications in tertiary_structure and simultaneous folding and alignment results we present a theoretical_model capturing both rna pair families and extended secondary_structure motifs with shared nucleotides using diagrams we accompany this model with a number of programs for parameter_optimization and structure_prediction availability all sources optimization routines rna_folding rna evaluation extended secondary_structure visualization are published under the gplv and available at www tbi univie ac at software rnawolf the classical rna_secondary model considers only the watsoncrick au and gc base_pairs as well as the gu wobble pair a detailed analysis of rna d structures however reveals that there are basic families of interactions between the bases all of which appear in nature moreover virtually all known rna_tertiary contain the socalled non watsoncrick base_pairs this has led to the development of an extended presentation of rna contact structures with edges labeled by their pairing type an example can be seen in this extended description of base_pairing is commonly termed after its inventors the leontiswesthof lw representation the lw representation has proved to be a particularly useful means of analyzing d structures of rna as determined by xray crystallography and nmr_spectroscopy in particular it has led to the discovery of recurrent structural_motifs such as kink turns and c loops that act as distinctive building_blocks of d structures the sequence_variation in these structural_motifs follows combinatorial rules that can be understood by the necessity to maintain the overall geometry when base_pairs are exchanged these isostericity rules are discussed in detail by as a new level of rna_structure description the ability to predict non standard base_pairs can be expected to improve the performance of rna_structure furthermore information about evolutionary to whom correspondence should be addressed of the pdb structure dul is shown in a d representation and as a d structure plot displaying the non standard base_pairs in lw representation the four bases highlighted in the d structure form the two base triplets that can be seen in the upper part of the interior loop in the d structure conservation of the isostericity classes of these non standard base_pairs will improve consensus structure_prediction and structuredependent rna gene_finding since many additional interactions beyond the standard base_pairs are represented in the lw formalism what was considered to be a loop in classical secondary_structures can now appear as complex structures of non standard base_pairs these non standard base_pairs effectively divide the long classical loops into much shorter ones proposed a model that contains loops with no more than four unpaired bases for unbranched structures the model is scored using a statistical potential estimated from the available d structures by counting the relative_frequencies of base_pairs short unbranched loops of particular shapes in dependence of their sequences and combinations of loops with a common base_pair an accompanying folding procedure mc fold which exhaustively enumerates stemloop components is available and has been used very successfully as a first step toward the de_novo prediction of rna d structures
