sequence_analysis a novel method for similarity analysis and protein sub cellular_localization prediction motivation biological sequence was regarded as an important study by many biologists because the sequence contains a large number of biological_information what is helpful for scientists studies on biological cells dna and proteins currently many researchers used the method based on protein_sequences in function classification sub cellular_location structure and functional site prediction including some machine_learning the purpose of this article is to find a new way of sequence_analysis but more simple and effective results according to the nature of genetic codes we propose a simple and intuitive d graphical expression of protein_sequences and based on this expression we give a new euclidean_distance method to compute the distance of different sequences for the analysis of sequence_similarity this approach contains more sequence_information a typical phylogenetic_tree constructed based on this method_proved the effectiveness of our approach finally we use this sequence_similarity analysis method to predict protein sub cellular_localization in the two datasets commonly used the results show that the method is reasonable bioinformatics is one of the great frontiers of life_sciences and it is also be one of the core areas of natural science in st_century now many researchers pay their attentions on protein_function classification and sub cellular_localization the methods of such studies classified from the data characteristics include sequencebased methods based on interaction networks functional_domains and so on the sequence_based method has two ways homologous and non homologous the non homologous method is constructing information from the sequence_based on the chemicalphysical characters such as the amino_acid the frequencies of different sub sequences the interval numbers of one sub sequences and so on the homologous based method is mainly analyzing the amino_acid sequence_similarity including the way using the alignment and the way computing the distance of sequences using the mathematical descriptors abstracted from some matrixes based on some graphical_representations the graphical_representation what do not need machine_learning or to whom correspondence should be addressed other complicated computing can provide intuitive picture or useful insights for helping analyzing since many graphical_representations of sequences have been provided in different biological topics such as d d d d graphical_representations of dna_sequences in recent_years many d graphical_representations of proteins have been proposed by randicrandic and others also many condensed matrices were provided such as d d matrix in which entries represent the quotient of the euclidean and the graph_theoretical distance between vertices in d plane l l matrix whose elements are defined as the quotient of the euclidean_distance between a pair of vertices dots of curve and the sum of distances between the same pair of vertices m m m cm and so on based on these matrices many invariants can be obtained for comparison of sequences applying the above methods the researchers have compared the similarities and dissimilarities of sequences also many researchers had used these matrices in constructing phylogenetic_tree in this work we propose a new euclidean_distance computing method based on a new graphical_representation composed basing on genetic codes distribution then we apply this method in protein sub cellular_localization prediction using the similarity comparisons our new graphical_representation is seeking distribution property of amino_acids from the nature of nucleotide triplets as shown in the d distribution of the amino_acids is not unique our method is based on the principles of symmetry and the nearest while using this method in phylogenetic_tree construction we select the sequences of only nine species this nine species has been used in many other articles including dna phylogenetic_tree construction and protein phylogenetic_tree therefore it has a strong representative and biological evolution relations of this nine species are more clearly really we proposed a new formula for computing the distance of sequences which can deal with the sequences with unequal lengths we know that mostly the lengths of sequences are not equal euclidean_distance is easy to miss information or have additional information to add many of the existing distance calculations are obtained special matrixes from the graphical expression and then raised invariants from the matrixes at last calculated distance of the invariants to represent the distance of sequences although those ways can handle the situation of unequal lengths too they need to calculate the matrixes and invariants which are complicated our method is proceeding directly from the graphic expression to obtain the distance between sequences and can effectively deal with the situation of unequal length sequences in the sub cellular_localization many articles used machinelearning methods especially svm method these methods have to set up a training_set part of the dataset to train the model and get the model_parameters and then use the model to test the testing_set therefore this method is computationally_expensive and complex our method uses the distance between sequences to measure the sequence difference the smaller the difference we think they tend to be more consistent with the location information although our results are not as well as some results of machinelearning methods our way just only need to calculate the distance between the sequences which is easy to operate in this article we proposed a new graphical_representation of proteins based on genetic_code distribution we applied this method in the phylogenetic_tree constructing the result of which is consistent with the result got from a multiple_sequence program cluster w then we provided a new distance computing method based on the graphical_representation and its application in the protein sub cellular_localization prediction using the similarity comparisons the results show that our new graphical_representation and new distance are more effective than some methods although not as good as some machine_learning but it is easier because only need to compute the distance not need machine_learning or training however as we can see the result of our method is not the best so in the future_research we would try to improve our method to increase the accuracy and test in many different datasets expecting our method will have general applicability
