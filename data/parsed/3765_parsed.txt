databases_and protocolnavigator emulation based software for the design documentation and reproduction biological_experiments motivation experimental reproducibility is fundamental to the progress of science irreproducible research decreases the efficiency of basic biological_research and drug_discovery and impedes experimental_data reuse a major_contributing to irreproducibility is difficulty in interpreting complex experimental methodologies and designs from written text and in assessing variations among different experiments current bioinformatics initiatives either are focused on computational research reproducibility i e data analysis or laboratory information management systems here we present a software_tool protocolnavigator which addresses the largely overlooked challenges of interpretation and assessment it provides a biologist friendly open_source emulation based tool for designing documenting and reproducing biological_experiments availability_and protocolnavigator was implemented in python using the wx module to build the graphical_user it is a platform independent software and freely_available from http protocolnavigator org index html under the gpl v license although protocolnavigator has been primarily developed for basic cell based research new instruments or materials can be added as per prospective users demand importantly the emulation based documentation and automatic design depiction concept introduced here is applicable across many research environments where practice design and interdisciplinary communication are serious concerns e g clinical_trials or animal_studies by linking practice variation with experimental_data protocolnavigator not only introduces an intuitive mechanism for identifying key_factors for reproducibility but also the foundation to convey best practices in quantitative_terms here cells were seeded in all eight vessels at time h and then labelled with nanoparticles four vessels h later again with corresponding unlabelled control four vessels thereafter data_acquisition was performed on vessels one from fluorescently_labelled and one from control and h post seeding for both scenarios a and b eight flow_cytometer fcs files were acquired of cells exposed to nanoparticles and control for varying numbers of days experiments are available in supplementary_information for download and navigation through protocolnavigator
