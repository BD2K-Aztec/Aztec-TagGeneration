systems_biology a matlab toolbox for structural kinetic_modeling structural kinetic_modeling skm enables the analysis of dynamical_properties of metabolic_networks solely based on topo logical information and experimental_data current skm based experiments are hampered by the time intensive process of assigning model_parameters and choosing appropriate sampling intervals for monte_carlo experiments we introduce a toolbox for the automatic and efficient construction and evaluation of structural kinetic_models sk models quantitative and qualitative_analyses of network stability properties are performed in an automated manner we illustrate the model_building and analysis process in detailed example scripts that provide toolbox implementations of previously published_literature models availability the source_code is freely_available for download atstructural kinetic_modeling skm enables the analysis of dynamical features of metabolic systems in steady_states without requiring the knowledge necessary for the construction of kinetic_models such as kinetic_parameters and reaction_rates instead these properties are derived solely from topological information and experimentally measurable steady_state data in doing so the skm algorithm derives a parameterized version of the systems jacobian matrix in which model_parameters encode the partial derivatives of the reaction_rates around the steady_state once the jacobian matrix is computed for a given set of parameters the evaluation of its eigenvalues indicates whether the steady_state is stable here a simple normalization step enables the restriction of the parameter_values to predefined sampling intervals e g for classical enzyme_kinetics this enables the combination of skm with a monte_carlo approach in which large_numbers of sk models are created using randomly_sampled parameters the resulting jacobian matrices can then be evaluated_quantitatively by counting the proportions of stable and unstable models or qualitatively by analyzing the conditions that lead to such stability or instability qualitative skm analysis can be performed by pairwise_comparisons of the model_parameters leading to stable or unstable states or by machine_learning that search for patterns in the parameter_space the skm experiments presented so_far used customized algorithms in which the sk models had been constructed manually from scratch for each pathway reznik andsegr while this might be sufficient for small systems like in the mentioned examples the construction of sk models for larger systems or even systems of genomic_scale is not feasible manually however its potential to be applied to large_scale systems is a major advantage of skm compared with kinetic_modeling because it does not rely on detailed kinetic knowledge it is well suited for the investigation of large metabolic systems for which only limited or uncertain information about the individual reaction_mechanisms is available here we present a matlab toolbox that enables the automated construction and evaluation of sk models models can be constructed from a minimal input consisting only of the stoichiometric matrix n steady_state concentrations s and the steady_state fluxes v with the experimental_data being obtained from metabolomics and isotope tracing experiments model_parameters can be derived automatically based on the information in n the user can also assign additional model_parameters for example to describe regulatory_interactions or manually manipulate the suggested parameter positions and intervals we illustrate the model_building and analysis process in example scripts that demonstrate the construction of previously published_literature models using the toolbox
