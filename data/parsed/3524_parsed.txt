genetics_and phasing for medical sequencing using rare_variants and large haplotype reference_panels motivation there is growing recognition that estimating haplotypes from high_coverage of single samples in clinical_settings is an important problem at the same time very large_datasets consisting of tens and hundreds of thousands of high coverage sequenced samples will soon be available we describe a method that takes_advantage of these huge human genetic_variation resources and rare_variant sharing patterns to estimate haplotypes on single sequenced samples sharing rare_variants between two individuals is more likely to arise from a recent common_ancestor and hence also more likely to indicate similar shared haplotypes over a substantial flanking region of sequence results our method exploits this idea to select a small set of highly informative copying states within a hidden_markov hmm phasing algorithm using rare_variants in this way allows us to avoid iterative mcmc methods to infer haplotypes compared to other approaches that do not explicitly use rare_variants we obtain significant_gains in phasing accuracy less variation over phasing runs and improvements in speed for example using a reference_panel of haplotypes from the uk k project we are able to reduce switch error_rates by up to when phasing samples sequenced at high coverage in addition a single step rephasing of the uk k panel using rare_variant information has a downstream impact on phasing performance these results represent a proof_of that rare_variant sharing patterns can be utilized to phase large high_coverage studies such as the genomes_project dataset availability_and a webserver that includes an implementation of this new method and allows phasing of high coverage clinical samples is available at https phasingserver stats ox ac uk information about the haplotypes underlying diploid genotypes is central to pipelines for a wide_range of genetic_analyses standard examples_include inference of human demographic_history detection of signatures of selection and imputation of untyped genetic_variation estimation of haplotypes from genotype data known as phasing is typically treated as a problem of computational statistical_inference for which there is an extensive literature typically we have shown that large haplotype reference_panels can be exploited for phasing of single samples we have done this by using the sharing of rare alleles between unphased genotypes and individuals in the reference_panel to inform the selection of copying states for an hmm_based phasing algorithm this can already be potentially useful in many contexts in medical_genetics where genotypes have been obtained via high_coverage one important feature of our method is that the selection of copying states depends only on the unphased genotypes in any iterative extension this means that the selection of states need be done only once for existing_methods which update copying states at each iteration based on matching of estimated haplotypes this selection_step becomes a computational bottleneck when the number of unphased samples is very large and necessitates additional approximations o manuscript submitted the general principle of using rare_variants to pre calculate which samples are potentially informative for phase offers a potentially more accurate and computationally more tractable approach we would expect the benefits of an iterative application of our method to be especially evident in the phasing of whole_genome sequencing_data on large cohorts of individuals such as the samples being collected as part of the genomics england project the high_coverage and large_sample will uncover a high number of very rare_variants an accurately phased set of haplotypes will be important for downstream_analyses such as genotype_imputation and demographic inference we are working towards extending our method for application to such datasets our method relies on access to a large haplotype reference_panel the haplotype reference_panels such as those produced by the genomics england project and the haplotype reference consortium will not be publicly_available as has been the case with projects such as hapmap and the genomes_project due to the way in which the study individuals have consented for data release to address these restrictions we have developed a phasing server that allows clinical samples sequenced at high coverage to be phased against the hrc reference_panel or the uk k reference_panels https phasingserver stats ox ac uk the method is primarily designed for application to high_coverage data where snp genotypes can be called very accurately and without using ld the method could in principle be applied to low_coverage data but genotype_calling without ld from such data will produce incorrect genotypes which would affect downstream phasing accuracy as we have described it this approach does not permit the phasing of sites that are polymorphic in the unphased sample but not represented in the reference_panel one possibility for phasing such sites is to use pirs our method complements this approach and as we have shown can be combined with it however in settings where we have a number of unphased samples which perhaps share some rare_variants not represented in a reference_panel it would make sense to pool the unphased samples with the reference_panel before selecting copying states and then to apply an iterative updating scheme we are working towards extending our method to do this
