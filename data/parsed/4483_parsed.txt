systems_biology susceptibility of the human pathways graphs to fragmentation by small sets of micrornas motivation micrornas mirnas are short_sequences that negatively_regulate the current understanding of mirna and their corresponding mrna_targets is primarily based on prediction programs this study addresses the potential of a coordinated action of mirnas to manipulate the human pathways specifically we investigate the effectiveness of disrupting the topology of human pathway graphs through a regulation by mirnas results from a set of mirna candidates that is associated with a pathway an exhaustive_search for all possible doubles and triplets coined mir duo mir trios is performed the impact of each mir combination on the connectivity of the pathway graph was quantified about human pathways were tested and the mir duos and mir trios were scored for their ability to disrupt these pathway graphs we show that of all pathways are effectively disconnected by a small number of pathway specific mir trios only of the human pathways are resistant to fragmentation by mir duos or mir trios significantly the combination of the most effective mir trios is unique thus a specific regulation of a pathway within the cell is guaranteed the impact of the selected mir duo trios on various diseases is discussed conclusions the methodology_presented shows that the synthesis of the topology of a network with a detailed understanding of the mirnas regulation is useful in exposing critical nodes of the network we propose the mir trio approach as a basis for rationally_designed perturbation experiments non coding micrornas mirnas play a role in stem_cell cell_division immunological cell function stress_response and cells identity reviewed in furthermore mirnas are involved in the human pathogenesis including cancer and viral_infection recent_studies confirmed the presence of hundreds of mirnas in healthy and diseased tissues to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as a growing number of tools and algorithms were developed for predicting mirna_target pairs currently mirbase is the most comprehensive collection of mirnas with over mirnas from human and from mouse the mirnas are estimated to target over a third of the genes in human more than dozen mirna_target predictors assigned potential targets for individual mirnas however the consistency among the principal mirnatarget predictors is relatively small a direct pairing of mirnas and mrnas was revealed using deep sequencing_technology from argonaute bound sequences currently the tarbase and the mirecords databases are used as sound sources for validated mirnas and their targets the presence of multiple_mirnas binding_sites on the same transcript augments its regulation level the parallel overexpression of three mirnas resulted in a synergistic_effect on the transcription_level of the candidate_genes for example the regulation of the tumor_suppressor fus in cancer_cells depends on the coordinated action of three mirnas importantly introducing several mirnas not only affected gene_candidates but also impacted regulatory_pathways considering pathways and diseases as the predictions objective reduces the noisy predictions of mirna gene_targets as demonstrated by mirnapath and diana mirpath this study raises the possibility that a cooperative action of a small selected group of mirna can alter the expression of genetargets that belong to some pathways without scarifying specificity more importantly the concept that is investigated argues that disruption of the pathways topology has the potential to alter the outcome of the targeted pathway a support for this notion stems from the following i a number of mirnas can act cooperatively ii multiple_mirnas disrupt disease pathways iii genes that comprise the regulatory and signaling_pathways are amenable to mirna regulation iv the quantities of mirnas in cells are strongly regulated v diseases and developmental_stages are often specified by altered expression of a number of mirnas herein we prioritize each pathway according to its susceptibility to a regulation by a small group of mirnas we included the most reliable resources for human pathways from pathway interaction_database pid hosted by the national_cancer nci and kegg many of thewe compiled the manually_curated pathways from kegg and pid nci human pathways resources covering and human pathways respectively the conversion relies on a simplification of the kegg_pathway by excluding non protein components and localization information the conversion creates pathway graphs that are used throughout this study about half of the pathway graphs are composed of only one or two connected components ccs the quantitative properties of kegg_pathways are listed in supplementary table s the conversion of the kegg_pathway to a graph is illustrated for insulin_signaling in this study we combine the importance of regulatory_pathway graph topology with the concept of coordinated regulation by mirnas we test the notion that a small set of a combinatorial mirna action constitutes an effective seed for pathways manipulations the protocol applied in this study introduces several sequential filters for the selection of few mirnas that are potentially_effective toward a specific pathway as a byproduct of this study we identified human pathways that are not susceptible for mirna regulation and others that are sensitive the later serve as an unbiased resource to test the rebalance of mirna combination in health and disease
