on reverse_engineering of gene_interaction using time course data with repeated_measurements motivation gene_expression are the most common data source for reverse_engineering gene_interaction when dealing with destructive sampling in time course experiments it is common to average any available measurements for each time point and to treat this as the actual time series data for fitting the network neglecting the variability contained in the repeated_measurements proceeding in such a way can affect the retrieved network_topology results we propose a fully bayesian_method for reverse_engineering a gene interaction_network based on time course data with repeated_measurements the observations are treated as surrogate measurements of the underlying gene_expression as these measurements often contain outliers we use a non gaussian specification for dealing with measurement_error the network interactions are assumed linear and an autoregressive model is specified augmented with indicator variables that allow inference on the topology of the network we analyse two in silico and one in vivo experiments the latter dealing with the circadian_clock in arabidopsis_thaliana a systematic attenuation of the estimated regulation strengths and a concomitant overestimation of their precision is demonstrated when measurement_error is disregarded thus a clear improvement in the inferred topology for the synthetic datasets is demonstrated when this is included also the influence of outliers in the retrieved network is demonstrated when using the in vivo data identifying and understanding gene_regulatory is of key importance in systems_biology reverse_engineering such networks is thus paramount and a plethora of literature dealing with the problem has developed in recent_years seeand references therein bayesian_networks bns have been used previously in gene network determination however it is to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as well known that when followed through time biological_processes have feedback_loops and thus the validity of bns is questionable when modelling such systems dynamic bns dbns have been proposed for modelling time course longitudinal gene_expression data these can be thought of as unfolding a bn for every time point and when folding it back self regulation and cliques may be obtained formally a dbn is characterized by a set of conditional relations p y t y t in the case of a regression_based dbn these relations can be written aswhere y t g is the expression_level of gene g g measured atand t g is an idiosyncratic error term the approaches above assume one observed time series for each gene however gene_expression measurement normally requires destruction of the sample e g microarrays and therefore the idea of a longitudinal time series becomes problematic this is because a single individual is not followed throughout the experiment but rather a population of cells or individuals are sampled and their gene_expression measured the phenomenon is particularly acute in experiments with multicellular_organisms where not even the same population of cells can be followed through time thus rather than real gene_expression we are faced with a set of surrogate measures in addition to the uncertainty involved in the sampling process it is well known that gene_expression measurement technologies such as microarrays render noisy_data and frequently exhibit outliers when repeated_measurements are available time course data used for reverse_engineering gene_interaction are commonly obtained as a weighted_average of these replicates and therefore these sources of uncertainty are ignored neglecting the variability within the replicates can have severe effects when fitting a linear_model with perhaps the most important being attenuation of the coefficient estimates see working within a univariate first order linear autoregressive setting demonstrated that neglecting measurement_error yields severe attenuation of the autoregressive coefficient and the variability of this estimate interpreting this result within the framework of with a linear specification of f i y t this suggests that an averaged time series will yield attenuated estimates of the interactions within the network with a spurious sense of security given the concomitant underestimation of the variability of these estimates we analyse two in silico and one in vivo datasets the simulated experiments allow us to isolate the effect of explicitly modelling measurement_error in controlled situations and highlight the attenuation effect we then turn to a real experiment dealing with the circadian_clock in arabidopsis_thaliana in all cases we fit the model with and without the measurement_error component using the same prior structure deleting the relevant terms when not accounting for measurement_error or when assuming it is gaussian distributed we demonstrate here that the uncertainty conveyed in repeated_measurements of time course gene_expression data can have a strong effect when estimating a gene interaction_network in the case of a linear autoregressive network specification not accounting for this uncertainty leads to attenuation of the autoregressive coefficients and overestimation of the precision of these estimates this in turn can affect the network_topology retrieval to address_this we propose a model that explicitly includes this variability our modelling is fully bayesian with the true gene_expression unobserved and thus inferred inference of these expression values draws information from both the surrogate measurements and the linear ar process assumed for the gene network interaction with the influence of each source weighted by the relative value of the ar precision and the measurement precision when is relatively small inference on the expression values will be predominately determined by the ar part of the model in the case where there is little information in the data about the regulatory_process the prior on must thence be carefully elicited we provide a benchmark prior for the kinds of datasets arising from microarrays our model accommodates simultaneous inference of the network_topology along with the interaction coefficients we showed that attenuation of the network coefficients as well as the underestimation of the variability of these estimates is systematic such behaviour is then passed on to the estimated link probabilities yielding a more concentrated distribution of link probabilities towards either one or zero the retrieved networks are obtained by setting an arbitrary threshold on the posterior link probabilities and thusbold values are those links that were predicted present in more than one half of the subsets using a threshold of genes in columns are regulators and rows are regulatees
