rpdb a database of experimentally_verified cellular_reprogramming records many cell_lines can be reprogrammed to other cell_lines by forced expression of a few transcription_factors or by specifically_designed culture methods which have attracted a great interest in the field of regenerative_medicine and stem_cell plenty of cell_lines have been used to generate induced_pluripotent ipscs by expressing a group of genes and micrornas these ipscs can differentiate into somatic_cells to promote tissue_regeneration similarly many somatic_cells can be directly reprogrammed to other cells without a stem_cell state all these findings are helpful in searching for new reprogramming methods and understanding the biological mechanism inside however to the best of our knowledge there is still no database dedicated to integrating the reprogramming records we built rpdb cellular_reprogramming database to collect cellular_reprogramming information and make it easy to access all entries in rpdb are manually extracted from more than published_articles which is helpful for researchers in regenerative_medicine and cell_biology availability_and rpdb is freely_available on the web at http bioinformatics ustc edu cn rpdb with all_major cellular_reprogramming is a process in which one cell_type transforms into another cell_type by expressing a group of genes and micrornas adding chemical molecules or changing cell culture_environment cellular_reprogramming technology which mainly includes induced_pluripotent ipsc generation ipsc differentiation and direct reprogramming is considered one of the most important advances in tissue_replacement therapies somatic_cells can be reprogramed to a stem_cell like state which can differentiate to functional somatic_cells multiple somatic_cells including blood cells fibroblasts and hair_follicle dermal_papilla have been successfully reprogrammed to ipscs there are also many functional somatic_cells that have been generated from ipscs such as dopaminergic_neurons and retinal cells multiple strategies have been used to achieve these goals including chemical inducible systems virus free transfection recombinant_proteins and micrornas using similar strategies various somatic_cells have been directly converted into other cell_types which are named direct reprogramming or transdifferentiation although there are several stem_cell focused databases such as systemcell and stemcelldb to the best of our knowledge there is no database that focuses on comprehensively collecting and analyzing cellular_reprogramming v c the author published_by the database includes reprogramming records of cell_lines genes and micrornas chemical molecules and culture methods and functional_annotations we classify the entries into two categories gene and micrornas and molecules and culture methods users can explore all entries of the database through the browse page and compare gene_expression levels of multiple tissues in the analysis page all the results can be downloaded for further analysis a tutorial for the database is available in the help page including searching genes of interest using the database to obtain reprogramming protocols and downloading the results for further analysis detailed information about genes and micrornas involved in cellular_reprogramming can be found in the gene page which includes basic gene information functional information go information protein_protein and regulatory_relationships all functional information is manually extracted from literature describing the role of genes in the reprogramming process with rpdb users can find genes micrornas and chemical molecules used for reprogramming processes the molecules and culture methods page lists all chemical molecules and culture methods deposited in rpdb
