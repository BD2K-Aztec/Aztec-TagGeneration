vecuum identification and filtration of false somatic variants caused by recombinant vector contamination motivation advances in sequencing_technologies have remarkably lowered the detection_limit of somatic variants to a low_frequency however calling mutations at this range is still confounded by many factors including environmental_contamination vector contamination is a continuously occurring issue and is especially problematic since vector inserts are hardly distinguishable from the sample sequences such inserts which may harbor polymorphisms and engineered functional mutations can result in calling false variants at corresponding sites numerous vector screening methods have been developed but none could handle contamination from inserts because they are focusing on vector backbone sequences alone results we developed a novel methodvecuumthat identifies vector originated reads and resultant false variants since vector inserts are generally constructed from intron less cdnas vecuum identifies vector originated reads by inspecting the clipping patterns at exon_junctions false variant_calls are further detected based on the biased distribution of mutant_alleles to vector originated reads tests on simulated and spike in experimental_data validated that vecuum could detect of vector contaminants and could remove up to of variant like false calls with precision application to public sequence_datasets demonstrated the utility of vecuum in detecting false variants resulting from various types of external contamination availability_and java_based implementation of the method is available at http vecuum sourceforge net the detection of somatic variants from massively_parallel sequencing_data is a core analysis in genomic studies recent_advances in sequence_analysis have remarkably improved the accuracy of somatic variant detection to consider low allelic fraction mutations and genetic subpopulations in a sample this improvement has enabled researchers to interrogate genetic causes that act in a minute circumstance in various diseases for instance studies on neurodevelopmental malformations identified disease_causing at a very low allelic fraction down to a few percent while several metagenomic_studies revealed small subpopulations of microbial_pathogens regarding carcinogenesis there is also a growing possibility for the clinical use of high_resolution next_generation ngs in diagnosing genetic_diseases that are hardly detectable by conventional clinical testing however extending the range of somatic_mutation analysis accompanies increased vulnerability to false findings that result from numerous factors including machine errors mapping ambiguity imprecise call models and observational stochasticity inevitable amplification or the reduction of alternative alleles in an observational process of these external sample contamination is a significant risk that can generate critical erroneous calls that perplex the investigators even at an infinitesimal amount for example the cause of genetic anomalies observed in various genome sequencing_data has been identified to be an inclusion of unexpected cell_line dna and viral contamination recent_studies showed that microbial_contamination also exists even in large_scale international projects a series of findings in experimentally well controlled studies indicate that external contamination needs to be assessed by more systematic and computational_approaches in quality_control external contamination by recombinant vector is a continuously occurring problem in sequencing_experiments which has been reported from traditional pcr based sequencing to the ngs sequencing era recombinant vectors are extraordinary problematic contaminants compared with others because of the presence of recombinant inserts unlike vector backbone sequences that are easily distinguishable in xenogeneic genomes the sequences of recombinant inserts is hardly separable once mixed in sample dna to form homogeneous short_read in ngs sequencing recombinant inserts are usually designed for transfection based on the genetic sequence of the target_organism in order to express a transcript in target cells moreover vector inserts are often engineered to harbor the intended mutations for in vitro or in vivo validation thus generating variant like alternative alleles at functionally_important sites yellow marks such false variants can result in serious pitfalls in interpreting the results of sequence_analysis and assessing the occurrence of disease_causing so_far numerous methods have been developed for the identification and filtration of vector contaminated reads and are used as a quality_control process in sequence_analysis https sourceforge net_projects seqclean however none could filter out such variant containing reads generated from vector inserts because all previous attempts have been confined to searching reads containing vector backbone sequences blue reads therefore a novel approach that guarantees the removal of the entire vector contaminant is required for more robust somatic_mutation analysis in ngs here we introduce vecuum that computationally estimates vector originated reads including vector backbones and recombinant inserts and identifies the resultant false variants caused by inherent contamination vecuum identifies the existence and sites of vector contamination by detecting vector backbone sequences in an ultra high_speed screening step based on bwa fastmap vecuum then attempts to capture short_reads from recombinant inserts usingsequence reads of a contaminated specimen consists of dna originating from the sample grey reads and recombinant vector blue and red reads due to ordinary mapping of reads from vector inserts engineered mutations can be observed as low frequent variants yellow marks since recombinant inserts do not include intronic sequences in general unique mapping patterns are generated by vector originated reads at exon_junctions clipped and discordant reads which provides a clue to identify the false variants b the analysis consists of two major_steps with four sub processes in the vector contamination assessment step vecuum checks for vector contamination and predicts insert regions false variants are then examined within the predicted insert regions in the next step the identified false variants with probability scores are provided as a result intron less mapping signatures split or discordantly mapped_reads at exon_junctions with a full recovery in transcript mapping red discordant reads vector inserts for molecular_cloning are generally constructed from intron less processed cdnas finally vecuum identifies false variants based on observation bias of mutant_alleles in vector originated reads using statistical_tests in a carefully_designed simulation we demonstrated that vecuum not only outperforms previously_reported methods but also reduces the computation time in the vector identification problem vecuum also accurately_identified the genomic_regions of contamination and detected most of the false variants which has not been attempted in the previous methods these performances were further validated by real spike in experimental_data by applying vecuum to public sequence_datasets we revealed that various types of external contaminations can be detected including mammalian expression_vectors mouse genes in xenografts and prepped mrna cdna_libraries based on these results we expect that vecuum will improve the reliability of low frequent somatic variant_calls in ngs_data by providing a novel quality_control method for external contamination in this study we developed a novel computational_method vecuum for the detection of false variants caused by vector contamination which has not been explored by previously_reported methods we predicted vector originated reads based on unique mapping patterns at exon_junctions and identified the false variants based on skewness of mutant_alleles to predicted vector reads validation with simulated and experimental contamination datasets not only showed the outperformance of vecuum against conventional assessment of vector contamination but also showed reliable performance for false variant detection occurrence of false somatic calls from external contamination has been occasionally reported however researchers often experience that many of the initial mutations from somatic variant analysis are not reproduced in confirmation steps such as sanger_sequencing targeted deep_sequencing and or mass_spectrometry based panels without a prominent feature of failure and therefore remain unreported such publication_bias suggests a good chance that contamination may exist more frequently than shown moreover high depth sequencing is necessary to identify small amounts of contamination the rapid decline of sequencing_costs and popularization of low frequent somatic_mutation analysis will call more attention to contamination issues where vecuum is a good fall back option application to public datasets showed the utility of vecuum for various sources of contamination in addition to external contamination that we demonstrated here vecuum even detected false variants caused by inherent pseudogenes all types of genomic_data generated by hybrid capture based sequencing would be applicable by vecuum including wes wgs and chip_seq to our knowledge vecuum is the first tool that performs an overall inspection of false variants judging from the perfect precision of the false variant detection achieved upon validations the false variants identified by vecuum can be considered as artifacts with high_confidence regardless of their origin which makes it applicable for robust quality_control of somatic variant analyses
