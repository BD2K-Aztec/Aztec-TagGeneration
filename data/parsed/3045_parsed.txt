structural_bioinformatics modeling macro molecular interfaces with intervor intervor is a software computing a parameter free representation of macromolecular interfaces based on the complex of the atoms given two interacting_partners possibly with water_molecules squeezed in between them intervor computes an interface model which has the following characteristics i it identifies the atoms of the partners which are in direct contact and those whose interaction is water mediated ii it defines a geometric complex separating the partners the voronoi interface whose geometric and topological descriptions are straightforward surface_area number of patches curvature iii it allows the definition of the depth of atoms at the interface thus going beyond the traditional dissection of an interface into a core and a rim these features can be used to investigate correlations between structural_parameters and key_properties such as the conservation of residues their polarity the water dynamics at the interface mutagenesis data etc availability intervor can be run from the web siteproteinprotein recognition plays_a in the formation of complexes which account for biological_functions the investigation of interfaces of macromolecular_complexes is therefore central to improve our understanding of the stability and specificity of macromolecular interactions in conducting such investigations one wishes to i improve the description of experimentally resolved complexes and ii improve scoring_functions used to discriminate native structures among putative ones the goal of this note is to present an interface model which has been used to refine most of the parameters involved so_far in interface studies using a unique parameter free geometric construction
