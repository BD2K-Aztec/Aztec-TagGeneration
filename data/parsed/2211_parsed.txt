structural_bioinformatics hitpick a web_server for hit identification and target prediction of chemical screenings motivation high_throughput phenotypic assays reveal information about the molecules that modulate biological_processes such as a disease phenotype and a signaling_pathway in these assays the identification of hits along with their molecular_targets is critical to understand the chemical activities modulating the biological system here we present hitpick a web_server for identification of hits in high_throughput chemical screenings and prediction of their molecular_targets hitpick applies the b score method for hit identification and a newly_developed approach combining nearest_neighbor nn similarity searching and laplacian modified navenave bayesian target models to predict targets of identified hits the performance of the hitpick web_server is presented and discussed availability the server can be accessed atchemical biology experiments are increasingly used to search for chemical modulators of biological_processes in cell based and even whole organism assays as illustrated by the thousands of phenotypic screenings stored in public_repositories in these assays the identification of the molecular_targets of hits is essential to understand the molecular basis of the chemical activities in the bioassay recently drug_target prediction_methods have been applied to the hits of cells and zebrafish phenotypic screenings showing that computational_approaches are suitable tools that facilitate the interpretation of the biological_activity of chemicals although diverse in silico methods have been proposed to identify hits and predict targets for chemicals reviewed in only few of them are available as easy to use online tools to overcome this situation and assist in the analysis and interpretation of chemical phenotypic screens we introduce hitpick the first web_server for hit identification and target prediction of chemical screenings hitpick provides the functionality to detect bioassay hits using the b score method and predicts targets of a chemical of interest using a new integrative approach that combines nearest_neighbor nn similarity searching and a machine_learning on cross_validation the target prediction approach of hitpick performs better than each of the methods alone achieving a sensitivity of a specificity of and a precision of
