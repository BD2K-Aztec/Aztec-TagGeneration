sequence_analysis predna accurate prediction of dna_binding in proteins by integrating sequence and geometric_structure information motivation proteindna_interactions often take part in various crucial processes which are essential for cellular function the identification of dna_binding in proteins is important for understanding_the of proteindna_interaction thus we have developed an improved method to predict dna_binding by integrating structural_alignment algorithm and support vector machinebased methods results evaluated on a new non redundant protein set with chains the method has sensitivity and specificity in the fold_cross test in addition it predicts dna_binding with sensitivity and specificity when tested on a dataset with proteindna complexes compared with a recently_published method bindn our method predicts dna_binding with a better area under_the value when tested on the same dataset many important problems in cell_biology require the dense non linear interactions between functional_modules be considered thus our prediction method will be useful in detecting such complex interactions proteindna_interactions play_essential in a variety of vital biological_processes such as dna_replication transcription packaging for example the interactions between dna and transcription_factors are important for modulating the process of gene replication and transcription the interactions of dna and histones are involved in chromosome packaging in the cell_nucleus moreover have shown that mutations of dna_binding residues such as those on the tumor repressor_protein p may predispose individuals to cancer thus the accurate identification of dna_binding in proteins is not only important for understanding the mechanisms of these biological_processes but also helpful for annotating the function of proteins proteindna_interaction sites can be detected by using biochemical_techniques such as dnase_i foot printing gel_retardation in vivo foot printing in vitro binding_assay and methylation however traditional biochemical_methods are time consuming and laborious to carry out for the rapidly increasing number of proteindna complexes therefore developing an objective and effective computational_approach to precisely predict dna_binding would be necessary several computational_methods have been developed to identify dna_binding in proteins based mainly on protein_sequence or protein_structure the sequence_based method can be further divided_into two classes the first class is based on the following side chain pka value hydrophobicity index and molecular_mass of the amino_acid and dna_binding residues predicted by support_vector svm and random_forests classifier the second class uses evolutionary and other sequence_information to identify dna_binding in proteins structure based_methods are further classified into a structural_alignment based method and a structural alignment_free method for the structural_alignment based method the dna_binding are recognized from a structural_alignment between the query_sequence and a template known to bind_dna in the structural alignment_free method dna_binding are predicted using electrostatic_potentials and the shape of the molecular_surface with the rapid increase in the number of high_quality protein_structures in the protein_data pdb developing new and efficient techniques for predicting dna_binding using geometric structures has become feasible in this article we introduce a two stage machine learning_strategy to predict dna_binding in the first stage dna_binding are predicted by a structural_alignment algorithm using the geometric_structure in the second stage dna_binding are predicted by svm using evolutionary_information torsion_angles present in the backbone_structure and solvent_accessibility the final results are obtained by a consensus of svm predictions and geometric_structure based_predictions to whom correspondence should be addressed
