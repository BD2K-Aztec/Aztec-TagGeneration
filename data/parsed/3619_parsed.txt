positive unlabeled ensemble learning for kinase_substrate prediction from dynamic phosphoproteomics data downloaded from motivation protein_phosphorylation is a post_translational that underlines various aspects of cellular_signaling a key_step to reconstructing signaling_networks involves identification of the set of all kinases and their substrates experimental_characterization of kinase substrates is both expensive_and to expedite the discovery of novel substrates computational_approaches based on kinase recognition sequence_motifs from known substrates protein_structure interaction and co localization have been proposed however rarely do these methods take into account the dynamic responses of signaling_cascades measured from in vivo cellular_systems given that recent_advances in mass_spectrometry based_technologies make it possible to quantify phosphorylation on a proteome_wide scale computational_approaches that can integrate static features with dynamic phosphoproteome data would greatly_facilitate the prediction of biologically_relevant kinase specific substrates results here we propose a positive unlabeled ensemble learning approach that integrates dynamic phosphoproteomics data with static kinase recognition motifs to predict novel substrates for kinases of interest we extended a positive unlabeled learning technique for an ensemble model which significantly_improves prediction sensitivity on novel substrates of kinases while retaining high_specificity we evaluated the performance of the proposed model using simulation_studies and subsequently applied it to predict novel substrates of key kinases relevant to insulin_signaling our analyses show that static sequence_motifs and dynamic phosphoproteomics data are complementary and that the proposed integrated model performs better than methods relying only on static information for accurate prediction of kinase specific substrates availability_and executable gui tool source_code are freely_available at https github comphosphorylation is an essential protein post_translational characterized by the precise and reversible addition of a phosphate_group by proteins called kinases to their targets called substrates the signaling_networks established by protein_phosphorylation govern numerous cellular_functions such as metabolic_homeostasis cell_proliferation survival and apoptosis and the identification of substrates often reveals new mechanisms by which the cell regulates these processes the identification of new kinase substrates i e the phosphorylation_site on a given protein is therefore of great biological interest experimental_validation of kinase substrates is an expensive_and process and must therefore be prioritized and performed for only a limited number of candidates to select appropriate candidates for experimental_characterization in silico approaches are widely used to predict candidate substrates of a kinase or family of kinases of interest to this end a number of computational_approaches have been developed for de_novo substrate prediction these range from simple motifbased approaches to sophisticated machine_learning a list of available methods is reviewed and categorized by trost and kusalik according to the techniques_employed for substrate prediction for example methods based on sequence_motif either contain precompiled regular expression_patterns or rely on calculating position_specific pssms from known kinase substrates extracted from the literature or in vitro experiments while motif based_methods are able to sensitively identify substrates that have a similar sequence_composition to those used to compile the motif they generally extend poorly to more diverse substrates as increasingly more phosphorylation_sites are deposited in public_databases such as phospho elm and phosphositeplus machine_learning that generalize well to diverse substrates are becoming increasingly necessary in this category methods differ in the learning algorithms that have been employed for modeling the amount of sequence_information utilized and the integration of additional information such as protein_structure colocalization or interaction while these static features e g protein_sequence structure co localization and interaction are informative methods based on static features do not account for the dynamic spatiotemporal kinetics that may help accurately define the architecture of cell_signaling recent_advances in liquid_chromatography has enabled high_throughput protein_phosphorylation profiling in time course studies coupled with labeling techniques such as isobaric tagging e g tmt or stable_isotope with amino_acids e g silac and increasingly label_free based_approaches tens_of of phosphorylation_sites can be identified and quantified with high_precision on a proteome_wide scale computational_approaches that integrate static features with dynamic phosphoproteome will enable kinase specific substrate prediction in the context of dynamic cellular_systems here we propose a positive unlabeled ensemble learning algorithm to integrate kinase recognition motifs with dynamic phosphoproteomics data to predict novel substrates of relevant kinases of interest extending on our previous model the proposed algorithm addresses several key computational challenges_faced in model training when using phosphoproteomics data by using a positive unlabeled learning technique for an ensemble classification algorithm first the class distribution of the phosphoproteomics data is highly imbalanced due to the fact that experimentally_verified substrates are sparse resulting in vastly more negative training instances compared with positive instances we address this by using repeated sampling from the phosphoproteomics data and creating an ensemble of classifiers each trained on a balanced training subset second the model training requires a set of negative instances to be provided however defining a true negative set is difficult because unannotated phosphorylation_sites comprise a mix of negative and unidentified positive substrates to overcome this problem a positive unlabeled learning procedure is implemented in the ensemble model for improving prediction sensitivity while retaining specificity by correcting for the prediction bias we studied the behavior of the proposed positive unlabeled ensemble approach using simulation on synthetic datasets and subsequently applied it to predict substrates of kinases akt and mtor mammalian_target using a time course phosphorylation dataset generated from insulin_stimulated profiling of cultured adipocytes our results indicate that the proposed approach is highly_accurate based on an array of evaluation metrics and is able to take advantage of both static information from amino_acid as well as dynamic information from phosphoproteomic data to predict kinase substrates in this study we developed a positive unlabeled ensemble learning approach that enables the accurate prediction of kinase specific substrates by integrating motif information derived from amino_acid surrounding the phosphorylation recognition_sites with dynamic phosphorylation patterns quantified in large_scale time series phosphoproteomics studies we extended the positive unlabeled learning techniques for ensemble learning and illustrated how such an application can improve the prediction sensitivity while retaining high_specificity for kinase_substrate prediction finally we demonstrated the complementary nature of the static features extracted from sequence_motif and the dynamic_features extracted from phosphoproteomics data compared with traditional sequence_motif centric methods our study suggests an alternative approach for predicting kinase specific substrates that incorporates and exploits the wealth of physiological information captured by large_scale phosphoproteomics studies with the recent development of high_throughput methods promising to streamline the generation of large_scale phosphoproteomics data we anticipate that the methods described here will become an increasingly valuable_approach for enabling prediction of kinase substrates while preserving the dynamic and cellular_context of the biological system being studied
