sequence_analysis hapmuc somatic_mutation calling using heterozygous germ_line variants near candidate_mutations motivation identifying somatic changes from tumor and matched normal sequences has become a standard approach in cancer research more specifically this requires accurate detection of somatic_point with low allele_frequencies in impure and heterogeneous cancer samples although haplotype_phasing information derived by using heterozygous germ_line variants near candidate_mutations would improve accuracy no somatic_mutation caller that uses such information is currently available results we propose a bayesian_hierarchical method termed hapmuc in which power is increased by using available information on heterozygous germ_line variants located near candidate_mutations we first constructed two generative_models the mutation model and the error_model in the generative_models we prepared candidate haplotypes considering a heterozygous germ_line variant if available and the observed reads were realigned to the haplotypes we then inferred the haplotype_frequencies and computed the marginal likelihoods using a variational_bayesian algorithm finally we derived a bayes_factor for evaluating the possibility of the existence of somatic_mutations we also demonstrated that our algorithm has superior spe cificity and sensitivity compared with existing_methods as determined based on a simulation the tcga mutation calling benchmark_data and data from the colo cell_line availability_and the hapmuc source_code is available fromcancer is caused by genomic_alterations in particular somatic_point play a clear role in cancer development driven by the recent advancement of high_throughput dna_sequencing mutation calling from tumor and matched normal sequences is becoming a standard approach in cancer research the simple goal of this approach is to detect genetic_alterations that are unique to the tumor sample for this purpose statistical_approaches that allow distinction of true somatic_mutations from relatively numerous germ_line variants sequencing_errors and alignment errors are required moreover mutation calling methods need to be sufficiently_sensitive targets with low allele_frequencies in cancer because of low tumor contents copy_number and tumor_heterogeneity in particular it is important to capture subclones demonstrating tumor_heterogeneity because this is thought to be one of the main causes of therapeutic_resistance and cancer_recurrence there are mainly two approaches to detect somatic_mutations using sequence_data of a tumornormal pair the first approach is to use fishers_exact on read_counts for evaluating the differences in allele_frequencies between tumor and matched normal_tissue varscan and genomon are categorized in this group by ignoring complex biological structures this approach achieves a reasonable computational speed and robustness the second approach is based on bayesian modeling which calculates the posterior_probability that tumor and normal samples would have different genotypes somaticsniper jointsnvmix strelka and mutect are representatives of this second group comparative concurrent analysis of a pair of tumor and normal sequences achieved a performance superior to the previous independent type of analysis in which tumor and normal samples were genotyped independently and results were subtracted here we focused on heterozygous germ_line variants located near candidate somatic_mutations in real_data we observed that somatic_mutations occurred mostly on one of two normal haplotypes however sequencing_errors occurred randomly on normal haplotypes the data are shown in section based on this observation we propose a novel statistical_method hapmuc which can use the information of heterozygous germ_line variants near candidate_mutations first we constructed two generative_models under a bayesian statistical_framework one represents true somatic_mutations and the other regards candidate somatic_mutations as errors in our generative_models we prepared four candidate haplotypes by combining a candidate mutation and a heterozygous germ_line variant if available the alignment probabilities of the observed reads given each candidate haplotype to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is

a variational_bayesian algorithm finally we derived a bayes_factor bf which is the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of these two models to evaluate the possibility of the presence of somatic_mutations we first demonstrated the effectiveness of hapmuc in a simulation_study second we also confirmed its efficiency based on a real sequence_dataset obtained from breast_cancer cell_line samples which forms part of the the cancer_genome tcga mutation calling benchmark_datasets third we tested hapmuc in the context of a whole_genome using the tcga datasets and the analysis suggested that our algorithm performed better than the existing_methods including varscan somaticsniper strelka and mutect in addition we confirmed that the sensitivity of our algorithm was superior or comparable with the existing_methods using the colo dataset with its list of validated somatic_mutations finally we discuss limitations and propose future_research for accurate mutation calling in this article we addressed the problem of accurately detecting somatic_mutations in cancer by using tumor and matched normal ngs sequences based on ccrcc patients data we observed that true somatic_mutations mostly occurred on one of two normal haplotypes however sequencing_errors occurred randomly on normal haplotypes based on this observation we developed a novel bayesian statistical_method hapmuc which can use the information of heterozygous germ_line variants located near candidate_mutations in our simulation_study we demonstrated that our algorithm has superior_performance compared with a simple fisher method when a candidate mutation_occurs near a heterozygous germ_line variant we also tested our algorithm on several read_lengths and bp as well as single_end and paired_end hapmuc achieved higher auc values with longer_reads and paired_reads by using additional information for calculating the likelihood of read_pairs we approximated it by multiplying the alignment likelihoods of the first and second read which assumes that read_pairs are generated independently given the haplotype however we should modify our modeling for read_pairs considering their insertion size_distribution as a read_pair usually comes from a fragment we also confirmed the advantages of using heterozygous germ_line variants based on breast_cancer cell_line samples which are publicly_available as a part of the tcga mutation calling benchmark_datasets in this experiment we excluded potential alignment artifacts by using some genomic_annotations a blat filter with human decoy sequence d and an indel filter because mapping errors can confuse the haplotype inference of our algorithm however detecting and eliminating alignment errors appropriately remains a problem additionally we evaluated our algorithm in the context of a whole_genome using the tcga mutation calling benchmark_datasets we compared the results of hapmuc with those of the simple fisher method bayesian_methods which includes strelka mutect and somaticsniper and varscan which is based on fishers_exact but which uses some filters for both snvs and indels our method shows higher auc values than the alternative_methods during subsequent manual_inspection using integrative_genomics igv we confirmed that hapmuc succeeded in using contextual_information such as mismatches and homopolymers near candidate_mutations although several filtering approaches have been proposed to date no somatic_mutation caller that integrates the contextual_information into its score has been available furthermore the analysis using the colo dataset with the list of validated somatic_mutations
