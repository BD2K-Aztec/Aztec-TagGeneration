accurate continuous geographic assignment from low to high_density data motivation large_scale genotype datasets can help track the dispersal patterns of epidemiological outbreaks and predict the geographic origins of individuals such genetically_based geographic assignments also show a range of possible applications in forensics for profiling both victims and criminals and in wildlife management where poaching hotspot areas can be located they however require fast and accurate statistical_methods to handle the growing amount of genetic_information made available from genotype arrays and next_generation results we introduce a novel statistical_method for geopositioning individuals of unknown_origin from genotypes our method is based on a geostatistical model trained with a dataset of georefer enced genotypes statistical_inference under this model can be implemented within the theoretical_framework of integrated nested laplace approximation which represents one of the major recent breakthroughs in statistics as it does not require monte_carlo we compare the performance of our method and an alternative method for geospatial inference spa in a simulation framework we highlight the accuracy and limits of continuous spatial assignment methods at various scales by analyzing genotype datasets from a diversity of species including florida scrub jay birds aphelocoma coerulescens arabidopsis_thaliana and humans representing snps our method appears to be best suited for the analysis of medium_sized datasets a few tens_of of loci such as reduced representation sequencing_data that become increasingly available in ecology availability_and inferring the geographic_origin of living_organisms from their genetic_information is of great interest for many applications in biology it can provide information about gene_flow migration_patterns and connectivity in natural_populations but can also help inform wildlife managers about illegal animal translocations and poaching hotspots as such this information can complement the arsenal of dna based fraud detection methods aiming at detecting derivatives of endangered and trade restricted species in addition dna informed geospatial localization can reveal the geographic source of pathogens during epidemiological outbreaks or the geographic_origin of plants and animals used in the industrial manufacture of food_products lees here we introduce spatial bayesian_inference spasiba a novel method for geospatial assignment the premise of the spasiba method is that in most natural contexts spatial_patterns of allele_frequencies are complex and are likely to be well captured by a geostatistical model such as the one implemented in the scat program but here we leverage the power of a recent breakthrough statistical theory developed by and this allows us to make mcmc free inference in only a fraction of the time required by scat
