quasr quantification and annotation of short_reads in r quasr is a package for the integrated analysis of high_throughput sequencing_data in r covering all steps from read preprocessing alignment and quality_control to quantification quasr supports different experiment types including rna_seq chip_seq and bis seq and analysis variants e g paired_end stranded spliced and allele specific and is integrated in bioconductor so that its output can be directly processed for statistical_analysis and visualization availability_and quasr is implemented in r and c c source_code for major platforms linux os x and ms windows are available from bioconductor www biocon ductor org_packages release bioc html quasr html the package includes a vignette with step_by examples for typical work flows high_throughput has become a powerful research tool in a wide_range such as transcriptome_profiling rnaseq measurement of dna_protein or chromatin_modifications chip_seq and dna_methylation bis seq in the last years there have been many efforts to provide software in r bioconductor to simplify data_processing and biological_interpretation such as an efficient framework for working with genomic ranges or tools for read_alignment quality_control and statistical_analysis it is however still challenging to conduct a complete analysis from raw_data to a publishable result in the form of a single r script which would greatly improve documentation and thus facilitate the exchange of analysis details with coworkers often it is necessary to perform a subset of tasks outside of r for example on
