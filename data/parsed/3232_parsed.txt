gene_expression network based comparison of temporal gene_expression motivation in the pursuits of mechanistic_understanding of cell_differentiation it is often necessary to compare multiple differentiation_processes triggered by different external_stimuli and internal perturbations available methods for comparing temporal gene_expression are limited to a gene by gene approach which ignores co expression information and thus is sensitive to measurement noise methods we present a method for co expression network based comparison of temporal_expression nacep nacep compares the temporal_patterns of a gene between two experimental_conditions taking_into all of the possible co expression modules that this gene may participate in the nacep program is available at http biocomp bioen uiuc edu nacep results we applied nacep to analyze retinoid acid ra induced_differentiation of embryonic_stem es_cells the analysis suggests that ra may facilitate neural_differentiation by inducing the shh and insulin_receptor pathways nacep was also applied to compare the temporal responses of seven rna inhibition rnai experiments as proof_of we demonstrate that the difference in the temporal responses to rnai treatments can be used to derive interaction relationships of transcription_factors tfs and therefore infer regulatory_modules within a transcription network in particular the analysis suggested a novel regulatory relationship between two pluripotency regulators esrrb and tbx which was supported by in vivo binding of esrrb to the promoter of tbx availability the nacep program and the supplementary documents are available at http biocomp bioen uiuc edu nacep embryonic_stem es_cells are capable of differentiating into all cell_types in an adult body and can be triggered by different external and internal signals one of the major themes in es_cell research is to find efficient ways of guiding es_cells to differentiate into a desired cell_type we chose to approach this theme by comparing the differentiation_processes triggered by different external_stimuli or internal perturbations differentiating mouse_es by withdrawing certain growth_factors usually leukemia_inhibitory lif leads to generating a mixture of all cell_types spontaneous_differentiation alternatively exposing es_cells to certain growth_factors can lead to enrichment of certain cell_lineages during differentiation examples_include retinoid acid ra induced_differentiation that enriches neuronal_cells and activininduced differentiation that enriches mesendoderm cells besides growth_factors repressing individual regulatory_proteins can also induce differentiation although we previously showed that the repression of a chromatin modeling factor may encourage es_cells to differentiate and express neural markers in general it is not clear whether the repression of es_cell regulators may encourage differentiation toward any specific cell_lineages we hypothesized that if two es_cell regulators are in the same regulatory_pathway the temporal transcriptional_responses to repressing them should be similar as opposed to the temporal responses of repressing a third es regulator that is not in this regulatory_pathway or acting to inhibit this pathway we also hypothesized that if a transcription_factor tf inhibits a signaling_pathway the temporal responses to repressing this tf may be closer to the transcriptional_responses to adding a growth_factor that induces this signaling_pathway as compared with the temporal responses to repressing another tf with these hypotheses in mind we applied the new method called nacep to compare spontaneous_differentiation against eight types of induced_differentiation including one external stimulation ra induced and seven internal perturbations repressing es_cell regulators the goals of these comparisons are as follows first we wish to gain mechanistic_insights into how ra treatment leads to differentiation toward the neural lineage second we wish to test whether any of these induced differentiation_processes resemble one another and thus to infer the relative proximities of these regulators in an es_cell regulatory_network these questions inspired us to revisit analytical_methods for comparing time course gene_expression data to date there are very few methods for comparing timecourse gene_expression data one method suppresses the temporal_information and compares the neighborhood genes between two conditions other methods explicitly_model the temporal_information but treat every gene independently for example one of these methods fits a spline to the time course data of a gene in each of two experimental_conditions and then it compares the fitted splines page
