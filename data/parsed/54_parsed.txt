sequence_analysis accurate in silico prediction of species specific methylation_sites based on information_gain feature optimization as one of the most important reversible types of post_translational protein methyla tion catalyzed by methyltransferases carries many pivotal biological_functions as well as many essential_biological identification of methylation_sites is prerequisite for decoding methy lation regulatory_networks in living_cells and understanding their physiological_roles experimental methods are limitations of labor_intensive and time consuming while in silicon approaches are cost_effective and high_throughput manner to predict potential methylation_sites but those previous predictors only have a mixed model and their prediction performances are not fully satisfactory now recently with increasing availability of quantitative methylation datasets in diverse_species especially in eukaryotes there is a growing need to develop a species specific predictor here we designed a tool named pssme based on information_gain ig feature optimization method for species specific methylation site prediction the ig method was adopted to analyze the importance and contribution of each feature then select the valuable dimension feature_vectors to reconstitute a new orderly feature which was applied to build the finally prediction model finally our method improves prediction_performance of accuracy about comparing with single features furthermore our species specific model significantly_improves the predictive_performance compare with other general methylation prediction_tools hence our prediction results serve as useful resources to elucidate the mechanism of arginine or lysine methylation and facilitate hypothesis driven experimental_design and validation availability_and the tool online service is implemented by c language and freely_available bioinfo many post_translational ptms of proteins provide the proteome with structural and functional_diversity and regulate cellular plasticity and dynamics protein methylation is considered one of the most common and reversible ptms which is an important element in many significant biological_functions meanwhile researchers and clinicians have proved that protein methylation and their regulatory enzymes are involved in the process of a variety of human_diseases such as cancer cardiovascular_disease multiple_sclerosis rheumatoid_arthritis as well as neuroses generative disorders therefore annotation of methylation in proteomes would certainly provide very useful information or clues for drug_discovery to study and analyze the mechanisms that govern these basic epigenetic phenomena identification of methylated sites is the first step towards to understanding molecular_mechanism of protein methylation although there have many conventional experimental methods to identify protein methylation_sites such as chip_chip mass_spectrometry ms and methylation specific_antibodies these experimental_approaches are limited to labor_intensive and timeconsuming while in silicon prediction of methylation_sites is much more desirable for its convenience and fast speed and there have been several tools published for prediction protein methylated sites recently our lab have systematically summarized current of computational_prediction methylation_sites method of the past ten years furthermore we have also summarized characteristic of differences among several typical tools the detailed information in supplementary including memo bpb ppms masa pmes plmla methk imethyl pseaac and gps msp for instance designed the first methylation_sites predictor within their automotif server using regular expression technique subsequently combined bi profile bayes feature_extraction with support_vector svm to predict arginine and lysine methylation based on an enhanced feature encoding scheme composed of the sparse property coding normalized van_der volume position weight amino and accessible_surface our lab developed a tool pmes to predict arginine and lysine methylation meanwhileincorporated protein_sequence secondary_structure and amino_acid to identify methylation and acetylation of lysine_residues in whole protein_sequences used amino_acid aac and accessible_surface asa coalition svm to identify lysinemethylated sites on histones and non histone_proteins most recently adopted gps algorithm and built gps msp methyl_group specific predictor for the prediction of general or type specific methyllysine and methylarginine residues in proteins although each of the aforementioned methods possesses its own merit and did play roles in stimulating the development of this area they still have limitations when applied to whole proteomes and need improvement from one or more of the following aspects i the benchmark_dataset used by the previous investigators needs to updated by incorporating new experiment confirmed data because methylation data updated very quickly in recent_years for example created methk model just with methyllysine sites at whereas our work have found lysine methylation_sites in total ii the features used by the previous_models were single and simple which it is casing the performance of the several aforementioned predictors not fully satisfactory so there is still room to improve_the the detailed information see comparison with other general prediction_tools in results and discussion iii the third limitation is that the methylation specific classification species or methyltransferase family was not discussed in previous methods the majority of existing_studies except gps msp disregarded the differences of species and considered all species methylation_sites as generic sites to build a mixed model however sequences or structural patterns around the methylation_sites may significantly differ in different organisms so it highlighting necessity to develop species specific predictors iv furthermore some of these tools were only published as a method and did not provide a user_friendly web_service or the web_server does not work the tools with web_services are useful for user to predict methylation_sites when they want to experimental_design and verify whether sequence is methylated especially for large_scale predictions protein methylation site prediction has not been as widely_studied as other types of ptm such as phosphorylation and acetylation due to lack of methylation data with techniques rapidly increasing in the past_few the growing number of methylation datasets was found in diverse_species especially in eukaryotes for example lott et_al found over arginine methylated proteins in an early branching eukaryote trypanosoma_brucei collected methylation_sites with species information in experimentally_validated methylated proteins in sysptm protein methylation has attracted more and more attentions there is a growing need to develop a species specific predictor in this work we developed a new tool named pssme prediction species specific methylation_sites to overcome above limitations of the existing_methods which is specifically_designed to predict both speciesspecific and general methylation_sites reliable and large_scale experimental methylation_sites data from multiple species were collected from several sources which used to train for building the species specific models in particular our model first used a wellestablished feature_selection method ig coupled with a two stage to distinguish the importance and valuable dimension feature_vector which it is more simple and convenient comparison with other selection and optimization_methods such as the maximum relevance minimum redundancy mrmr method the first stage selects five features including amino_acid aac k spaced amino_acid pair composition amino_acids binary encoding be k nearest_neighbors features knn and amino_acid physicochemical property psp features the second stage incorporates five features and finds most valuable dimension features based on information_gain ig method and then reconstitute a new orderly features to build the model for methylation_sites prediction after prediction of independent test_dataset the result showed that our prediction_performance overall significantly enhance than other tools furthermore we discussed the model of methylation in different species the analysis result shows the following i the methylation patterns are significantly different in different species ii ig method can effectively select valuable dimension features and reduce redundant features for improving the prediction_performance iii based on ig score it suggests that knn feature is important and makes a great contribution for prediction methylation_sites iv finally the web_service of pssme supports continuous stringency adjustment to meet the various confidence requirements of users cross_validation tests and provides better probability information for prediction results by comparison with other prediction_tools
