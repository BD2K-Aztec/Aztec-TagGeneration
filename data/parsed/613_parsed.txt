automatic d neuron tracing using all path pruning motivation digital reconstruction or tracing of d neuron structures is critical toward reverse_engineering the wiring and functions of a brain however despite a number of existing_studies this task is still challenging especially when a d microscopic image has low_signal snr and fragmented neuron segments published work can handle these hard situations only by introducing global prior information such as where a neurite segment starts and terminates however manual incorporation of such global information can be very time consuming thus a completely automatic approach for these hard situations is highly_desirable results we have developed an automatic graph algorithm called the all path pruning app to trace the d structure of a neuron to avoid_potential mis tracing of some parts of a neuron an app first produces an initial over reconstruction by tracing the optimal geodesic shortest_path from the seed location to every possible destination voxel pixel location in the image since the initial reconstruction contains all the possible paths and thus could contain redundant structural_components sc we simplify the entire reconstruction without compromising its connectedness by pruning the redundant structural_elements using a new maximal covering minimal redundant mcmr subgraph algorithm we show that mcmr has a linear computational_complexity and will converge we examined the performance of our method using challenging d neuronal image datasets of model_organisms e g fruit_fly availability the software is available upon request we plan to eventually release the software as a plugin of the v d neuron package at http penglab janelia org proj v d digital reconstruction or tracing of d neuron structures is critical toward reverse_engineering the wiring and functions of a brain a number of studies e g have been conducted to develop semi or fully_automatic neuron tracing methods that would yield more efficient neuron reconstruction than the currently widely_adopted manual reconstruction strategy most of these existing_methods have used various structural_components sc e g d spheres ellipsoids cylinders lines segments or irregular to whom correspondence should be addressed compartments to model a neurons morphology e the most successful strategy among these algorithms is to build up the reconstruction by incrementally adding more and more such scs into the morphological modeling of a neuron good examples_include image voxel scooping ray shooting and template_matching these bottom up local searching methods are suitable for d images that have ideally continuous neurite tracts and good signal_to snr however precise digitization of the d morphological structure of a neuron acquired through various microscopy methods such as d laser_scanning remains very problematic in practice it is especially hard when an image has low snr and or broken and fuzzy neurite segments that are due to the intrinsic punctuated neurite structures e g synaptic boutons or imperfections in sample_preparation and g notably such datasets are common for the nervous_systems of different animals for instance the punctuated and thus often broken neurites can be ubiquitously seen in the singleneuron images of drosophila_melanogaster fruit_fly caenorhabditis_elegans and mouse the local search_methods discussed above cannot easily handle these hard situations as it is very difficult to cross these gaps i e low signal regions one strategy to tackle this challenging situation is to combine both global and local cues global prior information such as the starting and ending locations of neurite structures will guide the finer scale optimization using local image_content such global priors of neurite structure can be supplied easily using a novel and highly_effective d visualization system v d the graph augmented deformable model gd algorithm which is a graph augmented deformable model can be used to trace the optimal paths from the starting location to each of the ending points automatically then the entire reconstruction can be assembled automatically by detecting branching points along the merging paths this method had been successfully_applied to reconstructing neuronal connections in the most detailed mouse_brain image atlas to date unfortunately when a neurons structure is very complicated or the image_quality is low it may still be very time consuming to input such simple global prior guiding information thus a completely automatic approach for broken structures and low snr images is highly needed we previously_proposed to detect the tips termini of a neuron automatically based on the spatial anisotropy of these terminal points manuscript under review or adaptive template_matching e g the automarker function in the v d system followed by the gd tracing however tip detection may not be accurate when the termini of a neuron do not form sharp tips such as those terminated with synaptic boutons adaptive template_matching may also mis detect the irregularly_shaped termini therefore here we propose a new method that iteratively prunes
