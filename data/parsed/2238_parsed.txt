data_and hts navigator freely_accessible cheminformatics software for analyzing high_throughput data we report on the development of the high_throughput hts navigator software to analyze and visualize the results of hts of chemical libraries the hts navigator processes output_files from different plate readers formats computes the overall hts matrix automatically detects hits and has different types of baseline navigation and correction features the software incorporates advanced che minformatics capabilities such as chemical_structure storage and visualization fast similarity_search and chemical neighborhood analysis for retrieved hits the software is freely_available for academic laboratories with the growing number of academic_centers such as uclas molecular screening shared resourcesmssr nimhs psychoactive drug_screening programpdsp or molecular libraries screening center networkmlscn conducting high_throughput hts comes the need for processing hts results efficiently some of these centers have the potential to screen up to compounds against several panels of targets e g gpcrs kinases as a result significant amounts of screening data are generated which require extensive management and analysis several commercial software_packages e g spotfire by tibco vortex by dotmatics are available to conduct these data analysis and mining tasks but these are relatively expensive have fixed sets of features and are not necessarily suited for academic structures and small biotech companies as a consequence there is a need for freely_available and easily customizable software capable of visualizing and analyzing hts results with an eye toward more extensive and chemical analysis using advances in cheminformatics for hts_data analysis kummel
