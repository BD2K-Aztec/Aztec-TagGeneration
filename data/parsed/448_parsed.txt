structural_bioinformatics approximating the set of local_minima in partial rna_folding landscapes motivation we study a stochastic method for approximating the set of local_minima in partial rna_folding landscapes associated with a bounded distance neighbourhood of folding conformations the conformations are limited to rna_secondary without pseudoknots the method aims at exploring partial energy_landscapes pl induced by folding simulations and their underlying neighbourhood relations it combines an approximation of the number of local_optima devised by garnier and kallel with a run time estimation for identifying sets of local_optima established by reeves and eremeev results the method is tested on nine sequences of length between nt and nt which allows us to compare the results with data generated by rnasubopt and subsequent barrier tree calculations on the nine sequences the method captures on average of local_minima with settings designed for a target of the run time of the heuristic can be estimated by o n dln where n is the sequence_length is the number of local_minima in the partial landscape pl under consideration and d is the maximum number of steepest descent steps in attraction basins associated with pl the method presented in the article targets sampling algorithms designed for rna_secondary and pathway analysis that employs in one way or another features of the underlying free_energy for this type of algorithms knowledge of metastable_states local_minima in the vicinity of intermediate conformations can be of advantage in speeding up the folding simulation here the term sampling algorithm covers any type of random_walks markov processes and kinetic or co transcriptional folding simulations applied to rna_secondary simulations of kinetic folding based upon the master_equation dp u t dtare feasible only for short_sequences due to the large number m of folding conformations even when executed on parallel_computing systems p u t is the probability that the folding_process is in conformational_state u at time t and the k uv are the transition_rates from state u to state v a standard_setting for values k uv is to whom correspondence should be addressed for the sequences we analysed in the present paper the garnier kallel method not only produced estimations within the same order of magnitude of the true number of local_minima calculated by rnasubopt and barriers but also with an average deviation of in most cases overestimation the estimations of the number of local_minima seem to be a useful input to the subsequent approximation of the entire set of local_minima on the nine sequences with a sufficiently_large size of the partial landscape the estimations and parameter_settings provided by reeves and eremeev have led to an average approximation rate of for a target rate of which we see as a confirmation of the reeves eremeev method and a justification for the entire approach the results were achieved for sequences with varying ratios of the size of the partial landscape versus the number of local_minima within the subspaces an open question is the secure selection of the initial sample_size m a potential way for solving this problem could be based on good approximations of the number of secondary_structures that constitute the hamming sphere around a particular structure under consideration the increase of the sample_size in case of can be organized in different ways for example when starting with a relatively small m a sample_size of t m in step t provides a rapid increase that could lead within a few steps to at least additionally one could then search backwards between t m and t m additive steps for better values of t where the current m run still complies with on the other hand for a given sequence_length n and a fixed radius it might be possible to devise standard rules for initial settings of m which could result in a very small number of m runs another line of further improvements could be the combination of the data from two runs for the same value of m with one run for a horizontal selection of samples high free_energy within the partial landscape and the second run for a random_selection over all conformations obtained by m random_walks of length k within the partial landscape here one would need to establish rules of how to determine the approximation from two different sets of values for m and outtaken together with the current value of m
