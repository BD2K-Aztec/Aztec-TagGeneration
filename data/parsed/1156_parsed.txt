contrastrank a new method for ranking putative cancer_driver and classification of tumor_samples motivation the recent_advance in high_throughput is generating a huge amount of data that are becoming an important resource for deciphering the genotype underlying a given phenotype genome_sequencing has been extensively applied to the study of the cancer_genomes although a few methods have been already proposed for the detection of cancer_related their automatic identification is still a challenging_task using the genomic_data made available by the cancer_genome consortium tcga we propose a new prioritization approach based on the analysis of the distribution of putative deleterious variants in a large cohort of cancer samples results in this paper we present contastrank a new method for the prioritization of putative impaired genes in cancer the method is based on the comparison of the putative defective rate of each gene in tumor versus normal and genome samples we show that the method is able to provide a ranked_list of putative impaired genes for colon lung and prostate adenocarcinomas the list significantly overlaps with the list of known cancer_driver previously_published more importantly by using our scoring approach we can successfully discriminate between tcga normal and tumor_samples a binary classifier based on contrastrank score reaches an overall accuracy and the area under the curve auc of receiver_operating roc for all the three types of adenocar cinoma analyzed in this paper in addition using contrastrank score we are able to discriminate the three tumor_types with a minimum overall accuracy of and auc of conclusions we describe contrastrank a method for prioritizing putative impaired genes in cancer the method is based on the comparison of exome_sequencing from different cohorts and can detect putative cancer_driver contrastrank can also be used to estimate a global_score for an individual genome about the risk of adenocarcinoma based on the genetic_variants information from a whole exome vcf variant_calling format file we believe that the application of contrastrank can be an important step in genomic medicine to enable genome based diagnosis availability_and the lists of contrastrank scores of all genes in each tumor_type are available as supplementary_materials a webserver for evaluating the risk of the three studied adenocarcin omas starting from whole exome vcf file is under development in the past_few next_generation ngs based screening has become an important tool for the detection of genetic_variants associated with many genetic_disorders its application on the study of cancer_genomes allowed the discovery of several cancer_related the cancer_genome tcga consortium cancer_genome research is producing a huge amount of cancer_genome data for cancer_types this enables the detection of an increasing number of variants potentially involved in cancer however the interpretation of genetic_variants is a challenging_problem and it is difficult to differentiate variation in specific genes responsible for the development and progression of cancer drivers from the background passengers in general the prediction of cancer driver_mutations is based on the conservation analysis of mutated sites the accurate detection of driver_mutations is important to define cancer_driver that play a causative_role in oncogenesis through exerting a selective_advantage to the cancer_cells so_far several methods for identifying cancer_driver have been reported the prevalent strategy to identify cancer_driver works by detecting significantly over mutated genes in tumors which are more likely the drivers most of the methods compare the frequency of mutations in an individual gene with the mutation_frequency of other genes in the same or related tumors after correction for sequence_context and gene size using this approach a considerable number of driver_genes have been discovered in a variety of cancer_types however many seemingly unrelated genes have also been identified in recent cancer_genome studies the heterogeneity of mutational processes within individuals and cancer_types could explain this anomaly therefore there is a pressing need for robust_methods to identify cancer_driver we describe here a new probabilistic_approach contrastrank to identify putative cancer_driver based on the estimation of the variation rates of genes in to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons

genome and tcga normal samples contrastrank can assign a score to each genome which can discriminate normal from the tumor_samples and amongst different tumor_types we tested the method on three whole exome_sequencing of adenocarcinomas from tcga our method performs highly in discriminating normal from tumor_samples as well as different types of adenocarcinomas in this paper we describe contrastrank a method that relies on the analysis of pigs in the tcga normal and cancer samples for prioritizing potential cancer_driver for each gene in each cancer type coad luad and prad we calculated probabilistic scores that allow us to discriminate tcga normal from tumor_samples in the following sections we described the results of our analysis of three tcga adenocarcinoma datasets and the performance of contrastrank algorithm on each tumor_type accurate variant_calling and appropriate filtering procedures are important prerequisites for the analysis of whole exome_sequencing although alternative variant_calling procedures can result in different number of variants the consistency of our datasets composition supplementary in terms of total snvs pdvs and pigs makes us confident about the average quality of nssnvs used in our analysis this is also confirmed by similar distributions of pdvs and nssnvs in each sample supplementary the general idea of using rare nssnvs is supported by the analysis of variants annotated in dbsnp supplementary furthermore the selection of as a threshold for defining pdvs is consistent with previously large_scale analysis of human genetic_variants the analysis of selected pdvs and the distribution of pdrs for pigs in each dataset genomes tcga normal and tumor_samples shows an increasing percentage of pigs with pdr from genomes to tcga tumor_samples supplementary on average for the three tumor_types coad luad and prad the number of pigs with pdrs are and in genomes tcga normal and tumor_samples respectively this observation is in agreement with the idea that samples for normal_tissues in patients affected by cancer can contain a high rate of putative functionally deleterious variants than samples from healthy_individuals constrastrank allows us to prioritize possible cancer_driver we first compared the performance of contrastrank against mutsigcv using three different manually_curated lists of cancer_related namely bushman cosmic census and vogelstein see section although a real evaluation of the performance is still a difficult_task in absence of a true benchmark set contrastrank performs better than mutsigcv for all three tumor_types under study supplementary using the fishers_exact to compare the number of oncogenes in highly ranked pigs and the number of oncogenes over the remaining genes we found p values lower than for all the benchmark sets in addition we found that eight of our highly ranked genes are included in the list of high significantly mutated colorectal cancer_genes provided by broad institute http cancergenome broadinstitute org the same analysis on luad dataset detected pigs between to of which are in the three cancer gene_lists comparing the fraction of oncogene in the highly ranked genes against the number of oncogenes on the remaining genes we found a significant p value lower than comparing our list of luad genes with score with the list provided by broad institute we found common genes over similar results are obtained for prostate_cancer for which we found a total number of highly scored genes to of which are also in the benchmark lists of cancer_related also in this case the comparison of the distributions of cancer_genes in low and high scored subset resulted in fishers_exact p values lower than in the case of prad the broad institute only reports one gene that is also included in the list of our highly scored genes all the numbers about the comparison between the gene_lists obtained using contrastrank and those in bushman cosmic census and vogelstein gene_lists are summarized in supplementary table s we showed that contrastrank scores could discriminate tcga normal from tumor_samples as well as different types of adenocarcinomas from each other using genes with score higher than we showed that our approach could discriminate tumor from normal samples with an overall accuracy and auc for each tumor_type see good levels of performances are also obtained in a more stringent test cv unseen in which the normal and tumor_samples with same identifier were kept disjoint supplementary furthermore the difference of contrastrank scores could discriminate different tumor_types using a cutoff score of the results show that in the worst_case luad our method reaches an average overall accuracy of and auc better performances are obtained for prad and coad these results are in agreement with the analysis of highly scored genes for each tumor_type using common size datasets composed by samples equally_distributed between positive_and cases we found and high scored genes average_score for coad luad and prad respectively comparing these lists of genes we found that and of highly scored pigs in prad and coad respectively are overlapping with highly scored genes in luad in this scenario luad seems to involve a larger spectrum of pigs with respect to coad and prad the observed heterogeneity could i contrastrank be explained by larger_sample for the luad dataset this reasoning is not true for coad that in spite of having around of the samples in the prad dataset supplementary results in higher number of high scored pigs our analysis also revealed that tp braf ar nbea rnf are the five common pigs across the three adenocarcinomas in conclusion in this paper we presented contastrank a new method for prioritizing cancer_related according to our analysis our method is able to detect already well known genes and identify new genes potentially involved in the insurgence and progression of tumor although we showed that contastrank reaches good performance even when compared against mutsigcv a further calibration of the method is needed before it could be applied to larger sets of genomic_data the main hurdles are standardization of the variant_calling procedure optimization of the method for selecting pdvs inclusion of other types of variants other than nonsynonymous and selection of representative set of normal samples that capture genetic_heterogeneity of each tumor_type
