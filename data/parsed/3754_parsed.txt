protein subcellular_localization of fluorescence imagery using spatial and transform domain features motivation subcellular_localization of proteins is one of the most significant characteristics of living_cells prediction of protein subcellular_locations is crucial to the understanding of various protein functions therefore an accurate computationally_efficient and reliable prediction system is required results in this article the predictions of various support_vector svm models have been combined through majority_voting the proposed ensemble svm subloc has achieved the highest success_rates of using hybrid features of haralick textures and local binary patterns harlbp using hybrid features of haralick textures and local ternary patterns harltp in addition svm subloc has yielded accuracy using only local ternary patterns ltps based features the dimensionality of harlbp feature_vector is compared with and for harltp and ltps respectively hence svm subloc in conjunction with ltps is fast sufficiently accurate and simple predictive system the proposed svm subloc approach thus provides superior prediction_performance using the reduced feature_space compared with existing_approaches availability a web_server accompanying the proposed prediction scheme is available at http svm subloccomprehension of the functions of proteins is of prime importance in the field of biological_sciences one of the significant characteristics of proteins is its subcellular_localization that reveals precious information regarding the working of proteins determining protein subcellular_locations is significant to the understanding of various protein functions for instance during the drug_discovery precise knowledge of the subcellular_localization of proteins can be useful for the identification of drugs in addition the effectiveness of drugs can be estimated by knowing the exact locations of proteins before and after using the drugs fluorescence_microscopy is frequently used to determine subcellular_localization of proteins in cells images of protein to whom correspondence should be addressed locations are normally analyzed in traditional ways which are time consuming and prone to errors automated approaches are thus required for the classification of such images these methods need to be computationally_efficient and accurate fortunately considerable progress is made in recent_years for the development of computational_methods that can automatically_determine the subcellular protein locations from fluorescence microscopy_images murphy et_al have developed subcellular_location feature slf sets and trained a back propagation neural_network bpnn to test the performance of these features using d hela dataset boland and murphy have tested the performance of haralick textures zernike moments slf and different combination of these three by employing the bpnns have trained bpnn using enhanced feature_sets consisting of haralick textures zernike moments and morphological_features have employed support_vector svm using various feature_extraction strategies including threshold adjacency statistics tass zernike moments as well as a hybrid of tass and haralick textures have developed automated classification system for protein subcellular_location images in multiresolution subspaces they have employed ann at different decomposition levels to obtain the classification results which are then combined through weight assignment have utilized random subspace of levenbergmarquardt neural_networks and adaboost learning algorithm in addition they have employed the fusion between these two ensemble classifiers while different local and global descriptors have been implemented as feature_sets recently have employed a random subspace of levenbergmarquardt neural_networks using optimized sets of various feature_extraction strategies including wavelet features haralick textures local binary patterns lbps local ternary patterns ltps and tass for d hela and locate mouse protein datasets the models proposed by different researchers have still margin in improving the prediction_accuracy and reducing the dimensionality of the feature_space the aim of this study is to develop an accurate and simple system compared with the existing_approaches we thus develop both individual and hybrid feature_based classification approaches for the prediction of protein subcellular_localization in the proposed approach we employ haralick textures zernike moments lbps ltps and tass based feature_extraction strategies different hybrid feature_sets are formed by concatenating these features the performance of various kernels of svm has been investigated using these features to enhance the performance of the proposed model the success_rates of different svms have been combined through majority_voting discrete wavelet transforms is used for the extraction of haralick textures and zernike moments only for this purpose we have decomposed the image upto four levels so that the best decomposition level could be detected then we have used statistical_measures to acquire haralick textures and zernike moments from each decomposed image rest of the article is organized as follows datasets and different feature_extraction strategies are described in section the proposed approach is presented in section results and discussions are elaborated in section conclusions are drawn at the end
