data_and gaussian interaction profile kernels for predicting drug_target interaction motivation the in silico prediction of potential interactions between drugs and target_proteins is of core importance for the identification of new drugs or novel targets for existing_drugs however only a tiny portion of all drugtarget_pairs in current datasets are experimentally_validated interactions this motivates the need for developing computational_methods that predict true interaction pairs with high_accuracy results we show that a simple machine_learning that uses the drugtarget network as the only source of information is capable of predicting true interaction pairs with high_accuracy specifically we introduce interaction profiles of drugs and of targets in a network which are binary vectors specifying the presence_or of interaction with every target drug in that network we define a kernel on these profiles called the gaussian interaction profile gip kernel and use a simple classifier kernel regularized least_squares rls for prediction drugtarget_interactions we test comparatively the effectiveness of rls with the gip kernel on four drugtarget_interaction used in previous_studies the proposed algorithm achieves area under the precisionrecall curve aupr up to significantly improving over results of state of the art methods moreover we show that using also kernels based on chemical and genomic_information further increases accuracy with a neat improvement on small_datasets these results substantiate the relevance of the network_topology in the form of interaction profiles as source of information for predicting drugtarget_interactions availability software and supplementary_material are available atthe in silico prediction of interaction between drugs and target_proteins is a core step in the drug_discovery for identifying new drugs or novel targets for existing_drugs in order to guide and speed up the laborious and costly experimental determination of drugtarget_interaction to whom correspondence should be addressed drugtarget_interaction data are available for many classes of pharmaceutically useful target_proteins including enzymes ion_channels g_protein gpcrs and nuclear_receptors several publicly_available databases have been built and maintained such as kegg brite drugbank glida supertarget and matador brenda and chembl containing drugtarget_interaction and other related sources of information like chemical and genomic_data a property of the current drugtarget interaction_databases is that they contain a rather small number of drugtarget_pairs which are experimentally_validated interactions this motivates the need for developing methods that predict true interacting pairs with high_accuracy recently machine_learning have been introduced to tackle this problem they can be viewed as instances of the more general link prediction_problem seefor a recent survey of this topic these methods are motivated by the observation that similar drugs tend to target similar proteins this property was shown for instance for chemical and side effect similarity and motivated the development of an integrated approach for drugtarget_interaction prediction a desirable property of this approach is that it does not require the d structure information of the target_proteins which is needed in traditional_methods based on docking_simulations the current state of the art for the in silico prediction of drug_target interaction is formed by methods that employ similarity_measures for drugs and for targets in the form by kernel functions like by using kernels multiple sources of information can be easily incorporated for performing prediction in different settings of the interaction prediction_problem are explored the authors make the distinction between known drugs or targets for which at least one interaction is in the training_set and new drugs or targets for which there is not there are then four possible settings depending on whether the drugs and or targets are known or new in this article we focus on the setting where both the drugs and targets are known that is we use known interactions for predicting novel ones we have presented a new kernel that leads to good predictive_performance as measured by aupr on the task of predicting interactions between drugs and target_proteins an interesting aspect of our gpi kernel is that it uses no properties beyond the interactions themselves this means that knowing the sequence of proteins and chemical_structure of drugs is perhaps not as important for this task as previously_thought for example on the ion_channel dataset our method with only the gip kernel has an auc score of and an aupr score of which improves upon the state of the art while using less prior information besides the gip kernel we have also introduced the rls kron algorithm that combines a kernel on drugs and a kernel on targets using the kronecker product compared with previous methods that do prediction with the two kernels independently and then combine the results this new method represents a small but consistent improvement by combining the gip kernel with chemical and genomic_information we get a method with excellent_performance this method has aupr scores of and on four datasets of drugtarget_interaction in humans representing an average improvement of points over previous results the aupr is a particularly relevant metric for this problem because it is very sensitive to the correctness of the highest ranked predictions the large improvement in aupr suggests that the top_ranked putative drugtarget_interactions found by our method are more likely to be correct than those found in previous methods a limitation of all machine_learning for finding new drugtarget_interactions is that they are sensitive to inherent biases contained in the training data it would be interesting to try and analyze the bias of existing datasets of drugtarget_interaction but this is out of the scope of this article note also that the datasets byused in this article do not include any singletons each drug interacts with at least one target and each target interacts with at least one drug this property could affect the cross_validation results by allowing a limited form of cheating however the experiments in section show that our method also works when tested in other ways a further limitation of the approach used in this article is that it can only be applied to detect new interactions for a target or a drug for which at least one interaction has already been established therefore biologists can use the method as guidance for extending their knowledge about the interaction of a drug or of a target not for discovering interactions of a new drug or target that is one for which no interaction is known in particular our method is useful for experimentalist to aid in experimental_design and interpretation especially in solving problems related to drugtarget selectivity and polypharmacology there are several ways in which the result might further be improved so_far we have used uninformative choices of the parameters and of these choices we have only investigated the last one perhaps with tuning of the other parameters better predictions are possible although one has to be careful not to over fit them to the data another avenue for improvement is in using more information about drugs and targets since combining the gip kernel with chemical and genomic kernels leads to a better predictive_performance perhaps adding different information in the form of additional kernels would yield further improvements these kernels could be interaction profile kernels based on other types data such as proteinprotein_interaction similarly for each pair of interacting drug and target more information is known beyond the fact they interact for example the type of interaction the binding_strength the mechanism of discovery and its uncertainty might all be known in this article we have made no use of this additional information nor did we attempt to predict the type or strength of interactions
