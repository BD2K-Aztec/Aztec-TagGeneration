structural_bioinformatics imod multipurpose normal_mode in internal coordinates motivation dynamic simulations of systems with biologically_relevant sizes and time scales are critical for understanding macromolecular functioning coarse_grained representations combined with normal_mode nma have been established as an alternative to atomistic simulations the versatility and efficiency of current approaches normally based on cartesian coordinates can be greatly_enhanced with internal coordinates ic results here we present a new versatile_tool chest to explore conformational_flexibility of both protein and nucleic_acid using nma in ic consideration of dihedral_angles as variables reduces the computational_cost and non physical distortions of classical cartesian nma methods our proposed_framework operates at different coarse_grained levels and offers an efficient framework to conduct nma based conformational studies including standard vibrational analysis monte_carlo or pathway exploration examples of these approaches are shown to demonstrate its applicability robustness and efficiency dynamic simulations of large_molecules long enough to observe functional changes are challenging normal_mode nma merged with coarse_grained cg models has proven to be a powerful and popular alternative to simulate collective motions of macromolecular_complexes at extended timescales the cg nma application range includes the prediction of biologically_relevant motions of proteins and nucleic_acids even with low_resolution structures x_ray refinement protein and ligand_docking flexible fitting of atomic_structures into electron_microscopy density maps efficient generation of conformational pathways and identification to whom correspondence should be addressed of conserved dynamic_patterns within protein_families nma describes the relevant collective motions based on the harmonic approximation around a local minimum which allows for solving the lagrangian equations of motion by diagonalizing the hessian and kinetic_energy matrices the resulting eigenvectors are a set of orthogonal displacements or normal_modes the high_frequency modes represent localized displacements whereas low_energy modes correspond to collective conformational changes these collective motions are closely_related to functional motions and they have been correlated with essential motions extracted from molecular_simulations these results and many others validate the use of nma and cg modeling to describe molecular flexibility serving as a powerful alternative to costly atomistic simulations for relatively large systems the main bottleneck of nma is the diagonalization step that can easily go beyond standard computers the vast_majority of current nma approaches have adopted cartesian coordinates cc as variables however internal coordinate ic method requires at least one third less degrees_of dof and hence reduces both computational time and memory_usage moreover in cc the covalent_bonding geometry is not implicitly preserved thus allowing potential non physical geometrical distortions the mathematical simplicity e g kinetic_energy matrix is reduced to the identity and its straightforward implementation are behind the cc preference nevertheless several exceptions have shown the ic potential rewards early work by go and others led to the development of a complete mathematical framework using dihedral_angles this full atomic approximation has been extended to include even bond stretching and angle bending promode is a full atom nma repository where users can only explore pre_computed results of proteins the integration of cg approximations with ic also has been successfully explored pioneering work by tirion with elastic network models in ic has been continued by others however the scope of these approaches is mainly theoretical and none of them are accessible as functional tool here we present a new multipurpose tool chest named imod to exploit the benefits of classical nma formulations in ic while extending them to cover multiscale modeling ordinary torsion_angles are maintained as variables whereas different graining levels were incorporated to represent protein_structure e g with only carbons these atomic_models can be easily combined with several elastic networks in a highly customizable framework including user_defined potential or the immobilization of parts of the macromolecular system by removing their dihedral_angle variables imod has been designed to be versatile and can handle also multiple chains nucleic_acids and rigid ligands the versatility and efficiency of this new integrative framework expand the applicability range of nma especially to very large systems here we show its robustness describing several representative conformational_transitions we also illustrate its applicability in two simulation contexts conformational_sampling and pathway trajectory generation in this section we illustrate the use of low_frequency modal spectra by our ic cg nma approximations to describe protein_flexibility
