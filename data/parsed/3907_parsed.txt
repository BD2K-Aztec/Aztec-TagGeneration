structural_bioinformatics rcsb_pdb mobile ios and android mobile_apps to provide data access and visualization to the rcsb protein_data the research collaboratory for structural_bioinformatics protein_data rcsb_pdb resource provides tools for query analysis and visualization of the d structures in the pdb archive as the mobile web is starting to surpass desktop and laptop usage scientists and educators are beginning to integrate mobile_devices into their research and teaching in response we have developed the rcsb_pdb mobile app for the ios and android mobile platforms to enable fast and convenient access to rcsb_pdb data and services using the app users from the general public to expert researchers can quickly search and visualize biomolecules and add personal annotations via the rcsb pdbs integrated mypdb service availability_and rcsb_pdb mobile is freely_available from the apple app store and google play http www rcsb org the popularity of mobile computing devices such as smart phones and tablets ensures that they play significant roles in our daily lives the cpu speed memory resources and graphics display capabilities of these devices have become increasingly powerful and sophisticated and can support advanced applications whether at work home or on the go an early example of such an app is the hematopoietic expression viewer which provides access to microarray_gene access to data and content rich life_science resources such as the protein_data pdb through the research collaboratory for structural_bioinformatics rcsb_pdb web_site can however prove problematic on tablets and more so on hand_held devices such as smart phones even with adaptively written web_sites that auto format content for the mobile_device screen dimensions web_site content can be difficult to navigate using pinch to zoom capability of mobile platforms as a result customized apps have become popular using mobile operating_systems platform native widgets and capabilities to provide responsive and easily navigable information pathways another mobile specific challenge involves biomolecular structure visualization on mobile platforms such as ios and android a comprehensive feature comparison of available viewers is available these platforms do not support java applets such as jmol and their cpu capability is often insufficient to achieve acceptable responsive interactivity with software based rendering one possible work around would be the use of webgl a mechanism that provides the ability to use hardware accelerated d rendering through a web_browser however it is not fully supported on all mobile platform browsers following requests from our users who have ios and android devices we initiated the development of native clients the ios and android clients described provide fast lowbandwidth access to data and services provided by the rcsb_pdb funding the rcsb_pdb is a member of the worldwide protein_data and is funded by grantprovided by the national_science the national_institutes and the department of energy conflict of interest none declared
