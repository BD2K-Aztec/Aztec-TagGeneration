chippcr an r package to pre process raw_data of amplification curves motivation both the quantitative_real qpcr and quantitative isothermal amplification qia are standard methods for nucleic_acid quantification numerous real_time read out technologies have been developed despite the continuous interest in amplification based techniques there are only few tools for pre_processing of amplification data however a transparent tool for precise control of raw_data is indispensable in several scenarios for example during the development of new instruments results chippcr is an r package for the pre_processing and quality analysis of raw_data of amplification curves the package takes_advantage of rs s object model and offers an extensible environment chippcr contains tools for raw_data exploration normalization baselining imput ation of missing_values a powerful wrapper for amplification curve smoothing and a function to detect the start and end of an amplification curve the capabilities of the software are enhanced by the implementation of algorithms unavailable in r such as a point stencil for derivative interpolation simulation tools statistical_tests plots for data_quality management amplification efficiency quantification cycle calculation and datasets from qpcr and qia experiments are part of the package core functionalities are integrated in guis web_based and standalone shiny applications thus streamlining analysis and report generation availability_and http cran r project org_web chippcr source_code quantitative_polymerase qpcr and quantitative isothermal amplification qia are standard methods used for nucleic_acid qpcr and qia are used in real_time monitoring technologies such as our previously_reported videoscan technology microfluidics and point of care devices to quantify nucleic_acids by specific curve parameters like the quantification point cq the fundamental steps of amplification curve analysis are i raw_data read in ii pre_processing e g noise_reduction iii amplification curve processing e g cq calculation iv post_processing and v data export report generation reliable data flow between all steps is a requirement for the proper optimization e g the taguchi method of amplification reactions r is widely used in bioinformatics and an early adopter of novel technologies e g digital pcr nanostring ncounter platform available r packages focus on the read in and post_processing of data from commercial qpcr systems r packages for the amplification analysis steps and cited earlier are available gehlenborg however r packages for the pre_processing and quality analysis of raw_data of amplification curves are unavailable preprocessing in most commercial cyclers is a black_box which restrains reproducible_research the development and optimization of equipment would benefit from the availability of a software capable of pre_processing raw_data pre_processing algorithms remove stochastic errors and artefacts supplementary section s and provide the means for raw_data inspection and transformation in a format suitable for successive analysis steps e g smoothing imputation data reduction e g removal of invalid sets and data_quality management misinterpretations are more likely if arbitrary corrections are performed and a manual alteration is contradictory to reproducible_research the chippcr lab_on pcr package was developed to automatize pre_processing analysis visualization and quality_control of qpcr and qia experiments r enables sophisticated_statistical and reproducible cross_platform analysis and quick adaptation to changing experimental_setups moreover it is advantageous to set up workflows in an open environment which offers graphical_user guis downstream_analyses facilities powerful data visualizations and report generation the target_audience encompasses developers and users who process raw_data from commercial_systems
