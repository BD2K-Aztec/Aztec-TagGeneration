gene_expression mining metabolic_pathways through gene_expression motivation an observed metabolic_response is the result of the coordinated_activation and interaction between multiple genetic_pathways however the complex structure of metabolism has meant that a compete understanding of which pathways are required to produce an observed metabolic_response is not fully understood in this article we propose an approach that can identify the genetic_pathways which dictate the response of metabolic_network to specific experimental_conditions results our approach is a combination of probabilistic_models for pathway ranking clustering and classification first we use a non parametric pathway extraction method to identify the most highly_correlated paths through the metabolic_network we then extract the defining structure within these top_ranked pathways using both markov_clustering and classification algorithms furthermore we define detailed node and edge annotations which enable us to track each pathway not only with respect to its genetic dependencies but also allow for an analysis of the interacting reactions compounds and kegg sub networks we show that our approach identifies biologically_meaningful pathways within two microarray expression datasets using entire kegg metabolic_networks availability_and an r package containing a full implementation of our proposed method is currently available fromcoordinated gene_expression along specific pathways determines which metabolic compounds can be synthesized and therefore can be used to infer the function of an entire network much of the networked structure of metabolism has already been identified and is readily available through databases such as kegg these databases reveal that even for simple organisms the complete metabolic_network is large and highly complex this mixture of network size and complexity is sufficient to hide the key pathways which define the response of the metabolic_network to external_stimuli consequently models of global metabolic_networks to whom correspondence should be addressed are required to identify the specific pathways that are driving an observed metabolic_response metabolism of specific models such as network expansion flux_balance fba and constraints based modeling model the chemical_properties of metabolic_networks the simplest of these network expansion uses the natural limits imposed by the stoichiometry of each reaction to identify the scope of a each compound within the network the goal of network expansion is to determine a minimum set of compounds required to fully reproduce the entire network fba and constraint_based are explicit physical_models of the chemistry that control metabolic_networks physical_models of metabolism explicitly_model the flux through the reactions in order to predict the amount of each compound being produced during an experiment both physical_models and network expansion approaches focus heavily on the chemical_properties of the metabolic_network and do not directly consider the genetic_component of a metabolic_network extensions to these approaches to include a genetic effect within model have been proposed however these extensions are limited to binary representations of gene_expression and do not consider relationships within the gene_expression along pathways or within subnetworks a considerable amount of research has been undertaken to identify the genetic_factors which dictate the function of metabolic_networks of particular note are methods relating to gene_set gsea which seek to identify known groups of genes that have a non random response to an external stimulus gsea methods identify important groups of genes by first ranking all genes using test_statistics such as t tests or correlation_coefficients and then testing to see if specific groups are at the top or bottom of the ranked_list however gsea methods rely on the structure of simple test_statistics that do not explicitly use the known networked structure of genes furthermore they can only indicate which large pre specified groups of genes are important and do not allow for partial_responses where only some genes within these known groups are related the observed response machine_learning such as graph_based kernels or penalized approaches overcome the limitations of gsea and use feature_selection to identify functional network_components however neither graph_kernels nor penalized approaches can strictly enforce that the features identified are logically connected within the network and therefore may produce results that are difficult to justify biologically probabilistic network models such as those described in wei and li andcan enforce these features
