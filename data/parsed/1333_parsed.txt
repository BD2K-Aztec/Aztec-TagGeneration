designing alternative_splicing rna_seq studies beyond generic guidelines motivation designing an rna_seq study depends critically on its specific goals technology and underlying biology which renders general_guidelines inadequate we propose a bayesian_framework to customize experiments so that goals can be attained and resources are not wasted with a focus on alternative_splicing results we studied how read_length sequencing_depth library_preparation and the number of replicates affects cost_effectiveness of single sample and group comparison studies optimal settings varied strongly according to the target_organism or tissue potential cost cuts and interestingly short_reads outperformed long_reads for standard analyses our framework learns key_characteristics for study_design from the data and predicts if and how to continue experimentation these predictions matched several follow_up experimental_datasets that were used for validation we provide default pipelines but the framework can be combined with other data analysis methods and can help assess their relative_merits availability_and casper package at www bioconductor org_packages release bioc html casper html supplementary manual by typing casperdesign at the r prompt contact the design of an rna_seq experiment is crucial for its validity and an adequate use of resources but is typically not assessed in detail general_guidelines ignore critical aspects such as the specific research goals or the nature of the studied phenomenon e g encode guidelines_recommend million m paired_end of base_pairs bp for expression estimation and m read_pairs of bp for novel transcript discovery as we show below the adequacy of such guidelines can change significantly between studies several experimental_design strategies were recently_proposed and li and dewey developed an rna_seq simulator for single sample studies considering mapping issues and situations where a reference transcriptome is unavailable respectively given a series of experimental_protocols the simulation pipeline ofcan explore the potential effects of various biases and settings and rossell and m ller proposed sample_size to compare overall gene_expression across two groups where interestingly these can be based on pilot or public data and hence incorporate some of the characteristics of this study these strategies focus mostly on specific settings such as one sample studies a given data analysis or technology e g short_reads here we propose a general framework for either single or multi sample studies targeting gene or isoform_expression that is flexible to accommodate any goal technology including long_reads and data analysis the approach is guided by bayesian_decision where v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com key_characteristics of the phenomenon under study or the technology are learnt as data become available and importantly the uncertainty associated to these unknown characteristics is formally taken into account in a mathematically coherent manner the goal is to provide recommendations tailored to each study such as sequencing settings the potential benefits of conducting further experimentation or the relative_merits of different data analysis strategies additionally the framework can also pinpoint general principles such as the balance between increasing sample_size versus sequencing_depth or assess the cost_effectiveness of short_reads versus long_reads from the latest sequencing_technologies in an era when high_throughput and big_data are having a profound impact on biomedical_research experimental_design continues to be critical for the validity of science unfortunately design considerations are often overlooked perhaps encouraged partly by a naive feeling that with good enough technology design considerations are less important and partly by practical difficulties such as the lack of available tools to address these challenges we proposed a general framework for rna_seq experiments firmly grounded in bayesian_decision and statistical_design of experiments we focused on rna_seq but the framework can serve as a basis to design other experiments e g proteomics genome_wide etc the key components for such extensions are a model that offers a good probabilistic representation of the datagenerating process a utility function or multiple_criteria that assess cost_effectiveness taking_into the characteristics of the problem at hand and a computational strategy that produces answerswithin a practical time frame although there are other possible routes to specify these components bayesian_models equipped with posterior and posterior predictive sampling algorithms become a convenient choice that allow implementing our framework in a straightforward manner our results indicate that it is important to go beyond default guidelines to consider each individual study i e to customize the design by taking_into the target_organism or likely expression levels for the tissue of interest one may cut sequencing_costs by a factor of and still estimate expression at a good precision similarly for multisample studies where the ability to find differential_expression depends critically on between groups differences relative to within groups variability and other characteristics for instance the contrast between gse and gse resembles differences between studies encountered in practice in the underlying biology technology used or even the target transcriptome that one wishes to make inference for by adapting to such context specific characteristics customized designs are a promising and currently under explored framework to help researchers decide if and how to conduct high_throughput studies in a statistically principled manner the associated savings in time and experimentation are not only ethical but also help focus research_efforts where they are more likely to yield useful results
