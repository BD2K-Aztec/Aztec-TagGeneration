structural_bioinformatics shape_complementarity and hydrogen_bond preferences in protein_protein implications for antibody modeling and protein protein_docking motivations characterizing proteinprotein_interfaces and the hydrogen_bonds is a first step to better understand proteins structures and functions toward high_resolution protein design however there are few large_scale surveys of hydrogen_bonds of interfaces in addition previous work of shape_complementarity of protein_complexes suggested that lower shape complementar ity in antibodyantigen interfaces is related to their evolutionary origin results using non redundant proteinprotein_interfaces we revealed peculiar features of various protein complex types in contrast to previous_findings the shape_complementarity of anti bodyantigen interfaces resembles that of the other interface types these results highlight the importance of hydrogen_bonds during evolution of protein interfaces and rectify the prevailing belief that antibodies have lower shape_complementarity interactions are one of the most fundamental activities of biomolecules disturbance of these interactions underlie biological disorders including cancers and neurodegenerative_diseases characterizing interactions is important to understand the detailed mechanisms of life complementarity is a key concept in molecular_recognition previous_studies have extracted common features of proteinprotein_interfaces and revealed peculiar features of particular classes of interfaces traditional structural surveys of proteinprotein_interactions often divided complexes into hetero dimers and homo dimers and into different functional_classes such as antibodyantigen enzyme inhibitor substrate and other complexes a key driving_force of molecular_recognition and specificity is forming hydrogen_bonds and salt_bridges unlike salt_bridges hydrogen_bonds are orientation dependent hence modulating hydrogen_bond networks is critical for specificity in protein_engineering and design hydrogen_bonds are also crucial for protein_folding where the patterns formed define secondary_structure based on protein_complexes nussinov and co workers reported that backbonebackbone hydrogen_bonds are dominant within protein_structures whereas side chainside chain hydrogen_bonds are most common across proteinprotein_interfaces another important factor in the complementarity of molecular_recognition is the shape of the interfaces there are several analyses on shape_complementarity of protein interfaces in such an analysis based onthat the shape_complementarity of antibodyantigen interfaces was lower on average than that of proteinprotein_interfaces in general antibodies evolve independently of foreign_antigens while other proteins involved in proteinprotein_interactions typically evolve with their counterparts so that the shape_complementarity of general interfaces is optimized by both partners however a later analysis with two high_resolution suggested that the observed lower shape_complementarity of antibodyantigen complexes was due to the low quality of the crystal_structures since the discussions were based on a limited number of proteinprotein_complexes a more comprehensive analysis of the complementarities of the interfaces is required to understand the essential nature of molecular_recognition and to guide the rational_design of protein_therapeutics the question is relevant today as computational_design efforts strive to create de_novo interfaces by optimizing only one protein in the pair as antibodies do antibodies provide a natural system that can demonstrate what level of shape_complementarity is possible in single_sided interface design in this study we focus on hydrogen_bond networks using non redundant protein_complexes our main dataset includes antibody v l v h light and heavy variable_domain pairs antibodyprotein antigen_complexes antibodypeptide antigen_complexes enzymeinhibitor substrate complexes other complexes and obligate complexes for a reference we also analyzed and proteinprotein_interfaces of hetero and homodimers the analyses reveal peculiar features of each protein complex type we discuss the impact on antibody modeling docking_simulations and interface designs
