sequence_analysis oases robust de_novo rna_seq assembly across the dynamic range of expression levels motivation high_throughput has made the analysis of new model_organisms more affordable although assembling a new genome can still be costly and difficult it is possible to use rna_seq to sequence mrna in the absence of a known genome it is necessary to assemble these sequences de_novo taking_into possible alternative isoforms and the dynamic range of expression values results we present a software_package named oases designed to heuristically assemble rna_seq in the absence of a reference_genome across a broad_spectrum of expression values and in presence of alternative isoforms it achieves this by using an array of hash lengths a dynamic filtering of noise a robust resolution of alternative_splicing and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies it was tested on human and mouse rna_seq and is shown to improve significantly on the transabyss and trinity de_novo transcriptome assemblers next_generation of expressed mrnas rna_seq is gradually transforming the field of transcriptomics the first attempts to discover expressed gene isoforms relied on mapping the rna_seq onto the exons and exonexon junctions of a known annotation consequently reference based ab_initio methods have been developed to assemble a transcriptome from rna_seq using read_alignments alone inferring the underlying annotation unfortunately the use of a reference_genome is not always possible despite the drop in the cost of sequencing reagents the complete study of a genome from sampling to finishing the assembly is still costly and difficult sometimes the model being studied is sufficiently different from the reference because it comes from a different strain or line such that the mappings are not altogether reliable for these cases de_novo genome_assemblers have been employed to create transcript assemblies or transfrags from the rna_seq in the absence of a reference_genome however these short_read genomic assemblers based mainly on de_bruijn genomic assemblers make implicit assumptions regarding the evenness of the coverage and the colinearity of the sequence indeed the coverage depth fluctuates significantly between transcripts isoforms and regions of the transcript therefore it cannot be used to determine the uniqueness of regions or to isolate erroneous sequence in addition these tools are geared to produce long linear contigs from the given sequence not to detect the overlapping sequences presented by isoforms of a single gene this affects a number of steps including error_correction repeat detection and read_pair usage these methods are therefore not necessarily suited to process transcriptome_data which does not conform to either of these assumptions more recently transcriptome_assembly pipelines were developed to post process the output of de_novo genome_assemblers velvet and abyss the common idea shared by these pipelines is to run an assembler at different k_mer lengths and to merge these assemblies into one the rationale behind this approach is to merge more sensitive lower values of k and more specific assemblies higher values of k the pipeline presented by transabyss also handles alternative_splicing variants it detects them by searching for connected groups of contigs such that they are connected in a characteristic bubble and one of the contigs has a length of exactly k these bubbles are first removed then added to the final assemblies to reconstruct alternate variants a variety of algorithmic researchers have used splicing graphs to represent alternative_splicing which have a direct relationship to de_bruijn as pointed_out bywe have shown that merging different single k assemblies is beneficial in concordance with previous work surget oases employs dynamic cutoffs where possible to allow for a robust reconstruction with different k values however detailed parameter_optimization for oases and trans abyss may lead to further improvements overall the de_novo methods produced large_numbers of misassemblies given the dynamic ranges involved the exact parameter_settings of these programs define a trade_off between sensitivity and accuracy in these experiments oases tends to be more sensitive trinity more accurate the correlation of small k_mer assemblies and misassembly rates suggests that homologies between genes are the main source of errors as reads get longer and coverage depths greater sensitivity will only increase and users will probably avoid the shorter k_mer lengths for greater_accuracy short k_mers will only be necessary to retrieve the very rare transcripts an independent but significant factor to these assemblies is read preprocessing as read error removal has already been shown to have a significant impact in the context of de_novo interestingly the comparison of reconstructed transcripts for the three de_novo methods inreveals that each method outperforms the others on a separate set of transcripts these differences in performance are probably due to the different strategies employed to remove errors a more aggressive method which discards more data would presumably end up with many gaps on low expression data whereas a more lenient algorithm would leave too many ambiguities at high coverage in particular it appears that the performance of all the assemblers sometimes drops at very high coverage depths this is probably linked to increased noise indeed this drop is especially marked for transabyss which to our knowledge is the only of the three de_novo assemblers not to integrate dynamic filters which adapt with coverage depth intriguingly transabyss outperformed trinity in our experiments contrary to the observation of this could not be due to the parameterization of trinity which cannot be parameterized apart from the insert length instead the larger k range used for transabyss and the lower sequencing_depth in our analyzed data_sets may explain this discrepancy as transabyss was shown to perform especially well for low to medium expressed genes similarly our experiments on mouse data show a bigger gap between cufflinks and the de_novo assemblers than observed by in their work the comparison was focused on the set of oracle transcripts which show sufficient coverage of exact k_mers in the reads however no such restriction was applied here and cufflinks surpasses the de_novo methods for low to medium expression ranges where coverage is sparse in this study we did not analyze strand specific rna_seq however as these datasets become more available oases already supports this data during the hashing phase reverse complement sequences can be stored separately instead of being joined as the two strands of the same sequence oases provides users with a robust pipeline to assemble unmapped rna_seq into full_length transcripts oases was designed to deal with the conditions of rna_seq namely uneven coverage and alternative_splicing our results show how crucial it is to explore and understand the relevant conditions alternative_splicing can significantly confound
