sequence_analysis funframe functional gene ecological analysis_pipeline pyrosequencing of s rdna is widely used to study microbial_communities and a rich set of software_tools support this analysis pyrosequencing of protein_coding which can help elucidate functional differences among microbial_communities significantly lags behind s rdna in availability of sequence_analysis software in both settings frequent homopolymer read errors inflate the estimation of microbial_diversity and de_noising is required to reduce that bias here we describe funframe an r based data analysis_pipeline that uses recently described algorithms to de noise functional gene pyrosequences and performs ecological analysis on de noised sequence_data the novelty of this pipeline is that it provides users a unified set of tools adapted from disparate sources and designed for different applications that can be used to examine a particular protein_coding of interest we evaluated funframe on functional_genes from four pcr_amplified clones with sequence depths ranging from to sequences funframe produced from one to nine operational taxanomic units for each clone resulting in an error_rate ranging from to importantly funframe reduced spurious diversity while retaining more sequences than a commonly used de_noising method that discards sequences with frameshift errors availability software documentation and a complete set of sample data_files are available atpyrosequencing of s rdna is commonly used to study microbial_community and existing bioinformatics_pipelines are primarily designed for the analysis of s rdna noise from dna sequencing_errors upwardly biases the estimates of microbial_diversity substantial progress has been made to remove noise artifacts from s rdna sequence_datasets targeted metagenomics of protein_coding offers the possibility of focusing on the diversity abundance and expression of specific genes particularly those genes that encode enzymes critical to biogeochemical cycling protein_coding fundamentally differ from non coding s rdna in that the genetic_code implicitly constrains the sequences to the amino coding triplets this distinction is particularly relevant with pyrosequencing as the technology is prone to misread the lengths of long homopolymers thereby creating the appearance of frameshift_mutations to reduce the inflated diversity bias with proteincoding_genes a commonly used approach discards sequences containing unexpected stop_codons a more nuanced error_detection algorithm hmm frame was recently_introduced in hmm frame a hidden_markov hmm of the target protein combined with a probabilistic_model of homopolymer errors detects and corrects the frameshifts caused by homopolymer read errors in addition the algorithm reports hmm alignment scores which can be used in downstream quality filtering to facilitate targeted metagenomics using pcr_amplified protein_coding we produced funframe a complete bioinformatics pipeline that uses hmm frame followed by chimera detection operational taxanomic unit otu clustering rarefaction and diversity estimation supplementary additionally funframe performs clustering and ordination using unifrac and braycurtis metrics supplementary figs s and s contrasting with the s rdna pipelines qiime and mothur funframe centers around the r project for statistical computing r core which facilitates analysis with a rich set of ecological statistical and visualization_tools
