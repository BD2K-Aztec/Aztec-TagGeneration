data_and qtlminer qtl database curation by mining tables in literature motivation figures and tables in biomedical_literature record vast_amounts of important experiment results in scientific_papers for example quantitative_trait qtl information is usually presented in tables however most of the popular text_mining focus on extracting knowledge from unstructured free_text as far as we know there are no published works on mining tables in biomedical_literature in this article we propose a method to extract qtl information from tables and plain_text found in literature heterogeneous and complex tables were converted into a structured database combined with information extracted from plain_text our method could greatly reduce labor burdens involved with database curation results we applied our method on a soybean qtl database curation from which records were extracted from papers with a precision rate of and a recall_rate of f value for the method is a quantitative_trait qtl is a region of dna that is associated with a particular phenotypic trait and is important information for breeding and gene_cloning qtl studies have a long and rich history a large number of articles recording the experiment results of qtl_mapping have been published in recent_years to allow researchers to query qtl information easily several databases have been developed by manually curating the information scattered in the literature however manual_curation is labor_intensive work and it is impossible to remain current with the rapidly increasing numbers of articles consequently automatic_methods are necessary for qtl database development unlike other experiment results such as genome and molecular data qtl information is usually presented in tables especially in scientific_papers it is difficult to extract such information using traditional text_mining that focus on mining knowledge in unstructured plain_text although knowledge hidden in tables and figures has_received as far as we know there are only a few works on web table mining and no published work on mining tables in biomedical_literature in this article we present a pipeline for automatically mining qtl information from scientific_literature a flowchart of this process is shown in we started the process by locating qtl tables in articles the tables were then converted into twodimensional qtl databases the natural_language process method was used to extract information that was not presented in tables including captions footnotes and full text lastly contentverification and duplication checks were performed on the outputs of previous steps we applied this pipeline for soybean qtl database curation with a precision rate of and f value of this software can also be used to construct qtl databases for other species we applied this pipeline for soybean qtl database construction from which records were automatically extracted from papers the precision rate of the mining results was compared with the records in the soybase qtl database we collected more records from the literature we also tested our pipeline on the literature listed on the soybase website which was used for manual_curation with a recall_rate up to this method is also suitable for development of comprehensive qtl databases for a wide_range of species
