databases_and accelerated similarity searching and clustering of large compound sets by geometric embedding and locality sensitive hashing motivation similarity searching and clustering of chemical_compounds by structural_similarities are important computational_approaches for identifying drug like small_molecules most algorithms available for these tasks are limited by their speed and scalability and cannot handle todays large compound databases with several million entries results in this article we introduce a new algorithm for accelerated similarity searching and clustering of very large compound sets using embedding and indexing ei techniques first we present ei search as a general_purpose similarity_search method for finding objects with similar features in large_databases and apply it here to searching and clustering of large compound sets the method embeds the compounds in a high_dimensional euclidean_space and searches this space using an efficient index aware nearest_neighbor search method based on locality sensitive hashing lsh second to cluster large compound sets we introduce the ei clustering_algorithm that combines the ei search method with jarvispatrick clustering both methods were tested on three large_datasets with sizes ranging from about to over million_compounds in comparison to sequential search_methods the ei search method was times_faster while maintaining comparable recall_rates the ei clustering method allowed us to significantly reduce the cpu time required to cluster these large compound libraries from several months to only a few days availability software implementations and online services have been developed based on the methods introduced in this study the online services provide access to the generated clustering_results and ultra_fast similarity searching of the pubchem compound database with subsecond response time software_tools for mining the available small_molecule space play_an in many bioscience and biomedical areas to whom correspondence should be addressed they are ranging from drug_discovery chemical_biology and chemical genomics to medicinal_chemistry currently the structures of over million distinct small_molecules are available in open_access databases like pubchem chembank nci chemmine chemdb and zinc to analyze these important data resources efficient structure similarity_search tools are essential for retrieving chemical and bioactivity information from databases in addition they are often useful for predicting bioactive_small a variety of structure similarity search_methods are available reviewed by unfortunately they are often not fast enough for systematic_analyses of very large compound collections with millions of compounds this is because most of these methods sequentially compare a query structure against all entries in the database and then rank the results by a chosen scoring system and thus the cost to perform similarity_searches grows linearly with the size of the compound database therefore more efficient and sophisticated search_methods need to be developed to utilize the available chemical_space efficiently clustering of compound sets is essential on practically all stages of the discovery process of bioactive_compounds reviewed by commonly structure similarity based clustering utilizes the pairwise similarity_measures generated by the above compound search_methods to partition the data into discrete groups of similar compounds an example is jarvispatrick clustering which is among the most widely used clustering_methods in cheminformatics alternatively they can be used to build hierarchical trees that represent the similarity relationships among all items in a compound dataset one of the main challenges in this area is the difficulty to cluster the millions of compound structures that are currently available in the public_domain this is because many cluster_analysis approaches multiply the complexity of a chosen similarity_search method by the number of compounds in the dataset they often require the calculation of all againstall similarities for the compounds under investigation and the computational_cost grows quadratically with the size of the dataset therefore novel clustering_methods need to be developed for exploring this vast chemical_space efficiently page
