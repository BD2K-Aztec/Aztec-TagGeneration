astream an r package for annotating lc_ms metabolomic_data astream an r statistical software_package for the curation and identification of feature peaks extracted from liquid_chromatography lc_ms metabolomics_data is described astream detects isotopic fragment and adduct patterns by identifying feature pairs that fulfill expected relational patterns data reduction by astream allows compounds to be identified reliably and subsequently linked to metabolite databases astream provides researchers with a fast reliable tool for summarizing metabolomic_data notably reducing curation time and increasing consistency of results availability the astream r package and a study example can be freely accessed atrecent improvements in chromatographic technologies and spectrometry analysis techniques have increased the use of metabolomics for disease diagnosis and in systems_biology liquid_chromatography lc_ms is a powerful and widely used method for identifying and quantifying metabolites in biological_samples after applying a data pre_processing algorithm a large set of feature peaks is usually obtained for each sample each feature is characterized by a particular retention time mass to charge m z value and an intensity measurement that is correlated with the relative concentration of the particular metabolite bioinformatic_methods such as xcms can perform these complex pre_processing however once the set of feature peaks is obtained a time consuming and error_prone manual_curation step is required particularly when an untargeted metabolomic_analysis needs to be performed the main objectives of the curation step are to reduce redundancy between the various chemical_forms detected in one compound e g carbon isotopes adducts fragments and to identify characteristics with a higher probability of being true biological_features rather than being generated by noise artifacts or potential sample contamination to whom correspondence should be addressed astream has been developed in order to facilitate the curation step of the analytical flow of metabolomic experiments using robust measures from relational patterns astream quickly identifies the set of metabolites that most reliably represents the metabolomic profile of each sample page an lc_ms dataset obtained from human_serum was used to evaluate astream performance ibaez l and correig x unpublished_data for illustration purposes the samples were randomly_assigned as n controls and n cases of note randomization does not influence astream metabolite annotation only the significance value for differential_expression after raw data_processing analysis had been applied using the xcms package a total of n features were generated this pre processed metabolomic dataset is included in the astream library using this dataset astream was used to process the large feature list into a curated non redundant metabolite set the quality_control step allowed one serum_sample to be identified displaying an outlying feature distribution and this was automatically discarded from further analyses supplementary in addition the observed retention time differences and correlation histograms of all feature pairs supplementary_material were used to select the optimal feature pair selection thresholds on the basis of this information a maximum retention time difference of s and a minimum correlation value of were used in the present analysis supplementary_material and supplementary table s the final number of feature pairs passing the filters was n from a total of n possible pairs i e after the mass to charge ratio m z tolerance for isotope and adduct searching was set to e according to the precision of the particular lc_ms equipment used a total of isotope patterns were obtained supplementaryand supplementary of these isotope patterns patterns were linked to other features corresponding to different adducts present in the samples supplementary in the final curated set of metabolomic compounds generated by astream supplementary all features were characterized by a minimum of two isotopic peaks thereby increasing confidence in the metabolite annotation in conclusion applying astream to the present dataset resulted in a fold reduction i e from n features to n annotated compounds in the number of metabolite features importantly this non redundant set of features fulfilled the expected relational patterns associated with lc_ms analysis and had an increased probability of being true_positive signals astream allows researchers interested in performing lc_ms metabolomic_studies to use a practical and robust tool for analyzing data obtained from this type of experiment
