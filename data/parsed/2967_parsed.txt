genome_analysis mimicme a web_server for prediction and analysis of host like proteins in microbial_pathogens mimicme is a web_server for prediction and analysis of host like proteins mimics encoded by microbial_pathogens users select a host_species and any set of pathogen and control proteomes bacterial fungal protozoan or viral and mimicme reports host like proteins that are unique to or enriched among pathogens additional server features include visualization of structural_similarities between pathogen and host_proteins as well as function enrichment_analysis availability_and mimicme is available at http many pathogens encode virulence_factors that mimic the function of one or more host_proteins these host like proteins called mimics exploit host pathways and or facilitate evasion of host immune detection mimics may be homologous to their host counterparts and originate through host to pathogen horizontal_transfer or may evolve through convergent_evolution several studies have focused on the latter type identifying pathogen mimics of short host peptide_fragments here we focus on pathogen mimicry involving host pathogen sequence_homology which can be more easily detected through standard bioinformatic approaches in previous work we used a blast_based comparative proteomics approach to detect mimics of this type in human pathogenic_bacteria by detecting human like proteins highly unique to pathogens and relatively absent in non pathogens controls known mimics e g legionella ralf mimicry of human adp_ribosylation guanine_nucleotide and novel ones e g multi species mimics of human collagen and leucinerich repeats could be identified here we report mimicme a web_server for exploration of host like proteins and potential mimics in pathogens mimicme automates and extends our previous analysis to include a range of common host_species from mammals to plants and pathogens from bacteria viruses protozoans and fungi the tool is best suited for predicting mimics that are homologous to host_proteins but other types of mimicry may be detected through altered parameters the tool allows for structural visualization of predicted mimicry relationships as well as function enrichment_analysis to identify host gene_families functions or pathways that are targets of molecular_mimicry by pathogens of interest we anticipate that the tool will be useful in comparative_analyses of pathogens where it may serve to generate hypotheses for future experimental_studies
