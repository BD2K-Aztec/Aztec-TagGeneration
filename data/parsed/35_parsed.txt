structural_bioinformatics accelerated protein_structure comparison using tm_score gpu motivation accurate comparisons of different protein_structures play_important in structural_biology structure_prediction and functional_annotation the root_mean rmsd after optimal superposition is the predominant measure of similarity due to the ease and speed of computation however global rmsd is dependent on the length of the protein and can be dominated by divergent loops that can obscure local_regions of similarity a more sophisticated measure of structure similarity template modeling tm_score avoids these problems and it is one of the measures used by the community_wide experiments of critical assessment of protein_structure to compare predicted models with experimental_structures tm_score calculations are however much slower than rmsd calculations we have therefore implemented a very fast version of tm_score for graphical processing units tm_score gpu using a new and novel hybrid kabsch quaternion method for calculating the optimal superposition and rmsd that is designed for parallel applications this acceleration in speed allows tm_score to be used efficiently in computationally_intensive applications such as for clustering of protein models and genome_wide comparisons of structure results tm_score gpu was applied to six sets of models from nutritious rice for the world for a total of million comparisons tm_score gpu is times_faster on an ati gpu on average than the original cpu single threaded implementation on an amd phenom ii quad core processor availability_and the complete source including the gpu code and the hybrid rmsd subroutine can be downloaded and used without restriction atfor protein_structure comparisons the simplest method is to calculate a transformation that superimposes corresponding atoms from one structure onto a second structure and minimizes the rootmean square deviation rmsd between the coordinates of the superimposed structures this can be obtained from the single value decomposition of the covariance_matrix or from the solution of the eigenvalue equation of a quaternion to whom correspondence should be addressed derived matrix although rmsd is a fast and easily calculated metric of structural_similarity a globally optimal transformation that minimizes the distances between all superimposed atom pairs can be dominated by a small set of divergent atoms in loop_regions furthermore rmsd is not only dependent on the overall goodness_of but also dependent on the length of the proteins tm_score uses a variant of the levittgerstein lg metric that provides a length independent measure and limits the impact of divergent pairs of atoms in superimposed structures an implementation of tm_score using qcprot red and the cpu and gpu versions of our implementation green and yellow tm_score gpu is on average times_faster than the original implementation run on an amd phenom ii quad core processor when comparing single threaded cpu implementations our hybrid rmsd algorithm gives rise to a speedup over the original code and speedup over an implementation using qcprot rotations in the kabsch method and avoids the iterative methods used to solve for the eigenvalues of the s matrix used in quaternion methods the resulting algorithm has a non divergent code path has no iteration and is significantly_faster the single threaded tm_score implementation using the hybrid method is faster than the original kabsch based implementation and faster than qcprot see
