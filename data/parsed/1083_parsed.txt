complex heatmaps reveal patterns and correlations in multidimensional genomic_data parallel heatmaps with carefully_designed annotation graphics are powerful for efficient visualization of patterns and relationships among high_dimensional genomic_data here we present the complexheatmap package that provides rich functionalities for customizing heatmaps arranging multiple parallel heatmaps and including user_defined annotation graphics we demonstrate the power of complexheatmap to easily reveal patterns and correlations among multiple sources of information with four real_world datasets availability_and the complexheatmap package and documentation are freely_available from the bioconductor projectheatmaps are a fundamental visualization method that is broadly used to unravel patterns hidden in genomic_data they are especially popular for gene_expression analysis and methylation profiling with the increasing availability of genomic_datasets visualization methods that effectively show relations within multidimensional data are urgently_needed in this paper we demonstrate how heatmaps with carefully_designed annotation graphics can give great enhancement for revealing underlying data_structure and how utilization of parallel heatmaps which focus on different sources of information gives a quick and comprehensive_overview of the data in the r programming environment traditional tools for drawing heatmaps like the basic heatmap function or add on packages such as pheatmap or heatmapplus only provide limited functionality to display annotation graphics and do not support plotting of multiple parallel heatmaps the complexheatmap package has been designed to overcome_these it provides a general solution to juxtapose different sources of information in multiple parallel heatmaps each heatmap can be enhanced by multiple annotation graphics to complete the portrayal of the dataset both column and row annotation graphics supported in complexheatmap can either be predefined graphics e g points bar plots or boxplots or more general user_defined graphics other features of complexheatmap include i flexible support for clustering for example rendered dendrograms or a user_defined distance_function that accepts two paired vectors are supported ii separating of heatmap rows into slices to support visualization of subgroups where splitting on rows can be done either by a partitioning method e g k_means or a data frame that contains classifications iii user customization of the heatmap grids for more advanced visualization of complex information e g the enhanced oncoprint in iv interactive selection on heatmaps to obtain subset of rows and columns if heatmaps are drawn on an interactive device e g x and v the ability to add more customized graphics after heatmaps are generated complexheatmap has a modular design with a user_friendly application_programming api the flexibility and extensibility of the package enables fast and easy generation of novel views of multidimensional datasets and greatly_facilitates discoveries from genomic and other omics_data
