characterizing spatial_distributions of astrocytes in the mammalian retina motivation in addition to being involved in retinal vascular_growth astrocytes play_an in diseases and injuries such as glaucomatous neuro degeneration and retinal_detachment studying astrocytes their morphological cell characteristics and their spatial relationships to the surrounding vasculature in the retina may elucidate their role in these conditions results our results show that in normal healthy retinas the distribution of observed astrocyte cells does not follow a uniform_distribution the cells are significantly more densely_packed around the blood_vessels than a uniform_distribution would predict we also show that compared with the distribution of all cells large cells are more dense in the vicinity of veins and toward the optic_nerve whereas smaller cells are often more dense in the vicinity of arteries we hypothesize that since veinal astrocytes are known to transport toxic metabolic waste away from neurons they may be more critical than arterial astrocytes and therefore require larger cell_bodies to process waste more efficiently availability_and a th size down sampled version of the seven retinal image mosaics described in this article can be found on bisque kvilekval et_al atthe large_amounts of image data that can be obtained with recent_advances in microscopy require mining in an objective and unbiased fashion using automated and reproducible methods in this way it is possible to discover trends and hypotheses for systems that domain_experts may have very little prior_knowledge about these improvements have especially had a profound impact on examination of the spatial distribution and correlation of biological_entities as the locations of large_amounts of cells and other structures can be imaged in situ studying the spatial_arrangement and relationships in full tissue_samples can improve our understanding of the various development or pathological_processes that underlie proper organ or organism function in particular it has been found that neuronal or vascular_structures are pervasive in many tissues and oftentimes are spatially_correlated with other cells in this study we are particularly interested in astrocytes one of two types of glial_cells found in the nerve_fiber nfl of the mammalian retina astrocytes can be found between vasculature and retinal_neurons and although many functions of astrocytes in the retina are poorly_understood it is widely_accepted that they play_an in the development and function of the retinalvasculature blood_flow and bloodretinal barrier brb studying astrocytes and their spatial_distributions within the healthy retina may give us some insight into their function in disease cases such as glaucomatous neuro degeneration and retinal_detachment with regard to cell characteristics one work determines that there are two types of astrocyte cells in developing rat white_matter and that they can be differentiated by their morphology but only analyzes a total of cells and measurements to quantify the cells are made manually another more recent work reports that astrocyte cells which lie on or near blood_vessels exhibit different morphological_characteristics specifically angles and lengths of primary processes than those which do not this study involves a small dataset on the order of tens of astrocyte cells hand picked to have distinguishable processes that can be manually counted our current dataset of seven full retinal mosaics each containing cells provides a much richer platform for testing hypotheses such as whether there exist distinct morphological classes of astrocytes and if so how many our semi_automated processing pipeline attempts to minimize bias from manual measurements while also testing the uncertainty of cell characteristic clustering_results which rely on cell segmentation astrocyte processes physically contact the vascular_structure and they also play a key functional role in the development of the retinal_vasculature an apparent spatial_correlation between astrocytes and the blood_vessels has been noted but only observational_evidence of such a relationship has been provided the vasculature is a large heterogeneous structure with specific arterial and venous delineations in order to quantify spatial_distributions of astrocyte cells with respect to it we need to image the entire retina strong evidence of astrocyte spatial_correlation with various vascular properties would lend further support to additional hypotheses of astrocyte function such as the suspected role of astrocytes in vasodilation and constriction however quantifying spatial properties of astrocytes in retinal_tissue can be a challenging_task one must be careful in selecting spatial mining methods which are invariant to scale rotation and which use distance metrics that operate in geodesic spaces such as along the linear network of the blood_vessels this rules out traditional spatial quantification_methods such as colocation or nearest_neighbor methods which operate in euclidean_space to our knowledge there has been only one previous work focused specifically on the analysis of spatial_distributions of astrocytes in the retina using manually marked cell centers and automatically traced blood_vessels their study attempts to determine existence of spatial relationships between the two in both detached and healthy retinas astrocytes and mm blood_vessel segments are represented by d features that quantify their respective locations astrocytes are mapped to their nearest blood_vessel segment via euclidean projection and d histograms of the features are computed with respect to the width of the blood_vessel segment and the geodesic vascular distance to the optic_nerve onh the article postulates that a correlation of astrocyte cell locations with the structure of the vasculature can be determined by comparing these histograms the study concluded that it is unlikely that the astrocytes are randomly_distributed along the structure of the vasculature regardless of the retina being normal or detached the article also reported that arterial astrocytes are spatially_distributed as random_samples from the arterial structure whereas venous astrocytes spatially deviate from the venous spatial_structure while this study presents a novel method for spatial analysis of astrocyte and blood_vessel distributions there has been much previous work in point_process modeling and spatial statistics dating back to regarding quantifying point distributions with respect to surrounding line segments or linear networks we choose to make use of such spatial statistics tools making our approach a more in depth and intuitive way to represent and analyze this type of data the conclusions arrived at here offer more detail but do not contradict those ofand we attribute that to the use of more principled methodology as mentioned above as well as a larger and more accurate dataset due to staining of astrocyte nuclei the goal of our analysis is to determine if the spatial distribution of astrocytes in the retina correlates with the vascular_network or with morphological cell characteristics such as area and perimeter to accomplish this we extract astrocyte and blood_vessel data for large image mosaics of the retinal nfl we then segment the astrocytes using two different segmentation_methods in order to assess the dependence of our resulting morphological_characteristics on the cell segmentation step of the analysis_pipeline following this we perform an exploratory correlation_analysis of cell characteristics to decide which to incorporate into our overall point_process model and which are redundant we also offer some possible spatial covariates for the cell distribution whose importance will be tested on all cells and on each type of cell resulting from the study of cell characteristics from these results we will arrive at an overall model for the density of astrocyte cells in the retina the methodology_presented here can be used for spatial studies between other vasculature structures and cells which occur in many places in the mammalian body using point_process models we are able to systematically quantify the spatial distribution of astrocyte cells within the mammalian retina and provide a foundation for future_research aimed at studying the spatial distribution of various biological_components in large tissue images our contributions lie in our choice of statistical_models to describe the astrocyte distributions as well as the biological conclusions derived from these models we will show evidence that in normal healthy retinas the distribution of observed astrocyte cells is more densely_packed around the blood_vessels than a uniform_distribution would predict we also show that compared with the distribution of all cells large cells are more densely_packed in the vicinity of veins and toward the onh whereas smaller cells are often more densely_packed in the vicinity of arteries in this study we presented what we believe to be the most appropriate choice of statistical_model to represent astrocyte locations and sizes in healthy mammalian retinas and most importantly the biological conclusions derived from those models due to very little prior_knowledge regarding these distributions we performed an exploratory_analysis which necessitates steps such as hypothesis_testing and model_selection these resulting trends regarding the size of astrocytes and their spatial_locations within the retina particularly with respect to the surrounding arteries and veins are new biological discoveries that have not yet been published to our knowledge although some of the trends were visible from the kernel smoothing estimate of the astrocyte intensity the full quantification of the distribution of cells and the statements regarding the statistical_significance of the dependence on the proposed spatial covariates could not have been made without usage of the appropriate point_process models our results show that in normal healthy retinas the distribution of observed astrocyte cells is more densely_packed around the blood_vessels than a uniform_distribution we also show that compared with the distribution of all cells large cells are more densely_packed in the vicinity of veins and toward the onh whereas smaller cells are often more densely_packed in the vicinity of arteries the conditional density maps shown in and in section of supplementary data show that the density of large cells is clearly higher in a flower shaped region with the petals centered on the retinal veins whereas small cells have low_density in these regions due to this clear differentiation between arteries and veins the results of this study could potentially aid in automated differentiation between arteries and veins in the retina which has proven to be a difficult_task a possible explanation for these phenomena is related to the vascular_function within the retina the retinal_vasculature enters the retina through the central_retinal via the onh and after being distributed through the retinal_tissue it leaves the tissue through the retinal vein astrocytes sit between vasculature and retinal_neurons and although many functions of astrocytes in healthy retinas are poorly_understood it is widely_accepted that they play_an in the development and function of the retinal_vasculature blood_flow and brb in fact glial_cell dysfunction in retinal pathologies is associated with retinal swelling and brb breakdown astrocytes transport small_molecules glucose glutamate small proteins or polypeptides from the blood_stream to the neurons at the arteries and take metabolic byproducts away from the neurons back into the blood_stream at the veins we hypothesize that the latter process may be more critical since for example it is well known that too many metabolic waste products can be toxic to neurons we speculate that this criticality may be the reason for the astrocytes residing on the veins to be the largest as larger cells can presumably process waste more efficiently in this article we have argued that the explanatory_power of each covariate considered follows a common trend across all seven retinas studied but have not yet shown the performance of the generative spatial point_process model derived here on hold out retinal data future work will include validating the generative_model that we have created on a hold out area from each retina using the parameters generated from the rest of that retina as well as holding out a few entire retinas and re using parameters derived from other retinas the latter requires normalization for the varying physical quantities between retinas such as shape orientation size number of arteries veins and overall intensity of cells we believe that once the retinal normalization issue is resolved the resulting models will allow us to predict the locations and sizes of the cells in a new retina based on its blood_vessel structure and directly compare parameters between retinas in other animals or stages of treatment disease or detachment without needing these manual markings this study can serve as a solid foundation for an end_to script which analyzes and simulates retinal cell distributions as well as spatial dependencies between other vasculature structures and cells which occur many places in the body
