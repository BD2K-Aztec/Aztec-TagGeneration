repgenhmm a dynamic_programming tool to infer the rules of immune receptor generation from sequence_data motivation the diversity of the immune repertoire is initially generated by random rearrangements of the receptor gene during early t and b cell development rearrangement scenarios are composed of random eventschoices of gene templates base_pair deletions and insertions described by probability_distributions not all scenarios are equally likely and the same receptor sequence may be obtained in several different ways quantifying the distribution of these rearrangements is an essential baseline for studying the immune system diversity inferring the properties of the distributions from receptor sequences is a computationally hard problem requiring enumerating every possible scenario for every sampled receptor sequence results we present a hidden_markov which accounts for all plausible scenarios that can generate the receptor sequences we developed and implemented a method based on the baumwelch algorithm that can efficiently infer the parameters for the different events of the rearrangement_process we tested our software_tool on sequence_data for both the alpha_and of the t cell receptor to test the validity of our algorithm we also generated synthetic sequences produced by a known model and confirmed that its parameters could be accurately inferred back from the sequences the inferred model can be used to generate synthetic sequences to calculate the probability of generation of any receptor sequence as well as the theoretical diversity of the repertoire we estimate this diversity to be for human t cells the model gives a baseline to investigate the selection and dynamics of immune repertoires availability_and source_code and sample sequence files are available at https bit bucket org yuvalel repgenhmm downloads the ability of the adaptive_immune to identify a wide_range of threats rests upon the diversity of its lymphocyte receptors which together make up the immune repertoire each such receptor can bind specifically to antigenic molecules and initiate an immune_response against the threat t cell receptors tcr are composed of two protein_chains called alpha_and b cell receptors bcr share a very similar structure with a light_chain and heavy_chain playing the same role each chain is produced according to the same process of v d j rearrangement in each new cell and for each of the two chains two germline segments for alpha chains va and ja genes or three segments for beta chains vb db and jb genes are assembled together to form the recombined gene coding for the chain in addition at the junctions where the segments are joined the ends of the segments are trimmed and random nucleotides are inserted seefor a diagram describing the alpha_chain rearrangement_process this process creates a large initial diversity of possible receptors which are later selected according to their recognition functionality an important property of this process is that it is redundant as many different v d j rearrangements may lead to the exact same sequence it is thus impossible to unambiguously reconstruct the scenario from the sequence alone a problem that is aggravated by sequencing_errors the rearrangement_process is random as is each of the elements composing itchoice of germline segments number of deleted nucleotides number and identity of insertions since the rearrangement_process is the basis of repertoire diversity it is important to study its distribution quantitatively with recent_advances in high_throughput there is a growing body of data on repertoires for both t and b cells in a variety of situations using large sequence_datasets of rearranged non productive genes the probability_distribution of rearrangement events in human tcr_beta and bcr heavy_chains could be inferred using statistical_methods gaining important insights into the random processes underlying repertoire diversity however these studies are based on a brute_force approach which enumerates every possible rearrangement scenario for each observed sequence this is a very computationally_costly procedure which is unrealistic for very large_datasets in this report we present a dynamic_programming to learn the distribution of rearrangement scenarios from large_numbers of non productive sequences in an efficient way this approach is based on a hidden_markov hmm formulation of the problem and learns its parameters using a modified baumwelch bw algorithm to avoid the full enumerations of all scenarios many studies have described algorithms designed to process or postprocess large_numbers of rearranged tcr or bcr genes and extract the template v d j genes of the rearrangement these tools process each sequence separately to obtain the best but often incorrect alignment to a v d j combination sometimes using dynamic_programming or hmm and assume an implicit ad_hoc prior on rearrangements by contrast our algorithm explores all plausible alignments for each sequence from data to learn accurately the distribution of rearrangement events once the model of rearrangement has been learned by our procedure the entire distribution of possible sequences and their probabilities is accessible our algorithm can calculate the probability of any sampled sequence even if it is not part of the data used to learn the model and it can generate arbitrary numbers of synthetic sequences with the exact same statistics as the data such large samples can be used to investigate the origin of shared sequences or public repertoires between different individuals the procedure can also calculate the entropy of the rearrangement processa classical measure of sequence_diversity this enables us to further our understanding of the generation_process quantify the baseline state of the immune system and evaluate subsequent processes such as somatic selection finally our work produces insights not just on the data sequences but on the underlying biological_processes the strength of the adaptive_immune lies in its inherent diversity this dynamic diversity is the result of several stochastic biological_mechanisms including complex enzymatic_reactions that alter the dna_structure and composition the action of some of the enzymes such as rag and tdt have been studied extensively seefor reviews in our work we have studied the way in which the diversity is generated in a top_down approach focusing on statistical_properties as inferred from sequenced receptor genes in principle this is a computationally difficult problem due to the very large number of possible rearrangement scenarios tcr_beta rearrangement distribution inferred from sequence_data previously analyzed in a distribution of the number of insertions at both vd and dj junctions and comparison with the distribution of insertion in the alpha_chain from inset the nucleotide usage is identical for vd and dj insertions when considered on opposite strands b distribution of the number of deletions on both the v and j genes averaged over different genes performance of the algorithm on synthetic data sequences generated using a known model were given as an input to the inference algorithm the results of the inference are compared to the true model used for generation for a the distribution of the number of insertions inset usage of inserted nucleotides and b v j gene_usage the error_bars which correspond to sample noise are smaller than symbol size for a in a we also report the distribution of insertions obtained using mixcr repgenhmm
