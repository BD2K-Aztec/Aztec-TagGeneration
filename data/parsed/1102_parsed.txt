genome_analysis computational discovery of human coding and non coding transcripts with conserved splice_sites motivation long_non lncrnas resemble protein_coding mrnas but do not encode_proteins most lncrnas are under lower sequence constraints than protein_coding and lack conserved secondary_structures making it hard to predict them computationally results we introduce an approach to predict spliced lncrnas in vertebrate_genomes combining comparative_genomics and machine_learning it is based on detecting signatures of characteristic splice_site evolution in vertebrate whole_genome alignments first we predict individual splice_sites then assemble compatible sites into exon candidates and finally predict multi exon transcripts using a novel method to evaluate typical splice_site substitution patterns that explicitly takes the species phylogeny into account we show that individual splice_sites can be accurately_predicted since our approach relies only on predicted splice_sites it can uncover both coding and non coding_exons we show that our predicted exons and partial transcripts are mostly non coding and lack conserved secondary_structures these exons are of particular interest since existing computational_approaches cannot detect them transcriptome sequencing_data indicate tissue_specific of predicted exons and there is evidence that increasing sequencing_depth and breadth will validate additional predictions we also found a significant_enrichment of predicted exons that form multi exon transcript parts and we experimentally validate such a novel multi exon gene overall we obtain novel multi exon transcript predictions from human intergenic_regions our results indicate the existence of novel human transcripts that are conserved in evolution and our approach contributes to the completion of the human transcript catalog availability_and predicted human splice_sites exons and gene structures together with a perl implementation of the tree based log odds scoring and a supplementary pdfa series of high_throughput transcriptomics studies utilizing a variety of different technologies revealed that mammalian_genomes are pervasively transcribed into a complex mosaic of transcripts a large extent of these transcripts consists of small and long non protein_coding ncrnas due to the diverse nature of these transcripts our catalog of genes is still incomplete computational_prediction of protein_coding is based on characteristic_features of coding_regions that distinguish them from non coding_dna coding_genes exhibit a clear evolutionary signature since mutations are often synonymous and preserve the reading_frame these signals can be exploited to find coding_genes by comparative_genomics methods also machine_learning based_approaches that recognize splice_sites transcriptional and translational start and stop signals can successfully detect coding_genes in contrast to protein_coding ncrnas form a heterogeneous class of transcripts that lacks common sequence_patterns complicating their detection in genomic_dna somepage de_novo splice_site prediction as illustrated in we trained svm classifier using the evolutionary signatures of vertebrate splice_sites to distinguish real from false splice_sites indicating a good discriminative_power our models achieved high auc values of for donors and for acceptors on an independent test_set with sites which were not used for training we correctly_detected of all true donors at a false_positive fpr of and of all true acceptors at an fpr of svm classification confidence p to reduce the fpr to less than we used a more stringent svm classification confidence of p which still correctly identifies of real donor acceptor_sites thisfirst we extracted splice_site candidates from genome_wide alignments and set up a training_set left panel we distinguished between i real annotated splice_sites in genic regions ii false splice_sites in genic regions gt ag dinucleotides that were similar to real splice_sites but were not supported by transcript data and iii the remaining set of intergenic splice_site candidates secondly we compiled a set of evolutionary signatures that are characteristic for vertebrate splice_sites and trained donor and acceptor svm models middle panel roc_curves are shown for both models thirdly these svms were used to classify intergenic candidates as either real or false splice_sites right panel b to obtain exon predictions we searched for pairs of splice_sites with a maximal distance of nt left trained a second svm that considered features of est confirmed exons middle and ranked predicted exons finally predicted exons were then clustered into partial multi exon transcripts c several splice_sites and exons introns of the shown example are confirmed by ests and short rna_seq demonstrates that our approach is capable of identifying splice_sites at high_specificity out of million intergenic candidates about million sites were predicted to be real p we present a computational procedure to identify novel spliced transcripts in vertebrate_genomes using conserved splice_sites and signatures of length constrained exons we deliberately neglect features of protein_coding and outline a first conceptual approach toward the de_novo prediction of lncrnas we have previously demonstrated the value of conserved introns for the prediction of conserved and hence likely functional ncrnas in insect genomes in this work we now tackled the problem of applying this conceptual idea to vertebrate_genomes where ab_initio splice_site and intron prediction is challenging due to the drastically increased absolute length and length variability
