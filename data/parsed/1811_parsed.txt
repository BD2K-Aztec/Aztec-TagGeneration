structural_bioinformatics ffas d improving fold_recognition by including optimized structural_features and template re ranking motivation homology detection enables grouping proteins into families and prediction of their structure and function the range of application of homology based_predictions can be significantly extended by using sequence_profiles and incorporation of local structural_features however incorporation of the latter terms varies a lot between existing_methods and together with many examples of distant relations not recognized even by the best methods suggests that further improvements are still possible results here we describe recent improvements to the fold and function assignment system ffas method including adding optimized structural_features experimental or predicted symmetrical z_score calculation and re ranking the templates with a neural_network the alignment_accuracy in the new ffas d is now higher than the original and comparable with the most accurate template based structure prediction_algorithms at the same time ffas d has high success_rate at the structural_classification of proteins scop family superfamily and fold levels importantly ffas d results are not highly_correlated with other programs suggesting that it may significantly improve meta predictions ffas d does not require d structures of the templates as using predicted features instead of structure derived does not lead to the decrease of accuracy because of that ffas d can be used for databases other than protein_data pdb such as protein_families database or clusters_of thus extending its applications to functional_annotations of genomes and protein_families availability_and ffas d is available at http ffas one of the most intriguing problems in molecular_biology is the extent of homology between genes and proteins with sequences evolving quickly many homologs become unrecognizable by simple sequence sequence_comparisons more sophisticated methods including sequence_profile and profile profile methods allow us to recognize statistically_significant similarities even between distant homologs the fold and function assignment system ffas is one of the first programs that introduced using profile profile alignment for protein_homology and since its inception it is publicly_available on the http ffas godziklab org server profileprofile methods have been proved to be more accurate and more sensitive than sequence sequence_alignment and sequence_profile alignment_methods and such methods are now widely used in various types of applications such as protein_structure function assignment new domain annotation and aiding molecular_replacement method of protein_crystallography the performance of the profile profile comparison depends critically on the diversity of sequences included in the profiles with low diversity the performance of profile profile alignment becomes similar to that of the sequence sequence_alignment continuous growth of the protein sequence_databases partly alleviates this problem in addition accuracy of profile profile algorithms can be improved by using additional information to add more sequences to the profile or by adding other features descriptors to it in the former category one can include sequence_fragments with similar structure in the profile calculation as done in the sp method or incorporate more distant homologs in the profile calculation by using a higher evalue cutoff in position specific iterated basic_local psi blast_searches as done by multi sources threader muster in the latter category one can expand scoring by including real or predicted structural_features such as secondary_structure ss type solvent_accessibility sa and torsion_angles this strategy recently became increasingly effective because of the improving accuracy of methods for predicting local structural_features it is important to note that using local structural_features predicted from sequence allows comparison of profiles of proteins neither of which has an experimentally_determined structure in this study we tested various predicted local structural_features in the context of the ffas scoring including ss residue type independent sa and residue depth rd besides testing to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the new composite score we predict the accuracy of each alignment by neural_network trained on various parameters of the alignment all new features were tested on benchmarks independent from the training_set
