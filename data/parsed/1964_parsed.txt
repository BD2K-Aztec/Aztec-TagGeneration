gene_gene analysis for the survival phenotype based on the cox_model motivation for the past_few many statistical_methods in genome_wide gwas have been developed to identify snpsnp interactions for case_control however there has been less work for prospective_cohort involving the survival time recently gui et_al proposed a novel method called surv mdr for detecting genegene_interactions associated with survival time surv mdr is an extension of the multifactor_dimensionality mdr method to the survival phenotype by using the log_rank for defining a binary attribute however the surv mdr method has some drawbacks in the sense that it needs more intensive computations and does not allow for a covariate_adjustment in this article we propose a new approach called cox mdr which is an extension of the generalized_multifactor gmdr to the survival phenotype by using a martingale residual as a score to classify multi level genotypes as high and low_risk groups the advantages of cox mdr over surv mdr are to allow for the effects of discrete and quantitative covariates in the frame of cox_regression and to require less computation than surv mdr results through simulation_studies we compared the power of cox mdr with those of surv mdr and cox_regression for various heritability and minor_allele combinations without and with adjusting for covariate we found that cox mdr and cox_regression perform better than surv mdr for low minor_allele of but surv mdr has high power for minor_allele of however when the effect of covariate is adjusted for cox mdr and cox_regression perform much better than surv mdr we also compared the performance of cox mdr and surv mdr for a real_data of leukemia patients to detect the genegene_interactions with the survival time contact recently massive_amounts of information for single_nucleotide snps across the whole_genome have become available from high_throughput technology which allows genomewide_association gwas to be performed as recently reviewed by nearly genome_wide association studies_covering distinct diseases and traits have been reported with nearly snp trait associations reported as significant under p however it is noted that the effective sizes of the to whom correspondence should be addressed loci identified via gwas are relatively small and these individual_loci may not be useful in assessing risk in personal genetics as mentioned by moore and williams in early gwas statistical_methods for identifying susceptibility have considered a single snp at a time and have selected a subset of the top few snps from a ranked_list of snps then replication studies have been implemented to determine_whether these associations held for other samples some of the replication studies however show that significant associations are not found from the top ranked_list recently this single locus approach has been moved into a multiple_loci approach because most complex_diseases are associated with multiple genes and their interactions however the traditional parametric approach such as the logistic regression_model has limited_power in detecting non linear patterns of interaction and needs a large amount of study samples when multiple_snps and genegene_interactions are considered as a dimensional reduction strategy proposed the multifactor_dimensionality mdr method which is a computationally_efficient method for detecting non linear patterns of genegene_interactions in genetic_association the mdr method is a non parametric and genetic model free approach that efficiently identifies higher_order interactions between genes and or geneenvironmental factors with binary phenotype the main idea of mdr is to reduce multi_dimensional genotypes into onedimensional binary attributes by pooling genotypes of multiple_snps using a well defined classifier more studies on mdr have been published byand hahn and moore in addition many modifications and extensions to mdr have been published which include the use of odds_ratios log linear_models generalized_linear methods for imbalanced data methods for dealing with missing_data and model based_methods among these previous_studies the generalized_multifactor gmdr method proposed byincludes both dichotomous and continuous phenotypes and allows for the adjustment of covariates such as age sex and other clinical_variables in a prospective_cohort survival time has been one of the important phenotypes in studies of associations with gene_expression levels measured by high_throughput microarray_technology recently proposed a novel approach for identifying genegene_interactions with survival_times using snp information in the frame of mdr called surv mdr the survmdr method modifies mdrs constructive induction algorithm to classify multi level genotypes as high and low_risk groups using a log_rank instead of case control ratios in addition balanced accuracy is replaced by log_rank test_statistics and is used as ato identify the complexity of genegene and or geneenvironment interactions on common diseases many plausible approaches have been developed by extending existing_methods into a more general framework in this article we propose the cox mdr method by extending the main idea of gmdr to the survival phenotype coxmdr uses the martingale residual of the cox_regression as a score to classify multi loci genotype combinations into highand low_risk groups since the martingale residual reflects the unexplained part beyond what is explained by the adjusted covariates excluding the genetic_factors we can evaluate whether genetic_factors have an independent association with the survival time using the martingale residual through the simulation_study we compared the performance of cox mdr to those of a cox_regression and surv mdr all of the three methods showed the common trend that the power increases steadily as heritability increases from to although the degree of increase varies depending on the minor_allele and the effect_size of covariate when the minor_allele is i
