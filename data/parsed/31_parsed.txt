genome_analysis abscn seq a statistical_method to estimate tumor_purity ploidy and absolute copy_numbers from next_generation detection and quantification of the absolute dna_copy in tumor_cells is challenging because the dna specimen is extracted from a mixture of tumor and normal stromal_cells estimates of tumor_purity are necessary to correctly infer copy_number and ploidy may itself be a prognostic_factor in cancer_progression as deep_sequencing of the exome or genome has become routine for characterization of tumor_samples in this work we aim to develop a simple and robust algorithm to infer purity ploidy and absolute copy_numbers in whole numbers for tumor_cells from sequencing_data results a simulation_study shows that estimates have reasonable accuracy and that the algorithm is robust against the presence of segmentation errors and subclonal populations we validated our algorithm against a panel of cell_lines with experimentally_determined ploidy we also compared our algorithm with the well established single_nucleotide array based method called absolute on three sets of tumors of different types our method had good performance on these four benchmark_datasets for both purity and ploidy estimates and may offer a simple solution to copy_number quantification for cancer sequencing_projects availability_and the r package abscnseq is available fromcopy number alterations cnas are an important class of somatic aberrations in tumor_genomes and have been extensively_studied in the hope of understanding the mutational_landscape and clonal_evolution of cancer highthroughput platforms such as array_comparative single_nucleotide snp_arrays and next_generation ngs have been widely used to measure cnas the direct readout from these platforms is a measure of the relative dna_content between a tumor sample and its normal counterpart over a set of genomic_regions however at the cellular_level cnas are integers for example a region of dna with normal copy_number corresponding to the two chromosomes may be duplicated in one chromosome resulting in copy_number or deleted resulting in copy_number to estimate absolute copy_numbers from the observed ratio of tumor to normal dna it is necessary to know two additional parameters tumor_purity which is the ratio of tumor_cells to total cells in the sample and tumor ploidy which is the average copy_number of the entire tumor genome and can be used to account for whole_genome duplication_events in the tumor tumor ploidy may itself be a prognostic_factor in cancer a related issue occurs with detection of somatic single_nucleotide snv as with cnas it is more informative to know the integer multiplicity of each gained somatic snv rather than the percentage of the alternate allele in the tumor stromal mixture incorporating purity ploidy and absolute_copy information may also help popular snv callers like samtools and gatk to reduce both false_positive and falsenegative calls all this highlights the importance of accurately estimating the absolute_copy information from noisy genomic_data recent work addressing this issue has aimed to control for the effects of either tumor_purity or ploidy or both in cna detection absolute uses allele specific copy ratios from snp_array to infer purity ploidy and absolute copy_numbers and has demonstrated high_accuracy in principle absolute can also be extended to sequencing_data although the working pipeline and performance on sequencing_data are not yet published as more cancer samples are sequenced using ngs_technology and as whole_exome wes becomes a routine platform for characterization of tumor_samples there is an urgent need to develop a similar tool for ngs developed a method to estimate tumor_purity from the deep whole_genome sequencing_data however their method does not offer the estimation of ploidy and absolute copy_numbers and has not been shown to work equally well on wes data in this work we develop a simple and robust statistical_method to estimate tumor_purity ploidy and absolute cnas from wes data we validated our method by comparing our purity and ploidy estimates against independent gold_standard to whom correspondence should be addressed values using recently_published exome data from cancer_cell breast prostate the cancer_genome research and glioblastoma cancer patients the cancer_genome research network we also study the effects of the existence of subclonal populations or segmentation errors on the accuracy of the purity estimation to the best of our knowledge this is the first work that has provided a working pipeline to estimate purity ploidy and absolute copy_numbers from raw wes data which has been validated on several independently published wes datasets we implemented the algorithm in an r package called abscnseq that is freely_available from our web_site biostats mcc ucsd edu files abscnseq tar gz we have developed a statistical_approach abscn seq which can estimate tumor_purity from wes data and then use these estimates to infer absolute_copy and absolute multiplicity of somatic snvs in the tumor the ploidy estimates of our method fit the sky values well our method also has good concordance with absolute although the two differ in several aspects first the input_data are generated from different high_throughput platforms absolute in it standard form using snp_array while our method_takes ngs_data second the statistical_framework and implementation differ absolute uses a bayesian_framework whereas our method uses a simpler frequentist approach third absolute uses additional independent information to infer which solution is most likely such as empirical karyotype models while our solution refers only to the data from the sample and chooses the estimate that gives the best least_squares fit to the data given these differences it is encouraging to see the high concordance between these two methods on our validation datasets for the breast_cancer patients absolute did not make calls on three a comparison of purity a and ploidy b estimates from abscnseq versus absolute for gbm samples and prostate samples assignment of integer copy_numbers to the segments on chromosome for subject br m raw copy ratios and segmented copy ratios between the tumor dna mixture and the match germ_line dna are in green and blue respectively the estimated absolute copy_numbers in pure tumor_cells are in red as a copy ratio of corresponds to a normal_diploid segment we multiply the copy ratios by two to bring the copy ratio and the absolute_copy to the same scale subjects and our method made reasonable calls on all three we are unclear whether the failure of absolute to produce an estimate for these subjects was due to a failure in snp_array experiment or to the algorithm itself thus it seems that abscn seq can work for certain samples where absolute cannot make a call on the other hand our method failed to produce estimates in one case where absolute could make an estimate thus providing complementary approaches as has been seen by absolute the best fitting solution is not always the correct solution the validation_studies here show that the top two solutions of our method usually cover the correct_answer but exceptions do exist we recommend the user to manually inspect each solution whenever possible although our method does not yet incorporate subclonal tumor_heterogeneity it has been shown to be robust to a considerable amount of such heterogeneity as well as to segmentation errors in the estimates of purity and ploidy our method is flexible in the sense that it can also be applied to shallow whole_genome sequencing_data an emerging ngs application to identification of copy_number genome_wide however presence of somatic_mutations cannot be reliably called in these type of data let alone the corresponding variant allele_frequency for these type of data we can set the algorithm to only use copy_number information by setting the reduced objective_function first term of equation in step now has a closed form solution define a new parameter it is easy to see that when q i s are given equation reduces to a simple_linear on q i s then can be obtained from the estimate a caveat arises when we apply this form of abscn seq to the wes data as seen in we observed a systematic upward bias in the purity estimates as compared with the snp based absolute estimates however by incorporating the snv information such bias was greatly_diminished and this did not appear to affect the ploidy estimates this might not be a concern in practice as for wes data we will always use the default form with snv information at this moment it is not clear to us what is the major cause for the small remaining observed bias platform specific_biases in the raw copy ratio data could be one possible reason for instance as shown by the algorithm relying on the illumina snp_array systematically underestimate tumor_purity as compared with the absolute method relying on the affymetrix snp_array likewise the apparent small overestimation of purity by our method as compared with absolute might also be attributed to the characteristics of wes data compared with snp_array a supporting evidence is that we did not observe such minor biases when the platform is fixed we have not tested our method on shallow wgs_data with reference to purity estimates and we do not know yet if such overestimation also exists in the wgs_data future work will examine the performance of the method on shallow wgs_data when a benchmark_dataset becomes available
