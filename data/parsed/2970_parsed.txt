data_and minerva and minepy a c engine for the mine suite and its r python and matlab wrappers we introduce a novel implementation in ansi c of the mine family of algorithms for computing maximal information based measures of dependence between two variables in large_datasets with the aim of a low memory_footprint and ease of integration within bioinformatics_pipelines we provide the libraries minerva with the r interface and minepy for python matlab octave and c the c solution reduces the large memory requirement of the original java implementation has good upscaling properties and offers a native parallelization for the r interface low memory_requirements are demonstrated on the mine benchmarks as well as on large n microarray and illumina gaii rna_seq transcriptomics datasets availability_and source_code are freely_available for download under gpl licence at http minepy source forge net for minepy and through the cran repository http cran r project org for the r package minerva all software is multiplatform ms windows linux and osx the maximal information based non parametric exploration mine family of statistics including the maximal information coefficient mic measure was recently_introduced in aimed at fast exploration of two variable relationships in many dimensional datasets mine consists of the algorithms for computing four measures of dependence mic maximum asymmetry score mas maximum edge value mev minimum cell number mcn between two variables having the generality and equitability property generality is the ability of capturing variable relationships of different nature while equitability is the property of penalizing similar levels of noise in the same way regardless of the nature of the relation between the variables the mine suite received immediate appraisal as a real breakthrough in the data_mining of complex biological data as well as criticisms see comments and referenced experiments by simon and tibshirani and by gorfin et_al at http comments sciencemag org content science many groups worldwide have already proposed its use for explorative data analysis in computational_biology from networks dynamics to virus ranking together with the algorithm description the mine authors provided a java implementation mine jar two wrappers r and python and four reference datasets however applicability and scalability of mine jar on large_datasets is currently limited owing to memory_requirements and lack of programming interfaces further a native parallelization currently unavailable would be of significant benefit these issues are hurdles for a systematic application of mine algorithms to high_throughput omics datafor example as a substitute of pearson_correlation in network studies inspired by these considerations we propose an ansi c implementation of the mine algorithms and the interfaces for r minerva and for c python and matlab octave minepy
