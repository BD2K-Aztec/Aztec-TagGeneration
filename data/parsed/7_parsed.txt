genetics_and funmap full sib family functional_mapping of dynamic traits motivation functional_mapping that embeds the developmental_mechanisms of complex_traits shows great power to study the dynamic_pattern of genetic effects triggered by individual quantitative_trait qtls a full sib family produced by crossing two heterozygous parents is characteristic of uncertainties about cross type at a locus and linkage phase between different loci integrating functional_mapping into a full sib family requires a model_selection procedure capable of addressing these uncertainties funmap written in vc provides a flexible and extensible platform to perform full sib functional_mapping of dynamic traits functions in the package encompass linkage phase determination marker map construction and the pattern identification of qtl segregation dynamic tests of qtl effects permutation_tests and numerical_simulation we demonstrate the features of funmap through real_data analysis and computer simulation many traits important in agriculture biology and medicine change with time or other independent_variables the genetic control of these dynamic complex_traits should be accordingly expressed as a function of the independent and continuous variable a new breakthrough in mapping the dynamic_change of quantitative_trait qtl effects has been recently made through the invention of a series of statistical_models called functional_mapping functional_mapping integrates mathematical aspects of trait development into a qtl_mapping framework enabling geneticists to test the interplay between gene action and development packed functional_mapping into a web_based funmap for a mapping_population derived from inbred_lines funmap cannot be applied directly to a full sib family produced by crossing heterozygous parents inevitably such a single full sib family that may generate an almost unlimited number of progeny has been commonly used for qtl_mapping in outcrossing species like forest trees and wildlife species since several assumptions essential for linkage mapping including a fixed marker cross type known linkage phase and known parental origin to whom correspondence should be addressed of qtl alleles do not exist in outcrossing populations a model_selection procedure should be implemented to make an inference about these uncertainties from observed marker and phenotypic_data here we report a new package of windows software funmap which conducts functional_mapping of dynamic qtls segregating in a full sib family derived from two heterozygous parents since the genotypes of the two parents are unknown the segregation of a qtl in a full sib family may obey the following possible types full cross segregating pseudof cross segregating and pseudo backcross segregating by incorporating model selection_criteria such as akaike_information aic and bayesian_information bic funmap can discern an optimal segregation type based on a given dataset thus meeting the urgent need for analysis tools of functional_mapping capable of handling the complexities of genetic segregation associated with crossed heterozygous parents the software integrates a comprehensive suite of biological merits of functional_mapping in terms of testing and estimating the developmental_pattern of genetic effects triggered by dynamic qtls the software enables users to test when a qtl is switched on to perform its function when the qtl is switched off to cease the function how long it is expressed in a time course and with which temporal_pattern is the qtl effect operational wu and lin classified four temporal_patterns of genetic expression for a qtl i e long early late and inverse by asking and addressing biologically_meaningful questions funmap will help to better understand the genetic and developmental architecture of complex_traits we described a windows software funmap to perform functional_mapping in a full sib family by considering unique outcrossing characteristics of heterozygous parents with funmap users canconstruct an integrative linkage_map by using all types of molecular_markers map specific qtls that govern dynamic changes of a complex_trait select an optimal type of qtl segregation and estimate the temporal_pattern of genetic effects triggered by individual qtls to our best knowledge this is a first package of software that can handle dynamic qtl segregation in a full sib family in a comprehensive way it equips breeders and geneticists for outcrossing species with a powerful_tool to dissect the genetics of dynamic complex_traits funmap has incorporated a function to run simulation_studies to investigate the statistical behavior of functional_mapping for a full sib family results from computer simulation under different heritability levels and sample_sizes supplementary_material suggest that a modest heritability h would provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the genetic control of trait trajectories when a sample_size n is used it is important to emphasize that a better management of plants that minimizes environmental and phenotyping errors may be more useful for the enhancement of qtl_mapping precision than augmenting the size of roughly managed samples we also tested model_misspecification by simulating and analyzing data reciprocally using different segregation models under h and n funmap has full power to identify a correct model we recognize the importance of epistasis in trait control epistasis has been incorporated into our software for a single qtl model funmap uses min on a pc desktop to draw the lr profiles for the populus example shown in yet computing time on for epistatic detection for a full sib family increases exponentially because there are many combinations of segregation types between any two qtls also two full cross qtls produce genotypes
