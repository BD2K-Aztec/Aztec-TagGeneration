pathscore a web_tool for identifying altered pathways in cancer data pathscore quantifies the level of enrichment of somatic_mutations within curated pathways applying a novel approach that identifies pathways enriched across patients the application provides several user_friendly interactive graphic interfaces for data exploration including tools for comparing pathway effect_sizes significance gene_set overlap and enrichment differences between projects availability_and web_application available at pathscore publichealth yale edu site implemented in python and mysql with all_major source_code available at github com sggaffney pathscore with a gplv_license we present an algorithm and web_application pathscore for the identification of known pathways that are enriched for mutations within a multi patient somatic gene_variant dataset the algorithm belongs to a class of pathway analysis techniques known as overrepresentation analysis ora tools like other ora tools this new algorithm uses a hypergeometric_test to estimate pathway alteration probability but distinguishes itself in three ways first it segregates data by patient calculating patientspecific pathway alteration probabilities that account for varied total mutation counts per patient second it accounts for gene_transcript length incorporating the increased chance of mutation in longer genes third it uses empirically_derived background mutation_rates to account for varied mutation probability across the genome which to our knowledge is a unique feature among pathway analysis tools our web app implementation of the algorithm uses the collection of canonical pathways from the molecular_signatures which includes pathways from the kegg biocarta reactome and nature nci databases among others unlike tools such as memo and hotnet that detect significantly altered subnetworks pathscore calculates an enrichment score for every pathway and all activity in a pathway contributes to the score in contrast to tools that for tractability require stringent gene filtering memos filters include a threshold for a minimum patient to whom correspondence should be addressed frequency pathscore has no filtering requirement even a gene that is mutated only once in a dataset will increase the enrichment score if mutated in a patient with no other pathway alterations applications of pathscore to lung_adenocarcinoma and lung_squamous data from the cancer_genome demonstrate its potential to uncover patterns in low_frequency events numerous pathways known to be frequently affected in these cancers are identified by pathscore additional pathways identified include the nicotinic_acetylcholine nachr and gaba receptor pathways and patient coverage respectively hotnet results include their genes but scattered in separate low coverage subnetworks max and coverage both pathways are missed by memo due to the low frequencies of their genes these two related gene_families are thought to play a role in lung_cancer and have been suggested as potential_therapeutic our demonstration of pathway enrichment supports this hypothesis
