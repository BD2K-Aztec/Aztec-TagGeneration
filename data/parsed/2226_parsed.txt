data_and homsi a homozygous stretch identifier from next_generation data in consanguineous_families as a result of inheriting the same genomic_segments through both parents the individuals have stretches of their genomes that are homozygous this situation leads to the prevalence of recessive diseases among the members of these families homozygosity_mapping is based on this observation and in consanguineous_families several recessive disease genes have been discovered with the help of this technique the researchers typically use single_nucleotide to determine the homozy gous regions and then search for the disease gene by sequencing the genes within this candidate disease_loci recently the advent_of enables the concurrent identification of homozygous regions and the detection of mutations relevant for diagnosis using data from a single sequencing_experiment in this respect we have developed a novel tool that identifies homozygous regions using deep sequence_data using vcf variant_call files as an input_file our program identifies the majority of homozygous regions found by microarray single_nucleotide genotype data availability_and homsi software is freely_available at www igbam bilgem tubitak gov tr softwares homsi with an online manual contact in communities with a high_level of consanguineous_marriage the diagnosis of a recessive genetic_disorder offers a unique advantage for positional_cloning of rare_diseases in such an isolated inbred human population several individuals may inherit a variation of an ancestor and the offsprings born of consanguineous union will have a high_probability of inheriting two copies of the mutated chromosomal segment and thus expressing the disease in this respect homozygosity_mapping is an effective approach to identify potential disease_loci because lander and botstein successfully used this technique in both the experimental and the computational_methods that are used to generate and analyze relevant datasets have undergone diversification and refinement originally to detect homozygous regions individuals were genotyped with panels of highly_polymorphic short_tandem or microsatellite_markers typically at genomic_intervals of cm with the availability of single_nucleotide snp microarrays short_tandem microsatellites were later replaced by snp_arrays to survey the genome and to identify large stretches of homozygosity the overlapping regions among the homozygous stretches of affected_individuals are called runs of shared homozygosity roshs and these regions are expected to contain the disease gene for this purpose several computational_tools have been developed even though the identification of recessive disease_loci homozygous regions is accomplished using the aforementioned snp_array based techniques the next step to detect pathogenic sequence variant is sequencing until recently only the candidate_genes in these loci are sequenced if this disease_locus is a large interval or if it includes several genes the determination of disease_causing by sanger_sequencing becomes a backbreaking task at this point next_generation ngs_platforms present an alternative_solution with their capacity to sequence the entire_genome owing to the moderate costs and tractable data amounts exome_sequencing is a promising approach to detect novel mutations of human monogenic_disorders hence it is now possible to concurrently identify homozygous regions and possibly deleterious sequence_variants using data from a single sequencing_experiment to the best of our knowledge only two programs have been developed to detect homozygous regions from ngs_data i e agilevariantmapper and homozygositymapper but these programs do not take into account the distribution of the variants within the genomic_coordinates here we developed a novel sliding_window based_methodology which provides the advantage of scanning the genome in detail but at the same time detecting the candidate homozygous regions easily this type of analysis gives us the opportunity of converting the genotype_information into a signal where we can apply well known signal_processing
