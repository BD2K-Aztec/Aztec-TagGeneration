rna enrich a cut_off free functional enrichment testing method for rna_seq with improved detection_power tests for differential_gene with rna_seq have a tendency to identify certain types of transcripts as significant e g longer and highly_expressed transcripts this tendency has been shown to bias gene_set gse testing which is used to find over or under represented biological_functions in the data yet there remains a surprising lack of tools for gse testing specific for rna_seq we present a new gse method for rna_seq rna enrich that accounts for the above tendency empirically by adjusting for average read_count per gene rna enrich is a quick flexible method and web_based with available gene_annotation databases it does not require a p value cutoff to define differential_expression and works well even with small sample sized experiments we show that adjusting for read_counts per gene improves both the type_i and detection_power of the test availability_and rna enrich is available at http lrpath ncibi org or from supplemental material as r code functional enrichment testing is one of the most common downstream_analyses for transcriptomics experiments facilitating a deeper interpretation of results examples of gene_set databases used for testing are gene_ontology go which includes biological_processes cellular_components and molecular_functions and the kyoto_encyclopedia which places genes in metabolic and other pathways most current gene_set gse methods such as david were developed for microarray_data these methods often only make use of differential_expression de p values or ranks or simply a list of significant genes with rna_seq which uses whole transcriptome_sequencing to quantify gene_expression tests for de often exhibit a relationship between read_count and likelihood of detecting de for example when power is greater to detect longer and or higher expressed genes gene_sets that have long genes or that are highly_expressed are more likely to be detected as significant violating common test assumptions thus accounting for read_count per gene may improve standard gse methods which may otherwise not be appropriate for rna_seq rna_seq achieves a very high dynamic range with gene read_counts often varying across six or more orders_of readcount based_methods such as those using a negative_binomial e g edger and deseq can be more likely to identify longer and highly_expressed transcripts as significant methods that can account for this bias in gse testing are goseq which requires a p value cut_off and gsaaseqsp and seqgsea which require permutations and moderate to large_sample to obtain a sufficient number of unique permutations of phenotype labels we have developed rna enrich a gse method that empirically adjusts for average read_count per gene and does not require a cut_off to define differentially_expressed degs time consuming permutations or regression_models similarcut off free methods for microarray_data have shown improved ability to detect gene_sets enriched with either a few very strong degs or many only moderate degs
