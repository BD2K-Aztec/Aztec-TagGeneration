gene_expression vizprimer a web_server for visualized pcr primer_design based on known gene structure the visualization of gene structure plays an important role in polymerase_chain pcr primer_design especially for eukaryotic_genes with a number of splice_variants that users need to distinguish between via pcr here we describe a visualized web_server for primer_design named vizprimer it utilizes the new information_technology it tools html to display gene structure and javascript to interact with the users in vizprimer the users can focus their attention on the gene structure and primer design_strategy without wasting time calculating the exon positions of splice_variants or manually configuring complicated parameters in addition vizprimer is also suitable for the design of pcr_primers for amplifying open_reading and detecting single_nucleotide snps availability vizprimer is freely_available biocompute bmi ac cn czlab vizprimer the web_server supported browsers chrome firefox safari and opera alternative_splicing is widely found for eukaryotic_genes and it plays_important biological_processes such as increasing protein diversity the variant specific pcr technique_requires a unique region of a transcript variant for the primer_design to distinguish between the specific variant from other isoforms existing programs such as primer perlprimer and primer premier usually require users to enter or paste the dna_template sequence and to specify the unique region manually another program primegens v added a new algorithm hspd to design homolog specific pcr_primers without any prior information of the splice_variants but the algorithm requires much longer search times to generate homolog specific_primers importantly none of these programs supports the graphic display of the splice_variants of eukaryotic_genes however the visualizationthe design of pcr_primers for eukaryotic_genes in the identification of splice_variants is a complex and tedious task the currently available primer_design programs do not have a function of graphically displaying the gene structure to help users locate the unique regions among the splice_variants using html and javascript for adding interactivity to a web_page is a new paradigm of web computing nowadays this combination is also encouraged by scientific applications due to the fast progress in the performance of javascript engines and html compatible browsers there are already several scientific applications relying on the javascript and html canvas element and which are currently available including anno j and chemdoodle http web chemdoodle com therefore by integrating these new technologies the widely used primer_design program primer and the specificity checking program mfeprimer vizprimer will be a beneficial visual pcr primer_design tool in the future we will add the function of visualized multiple pcr primer_design to vizprimer
