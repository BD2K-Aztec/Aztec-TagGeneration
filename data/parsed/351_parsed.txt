an integer_programming formulation to identify the sparse network architecture governing differentiation_of motivation primary purpose of modeling gene_regulatory for developmental_process is to reveal pathways governing the cellular_differentiation to specific phenotypes knowledge of differentiation network will enable generation of desired cell_fates by careful alteration of the governing network by adequate manipulation of cellular_environment results we have developed a novel integer_programming based_approach to reconstruct the underlying regulatory architecture of differentiating embryonic_stem from discrete temporal gene_expression data the network_reconstruction problem is formulated using inherent features of biological_networks i that of cascade architecture which enables treatment of the entire complex network as a set of interconnected modules and ii that of sparsity of interconnection between the transcription_factors the developed framework is applied to the system of embryonic_stem differentiating towards pancreatic lineage experimentally_determined expression_profile dynamics of relevant transcription_factors serve as the input to the network identification algorithm the developed formulation accurately captures many of the known regulatory modes involved in pancreatic differentiation the predictive capacity of the model is tested by simulating an in silico potential pathway of subsequent differentiation the predicted pathway is experimentally_verified by concurrent differentiation experiments experimental_results agree well with model_predictions thereby illustrating the predictive_accuracy of the proposed algorithm phenotype and functionality of a cell is largely governed by the underlying gene_regulatory grn the grn is of fundamental_importance for the developmental_process where a pluripotent progenitor_cell gives rise to multiple cell_types to whom correspondence should be addressed in a multicellular_organism acquisition of different cellular_phenotypes stems from the differential expression_patterns of specific transcription_factors that activate a cascade of complex network architecture while experimental_data are fundamental in identifying the level of transcription and the nature of transcriptional_control understanding of the complex network architecture and prediction of the effects of individual interactions in such networks will require their quantitative description in terms of strength of interaction governing the network_dynamics in this article we report a novel mathematical_modeling effort that aims at identifying the transcription_factor network governing differentiation of progenitor_cells to a specific lineage we exploit the notion of sparsity common to many biological_networks to identify the most plausible grn operative in this scenario our model_predictions are supported by concurrent experiments in differentiating embryonic_stem to a specific lineage for this case the pancreas as will be discussed subsequently we believe that our approach will be beneficial for the development of targeted experimental_protocols for the production of cells with a pre specified fate developments in large_scale genomic technologies have made data_acquisition more tractable this feat is increasing the emphasis on the development of meaningful quantitative_models utilizing the wealth of experimental_data however it is not always obvious how the data acquired through such techniques can be assembled into unambiguous predictive_models tremendous effort has been focused to tackle the network identification problem with significant success in analyzing bacterial and yeast networks however the generalization of these methods to the inference of networks in higher_eukaryotes is not always obvious furthermore developmental grns are organized very differently from the grns responsible for cellular_physiology house_keeping cell_cycle etc in contrast to most other grns developmental network occurs in a sequence of multiple cascades of transcriptional regulations endomesoderm specification in pre gastrular sea_urchin was among the first attempts in identifying developmental grn followed by mesoderm specification in the frog xenopus_laevis dorsoventral patterning and segmentation of the drosophila embryo and b cell_differentiation in thepage we have developed a bi level mixed integer_programming formulation to reliably identify the grn from a data limited scenario the developed framework can accurately capture the regulatory_interactions solely from the data of gene_expression without any a priori information regarding regulatory_interactions between transcription_factors our mathematical formulation is based on the understanding that a sparse network reproducing the transcription_factor profile will be the optimal one chosen by nature the network architecture derived by promoting sparsity could adequately predict the experimentally_observed regulations reported in the literature it could also accurately_predict the perturbation required to induce subsequent differentiation an outcome confirmed by concurrent experiments the grn determined by the proposed bi level methodology could reliably capture the known effects of shh inhibition of cyclopamine along with key governing features of the pancreatic organogenesis the reconstructed network had excellent predictive_capability even outside the domain of experimental_data used to determine the network it could accurately_predict the effects of foxa silencing on up regulation of ngn expression which would induce the next cascade of pancreatic differentiation such an effect has not been reported in literature and concurrent experiments validated the nature and even the predicted magnitude of ngn up regulation as detailed in the model_prediction could accurately capture the most significant effect of foxa silencing on the genes considered in the network the prediction of the magnitude of effect had different degrees of accuracy but the most significant effect that of ngn up regulation was accurately_predicted this is significant in establishing confidence in the presented reverse engineering_approach based on the notion of sparsity and its usefulness in assisting in vitro differentiation to derive specific cellular_phenotypes of interest the proposed method offers significant_advantage in analyzing differentiating cell_population where the cells are typically induced to a specific lineage by exposing them to different environmental_conditions with respect to extracellular_matrix growth_factors and chemical inducers or repressors the proposed method can efficiently utilize this information in analyzing the governing network and does not rely on more laborious gene_knockout data this is even more pertinent in stem_cell studies since knockout of certain key_genes can have severe_consequences with respect to cell_survival and differentiation however in the event of availability of such data it can be easily incorporated into the network identification formulation moreover the bi level formulation ensures efficient utilization of experimental_data by essentially reducing the number of variables being optimized in the inner loop since the proposed algorithm extracts regulatory information from the dynamic profile of transcription_factors the choice of the transcription_factors and the quality of the input experimental_data will play_a on the reliability of the predicted network it is crucial to consider all salient transcription_factors important for the differentiation_stage under consideration since the formulation will have no information of the excluded tfs it is likely that any strong effect of the excluded tfs will be reported as spurious interactions of the existing network however as illustrated in the case of cyclopamine a the identified network will still capture functional interactions even in the absence of all the intermediate tfs involved in such interaction the resolution of the identified network will thereby be largely dependent on the input experimental_data however this interaction will be negligible if the excluded tf have only a mild effect the mathematical framework proposed in this paper is deterministic in nature and does not consider the experimental variability and parameter_uncertainty in the network prediction even then the posterior sensitivity analysis illustrated inindicates an acceptable level of sensitivity of network connections to the experimental uncertainty the developed methodology has been illustrated in the context of differentiating population of embryonic_stem to pancreatic lineage however the mathematical framework is general enough to be used to analyze the differentiation of stem_cells embryonic or adult to any lineage although there is considerable information regarding specific role of transcription_factors at different stages of organogenesis very little information is available at present on how transcriptional_networks are organized within these cells the proposed methodology will be instrumental in identifying such transcriptional_networks and the environmental effect on such networks which will have potential application in designing in silico protocols for stem_cell the proposed scheme holds page
