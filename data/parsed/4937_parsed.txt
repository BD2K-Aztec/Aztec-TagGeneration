systems_biology xlinkdb integrated large_scale structural analysis of protein crosslinking data motivation large_scale chemical_cross with mass_spectrometry xl ms analyses are quickly becoming a powerful means for high_throughput determination of protein structural_information and proteinprotein_interactions recent_studies have garnered thousands of cross_linked interactions yet the field lacks an effective tool to compile experimental_data or access the network and structural knowledge for these large_scale analyses we present xlinkdb which integrates tools for network_analysis protein databank queries modeling of predicted protein_structures and modeling of docked protein_structures the novel integrated approach of xlinkdb enables the holistic analysis of xl ms protein interaction data without limitation to the cross_linker or analytical system used for the analysis availability_and xlinkdb can be found here including documentation and help http xlinkdb gs washington edu large_scale structural_characterization of interactions within proteins and protein_complexes is a major_goal of structural proteomics recent efforts have generated datasets featuring thousands of peptidepeptide links used to build networks of proteinprotein_interactions ppis yet the full depth of these datasets is often unrealized as i the structural data inherent to chemical crosslinking mass_spectrometry xl ms networks remains untapped on a network wide scale particularly for proteins lacking empirically_derived structures and ii there is currently no centralized platform to host these large_scale networks to address the lack of network level structural_information we present xlinkdb hereafter xlinkdb a web_resource designed to integrate xl ms data with databases of protein_structures enable generation of protein_structure models for proteins lacking known structures and generate automated proteinprotein_docking models protein_structures are derived from empirical data when available protein databank pdb or through high_quality structural prediction modeller similarly structures of docked interacting_proteins are queried from the pdb or docked with patchdock xlinkdbs automation allows for the first cross_platform streamlined structural analysis of large xl ms datasets and provides a curated ever growing reference_database of cross_linked protein interactions for the general_community features and relatively low runtime make imp ideal for highthroughput analyses the user input for xlinkdb is a tab_delimited text_file with only six columns to identify crosslinked peptides and protein accessions peptide_sequence protein uniprot accession the relative_position of the crosslinked residue within peptide peptide_sequence protein uniprot accession and the relative_position of the crosslinked residue within peptide xlinkdb has been preloaded with publicly_available example xl ms datasets from previous_analyses importantly as demonstrated by the publicly_accessible datasets within xlinkdb data from any xl ms pipeline can be used as the input including that generated by plink xlinkx or react xlinkdb generates proteinprotein_interaction and queries the uniprot database to determine the amino_acid for all input proteins supplementary xlinkdb then queries the pdb to determine if a pdb structure exists for the protein and maps identified crosslinked residues to these structures if no pdb structure exists xlinkdb generates a homology_model using modeller through the pdb query or modeller prediction xlinkdb seeks to establish an associated pdb structure or structural model for each protein from the original input for cross_linked relationships identified between two proteins multi protein_complexes xlinkdb will automatically query the pdb again this time searching for co protein_structures that contain both input proteins if no co protein_structures are identified xlinkdb initiates imps integrative docking to determine interaction interfaces of these proteins using sites of crosslinking as empirical distance constraints finally xlinkdb retains the top_ranked docked model for each protein complex modeling and docking jobs are scheduled and initiated via a jenkins server and job queueing is performed via a centralized sun_grid in this manner the docking and modeling platforms are maintained separately from network_analysis all associated structures models docked models and crosslinked residues therein can be visualized using jmol directly within the users web_browser
