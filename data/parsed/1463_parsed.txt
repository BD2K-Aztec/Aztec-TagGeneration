sequence_analysis domosaics software for domain arrangement visualization and domain centric analysis of proteins domosaics is an application that unifies protein domain annotation domain arrangement analysis and visualization in a single tool it simplifies the analysis of protein_families by consolidating disjunct procedures based on often inconvenient command_line applications and complex analysis tools it provides a simple user_interface with access to domain annotation services such as interproscan or a local hmmer installation and can be used to compare analyze and visualize the evolution of domain_architectures availability_and domosaics is licensed under the apache license version and binaries can be freely obtained from www domosaics protein evolution can be treated as a series of domain wise changes that alter their domain arrangement or architecture the sequence of a proteins constituent domains the majority of novel arrangements can be explained by rearranging domains and processes such as fusion fission and terminal domain loss are thought to be the primary forces at play the signatures of domains are stored in specialized domain databases such as pfam superfamily or interpro existing_tools that exploit domain content for evolutionary_analysis focus on specific aspects primarily the identification of homologous_proteins and are often limited to a single domain definition database services are either provided in the form of web_servers such as d omix or dahunter now wdac or as standalone applications such as pfamalyzer nifas or xdom the recently described tool archschema takes a domain graph approach to illustrate related domain arrangements however none of these tools combine annotation analysis search and visualization into a single framework domosaics collates all steps from domain annotation homology_search analysis of architectural evolution to creation of customizable publication ready figures into a single tool the program can be started directly from the domosaics web_page using java web start alternatively a precompiled java archive file jar can be downloaded an example dataset and the program documentation are included in the program
