pdbest a user_friendly platform for manipulating and enhancing protein_structures pdbest pdb enhanced structures toolkit is a user_friendly freely_available platform for acquiring manipulating and normalizing protein_structures in a high_throughput and seamless fashion with an intuitive graphical_interface it allows users with no programming background to download and manipulate their files the platform also exports protocols enabling users to easily share pdb searching and filtering criteria enhancing analysis reproducibility availability_and pdbest installation packages are freely_available for several platforms at http www pdbest acquiring manipulating and filtering large sets of biomolecule files from repositories such as the protein_data is a common and important preprocessing_step prior to protein_structure studies by treating these files one aims to improve data_quality identifying and or removing common idiosyncrasies that could compromise and bias subsequent analysis common filtering tasks include but are not limited to filtering multiple occupancies and models splitting files by chain selecting subsets of atoms or residues identifying missing atoms or residues generating an assessment report given the relevance of structural_biology and bioinformatics several initiatives have been successful in developing software_tools and libraries for manipulating pdb files for different programming_languages such as python java r and others which are widely used today it is however a task of great relevance for both educational and scientific purposes to make the manipulation and study of such source of data more accessible to a larger public from undergraduate_students to researchers without requiring a programming background while taking_into the ever increasing scale of current data availability and guaranteeing the reproducibility of the process despite the efforts of the community to make these capabilities available as web_services there still is a significant demand for an easy to use scalable platform for treating protein_structures to fill this gap we have developed pdbest pdb enhanced structures toolkit a user_friendly freely_available platform for acquiring manipulating and normalizing protein_structures in a reproducible high_throughput and seamless fashion
