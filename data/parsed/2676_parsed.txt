sequence_analysis lasagna search integrated transcription_factor search and visualization in a browser lasagna search is an integrated webtool for transcription_factor tf_binding search and visualization the tool is based on the lasagna length aware site alignment guided by nucleotide association algorithm it eliminates manual tf model collection and promoter_sequence retrieval search results can be visualized locally or in the university of california santa_cruz genome_browser gene_regulatory based on the search results offers another way of visualization a list of tfs and target_genes is all a user needs to start using the tool lasagna search currently offers tf models and supports species for automatic promoter retrieval and visualization in the university of california santa_cruz genome_browser it is a user_friendly designed for non bioinformaticians and is suitable for research and teaching we describe important changes made since the initial release availability_and lasagna search is freely_available without registration ata transcription_factor tf is a protein or protein complex that regulates gene_expression by physically binding to the regulatory_regions of its target_genes because of the similarity shared among binding_sites of a tf a model can be built from the known tf_binding tfbss to search for novel binding_sites in unannotated dna_sequences various assays can be used to identify binding_sites of a tf one of these is the highthroughput chip_seq method which combines chromatin_immunoprecipitation with massively_parallel dna_sequencing briefly dna bound by the tf in question is sequenced producing short dna_sequences or reads by aligning these reads to a reference_genome we obtain the number of reads covering each genomic location or the binding signals which are used by a peak finding algorithm to locate signal peaks in the genome projects such as the encyclopedia of dna elements encode_project encode_project generated huge_amounts of chip_seq for human and mouse tfs across different cell_types this helps scientists better understand tf_binding for the studied species chip_seq however are not available for lesser studied tfs and species as a result tfbs search tools are still routinely used by scientists and databases curating tfbss and tf models are released or updated lasagna search is an integrated webtool that allows users to perform tfbs search and visualization without leaving the website it offers collections of tf models_built from either tfbss or position specific weight matrices pwms where the tfbss and pwms were collected from transfac jaspar uniprobe oreganno and pazar to use custom tf models the tool accepts unaligned variable_length binding_sites of a tf as well as tf models in the form of pwms in case tfbss are provided the lasagna algorithm is used to align variablelength tfbss before building a tf model while users can provide dna_sequences in the fasta_format to be scanned for putative_binding lasagna search supports automatic promoter_sequence retrieval for species users can use official gene symbols refseq mrna accession_numbers or ncbi gene ids to search for genes and retrieve promoter_sequences relative to the transcription_start promoter_sequences retrieved via lasagna search come with genomic_locations which allow the search results to be visualized with other annotations with ease users can either visualize hits locally or in the university of california santa_cruz ucsc_genome with a mouse click finally significant binding_sites of tf a found in the promoter of gene b suggest interaction between tf a and gene b enabled by our tool search results can hence be visualized as a network of tfs tf coding_genes and target_genes since the initial release of lasagna search we received constructive and encouraging feedback from the users which resulted in lasagna search in this note we describe the improvements discuss the implications and outline future work
