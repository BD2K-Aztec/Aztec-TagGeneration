a method to infer positive_selection from marker dynamics in an asexual population motivation the observation of positive_selection acting on a mutant indicates that the corresponding mutation has some form of functional_relevance determining the fitness_effects of mutations thus has relevance to many interesting biological_questions one means of identifying beneficial_mutations in an asexual population is to observe changes in the frequency of marked subsets of the population we here describe a method to estimate the establishment times and fitnesses of beneficial_mutations from neutral marker frequency data results the method accurately reproduces complex marker frequency trajectories in simulations for which positive_selection is close to per generation we obtain correlations upwards of between correct and inferred haplotype establishment times where mutation selection coefficients are exponentially_distributed the inferred distribution of haplotype fitnesses is close to being correct applied to data from a bacterial evolution experiment our method reproduces an observed correlation between evolvability and initial fitness defect the potential of a biological system to adapt to a given environment is a key characteristic measurements of which shed light on a critical aspect of the process of evolution how adaptation takes_place depends to a large extent on the distribution of the fitness_effects of mutations eyre therefore quantitative_measurements of selection are biologically_interesting and valuable neutral markers provide one tool for identifying selection in experimental_populations in an experimental population markers allow for the easy identification of variants selection_pressures acting on marked populations can then be seen by changes in their relative_frequencies in initially isogenic asexual populations neutral markers have been used to characterize novel beneficial_mutations rozen to whom correspondence should be addressed and to study evolutionary_processes such as clonal interference and evolvability where marked subpopulations have differing initial fitness their relative fitnesses can be derived by considering the ratio between their malthusian parameters where the initial population is isogenic these growth_rates are theoretically identical but novel beneficial_mutations lead to changes in the marker frequencies in a study of beneficial_mutations arising inexamined the log_ratio between marker population frequencies for each set of observed marker frequencies a deterministic curve parameterized by a mutation time and a selection coefficient was fitted multiple simulations of populations were then generated giving an estimate of a single beneficial mutation_rate and selection coefficient fitting the set of observations as a whole while this characterization of multiple_populations by single mutation and selection parameters provides a useful approach where clonal interference between mutations is severe it is not applicable to all evolutionary_scenarios under a very low beneficial mutation_rate where competition between clones is rare mutations under a range of strengths of positive_selection would be likely to fix furthermore in the application of this method where only the first mutational event in an experiment is considered frequencies at later time points are discarded potentially valuable information on the evolution of the system is lost here we describe an alternative method that uses a maximum_likelihood approach to infer selective effects and establishment times of mutants in an asexual population from individual marker frequency trajectories our method enables the inference of fitness of multiple mutant haplotypes arising in an experiment with no prior assumption of their distribution of fitness_effects while also allowing for the detection of standing variation in the initial pool we test our method against data generated from simulations using a range of evolutionary_parameters and against experimental_results from a recent study of marker populations
