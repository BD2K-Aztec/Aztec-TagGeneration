siform shared informative factor_models for integration of multi_platform bioinformatic data motivation high_dimensional omic_data derived from different technological platforms have been extensively used to facilitate comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and to determine personalized health treatments numerous studies have integrated multi_platform omic_data however few have efficiently and simultaneously addressed the problems that arise from high_dimensionality and complex correlations results we propose a statistical_framework of shared informative factor_models that can jointly analyze multi_platform omic_data and explore their associations with a disease phenotype the common disease associated sample characteristics across different data types can be captured through the shared structure space while the corresponding weights of genetic variables directly index the strengths of their association with the phenotype extensive_simulation demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in terms of biomarker detection_accuracy via comparisons with three popular regularized regression_methods we also apply the proposed method to the cancer_genome lung_adenocarcinoma dataset to jointly explore associations of mrna_expression and protein expression with smoking_status many of the identified biomarkers belong to key pathways for lung tumorigenesis some of which are known to show differential_expression across smoking levels we discover potential biomarkers that reveal different mechanisms of lung tumorigenesis between light smokers and heavy_smokers availability_and r code to implement the new method can be downloaded fromthe success of the human_genome enables genome_wide studies of various biological_activities in humans and other organisms the extensive development of high_throughput biotechnologies have made data accessible from different platforms including rna_sequencing copy_number dna_methylation and protein lysate arrays although vital to the progress of biomedical_research these multi_platform data impose new challenges for data analysis in addition to high_dimensionality and complex correlations within and across platforms different types of omic_data also likely have different scales and distributions therefore appropriate and effective analytical_methods are desirable to extract useful information from the emerging data platforms integrative_analysis of multi_platform data has been proposed to study the interplay within and between different levels of biological data a large number of statistical_methods have been discussed for different applications and purposes for example sequential_analysis e g multiple concerted disruption confirms or refines the findings obtained from one data type by analyzing additional omic_data collected from the common set of samples pairwise correlation of genetic variables e g weighted gene correlation network_analysis is used to infer molecular_network interactions network_analysis e g jactivemodules identifies active or aberrant subsets in a certain biological system using molecular_network interactions based on graphical_models bayesian_network approaches identify_biomarkers that are associated with clinical_outcomes by incorporating another type of biomarkers collected from the same samples through prior distributions another line of work in canonical_correlation cca intends to identify the linear_combinations of the two sets of genetic variables which have maximum correlation with each other more recent development based on the original cca includes sparse cca which identifies the linear_combinations of the two high_dimensional genomic_data by incorporating penalty function supervised cca which associates the linear_combinations with some clinical_outcome and multiple cca which extends to the case of more than two datasets we propose to simultaneously analyze multi_platform data to detect predictive_biomarkers for a response variable of interest which is typically a disease associated phenotype the widely used variable_selection approach aggregates genetic variables derived from different platforms as covariates in regression_models for the response variable to address the extremely high_dimensionality of the covariate space which is much larger than the number of samples sparsity induced penalization methods have been commonly used this line of work includes the l penalty based lasso its improved version adaptive lasso l and l combined elastic_net and smoothly clipped absolute deviation scad the scad method has been shown to have appealing theoretical oracle properties unbiasedness sparsity and continuity however the drawbacks of regression based_methods include a limitation on the number of selected_variables according to the available sample_size and the incapability to detect correlated variables to address these challenges we propose a framework of shared informative factor_models to use in integrating_multiple types of omic_data plus a disease associated response variable in contrast to the conventional factor_models we incorporate the disease phenotype information in the factor space to detect genetic variables that interact with the response variable in addition we assume a common structured factor across multiple data types for the purpose of detecting different levels of the important disease associated genetic variables the proposed_framework lays the foundation for incorporating prior_biological on functional pathways and networks both within a data type and across different data types to improve the biological_relevance of the results we have proposed a generalized statistical_framework siform to jointly_model high_throughput omic_data produced by multiple_platforms and to discover associations between these genetic variables and a disease associated phenotype the new method conveniently produces direct rankings of genetic variables in terms of the strength of association with the response variable extensive_simulation demonstrated the superior_performance of siform in terms of biomarker detection_accuracy regardless of inter variable correlations compared to the performances of other penalized variable_selection methods biological meaningfulness of the proposed method is supported by two tcga lung_adenocarcinoma studies that investigate the association of the integrated mrna_expression and rppa protein concentration data and two phenotypes smoking_status and discretized survival in particular we discovered that most of the identified proteins either belong to known key pathways for nsclc tumorigenesis or are prognostic_biomarkers in nsclc we also discovered some proteins that are potentially associated with the different ways in which nsclc develops in smokers versus non smokers the proposed_framework appears to fit the lung_cancer data reasonably well however a more comprehensive version of this framework can be developed to improve the goodness_of of the model if appropriate a possible solution is to include a nonparametric mean component for example with the structure of singular_value and use model_selection methods e g bic to determine the rank of the additional component this idea requires extensive investigation and therefore is deferred to our future_research another ongoing research_project is to modify siform by incorporating the prior biological pathway_information to improve biomarker detection_accuracy specifically further regularization of the parameters for example a graphic model based penalization method will be investigated
