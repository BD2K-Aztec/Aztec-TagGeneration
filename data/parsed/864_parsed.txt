gene_expression cascade a r package to study predict and simulate the diffusion of a signal through a temporal gene network temporal gene interactions in response to environmental_stress form a complex system that can be efficiently described using gene_regulatory they allow highlighting the more influential genes and spotting some targets for biological intervention experiments despite that many reverse_engineering tools have been designed the cascade package is an integrated solution adding several new and original key features such as the ability to predict changes in gene_expressions after a biological perturbation in the network and graphical outputs that allow monitoring the spread of a signal through the network availability_and the r package cascade is available online atsince the emergence of high_throughput that allow measuring simultaneously expression of thousands of genes many tools have been developed to learn gene_expression and reverse_engineer their underlying gene_regulatory grn these tools are either based on static coexpression methods or if the biological_phenomenon shows any temporality time dependent methods although the former relies on the assumption that coexpressed genes share some biological_characteristics the latter infers a directed network with temporal dependencies in this last case another important distinction should be made between exogenous stress e g growth response and endogenous phenomenon e g cell_cycle this leads to different network_topologies in exogenous stress networks topologies seem to have larger hubs and shorter paths through temporal dependent transcriptional waves this results in a quick_response to environmental modifications the cascade package is designed to model such cascade networks taking_advantage of the assignment of genes to temporal clusters which adds temporal causality in the network
