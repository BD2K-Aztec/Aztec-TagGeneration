metextract a new software_tool for the automated comprehensive extraction of metabolite derived lc_ms signals in metabolomics research motivation liquid chromatographymass spectrometry lc_ms is a key technique in metabolomics since the efficient assignment of ms signals to true_biological metabolites becomes feasible in combination with in vivo stable isotopic labelling our aim was to provide a new software_tool for this purpose results an algorithm and a program metextract have been developed to search for metabolites in in vivo labelled biological_samples the algorithm makes use of the chromatographic characteristics of the lc_ms data and detects ms peaks fulfilling the criteria of stable isotopic labelling as a result of all calculations the algorithm specifies a list of m z values the corresponding number of atoms of the labelling element e g carbon together with retention time and extracted adduct fragment and polymer ions its function was evaluated using native c and uniformly c labelled standard substances the extraction of high_resolution lc_ms signals of true metabolites contained in complex biological_samples is still a major_challenge in non targeted metabolomics this limitation can largely be attributed to the non specific nature of the electrospray_ionisation esi process in lc_ms leading to full scan spectra which tend to contain up to background signals compared with signals measured for metabolites in vivo stable isotopic labelling offers a powerful_tool to circumvent these limitations uniformly c labelled metabolites show identical chromatographic behaviour as their non labelled isotopologues but can be easily differentiated by ms recently for example successfully used c labelled arabidopsis_thaliana plants in combination with to whom correspondence should be addressed database_searching for the elimination of background signals and annotation of metabolites despite the high potential of this approach in metabolomics research no algorithms have been published for the automated evaluation of lc_ms data originating from in vivo labelled biological_samples to the best of our knowledge a single commercial software programme exists to date which has been designed to assign differentially_expressed metabolites in differently treated biological_samples e g control versus treatment by calculating and graphically illustrating the intensity ratios of the principal ions from isotopologue signal pairs http nextgenmetabolomics com complementary to this the presented metextract algorithm makes use of biological cultures obtained under identical growth conditions with the only difference being the isotopic_composition of the nutrition source metextract mainly aims at the global detection and combination of metabolitederived corresponding lc_ms signals originating from natural and stable isotopically labelled analogues and their assignment to true_biological metabolites page of the algorithm for a given lc_ms dataset observed for stable isotopic labelled metabolites metextract offers a list of m z values which were identified to represent true_biological metabolites the final output specifies binned m z values the corresponding number of atoms of the specified labelling element e g carbon together with retention time and found adduct fragment and polymer ions if database_search function is used database entries matching the selected assignment criteria will also be listed
