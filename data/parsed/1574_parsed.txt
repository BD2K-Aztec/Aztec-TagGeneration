data_and emzed an open_source framework in python for rapid and interactive development of lc_ms data analysis workflows the python based open_source emzed framework was developed for mass_spectrometry ms users to create tailored work flows for liquid_chromatography lc_ms data analysis the goal was to establish a unique framework with comprehensive basic function alities that are easy to apply and allow for the extension and modification of the framework in a straightforward manner emzed supports the iterative development and prototyping of individual evaluation strategies by providing a computing environment and tools for inspecting and modifying underlying lc_ms data the framework specifically addresses non expert programmers as it requires only basic_knowledge of python and relies largely on existing successful open_source e g openms availability the framework emzed and its documentation are freely_available atliquid chromatography mass_spectrometry lc_ms data analysis generally requires flexible software_tools although a number of solutions for specific or multiple applications currently exist many of these belong to one of two extremes the first group includes frameworks that are highly_flexible but have been developed in languages e g c that require advanced programming_skills e g openms although such frameworks have a rapid application run time the testing of new workflows and concepts is cumbersome because programming requirements are high and edit compile cycles are slow the second group includes closed black_box solutions with graphical_user that are easy to use but inherently non transparent and inflexible e g maven and mzmine note that libraries such as the r based xcms or the matlab based bioinformatics toolbox mathworks natick ma usa lie between these extremes the motivation to develop emzed was to provide an open_source framework to establish transparent and flexible workflows for high end data treatment that requires only basic programming_skills of the user to this end we combined the powerful and easy to learn programming_language python a comprehensive library of elementary building_blocks and an integrated development environment metabolomics and related_fields are rapidly_progressing and require the development and modification of workflows and analytical strategies in this context the speed of data analysis routines is an important factor although efforts to implement and test new solutions are equally_important to this end emzed provides a workspace and capability to inspect and visualize interim results at each step of data_processing in addition emzed provides a common base for developing individual applications and supports interchangeable individual solutions this approach may help to simplify the current landscape of existing lc_ms software which is fragmented and often laboratory specific
