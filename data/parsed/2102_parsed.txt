databases_and gpcr ontology development and application of a g_protein pharmacology knowledge framework motivation novel tools need to be developed to help scientists analyze large_amounts of available screening data with the goal to identify entry points for the development of novel chemical probes and drugs as the largest class of drug_targets g_protein gpcrs remain of particular interest and are pursued by numerous academic and industrial research_projects results we report the first gpcr ontology to facilitate integration and aggregation of gpcr targeting_drugs and demonstrate its application to classify and analyze a large subset of the pubchem database the gpcr ontology based on previously_reported bioassay ontology depicts available pharmacological biochemical and physiological profiles of gpcrs and their ligands the novelty of the gpcr ontology lies in the use of diverse experimental_datasets linked by a model to formally define these concepts using a reasoning system gpcr ontology offers potential for knowledge based classification of individuals such as small_molecules as a function of the data availability the gpcr ontology is available at http www bioas sayontology org bao gpcr and the national center for biomedical_ontologies web_site gpcrs continue to remain a hot target of research as new structural_information signal processing_pathways and largescale compound screening results become validated and available acquired data come with challenges of integration and analysis to derive new knowledge here we report gpcr ontology to facilitate integration of various gpcr resources the gpcr ontology includes relevant classes and relations to characterize and link receptors and compounds that are known binders or show activity on gpcrrelated assays to more effectively disseminate biological data on gpcrs with the goal to drive innovation involving biologists chemists and bioinformaticians requires a flexible framework to integrate gpcr data from various resources to enable identification of novel gpcr probe and drug lead candidates via more efficient data_integration and analysis we first researched and then aggregated available and relevant gpcr pharmacological data_sources gpcr target and ligand features are captured in the ontology to enable more versatile and integrative views on gpcr function for example classifying different ligand types based on chemical_structure composition amine peptide and lipid as well as different receptor_types aminergic peptidergic and lipidergic can guide compound library design to maximize structureactivity relationship sar studies we have illustrated how the major receptor categories can be inferred ligands are also classified based on their efficacy at a particular gpcr full agonist allosteric_modulator etc yielding insight into selective agonism issues that are becoming more apparent in gpcr pharmacology gesty palmer and in addition ligands are grouped based on their indication endogenous promiscuous and radioactive and the type of the receptor they interact with for example ligand s p is classified as a full agonist endogenous lipid compound targeting the class a lipidergic lysophospholipid family of s p receptors to illustrate use of the gpcr ontology the activity of screened compounds was categorized based on assay details stage technology detection alternate targets etc and receptor information type class etc the query to identify how often a compound has been screened against a given type of gpcrfacilitated calculation of receptor type specific promiscuity for example sid was tested in assays targeting peptidergic gpcrs and was active in of them pcidx categorization of compound data into various activity groups functionally_active target selective non functionally_active and unselective across a single campaign illustrates how the gpcr ontology can be applied the process included sorting tagging the data based on confidence of each data point and using only the highest quality results analysis was performed within and across screening campaigns to identify the most interesting and relevant compounds according to several categories the identification of known mlp probes in addition to many other compounds that are potential probe or drug_development candidates validates our approach target selective category compounds not tested in confirmatory assays were filtered out in the analysis_pipeline ensuring only high_quality likely replicable outcomes were used for the cross campaign categorization relaxing the confidence_score may thus identify many additional potentially relevant compounds promiscuity calculations and compound categories were performed using a rule_based system in contrast to reasoning because we wanted to report statistics and consider confidence of assay results but also because of the difficulty to reason across large_datasets the gpcr ontology enables additional levels of analytical complexity e g tissue expression linking receptor and tissue expression pattern is another example among many others of how the ontology adds value by enabling integration of data_sources this would allow inferring if a compound acts at a receptor in the brain versus another peripheral_tissue thus enabling quick identification of potential brain penetrable properties analyses as described earlier in the text can be performed for any concept class in the gpcr ontology
