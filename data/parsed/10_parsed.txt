genome_analysis a miseq an updated pipeline to assemble microbial_genomes from illumina_miseq data motivation open_source bacterial genome_assembly remains inaccessible to many biologists because of its complexity few software solutions exist that are capable of automating all steps in the process of de_novo from illumina data results a miseq can produce high_quality microbial genome_assemblies on a laptop computer without any parameter_tuning a miseq does this by automating the process of adapter trimming quality filtering error_correction contig and scaffold generation and detection of misassemblies unlike the original a pipeline a miseq can use long_reads from the illumina_miseq use read pairing information during contig generation and includes several improvements to read trimming together these changes result in substantially improved assemblies that recover a more complete set of reference genes than previous methods availability a miseq is licensed under the gpl open_source source_code and precompiled binaries for mac os x and linux are available from http sourceforge net_projects ngoptgenome assembly involves an entire data_processing workflow starting with raw_sequence and ending with scaffolded contigs the steps often consist of adapter trimming quality filtering error_correction creation of contigs verification of contigs by mapping reads to the assembly and the creation verification of scaffolds we previously_published a a pipeline that automated all the steps to generate bacterial genome_assemblies from raw illumina data the workflow included five steps and the parameters for each step were optimized on assemblies of halophilic archaea and tested on escherichia_coli since the publication of a illuminas chemistry has advanced significantly and the miseq instruments are now capable of producing reads in excess of nt_long which is fold longer than what was previously possible on a hiseq the original a could not process reads longer than nt the longer_reads make it possible to assemble genomes from less data overall but doing so required major revisions to the data_processing algorithms in a we introduce a revised pipeline called a miseq which replaces several components of the original a pipeline with new software modules and produces substantially improved assemblies the benchmarking results for a miseq on the gage b data shown in indicate that it offers substantial improvements over the original a pipeline a miseq assemblies contain more full_length reference genes than a or any of the gage b assemblers relative to the original a the number of genes missing from a miseq assemblies is reduced by fold on the gage b datasets in most cases a miseq assemblies have higher nga values fewer misassemblies and fewer basecalling errors than the original a pipeline a miseq produces results that are competitive with the best achieved by other assemblers on the gage b data but requires only minimal user effort a miseq can recover nearly complete genome_assemblies with much less sequence_data than its predecessor shows that to recover a fixed fraction of the genome e g a miseq requires about half as much sequence_data relative to a a miseq achieves higher degrees of contiguity with less data this permits deeper multiplexing of sequencing_experiments a miseq is computationally_efficient assembly of the b cereus gage b data completed in h with a peak memory_usage of gb and gb disk usage on a laptop computational requirements for other bacterial_genomes are similar one limitation of the gage b data is that following its publication assembly pipelines might be inadvertently tuned to produce high scores specifically on that dataset this could result in artificially high scores that do not accurately_reflect the expected performance on other datasets we assert that we have not tuned a miseq in any way to improve scores on the gage b dataset and to our knowledge none of the component programs used by a miseq has been optimized for gage b genome_assembly is a fast evolving field and software has been advancing rapidly although a miseq produces assemblies that are competitive with results in a recently_published assembler evaluation it is likely that versions of other software that are currently under peer_review e g spades might produce even better results spades automates many of the same steps that a miseq automates and in general produces excellentassembly accuracy for the a miseq and a pipelines measured on raw coverage miseq pe gage b data accuracy was measured by quast frac is the fraction of the reference_genome represented in assembly scaffolds nga the n after breaking contigs at misassemblies ma number of misassemblies mm number of nucleotide mismatches per kbp genes number of intact full_length genes recovered for gage b results the single best assembly result for each metric and genome reported in magoc et_al is shown with the assembler producing the best result indicated as follows s spades sdn soapdenovo m masurca a abyss sga sga contiguity of assemblies of the b cereus data from gage b with increasing depths of coverage a was run on reads cut down from nt to nt a miseq was run on both the cut down reads red and the fulllength nt reads black a miseq assemblies become highly contiguous with coverage whereas a blue requires coverage to achieve comparable contiguity assemblies with a miseqs main advantages being automated adapter trimming more full_length genes assembled ncbi ready outputs and production of base call quality_scores if possible researchers interested in genome_assembly should become acquainted with the various algorithms available before selecting a particular approach a miseq should be particurlarly useful for researchers with limited bioinformatics experience or computing_resources
