omppm online multiple palindrome pattern matching motivation a palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward finding palin dromic substructures is important in dna rna or protein sequence_analysis we say that two strings of the same length are pal equivalent if for each possible centre they have the same length of the maximal palindrome given a text t of length n and a pattern p of length m we study the pal indrome pattern_matching that finds all indices i such that p and t i m i are pal equivalent results we first solve the online palindrome pattern_matching in o m preprocessing time and o mn query time using o m space we then extend the problem for multiple patterns and solve the online multiple palindrome pattern_matching in om k m preprocessing time and om k n c query time using om k m space where m is the sum of all pattern lengths m k is the longest pattern length and c is the number of pattern occurrences availability_and the source_code for all algorithms is freely_available toc finding motifs and patterns in bio strings has been one of the most popular topics in both computer science and biology a palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward namely a string w is a palindrome if w w r where w r denotes the reversal of w if a substring of a string is a palindrome we say that the string has a palindromic substring or palindromic structure it is important to find palindromes and identify similar palindromic structures in dna rna or protein sequence_analysis since palindromic structures in bio data reflect the capability of molecules to fold and form doublestranded stems bio data with similar palindromic structures may have similar secondary_structures moreover palindromic sequences are closely associated with dna_breakage during gene_conversion and palindromic substructures are presented in crispr_cas which has been used for gene_editing and gene_regulation in species therefore it is useful to identify palindromic substructures and palindromic equivalence efficiently we focus on the palindrome pattern_matching introduced by given a text t of length n and a pattern p of length m the palindrome pattern_matching is to find all indices i such that p and ti m i have the same set of all centre distinct maximal palindromes seefor an example presented two algorithms that solve the palindrome pattern matching for an arbitrary size alphabet we notice that both algorithms byrequire a preprocessing_step of t this may slow down the whole process when t is an extremely_large text and i o for t is considerably slow due to the large but slow storages moreover these algorithms might not be applicable if t is a stream data many researchers designed online string algorithms to avoid these problems where each character in t is given online and we want to report intermediate results without readingwhole t for the palindrome pattern_matching we want to report all matching indices i while reading t online based on the knuthmorrispratt algorithm we first build an automaton a from p and process t using a for a text t of length n and a pattern p of length m our algorithm requires o m preprocessing time and runs in o mn query time using o m space we furthermore tackle the online multiple palindrome pattern matching based on a modification of the ahocorasick automaton for multiple patterns p p k of length m m k our algorithm requires om k m preprocessing time and runs in om k n c query time using om k m space where m is the sum of all pattern lengths m k is the longest pattern length and c is the number of pattern occurrences note that the second algorithm considers multiple patterns and has the same query time as the first algorithm except the number of pattern occurrences
