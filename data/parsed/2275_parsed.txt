identification and removal of ribosomal rna_sequences from metatranscriptomes here we present ribopicker a robust framework for the rapid automated identification and removal of ribosomal rna_sequences from metatranscriptomic datasets the results can be exported for subsequent analysis and the databases used for the web_based version are updated on a regular basis ribopicker categorizes rrna like sequences and provides graphical visualizations and tabular outputs of ribosomal coverage alignment results and taxonomic classifications availability_and this open_source application was implemented in perl and can be used as stand alone version or accessed online through a_user the source_code user help and additional information is available atmetatranscriptomic approaches are drastically improving our understanding of metabolism and gene_expression in microbial_communities by investigating all functional mrna_transcripts isolated from an environmental sample metatranscriptomic analyses provide insights into the metabolic_pathways important for a community at the time of sampling although metatranscriptomes are used to investigate metabolic_activities the majority of rna recovered in metatranscriptomic studies is ribosomal_rna rrna often exceeding of the total reads even after various treatments prior to sequencing the observed rrna content decreases only slightly and metatranscriptomes still contain significant amounts of rrna although rrna like sequences are occasionally removed from metatranscriptomes the removal is performed only with a subset of the publicly_available rrna sequences failure to remove all rrna sequences can lead to misclassifications and erroneous_conclusions during the downstream_analysis it is estimated that misannotations of rrna as proteins may cause up to false_positive matches of rrna like sequences in metatranscriptomic studies the potential for false_positives arrises to whom correspondence should be addressed from a failure to completely remove all rrna prior to translating the putative rrna and querying a protein database the rrna_operons in bacteria and archaea are not known to contain expressed protein_coding that at the same time code for rrna and therefore annotations of proteins in rrna coding_regions should be presumed to be misannotations metagenomic sequence_data generated to asses the metabolic potential of a community will also be affected by false_positive matches of rrna sequences when querying a protein database therefore transcript analysis should only proceed after it has been verified that all rrna like sequences have been found and removed from the dataset to allow accurate identification of the transcribed functional content the high_throughput nature of community sequencing_efforts necessitates better tools for the automated preprocessing of sequence_datasets here we describe an application able to provide graphical guidance and to perform identification classification and removal of rrna like sequences on metatranscriptomic data the application incorporates a modified_version of the bwasw program http bioinformatics oxfordjournals org citmgr gca bioinfo and is publicly_available through a_user and as stand alone version the web_interface allows online analysis using rrna sequences from public_databases and provides data export for subsequent analysis
