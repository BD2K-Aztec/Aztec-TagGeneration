sequence_analysis rnasalign rna structural_alignment system motivation structural_alignment of rna is found to be a useful computational technique for idenitfying non_coding ncrnas however existing_tools do not handle structures with pseudoknots although algorithms exist that can handle structural_alignment for different types of pseudoknots no software_tools are available and users have to determine the type of pseudoknots to select the appropriate algoirthm to use which limits the usage of structural_alignment in identifying novel ncrnas results we implemented the first web_server rnasalign which can automatically identify the pseudoknot type of a secondary_structure and perform structural_alignment of a folded rna with every region of a target dna rna_sequence regions with high similarity_scores and low e values together with the detailed alignments will be reported to the user experiments on more than ncrna families show that rnasalign is effective structural_alignment is an important topic in studying rnas especially for non_coding ncrnas which are found to be evolutionary_conserved in terms of primary sequences and secondary_structures to check if a given sequence target contains regions that are possibly candidates of a particular ncrna family a useful computational_approach is to compute the structural_alignment between a folded ncrna query of the family and every unfolded region in the target_sequence where the alignment score represents their sequence and structural_similarity the approach has been shown to be effective some existing software such as rsearch and fastr belongs to this category however the approach is not being widely used partially due to the followings first the available tools rsearch and fastr do not support query with pseduoknots the secondary_structure of an ncrna is said to contain a pseudoknot if there are two base_pairs at positions i j and i j where i j and i j such that i i j j or i i j j secondary_structures including pseudoknots are found to be critical in some biological_functions secondly although there
