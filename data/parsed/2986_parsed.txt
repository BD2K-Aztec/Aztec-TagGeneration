mira mutual_information based reporter algorithm for metabolic_networks motivation discovering the transcriptional_regulatory architecture of the metabolism has been an important topic to understand the implications of transcriptional fluctuations on metabolism the reporter algorithm ra was proposed to determine the hot_spots in metabolic_networks around which transcriptional_regulation is focused owing to a disease or a genetic perturbation using a z_score based scoring_scheme ra calculates the average statistical change in the expression levels of genes that are neighbors to a target_metabolite in the metabolic_network the ra approach has been used in numerous studies to analyze cellular_responses to the downstream genetic changes in this article we propose a mutual_information based multi variate reporter algorithm mira with the goal of eliminating the following problems in detecting reporter metabolites i conventional statistical_methods suffer from small_sample ii as z_score ranges from minus to plus infinity calculating average_scores can lead to canceling out opposite effects and iii analyzing genes one by one then aggregating results can lead to information_loss mira is a multivariate and combinatorial algorithm that calculates the aggregate transcriptional_response around a metabolite using mutual_information we show that miras results are biologically sound empirically significant and more reliable than ra results we apply mira to gene_expression analysis of six knockout strains_of and show that mira captures the underlying metabolic dynamics of the switch from aerobic to anaerobic_respiration we also apply mira to an autism_spectrum gene_expression dataset results indicate that mira reports metabolites that highly overlap with recently found metabolic biomarkers in the autism literature overall mira is a promising algorithm for detecting metabolic drug_targets and understanding the relation between gene_expression and metabolic_activity availability_and the code is implemented in c language using net framework project is available upon request changes with respect to environmental or genetic_modifications lead to complex cellular_responses standing on the top of the omics hierarchy metabolomics reflects changes taking_place in the transcriptome and in the genome these responses are analyzed by researchers to discover regulatory_mechanisms and dynamics of cells transcriptional_responses of the cells along with the corresponding metabolic_alterations have been investigated in various contexts some examples are plant research diabetes insulin_resistance and cancer functional class based and proteinprotein_interaction based analysis of gene_expression data have been well established metabolic_network and metabolic_pathway driven analysis of transcriptional data have been receiving attention lately efforts have centered on discovering transcriptional_regulation architecture of metabolic_networks of organisms using genome_wide various methods with different goals have been developed to use transcriptomic and metabolic data together in the context of a metabolic_network such as i mining for new metabolitegene transcription_factor relationships ii flux_balance and constraint_based of organisms and iii using metabolic network_topology to identify significant changes in related groups of genes network_topology based analysis of biological data is a broad research area in the context of metabolic_networks and transcriptomics the literature so_far can be divided_into two subcategories the first type of analysis uses predefined metabolic_pathways as targets for transcriptional_regulation and analyzes the changes in the pathways gene_set gsea is the first and most established analysis in this subcategory improvements have been proposed in the literature to eliminate the shortcomings of the gsea approach the second type of analysis considers the metabolic_network as a whole and aims to find signatures or hot_spots in the metabolic_network that are subject to transcriptional_regulation the most established method in this group is the reporter algorithm ra using the z_score based method introduced before the algorithm aims to find metabolites around which transcriptional_regulation is centered and link the complex

modifications to the algorithm have been published in the literature for instance same idea has been used to discover reporter reactions a similar z scorebased approach has also been used analyze the rate_limiting steps of pathways in this article we focus on the original ra and its scoring mechanism our observations discussed next also apply to the extensions of the ra method ra first maps the differential data onto the enzymes reactions in the metabolic_network and then calculates the p values for each gene using students t test p values are then converted to z scores using the inverse normal cumulative distribution equation shows how each p i is converted to the corresponding z_score z i given all samples z_score measures how many standard_deviations away a p value is it ranges from negative to positive infinity where negative infinity corresponds to no significance at all the z_score z m for a metabolite m is the aggregation of z scores of the k enzymes that are neighbors of m in the metabolic_network through metabolic_reactions and calculated as shown inequation the null_hypothesis is that the genes adjacent to a metabolite display their normalized average response by chance should the significance of a metabolite need to be determined z_score is normalized and converted back into the corresponding p value that enzyme i is a neighbor of metabolite m although ra has been shown to be effective in several different contexts such as analysis of type_diabetes genome_scale analysis of organisms genome_scale analysis of cell_lines gene_knockout analysis targeted pathway analysis there are some shortcomings that may affect the accuracy of the algorithm first the z_score method uses students t test to measure the amount of change between two variables however the resulting p value is highly dependent on the degrees_of it has been shown that owing to the small number of samples in cohorts p values may not work as intended second ra uses a univariate approach that is it determines the changes per gene and does not take dependencies among genes into account for a reaction associated with multiple genes the gene with the highest z_score is used and the rest are discarded in we illustrate the problem via an example the figure shows an example from the application of the ra algorithm to compare arcafnr and wild_type wt strains_of aerobic in the gene_expression dataset please see section for details genes pentagons are assigned z scores first and then the maximum z_score is selected and assigned as the z_score of the reaction rectangles for the reaction copragon transport via ton system the maximum z_score belongs to the gene fhue this scoring ignores the contribution of the gene tonb as any z_score value for tonb in the range infinity would yield the same z_score for the reaction finally the method is additive in aggregating z scores of each neighboring reaction to determine the z_score of a metabolite as shown in however z_score ranges from negative to positive infinity negative infinity representing the most insignificant case therefore averaging individual results introduces the problem of opposite signs cancelling each other out in copragon is assigned a z_score ffiffi p negative z_score assigned to the reaction copragon transport via abc system partially cancels out the z_score of the reaction copragon transport via ton system the problem would have been resolved if the scoring mechanism used assigned zero to the most insignificant case p in this article we present a new algorithm called mutual_information based reporter algorithm mira that addresses the shortcomings of the original ra mira is a multivariate and combinatorial algorithm that calculates the aggregate transcriptional_response around a metabolite using mutual a binformation mutual_information is an information_theoretic method that measures how much knowing one variable reduces the uncertainty about the other in gene_expression analysis it has been used frequently chowdhury et_al show that combinatorially dysregulated subnetworks found through mutual_information is predictive for cancer in metabolomics analysis using the combinations of metabolites and their levels adema the algorithm for determining expected metabolite alterations predicts expected changes of metabolite_levels in a given metabolic_network using mutual_information in the context of mira the two variables are i the genotype e g case and control and ii the combinations of the genes associated with a reaction and their expression levels more specifically mira performs the following tasks i discretize gene_expression levels using b spline functions ii calculate the mutual_information between the genotype as well as combinations of genes associated in a reaction and their discretized expression levels and iii calculate the average mutual_information for each metabolite using the mutual_information of each neighboring reaction shows the overall flow of the algorithm the advantages of mira over ra are as follows combinatorial mutual_information works well when the sample_sizes are small and performs better than univariate significance testing unlike the ra mira uses a multivariate method analyzing multiple genes at a time therefore it does not discard less insignificant changes unlike ra mira uses measurements of individual samples instead of comparing sample means and is able to capture linear_and dependencies among variables mutual_information is bounded by zero and the minimum of the entropies of the two random_variables the most insignificant case is assigned the score zero therefore insignificant changes do not cancel out significant changes mira has no bias toward highly_connected metabolites as it normalizes the sum of changes around a metabolite using the number of reactions instead of the square_root of number of reactions as ra does see equations and shows the results obtained by mira for the introductory example shown in unlike the ra which assigns a low score to the reaction copragon transport via abc system indicating that there is no significant change on this enzyme mira predicts relatively high mutual_information indicating that when considered together genes fhub fhuc and fhud are expressed differently mira predicts similar results for both reactions and the average is found as max in this test whereas the ra assigns to copragon max in this test the difference between the two algorithms stems from the fact that i mira performs a multivariate_analysis compared withmetabolic networks have received significant attention in the past_decade this advancement has led to the investigation of various genetic_diseases and their metabolism with the use of the reconstructed genome_scale one application is to find the regulatory architecture of the metabolic_network using the underlying transcriptome the ra finds the metabolic hot_spots around which transcriptional_regulation is centered in this article we developed a novel method called mira that uses a combinatorial_approach and mutual_information to find reporter metabolites our approach addresses the shortcomings of the existing ra algorithm more specifically it is robust against small_sample uses a multivariate_approach instead of a univariate one and does not cancel out significant changes in expression levels with non significant ones our results show that i mira has no bias on picking hub metabolites as reporter metabolites ii reporter metabolites found by mira are biologically sound and are supported by literature even for a complex disease like autism iii mira captures the effects of a knockout of the fnr gene in e coli successfully and iv mira provides empirically significant results which supports the fact that it captures the underlying biological_phenomenon
