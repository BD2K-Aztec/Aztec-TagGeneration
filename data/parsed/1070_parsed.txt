genome_analysis comparing dna integration_site clusters with scan statistics motivation gene_therapy with retroviral_vectors can induce adverse_effects when those vectors integrate in sensitive genomic_regions retroviral_vectors are preferred that target sensitive regions less frequently motivating the search for localized clusters of integration sites and comparison of the clusters formed by integration of different vectors scan statistics allow the discovery of spatial differences in clustering and calculation of false_discovery providing statistical_methods for comparing retroviral_vectors results a scan statistic for comparing two vectors using multiple window widths is proposed with software to detect clustering differentials and compute false_discovery application to several sets of experimentally_determined hiv integration sites demonstrates the software simulated_datasets of various sizes and signal strengths are used to determine the power to discover clusters and evaluate a convenient lower_bound this provides a toolkit for planning evaluations of new gene_therapy availability_and the generxcluster r package containing a simple tutorial and usage hints is available from http www bioconductor org retroviruses such as hiv prefer to target specific regions and locations of the host_genome for integration and these preferences differ between retroviruses extensive studies have shown that the integration targeting preferences characteristic of different retroviruses are preserved in retroviral_vectors which are engineered derivatives used for gene_transfer during human gene_therapy gene_therapy with retroviral_vectors benefits patients but carries risks associated with integration in sensitive genomic_regions such as the promoter of the lmo proto_oncogene this motivates the development of vectors with reduced preference for sensitive genomic_regions to track such outcome in human gene_therapy the us food_and has advised the monitoring of integration_site is distribution in cells from gene corrected subjects to assess the risk of integration into sensitive regions u s food_and cber comparing the risks of candidate gene_therapy depends in part on assessing their relative preferences for integration in specific genomic_locations of concern vectors can be compared with respect to their preference for targeting known sensitive regions however limited understanding of the relationship between the genomic location of an integration and its risk constrains the usefulness of inspecting pre specified regions and of supervised_learning or regression_methods for risk_assessment focusing interest instead on clustering detected in empirical_studies local clusters of iss favoring one or another vector reflect preferences for local targets scan statistics generated by moving a window over a defined space and computing a summary at each position have many applications in genomics for an early review see it has been shown that combining scans using windows with a range of widths improves power over a single fixed width scan the false_discovery fdr of such scan statistics is estimated by d fdr r where is the expected number of false_discoveries and r is the number of discovered clumpsi e intervals formed by combining adjacent or overlapping windows with scan statistics passing a defined threshold the estimate is unbiased when the number of false_discoveries is poisson with mean and independent of the number of true discoveries the poisson assumption is reasonable for clumps formed from locally dependent windows seeand the references therein for proofs details and further discussion a method for discovering chromosomal intervals or clumps favoring one vector over another using these methods is outlined in the next section then it is applied to several sets of hiv iss to illustrate how the method could be used in the examples we examine differential clustering in a relatively subtle setting involving comparison of methods for recovering iss made by infection with hiv or an hiv based vector in lymphoid_cells we then discuss the use of this method in the comparison of gene_therapy and some of the analytic issues that arise in supplementary s section it is shown that the method generalizes the definition of so_called common integration sites sets of n iss from one vector in a defined interval and shows how fdrs can be estimated for them to whom correspondence should be addressed we also present a limited comparison with a machine_learning that recursively splits data from a chromosome to form genomic_intervals the clumping method provides a flexible toolkit for exploring local differences in collections of retroviral iss and for planning experiments the comparison of the avr with mse recovery methods may mirror future_studies of gene_therapy only subtle differences exist but they may have profound implications for the risk_profile of a newly engineered vector in clinical_trial reporting the consort criteria require reporting of the power of the trial for the pre specified endpoint this report steps in the direction of allowing a deliberative approach to study planning supplementary s section illustrates some of the possibilities of using this toolkit for planning with an eye toward choosing sensible rules for filtering and sensible cutpoints for discovery there are various parameters that affect the discovery of clumps and the fdrs associated with them ideally these would be set using prior_knowledge and without dependence on statistics that correlate with the ultimate test_statistic optimizing the fdr reported by searching over the parameter_space has the potential to introduce resubstitution bias when such optimization is desired strategies should be implemented such as training on one set of data and using an independent test_set to validate the clumps discovered further work may explore how sensitive resubstitution bias is to different parameters
