genome_analysis splamir prediction of spliced mirnas in plants motivation micrornas mirnas are important regulators of biological_processes in plants and animals recently mirna_genes have been discovered whose primary_transcripts are spliced and which cannot be predicted directly from genomic_sequence hence more sophisticated programs for the detection of spliced mirnas are required results here we present the first method for the prediction of spliced mirnas in plants for a given genomic_sequence splamir creates a database of complementary_sequence pairs which might encode for rnas folding into stemloop structures next in silico splice_variants of database sequences with complementarity to an mrna of interest are classified as to whether they could represent mirnas targeting this mrna our method identifies all known cases of spliced mirnas in rice and a previously undiscovered mirna in maize which is supported by an expressed_sequence est splamir permits identification of spliced mirnas for a given target_mrna in many plant_genomes availability the program is freely_available atmicrornas mirnas are short nt non_coding which generally negatively_regulate these short rnas were first studied in caenorhabditis_elegans and drosophila_melanogaster but the term mirna was coined later since their discovery mirnas have been identified in a number of animals plants and viruses in plants and animals mirnas regulate many biological_processes while virus mirnas mainly target host mrnas involved in antiviral_response cell_proliferation plant mirnas are key_regulators of a variety of developmental_processes including root_development vascular_development flower_development leaf morphogenesis and phase_change from vegetative to reproductive_development in addition plant mirnas are crucial for controlling stress_responses as well as nutrient homeostasis in plants a mirna gene is commonly transcribed by rna_polymerase giving rise to a primary mirna transcript pri mirna which folds into a stemloop structure next mainly unpaired nucleotides at the and ends are cleaved by a multiprotein_complex resulting in a pre mirna pre mirnas feature a huge diversity of lengths further processing of the premirna generates a mirna mirna duplex structure composed of the mature mirna and its complementary part the mirna this duplex exhibits_high complementarity including the standard watson_crick as well as g u wobble base_pairs with generally less than four mismatches and rare and small asymmetric bulges the mirna mirna duplex is either exported to the cytoplasm where it is unwound or it is unwound in the nucleus and the mature mirna is exported to the cytoplasm after incorporation into the rna_induced risc the mature mirna guides the recognition of the target_mrna which then leads to post_transcriptional of this mrna featuring standard and wobble base_pairs with usually less than four mismatches and few bulges the mirna is highly complementary to its target_mrna this way plant mirnas generally guide mrna cleavage the minimum_length of mature_mirnas in plants is nt some primary_transcripts of mirnas contain introns in most published cases the characteristic stemloop structure is encoded by one of the exons of the mirna gene recently however intron containing mirna_genes have been identified for which the stemloop structure cannot be predicted based on the unspliced primary transcript hereafter referred to as pri u mirna several of these spliced mirnas belong to the mir family which has only been identified in
