genetics_and rvfam an r package for rare_variant analysis with family data family based designs offer unique advantage for identifying rare risk_variants in genetic_association there are existing_tools for analyzing rare_variants in families but lacking components to handle binary_traits properly and survival traits in this report we introduce an r software_package rvfam rare_variant analysis with family data designed to analyze continuous binary and survival traits against rare and common sequencing variants in genome_wide gwas involving family data single and multiple variant association tests were implemented while accounting for arbitrary family structures extensive_simulation were performed to evaluate all the approaches implemented in rvfam availability_and http cran r project org_web rvfam it was hypothesized that rare_variants poorly represented in existing gwas may underlie the unexplained heritability by common_variants identified to date emerging exome_sequencing and whole_genome studies are designed to capture rare_variants in human_genomes the regularity condition assumed in many existing gwas tools for common_variants may become invalid when applied to rare_variants family based designs are advantageous for identifying rare risk_variants such as private or pedigree specific mutations that may only be enriched with family samples ignoring family_structure could introduce bias in the results and selecting unrelated sample from family data reduces power there are existing_tools that can handle rare_variant with family samples such as raremetalworker http genome sph umich edu wiki raremetalworker seqmeta https cran r project org_web seqmeta and epacts http genome sph umich edu wiki epacts the three packages report test based on score statistic from linear mixed_effects lme for continuous traits measured on family samples for binary_traits seqmeta can only analyze unrelated sample and raremetalworker and epacts use lme and treat binary_traits as continuous so the effect estimate is not interpretable none of the package can handle survival traits in this report we introduce rvfam that is designed to provide tools for family samples for all three types of traits continuous binary and survival rvfam can perform single_variant and multiple variant pooled_analysis for a single cohort as well as producing score statistics formatted for metaanalysis in seqmeta we performed extensive_simulation to assess the approaches implemented in rvfam
