systems_biology cellanimation an open_source matlab framework for microscopy assays motivation advances in microscopy technology have led to the creation of high_throughput microscopes that are capable of generating several hundred gigabytes of images in a few days analyzing such wealth of data manually is nearly impossible and requires an automated approach there are at present a number of open_source and commercial software_packages that allow the user to apply algorithms of different degrees of sophistication to the images and extract desired metrics however the types of metrics that can be extracted are severely limited by the specific image_processing that the application implements and by the expertise of the user in most commercial software code unavailability prevents implementation by the end_user of newly_developed algorithms better suited for a particular type of imaging assay while it is possible to implement new algorithms in open_source rewiring an image_processing application requires a high degree of expertise to obviate these limitations we have developed an open_source high_throughput application that allows implementation of different biological_assays such as cell_tracking or ancestry recording through the use of small relatively simple image_processing modules connected into sophisticated imaging pipelines by connecting modules non expert users can apply the particular combination of well established and novel algorithms developed by us and others that are best suited for each individual assay type in addition our data exploration and visualization modules make it easy to discover or select specific cell_phenotypes from a heterogeneous_population page
