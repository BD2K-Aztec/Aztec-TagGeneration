busco assessing genome_assembly and annotation completeness with single_copy orthologs motivation genomics has revolutionized biological_research but quality_assessment of the resulting assembled sequences is complicated and remains mostly limited to technical measures like n results we propose a measure for quantitative assessment of genome_assembly and annotation completeness based on evolutionarily informed expectations of gene content we implemented the assessment procedure in open_source with sets of benchmarking universal single_copy orthologs named busco availability_and software implemented in python and datasets available for download from http busco genomics data_acquisition continues to accelerate however the short lengths of sequencing_reads make their assembly into fulllength chromosomes extremely_challenging to gauge potential_limitations and implement improvements it is thus important to assess the quality of the resulting data proposed measures reflect methodologies e g per base error_rates insert_size distributions or genome biases e g k_mer distributions or fragment contig length distributions e g n which summarizes assembly contiguity in a single number half the genome is assembled on contigs of length n or longer however such measures do not assess assembly completeness in terms of gene content an important consideration that also affects data interpretation and helps to guide improved assembly and annotation strategies with the growing number of available sequenced_genomes knowledge of their gene content is consolidating and can be used to develop an evolutionary measure of genome completeness here we revisit the idea of using known genes to measure genome_assembly and annotation completeness by introducing a citable notation for well defined measures compiling the comprehensive datasets to support such assessments and offering these as an off_the software as proposed previously benchmarking universal single_copy orthologs busco are ideal for such quantifications of completeness as the expectations for these genes to be found in a genome and to be found only in singlecopy are evolutionarily sound we used our orthodb database of orthologs www orthodb org to define busco sets for six major phylogenetic clades sampling hundreds of genomes orthologous_groups with single_copy orthologs in of species were selected importantly this threshold accommodates the fact that even wellconserved genes can be lost in some lineages as well as allowing for incomplete gene_annotations and rare gene_duplications subsequent the clades spanning many phyla offer comprehensive coverage of the tree of life while the more narrowly defined clades provide a much greater resolution with much larger busco sets these are applicable not only to the assessment of genome_assemblies but also to annotated gene_sets as well as assembled transcriptomes additionally as near universal single_copy markers the recovered genes are ideal for species phylogeny reconstructions we propose intuitive metrics to describe genome gene_set or transcriptome completeness in busco notation c complete f fragmented m missing n number of genes used the recovered genes are classified as complete when their lengths are within two standard_deviations of the busco group mean length i e within expectation supplementary complete genes found with more than one copy are classified as duplicated these should be rare as buscos are evolving under single_copy control and the recovery of many duplicates may therefore indicate erroneous assembly of haplotypes genes only partially recovered are classified as fragmented and genes not recovered are classified as missing finally the number of genes used indicates the resolution and hence is informative of the confidence of these assessments using hmmer hidden_markov hmm profiles from amino_acid alignments the core of the analysis workflow assesses whether busco gene matches are orthologous or not i e satisfy busco group specific bitscore cut_offs detailed in som and classifies positive matches as complete or fragmented this core analysis is the same for assessing genomes transcriptomes or gene_sets however additional_analyses are required to first annotate genes from transcriptomes and genomes the simple longest open_reading approach performs well for transcriptomes for genomes gene_annotation is performed with augustus guided by amino_acid busco group block profiles on genomic_loci detected with tblastn searches using busco group consensus_sequences detailed in som although this gene prediction approach may have its limitations and biases they are consistent across different species making for fair comparisons conveniently the thousands of confident busco gene models provide an excellent gene predictor training_set for use as part of genome annotation_pipelines reports busco notation assessments of five diverse_species for both their genome_assemblies and their annotated gene_sets assessing genomes gene_sets and transcriptomes revealed substantial variability of completeness supplementary poor correlation with scaffold n supplementary highlights how completeness provides important complementary information for quality_assessment nevertheless the fact that some genome_assemblies appear less complete than their corresponding gene_sets e g h sapiens reveals limitations of the busco gene prediction step on the other hand a reversal of this trend e g a nidulans suggests that the annotated gene_set may be missing some busco gene matches that are in fact present in the genome thus it should be noted that while busco assessments aim to robustly estimate completeness of the datasets technical_limitations particularly gene prediction may inflate proportions of fragmented and missing buscos especially for large_genomes more missing buscos may also be reported for species that are highly derived with respect to the assessment cladeeven

with the thousands of vertebrate arthropod and fungal busco sets do require longer run times supplementary run times are generally proportional to the size of the busco set used and the sizes of the
