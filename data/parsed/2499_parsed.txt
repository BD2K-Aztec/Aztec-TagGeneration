integrated pathway level analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics_data with impala pathway level analysis is a powerful approach enabling interpretation of post genomic_data at a higher_level than that of individual biomolecules yet it is currently hard to integrate more than one type of omics_data in such an approach here we present a web_tool impala for the joint pathway analysis of transcriptomics or proteomics and metabolomics_data it performs over representation or enrichment_analysis with user specified lists of metabolites and genes using over pre annotated pathways from databases as a result pathways can be identified that may be disregulated on the transcriptional level the metabolic level or both evidence of pathway disregulation is combined allowing for the identification of additional pathways with changed activity that would not be highlighted when analysis is applied to any of the functional levels alone the tool has been implemented both as an interactive website and as a web_service to allow a programming interface availability the web_interface of impala is available atsystems biology aims at the concerted analysis of biological_systems at different levels for example the combination of transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics biochemical_pathways are the primary_focus of systems_biology pathways are extensively used to interpret omics_data for example to gain mechanistic insight into gene disregulation which is causative or indicative of complex_diseases in particular pathway over representation ora and enrichment_analyses have become important tools for the interpretation of data from transcriptomics and metabolomics experiments
