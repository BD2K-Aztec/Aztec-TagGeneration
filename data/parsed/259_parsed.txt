a multi_objective approach accurately resolves protein domain_architectures motivation given a protein_sequence and a number of potential domains matching it what are the domain content and the most likely domain_architecture for the sequence this problem is of fundamental_importance in protein annotation constituting one of the main steps of all predictive annotation strategies on the other hand when potential domains are several and in conflict because of overlapping domain boundaries finding a solution for the problem might become difficult an accurate prediction of the domain_architecture of a multi domain protein provides important information for function prediction comparative_genomics and molecular_evolution results we developed dama domain annotation by a multi objective approach a novel approach that identifies architectures through a multi_objective algorithm combining scores of domain matches previously observed multi domain co occurrence and domain overlapping dama has been validated on a known benchmark_dataset based on cath structural_domain assignments and on the set of plasmodium_falciparum proteins when compared with existing_tools on both datasets it outperforms all of them availability_and dama software is implemented in c and the source_code can be found atsequence based domain recognition represents one of the most convenient and practical approaches to understand evolution and function of proteins domains are sequence_fragments that can be independently stable and folded they have a shape and a function they occur alone or in groups and are the building_blocks of all proteins to account for the great diversity of domain contexts several efforts were made in categorizing coding_regions into protein_domains and domain families some resources like scop and cath organize domains according to their structural_classes while others such as pfam and prosite are purely sequence_based these databases are the starting_point of annotation_pipelines that are commonly organized into three steps i a probabilistic_model or a set of models is built to represent each functional_domain ii the model library representing all domains in the database is used to scan query_sequences identifying potential domains and iii conflicting predictions are resolved to propose a domain_architecture domain arrangement for each protein to be annotated domain_architecture prediction step iii can be used to improve the v c the author published_by we evaluated the performance of dama on two datasets a benchmark containing multi_domain and the genome of the malaria_parasite p falciparum the pdb benchmark was proposed into measure the performance of the mda approach and we used it to compare dama and mda section this benchmark is useful for optimizing parameters and evaluate the robustness of the algorithm but it does not constitute a realistic case study made of a large set of highly_divergent sequences as often encountered in the annotation of new genomes to address these difficulties we considered the set of p falciparum proteins known to be hard to annotate and we compared the performance of dama mda dpuc and codd on its domain annotation section accurate prediction of mdas is extremely useful for function and network prediction including phylogenetic profiling gene fusion_detection proteinprotein_interaction inheritance and annotation by homology transfert moreover the amount of accurate information that can be generated by tools like dama on new genomes and metagenomes will be useful to answer evolutionary questions on the dynamics of architecture formation across species the way protein architectures form is an important factor to understand protein evolution a quantification of the elementary events affecting protein architectures such as domain s insertion_deletion duplication and exchange was done but yet little is known about the relationships between these elementary events and the molecular_mechanisms they originate from finer domain mapping on entire sets of proteins for completely_sequenced will contribute precise information on the evolution of these architectures this means for instance a more precise estimation of the rate of insertion deletion duplication and exchange of domains within proteins in a given species in general it would be interesting i to establish whether the process of generation of an architecture follows constraints or not ii to pinpoint such constraints if they exist and iii to verify whether they are species specific or not along a phylogenetic_tree domains might have been lost permuted combined with other domains they might be integrated within an architecture and lost again on the other hand architectures might have been duplicated recombined broke up again in summary the process of architectures formation appears to follow evolutionary rules that need yet to be unraveled to test the performance of dama and other tools in architecture reconstruction we looked for a realistic dataset of sequences that could represent well the difficulties_encountered in genome and metagenome annotation we decided to consider the set of p falciparum protein_sequences knowing that these sequences diverged sufficiently from those that were used to construct probabilistic_models employed for domain identification this set of sequences represent in a fine way the protein world compared with the benchmark based on cath domains used in the first evaluation other genomes could be used instead on comparable fdrs computed from the two artificial datasets mer and mer constructed by reshuffling sequences of the p falciparum genome mda showed to behave very well despite the fact that it was not explicitly tested over the p falciparum genome before while codd and dpuc were dama overperforms all tools and its excellent_performance is due to several reasons first in dama domain overlapping is considered by combining the strategies introduced in mda and in dpuc second dama exploits knowledge on multi domain co occurrence by combining individual domain_scores with cooccurrence information in five different optimization functions this multi_objective strategy is a refinement of the simplified function proposed in dpuc while domain co occurrence was not considered at all in mda we also considered the likeliness to find co occurring domains by chance on randomly shuffled domain_architectures the artificialdataset that we constructed from p falciparum sequences allowed to verify again that dama performs the best followed by mda the difference between mda and dama with codd and dpuc is striking especially when considering the high number of domains certified by the tools new improvements leading to a higher accuracy might be envisageable by looking at specific failures of dama by replacing some of the optimization functions f i with some alternative definition by redefining tolerance parameters d i as functions of specific architecture characteristics as the number of domains or by integrating other architecture characteristics like the high_frequency of certain pairs of domains that was ignored in this version of the tool
