systems_biology an effective framework for reconstructing gene_regulatory from genetical_genomics motivation systems_genetics approaches in particular those relying on genetical_genomics put forward a new paradigm of large_scale genome and network_analysis these methods use naturally_occurring multi_factorial perturbations e g polymorphisms in properly controlled and screened genetic crosses to elucidate causal_relationships in biological_networks however although genet ical genomics data contain rich_information a clear dissection of causes and effects as required for reconstructing gene_regulatory is not easily possible results we present a framework for reconstructing gene_regulatory from genetical_genomics where genotype and phenotype correlation measures are used to derive an initial graph which is subsequently reduced by pruning strategies to minimize false_positive applied to realistic simulated genetic data from a recent dream_challenge we demonstrate that our approach is simple yet effective and outperforms more complex methods including the best performer with respect to i reconstruction_quality especially for small_sample and ii applicability to large_data due to relatively low computational costs we also present reconstruction results from real genetical_genomics of yeast availability a matlab_implementation script of the reconstruction framework is available atsystems genetics seeks to reveal complex genetic_interactions in biological_systems by relating genetic_variations to various phenotypic_data from high_throughput measurements in contrast to the classical one gene perturbation at a time approach systems_genetics interprets naturally_occurring multiple genetic_variations e g single_nucleotide snp as multi_factorial perturbations from which causalities can be unraveled more efficiently systems_genetics methods use properly controlled genetic crosses segregating populations such as recombinant congenic_strains rcs recombinant_inbred ril advanced intercross lines ail or chromosome substitution strains css to causally link genetic or chromosomal_regions to observed phenotypic trait data identifying a chromosomal_region the quantitative_trait qtl that influences a certain phenotypic trait is known as qtl_mapping in genetical genomics a particular subclass of systems_genetics gene_expression levels are considered as phenotypic_traits called etraits and identified qtls comprising single genes or gene regions are referred to as expression qtls eqtls one application of eqtl maps_obtained from genetical genomics approaches is the reconstruction of gene_regulatory grn in the latter nodes represent genes and edges represent interactions or dependencies between genes grn provide the basis for systems level understanding of interacting genes and phenotype formation in living_systems they condense different types of molecular_interactions on the signaling metabolic and genetic level to a network representation of causalities therefore grn represent a causal projection of gene activities neglecting detailed molecular_mechanisms reconstructed gene_regulatory can be used to narrow down genetic_analysis by massively reducing the number of potential molecular_interactions or locations of interaction sites in the same way grn can be used to identify putative intervention points by relating genetic spots to pathologic phenotypes according to the general grn reconstruction pipeline for genetical_genomics consists of three major_steps i eqtl_mapping ii candidate regulator selection and iii network refinement for step i there exist several eqtl_mapping strategies single etrait single eqtl multiple etraitsingle eqtl multiple etrait multiple eqtl a detailed_review on the pipeline of eqtl_mapping is for instance given by in step ii the eqtl map in combination with a genetic_map is used to select single candidate regulator genes from the eqtls as the latter often represent chromosomal_regions due to genetic_linkage methods used include conditional correlation local regression or analysis of between strains snps in the third step iii network refinement methods are used to the topology obtained in step ii e g with the goal to identify and eliminate false_positive edges arising from indirect_effects here bayesian_network approaches and structural_equation sem have been used one disadvantage of the former is that bayesian_networks cannot handle cycles if no time dimension is included to whom correspondence should be addressed further inferred dependencies in bayesian_networks do not necessarily represent causalities as there may exist several alternative dependencies having the same joint probability as one approach for structural_equation construct first an encompassing directed network from the eqtl_analysis which is afterwards further refined by sem similar as baysian network_inference sem is computationally_expensive which restricts the applicability to medium_sized networks in this work we propose a novel strategy for reconstructing grn from genetical_genomics the workflow explained in detail in section encompasses implicitly the three major_steps mentioned above but uses different techniques than used so_far the chosen methods were intentionally kept simple realistic datasets show that they are nevertheless effective section the initial grn is constructed based on genotypephenotype and phenotypephenotype correlation_analysis owing to genetic_linkage there are often groups of genetically adjacent regulator candidates that target the same gene resulting into eqtls to avoid a lot of false_positive interactions single candidate regulators are therefore identified from the eqtls finally as a method for network refinement indirect path effects are removed by transwesd a recently_introduced transitive_reduction approach originally transwesd has been developed to prune perturbation graphs derived from single knock_out data here we show that transwesd can also be used to prune perturbation graphs obtained from genetical_genomics thus complementing bayesian_networks and sem overall our framework constitutes simple modules with a total number of just two threshold parameters we tested it on in silico recombinant_inbred data that have been provided by the dream initiative dream systems_genetics challenge a http wiki c b columbia edu dream index php d c we find that the proposed modular reconstruction approach outperforms the best performer we also present and discuss reconstruction results from real genetical_genomics of yeast shows the general workflow of our reconstruction framework together with a simple illustrative example starting from a typical set of genetical_genomics that include genotyped markers phenotyped genes and gene to marker association marker linkage_analysis and genotype assignment for each gene is performed in a preprocessing_step from these data an unweighted and unsigned perturbation graph g is derived using genotypephenotype correlation in combination with an appropriated thresholding strategy the nodes in the graph directly correspond to genes while linkage information is kept to allow later eqtl assignment for each gene the perturbation graph g is refined to g by quantifying each identified edge with respect to edge sign and weight which indicate activation repression and interaction_strength respectively owing to genetic_linkage true regulators may be masked by other genes e g on adjacent positions on the genetic_map resulting into eqtls the eqtls of a given target_gene t can be identified on the basis of all potential_regulator genes of t and the marker linkage_map these relationships are captured in graph g graph g is subsequently obtained by selecting one candidate regulator per eqtl based on the maximum of the edge_weights we call g the final perturbation graph whose edges reflect direct and indirect_effects between genes induced by genetic_variations to remove indirect edges that can be explained by the operation of sequences of edges paths we apply the transitive_reduction method transwesd resulting in the final graph g optionally if one is left to verify the interactions experimentally it is desirable to have a list of edges sorted with respect to edge confidences such a list is also used by the dream evaluation procedures to assess the quality of a reconstructed network section we generate such a sorted list based on the edge_weights we applied the proposed method to i synthetic genetical_genomics that were provided for a recent systems_genetics challenge of the dream initiative dream challenge a http wiki c b columbia edu dream index php d c and ii real genetical_genomics from yeast which were originally published in brem and kruglyak
