systems_biology mgv a generic graph viewer for comparative omics_data motivation high_throughput transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics methods have revolutionized our knowledge of biological_systems to gain knowledge from comparative omics studies strong data_integration and visualization features are required knowledge gained from these studies is often available in the form of graphs and their visualization is especially useful in a wide_range of systems_biology topics including pathway analysis interaction networks or gene models especially it is necessary to compare biological_models with measured data this allows the identification of new models and new insights into existing ones results we present mgv a versatile generic graph viewer for multiomics data mgv is integrated into mayday battke et_al it extends maydays visual_analytics capabilities by integrating a wide_range of biological_models high_throughput data and meta_information to display enriched graphs that combine data and models a wide_range of tools is available for visualization of nodes data aware graph layout as well as automatic and manual aggregation and refinement of the data we show the usefulness of mgv applied to several problems including differential_expression of alternative transcripts transcription_factor interaction cross study clustering comparison and integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics_data for pathway analysis availability mgv is a open_source implemented_in and freely_available as a part of mayday at http www microarray_analysis org mayday contact the current focus of life_science research is to achieve a systemsbased view of processes organisms and ecosystems to this end biological_activity is studied using a variety of tools gene_expression on transcription_level is measured using microarrays and nextgeneration_sequencing furthermore gas_chromatography and mass_spectrometry methods are applied to measure protein and metabolite_concentrations this leads to large and complex datasets containing potentially tens_of of measured species from hundreds of experiments these data are then used to build a comprehensive view of biological_processes with exhaustive formal models of the systems as one of the ultimate aims analysis and interpretation to whom correspondence should be addressed of such data call for visualization at every step to be successful visualization_tools like box plots and heat maps support the choice of methods for quality_control and normalization as well as during statistical_analysis the identification of relationships in the data and hypothesis_generation often require graph_based visualizations this includes biological_pathways regulatory and interaction networks as well as gene models the full extent of systems_biology data is only utilizable if analysis tools can keep up with the data current datasets require classical visualization_tools a genome based view as well as strong network_visualization features especially for the latter smart layout and data analysis tools as well as interactivity is necessary and extensibility is important to cope with new data_formats and analysis methods network_visualization is most useful if it is combined with measured data as this allows to compare predictions with actual results therefore extensible tools for visualizing and analyzing enriched networks are desirable additionally the integrative bioinformatics paradigm calls for seamless_integration and processing of data from a multitude of sources here we introduce a generic integrative graph viewer called mgv short for mayday graph viewer mgv is based on the versatile mayday platform and offers a comprehensive set of tools for analysis and visualization of graphs as an extensible feature rich tool for multiple omics_data analysis mayday is flexible about the data analyzed a recently_published major extension to mayday called mayday seasight allows working with high_throughput sequencing_data mgv is designed to work on any kind of measured data and it can import different graph and pathway data_formats a large variety of different configurable tools are available for displaying measured data at nodes along with layout methods that use data properties of the nodes several biological and all purpose graph file_formats can be imported mgv also allows to visually organize and analyze biological data to this end we investigated new ways of exploring organizing and summarizing systems_biology data in graphs while the extent of systems_biology data expands so does our knowledge of the organisms processes and molecules under investigation much of that knowledge is condensed in databases of biological_pathways as a conceptual representation they are essential for understanding data and putting it into context pathways are the building_blocks of our understanding of life at its basis several common sources of biological_pathways are available for example kegg metacyc pathway_commons wikipathways or reactome one of the most useful concepts for working with pathways is a graph_representation it allows to view the components page we illustrate some of the most important features of mgv using typical questions in systems_biology research since there are different data requirements for each question we use a variety of datasets for illustration in all examples we use measured values from expression and or metabolomics_studies mapped to nodes to visualize the expression values we employ the inverse black body radiation gradient which works well in gray_scale and color since demonstrating every feature of mgv exceeds the scope of this paper the supplemental material contains several further examples in this article we have introduced mgv a new versatile and extensible graph viewer for systems_biology data we combined the successfully implemented concepts of graph_based visualization of biological_knowledge with the concept of using small multiples for visualization of quantitative data in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our implementation of this concept we used data from different sources and contexts and applied mgv to investigate common questions on it for regulatory_networks mgv provides an integrated view of the network and of the expression data in different levels of detail in general the levels of detail can easily be configured via the many rendering options for nodes possible details range from zero values showing only the shape of the node to several hundred values via heat maps and profile plots the latter case can suffer from overplotting when many probes are displayed in this case summaries of the probes e g box plots can be used this is an application of the visual_analytics concept data are summarized or omitted e g by filtering out nodes or edges in order to identify interesting regions in the graph then the level of details can be vastly increased by zooming in and adding meta_information to the nodes versatility is a design goal for mgv also in the context of data_integration mgv brings together quantitative data with annotation data and textbook knowledge the integration of expression data with gene models allows to simultaneously visualize two levels of differential activity splicing and transcription which is especially interesting in larger rnaseq studies where different classes of samples are compared the most useful rendering strategy for exon nodes are heat maps and profile plots circular plots are less useful here as it is necessary to keep the width of the node constant mgv can work on a wide_variety of data and is able to join data between different sources and studies this encompasses several studies at the same level e g two microarray_studies as well as the comparison of transcriptomics or proteomics with metabolomics_studies we have illustrated this with the p aeruginosa data in the context of a metabolic_pathway in the biopax format giving both an overview and details of the process a direct comparison of the metabolomics and transcriptomics_data though is not possible since the studies differ in several criteria still these studies are comparable enough to demonstrate the use of mgv for this application furthermore to our knowledge there is no comprehensive multiomics dataset publicly_available with whole_genome transcription data and a large number of measured and identified metabolites as technology advances such datasets will eventually be made available and mgv is well suited to work on them as demonstrated a further cross study visualization feature is the clustering comparison tool of mgv it allows to investigate overlaps of probe groupings between datasets in this way properties of the probes in each partition can be compared as in the chemostat and wine fermentation data this allowed us to identify overlaps between fermentation related genes and nutrient or oxygen_dependent genes without using external annotations further applications include comparing profiles of groups in closely_related studies and investigating the stability of clusterings among studies mgv not only assists in exploratory_analysis of pathways but can also help in formulating new and confirmed hypothesis for this purpose new graphs can be easily built in mgv the resulting graphs can be used to illustrate such a hypothesis which can be then combined with the underlying data in an interactive environment based on mayday mgv is integrated into a well established framework connected with many analysis and visualization_tools we consider this to be beneficial because the workflow of data analysis requires several data_integration and analysis steps before the high_level analyses and visualizations that mgv is designed for new methods emerge continuously therefore we consider it to be important that all key features of mgv node rendering graph layout data import graph manipulation and filtering are extensible we are continuously extending mgv to provide new methods for all these purposes while extensibility and breadth of functionality were in the focus of development mgv is able to process large sparse graphs with thousands of genes further research is necessary on the questions of graph drawing and visualization of dense datasets especially in the context of how to use the data properties of a node for the latter topic a thorough user study should evaluate assets and liabilities of the current and future approaches enhancements of the rendering options and speed are also planned cross study comparison methods are also of increasing interest a large variety of methods for data_integration has been proposed some of which require careful_review and integration into mgv the development of mgv will continue in these directions for graph drawing methods as suggested byfor large graphs orfor handling unconnected graphs can greatly enhance mgv further extensions in usability e g a scripting feature for automation and performance enhancements are planned
