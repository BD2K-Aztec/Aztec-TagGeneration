structural_bioinformatics e d database and visualization of a to i rna_editing mapped to d protein_structures e d a database of a to i rna_editing from human mouse and fly mapped to evolutionary related protein d structures is presented genomic_coordinates of a to i rna_editing are converted to protein coordinates and mapped onto d structures from pdb or theoretical_models from modbase e d allows visualization of the protein_structure modeling of recoding events and orientation of the editing with respect to nearby genomic functional sites from databases of disease_causing and genomic polymorphism a to i rna_editing the deamination of adenosine to inosine by adar family of enzymes is the most widespread modification in the human_transcriptome most of the rna_editing are located in non coding_regions such as introns and utrs still several rna_editing are found in coding_regions and likely change amino_acid as inosine is identified as guanosine by the translation_machinery these recoding sites were proved to be important for normal development adar knock_out mice suffered from epileptic_seizures and died at a very early age as a result of lack in editing specifically at the q to r site in gria changes in editing level at recoding sites in the serotonin_receptor c htr c were found to be related to depression schizophrenia and suicide recoding event from s to g at azin was found to result in hepatocellular_carcinoma recently it was found that most of the non synonymous editing sites in human seem to have a deleterious_effect most edited sites tend to have strong destabilization effect on the protein_structure still some coding rna_editing have a functional rule are edited in a significant level and located at critical sites of the protein_structure several comprehensive databases which gather genomic_data evolutionary context expression data and editing level for editing sites were recently_developed these include darned radar and inosinome atlas still there is a need for computational_tools for convenient intersection of rna_editing information with protein structural and functional information the current gap impedes most biologists working in rna_editing field from inferring the functional significance of editing event in the context of protein d structural data here we present e d a tool which is intended to bridge this gap and provide the community with user_friendly database and web_interface to spot and visualize protein_modifications resulted from a to i rna_editing events regarding editing sites in human mouse and fly human sites mouse sites and fly sites human rna_editing were also downloaded from the inosinome atlas human sites the entire information is stored as a rational database on mysql server for each organism human mouse and fly a table with all editing sites their read_coverage editing level and additional information is maintained this data architecture allows relatively quick searches and is used for initial query of editing site information in the e d front page as shown in ucsc gene_annotations are used to connect the stored genomic_coordinates with transcripts and protein coordinates protein_sequences are aligned to pdb sequences using blast s c http dunbrack fccc edu guoli s c is used to convert seqres with atom coordinates in the pdb files e d will be updated routinely following updates of the source editing sites databases
