data_and cdrug a web_server for predicting anticancer_activity of chemical_compounds cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide screening anticancer candidates from tens of millions of chemical_compounds is expensive_and a rapid and user_friendly web_server known as cdrug is described here to predict the anticancer_activity of chemical_compounds in cdrug a hybrid score was developed to measure the similarity of different compounds the performance analysis shows that cdrug has the area_under of indicating that cdrug is effective to distinguish active and inactive compounds availability the cdrug web_server and the standard alone version are freely_available bsb kiz ac cn cdrug cancer causes millions of deaths per year screening candidates from natural or synthetic compounds is an efficient way for cancer drug_discovery in the past_decades tens of millions of chemical_compounds have been deposited in the public database discovering anticancer compounds from this huge database through experimental methods is expensive_and although the national_cancer nci has been screening the anticancer compounds for tens of years only compounds were tested for screening anticancer compounds therefore a rapid and effectively computational_method is required for prediction of anticancer_activity of chemical_compounds here we constructed a web_server termed cancer drug cdrug to predict the anticancer_activity of given compound s cdrug uses a novel molecular description method relative frequency weighted fingerprint to implement the compound fingerprints then a hybrid score was calculated to measure the similarity between the query and the active_compounds finally a confidence_level p value is calculated to predict whether the query compound s have or do not have the activity of anticancer cdrug web_server provides an effective rapid and user_friendly interface to predict anticancer_activity of chemical_compounds
