bioinformatics_discovery thymine distribution in genes provides novel insight into the functional significance of the proteome of the_malaria d plasmodium_falciparum pf mediated malaria is one of the most devastating_diseases in the world and the search for suitable antimalarial_drugs remains an extraordinary challenge for scientists working in this area novel unconventional approaches could reveal new potential targets that may be useful for the treatment of malaria we used a bioinformatics_approach to analyze the entire_genome of the pf d strain because the carbon c content is a pivotal parameter that determines the hydrophobicity of a protein which in turn controls protein_folding and function we analyzed the entire pf d proteome based on the genes thymine t controlled amino_acid expression our data disclose a total of proteins encoded by chromosome and chromosome that have an outstanding t encoded and c controlled hydrophobic_character the identification of these proteins could open new pivotal drug_targeting avenues the most prevalent and lethal malaria_parasite that infects humans plasmodium_falciparum pf may have recently undergone host switching to become a plasmodia adaptation that is specific for humans p falciparum is the most deadly of the five plasmodium_species that cause human_malaria which is the worlds second largest cause of death after tuberculosis thus we have chosen to analyze the completely_sequenced and annotated pf d strain the pf d nuclear_genome is composed of megabases which are distributed among chromosomes chrs despite the completion of the pf d genome and comparative proteomics_studies we are far from a strategy for curing this disease because there are still too many uncharacterized_proteins to obtain a reasonable understanding of the disease_causing activity of p falciparum the base thymine t defines the stability of an organism at the nucleotide level and in turn also controls the proteins carbon c content and thus hydrophobicity for stability and activity hydrophobic_residues are important for dictating topological_features of proteins because hydrophobic_interactions are the dominant force in proper protein_folding and in organizing the self assembly of water_soluble globular_proteins in the current study we analyzed the entire pf d genome with regard to the t content to identify potential novel proteins that could have pivotal significance in pf d mediated malaria
