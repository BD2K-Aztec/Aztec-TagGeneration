missmethyl an r package for analyzing data from illumina's humanmethylation platform dna_methylation is one of the most commonly_studied epigenetic_modifications due to its role in both disease and development the illumina humanmethylation beadchip is a cost_effective way to profile cpgs across the human_genome making it a popular platform for profiling dna_methylation here we introduce missmethyl an r package with a suite of tools for performing normalization removal of unwanted variation in differential_methylation analysis differential variability testing and gene_set for the k array availability_and missmethyl is an r package available from the bioconductor_project at www bioconductor org dna_methylation one of the most widely_studied epigenetic_modifications is crucial for normal_embryonic and is often disrupted in disease epigenetic_marks can be modified by environmental_exposures and are dramatically altered in cancer since epigenetic changes are potentially reversible dna_methylation is an attractive therapeutic_target and remains an important area of research there are several array and sequencing based_technologies available for profiling dna_methylation while sequencing_costs have declined it remains expensive for large dna_methylation studies making arrays a cost_effective alternative illuminas humanmethylation k beadchip is currently the most popular platform having been used in many large studies such as the cancer_genome as well as in many epigenome_wide here we present the missmethyl r package which contains dedicated tools for performing a range of analyses primarily targeted at k arrays these methods include normalization removal of unwanted variation ruv such as batch_effects in a differential_methylation analysis differential variability testing and gene_set software_packages for reading in raw_data pre_processing and differential_methylation analysis include minfi methylkit and methylumi however missmethyl provides more specialized analysis methods not available elsewhere the missmethyl r package contains a suite of functions to perform novel analyses for k array data with new functions likely to be added as they are developed the functions have been written to complement the limma package and are compatible with data_objects from minfi methylumi and edger in addition missmethyl is well documented and freely_available from bioconductor
