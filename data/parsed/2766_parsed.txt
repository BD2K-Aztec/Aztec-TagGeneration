genetics_and m an improved snp_calling algorithm for illumina beadarray data genotype_calling from high_throughput platforms such as illumina and affymetrix is a critical step in data_processing so that accurate information on genetic_variants can be obtained for phenotypegenotype association studies a number of algorithms have been developed to infer genotypes from data generated through the illumina beadstation platform including gencall genosnp illuminus and crlmm most of these algorithms are built on population_based statistical_models to genotype every snp in turn such as gencall with the gentrain clustering_algorithm and require a large reference_population to perform well these approaches may not work well for rare_variants where only a small proportion of the individuals carry the variant a fundamentally different approach implemented in genosnp adopts a single_nucleotide snp based model to infer genotypes of all the snps in one individual making it an appealing alternative to call rare_variants however compared to the population_based strategies more snps in genosnp may fail the hardyweinberg equilibrium test to take advantage of both strategies we propose a two stage snp_calling procedure named the modified mixture_model m to improve call accuracy for both common and rare_variants the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through applications to genotype_calling on a set of hapmap samples used for quality_control purpose in a large casecontrol study of cocaine_dependence the increase in power with m is greater for rare_variants than for common_variants depending on the model genome_wide gwas have resulted in the discovery of numerous genetic_variants contributing to major human_diseases these studies benefit from the success of the international_hapmap in cataloging and characterizing millions of single_nucleotide snps for the purpose of gwas the international to whom correspondence should be addressed another major_contributing is the availability of high_density and low_cost snp_arrays such as those from affymetrix and illumina which allow researchers to genotype millions of snps for any microarray genotyping platform an accurate genotyping algorithm is needed to convert the observed probe intensities into genotypes and many methods have been proposed for snp_calling for example rlmm brlmm affymetrix and chiamo have been developed for the affymetrix_genechip and iluminus genosnp and gencall for the illumina beadarray in addition some algorithms are applicable to both platforms such as crlmm and beagle with beaglecall in this article we focus on the illumina_platform with greenred color single base extension biochemistry illumina microarrays use allele signal_intensity to measure two alleles a and a at each snp for every individual one class of calling algorithms considers data from all study subjects for one snp at a time we call these algorithms the population_based ones their basic premise is that the three possible genotypes from an snp with alleles a and a namely aa aa and aa will form three distinct clusters and each individuals genotype can be inferred from its cluster membership however this approach_requires every cluster to contain a sufficient number of individuals to be correctly inferred so that a large number of samples are needed if the minor_allele maf of an snp is low in practice three genotype clusters of a fraction of snps may be shifted away from their expected positions which will lead to a genotyping error_rate of from missing genotypes or miscalled genotypes another algorithm genosnp is distinguished from the population based_algorithms in that it genotypes all snps within one individual at a time under the assumption that probes for different snps have similar response features across the genome that is instead of genotyping snp by snp this algorithm infers genotypes of all the snps for every individual in turn we refer to this algorithm as the snp based strategy since genotypes are called at the individual_level and the variation within a cluster may be smaller than that between clusters there is no need to collect a large number of samples to achieve high_accuracy of genotype_calls for low maf snps however compared with the population_based strategy many more snps fail
