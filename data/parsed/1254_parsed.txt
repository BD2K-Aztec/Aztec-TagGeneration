structural_bioinformatics dara a web_server for rapid search of structural neighbours using solution small_angle data motivation small_angle saxs is an established method for studying biological_macromolecules in solution whereby the experimental scattering patterns relate to the quaternary and tertiary_structure of the macromolecule here we present dara a web_server that queries over scattering profiles pre_computed from the high_resolution models of macromolecules and biological assemblies in the protein_data to rapidly find nearest neighbours of a given experimental or theoretical saxs pattern identification of the best scattering equivalents provides a straightforward and automated way of structural assessment of macromolecules based on a saxs profile dara results are useful e g for fold_recognition and finding of biologically_active oligomers availability_and http dara embl hamburg de in a small_angle saxs experiment a homogeneous solution of proteins nucleic_acids or their complexes is illuminated by a monochromatic x_ray beam the isotropic scattering intensity i s is measured as a function of momentum transfer s psin h k h being the scattering angle and k the x_ray wavelength for monodisperse solutions the signal after background_subtraction is proportional to the scattering of a single_particle averaged over all orientations the scattering pattern contains information about the macromolecular structure at a low_resolution nm without a priori information ab_initio particle shape can be reconstructed if an atomic model is available its theoretical scattering can be computed and compared to the experimental_data comparison of the experimental scattering to a manifold of known scattering patterns is a useful alternative to shape determination if one or several patterns agree with the experimental_data the corresponding models may provide insights about the quaternary and sometimes also tertiary_structure here we present dara a web_server that rapidly compares over scattering profiles pre_computed from models in the protein_data pdb with a given saxs pattern the current_implementation of dara represents an overhaul of the database designed for proteins over twelve years_ago the implementation features a new search algorithm combining principal_component and k d trees for almost instantaneous within a few seconds identification of the scattering neighbours includes nucleic_acids and complexes in the search_space and provides an enhanced presentation of the results
