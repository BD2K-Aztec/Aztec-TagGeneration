genome_analysis treat a bioinformatics tool for variant annotations and visualizations in targeted and exome_sequencing treat targeted re sequencing annotation tool is a tool for facile navigation and mining of the variants from both targeted_resequencing and whole_exome it provides a rich integration of publicly_available as well as in house developed annotations and visualizations for variants variant hosting genes and host gene pathways next_generation offers the promise of scientific discovery with the challenge of results interpretation one experiment such as exome_sequencing can generate tens_of of single_nucleotide snvs and small_insertions indels which must be elucidated in the search for disease associated mutations whole_exome is an application of ngs that has been successfully used to identify disease associated variants in several monogenic_disorders and complex_diseases while these studies demonstrated the power of ngs they also highlighted the challenge of efficiently sifting through thousands of variants to identify a subset that is potentially clinically_relevant bioinformatics solutions are beginning to be released that address this challenge and facilitate filtering and interpretation of human sequence_variation to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as data we developed treat to extend the functionality of these tools and directly integrated structured and sortable formats with embedded hyperlinks to sequence_alignment gene specificity and gene pathway visualizations in addition to enable broad accessibility we have fully deployed treat to the amazon cloud treat is optionally offered as part of a complete workflow for exome or targeted_sequencing providing users with a convenient method for integrated sequence_alignment mutation detection and results interpretation we believe this tool offers investigators with an accessible and convenient method for annotating and visualizing sequencing_data and a means of efficiently identifying variants of interest
