gene_expression snowball resampling combined with distance based regression to discover transcriptional consequences of a driver_mutation motivation large_scale cancer genomic studies such as the cancer_genome tcga have profiled multidimensional genomic_data including mutation and expression_profiles on a variety of cancer cell_types to uncover the molecular_mechanism of cancerogenesis more than a hundred driver_mutations have been characterized that confer the advantage of cell_growth however how driver_mutations regulate the transcriptome to affect cellular_functions remains largely unex plored differential analysis of gene_expression relative to a driver_mutation on patient samples could provide us with new insights in understanding driver_mutation dysregulation in tumor genome and developing personalized treatment_strategies results here we introduce the snowball approach as a highly_sensitive statistical_analysis method to identify transcriptional signatures that are affected by a recurrent driver_mutation snowball utilizes a resampling based_approach and combines a distance based regression_framework to assign a robust ranking index of genes based on their aggregated association with the presence of the mutation and further selects the top significant genes for downstream data analyses or experiments in our application of the snowball approach to both synthesized and tcga data we demonstrated that it outper forms the standard methods and provides more accurate inferences to the functional effects and transcriptional dysregulation of driver_mutations availability_and r package and source_code are available from cran at http cran r project org_web desrecent large_scale cancer genome studies such as those from the cancer_genome tcga and the international cancer genome consortium http www icgc org have led to the identification of a large number of somatic_mutations in cancer cell_types through high_throughput cancer_genome network a b among those somatic_mutations most are passenger_mutations which do not contribute much to carcinogenesis however a relatively small number of mutations have been documented as driver_mutations and they confer the advantage of cell_growth to date more than a hundred driver_mutations have been uncovered some well studied examples_include egfr braf nras pik_ca met cdkn a and tp understanding the functional consequences of those driver_genes and predicting how they affect protein and cellular_functions have become one of the major focuses in cancer genomic_research for example the recurrent oncogene braf_mutation at v has been well documented as an activator of the mitogene activated protein_kinase mapk_pathway that stimulates proliferation whereas mutation in tumor_suppressor tp can disrupt cell_cycle and apoptosis_pathway in human cancer even though much effort has been expended to explore specific pathways or biological_processes dysregulated by driver_mutations the systematic de_novo identification of potential targets on the transcriptome scale is still largely_unexplored considering that a driver_mutation may affect a few or even many key signaling_molecules in a cellular system and cause diseases a supervised analysis of whole transcriptome measurements with regard to the presence of a known somatic driver_mutation can amplify important biological_signals involving tumorigenesis the standard statistical_methods that can be used for this purpose include gene by gene differential_expression to rank genes based on a parametric model typically in a regression_framework and select the top list with statistical_significance however a driver_mutation is expected to alter the expression of its cognate genes its interacting genes and genes in the same downstream pathways geneby gene analyses assume independence among genes and may result in ineffective detection of important gene or pathway targets in addition the genetic_background of patients and their tumor_samples are highly_heterogeneous each sample may exhibit patient specific and sample specific variation this differing predisposition to the driver_mutation perturbation may lead to different target_gene expression_patterns from sample to sample and from patient to patient gene by gene analyses to whom correspondence should be addressed assume marginally uniform differential_expression for each gene and this may culminate in detection power_loss to key functional targets lastly the recurrent mutations are mostly rare_events in the patient population thus we typically have a limited sample_size per mutation even if the sample_size of the initial patient cohort is large this brings in another key challenge to the conventional methods for the differential analysis of gene_expression with mutation data several multivariate_statistical were applied to detect differential_gene however applications of well established multivariate_statistical in this case are not straightforward because of the unusual features in mutation profiling data such as high_heterogeneity and limited sample_size per mutation status a different approach used for gene_selection that may serve for the same purpose is to utilize a non parametric ensemble_method to rank genes based on their classification_performance on the mutation status and select the most relevant_genes for example random_forests based gene ranking and selection approach uses the classification_and model cart and ranks the genes based on their variable_importance diaz uriarte and alvarez however ranking and selecting genes based on the prediction of the gene_expression to the presence of a mutation might lead to a gene_list biased toward the classification of mutation groups instead of the correlation with the functional consequences of the mutation to meet the challenges of accurate inference on the functional consequences of driver_mutations we propose the snowball approach as a highly_sensitive statistical_analysis method based on the differential analyses of co expression_profiles relative to the presence of a driver_mutation gene transcriptions and their interactions usually present in regulatory_networks and or biological_pathways therefore a driver gene_mutation will naturally trigger a differentially co expressed gene_expression pattern of a series of genes between the patients with and without a driver_mutation the snowball approach takes_advantage of networked genegene_interactions and assigns a robust ranking to the gene_list based on their aggregated association of co expression_patterns with the presence of a mutation in a resampling and distance based regression_framework it then selects the top significant list as target_genes for downstream functional and pathway analyses to evaluate the performance of the snowball method we applied it to both synthesized and tcga data and demonstrated the superior_performance when compared with the gene by gene as well as random forestsbased variable ranking and selection approaches we also demonstrated via functional_analyses of the top gene_lists that the snowball approach gives much more informative inference to the functional effects and transcriptional dysregulation of driver_mutations in cancer_genomics interpreting the consequences of genetic changes such as somatic_mutations provides unprecedented opportunity to understand the molecular_processes driving tumorigenesis several existing_approaches such as paradigm paradigm_shift and network based stratification nbs have been successfully developed to explore cancer related pathways in individual samples however those approaches are primarily based on overlaying multiple data types as evidence e g whole_genome mutations copy_number mrna changes on existing biological_networks such as proteinprotein_interaction therefore the identified cancer related pathways are based on the known knowledge about the networks in addition all these approaches are tied to the gene level resolution by augmenting the mutation_profile information onto the gene based networks however somatic_point occurred at different positions within a gene approaches limited to the gene level resolution will consider them the same event regardless of their position difference this may be reasonable to tumor_suppressors as nonsynonymous mutations in different locations may disrupt the gene function in a common manner however for those occurring in an oncogene such as braf they may differ with distinct_functional consequences this is indicated by high_frequency point_mutations in oncogenes that suggest a selective_advantage of the specific point_mutation to confer cancer cell_growth to our knowledge our approach is among the first attempts to overcome the challenge to identify the functional consequences of a single driver_mutation in addition to helping understand the tumorigenesis a specific investigation of the downstream_gene dysregulated by a driver_mutation could be very useful to the development of targeted_therapy strategies investigators are actively hunting for drugs especially kinase_inhibitors that can target specific driver_mutations for example fda_approved drug vemurafenib specifically targets braf driver_mutation at position v brafv which occurs in of melanoma_tumors this represents one of the most successful molecular therapy strategies in melanoma providing tremendous clinical_benefit in personalized cancer medicine however patients eventually develop resistance after treatment therefore an in depth exploration of the functional consequences of a driver_mutation like brafv is critical for better understanding the molecular_profiles driven by a driver_mutation and further development of appropriate molecular therapy strategies most tumors have three to eight driver_mutations that target on different pathways and multiple driver_mutations may coexist and confound although the snowball approach is designed to study the consequences associated with a single driver_mutation it can be applied to samples with multiple driver_mutations to investigate their common and mutation specific target_genes and pathways however in this case users need to carefully examine the mutation profiles and design meaningful comparison groups so that multiple driver_mutations can be properly contrasted and compared and confounding_effects minimized as an example we demonstrated using tcga melanoma metastasis samples to analyze_multiple driver_mutations simultaneously with snowball first we examined the mutational profiles across all tcga melanoma metastasis samples several high_frequency mutation genes including braf nras and cdkn a have been observed braf and nras exhibited mutually_exclusive pattern but partially confounded with cdkn a accordingly we defined sample groups each represent a gain of function recurrent mutation in braf and nras a loss of function deletion in cdkn a or a control_group without any driver_mutations these four groups had braf v e nras q r cdkn a loss and driver_mutation free samples respectively next we applied snowball to compare each mutation group with the controls summarized the results interestingly snowball robustly identified a high proportion of genes that were shared among all driver_mutation groups suggesting that these genes might involve in the melanoma common pathways promoted by all those driver_mutations together ipa analysis further revealed that mitf is the most significantly_enriched up regulator of those common genes previous_studies reported that braf and nras promote gene_expression of mitf mediated via mapk_pathway in addition snowball also identified many driver_mutation specific targets for future investigation in this study we proposed snowball a new discovery approach to identify the consequences of a driver_mutation when comparing the whole_genome gene_expression data between the patient samples with and without a driver_mutation snowball is a de_novo method that can robustly identify the target_genes dysregulated by a driver_mutation it showed high_sensitivity in our simulation_studies and outperformed the two commonly used methods when only a small_sample is available and conventional methods do not have sufficient detection_power good performance should indicate a reasonable balance between type_i errors as shown in supplementary table s the type_i and detection rate showed a reasonable trade_off from snowball but limma lacked the power to detect a good number of genes for downstream_analyses in this case furthermore the application of snowball approach to the tcga data on the braf v mutation in melanoma indicated its ability to discover functional highly_relevant targets including both novel and known genes the higher overlap with the braf v knockdown experiment results additionally supported the conclusion that snowball has higher accuracy in identifying_functional consequences caused by this recurrent driver_mutation the functional analysis of the gene_lists obtained from snowball random_forests and limma indicates that snowball performs substantially better in identification of functional gene and pathway targets of driver_mutations snowball was developed to meet the specific challenges in identifying the functional_consequence of a driver_mutation on clinical samples although we believe our approach could be applied to more general comparative experiments with replicates it has not been fully evaluated we used the tcga data in our discovery example however the snowball approach is not specifically_designed for tcga it can be applied to any transcriptome_data in which two groups can be separated by the status of a driver_mutation based on our simulation_study snowball is particularly effective for cases with small_sample and perform similarly as conventional methods when sample_size is large snowball is a computationally_intensive method however this becomes less of an issue as the modern computational power has substantially increased the implemented r package has applied the r parallel framework to simultaneously utilize multiple processes that are now commonly available in lab workstations
