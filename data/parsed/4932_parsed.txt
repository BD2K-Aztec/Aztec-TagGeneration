xenome a tool for classifying reads from xenograft samples motivation shotgun sequence_read data derived from xenograft material contains a mixture of reads arising from the host and reads arising from the graft classifying the read mixture to separate the two allows for more precise analysis to be performed xenograft_models are an important tool for many areas of biomedical_research including oncology immunology and hiv pathology a typical scenario drawn from oncology_research is that of a human prostate_cancer grown in an immunocompromised mouse_model doing so allows researchers to investigate aspects of the cancer that are not necessarily preserved in cell_lines and it allows investigations into the interactions between the cancer and the surrounding stromal_tissue the mouse may be biopsied or harvested and samples of cancer and or stroma collected at various time points during an experiment difficulties arise when sequencing the genome or transcriptome of the samples because host mouse material i e dna rna will inevitably comingle with the graft human material if a sufficiently careful section is taken it has been generally assumed that the level of host contamination is low enough that it may be ignored this may be a dangerous assumption however since the level of gene_expression is non uniform if the overall level of host contamination in a graft sample is measured to be overall it may still be the case for a given gene that the host homologue accounts for most or all of the expression contamination may be minimized by physical or biochemical_techniques such as conservative sectioning cell_sorting or laser capture micro dissection but these techniques can be a significant source of technical bias or in some cases may require infeasibly large_amounts of starting_material further in the case of transcriptomic investigation classifying host and graft in vitro may fail to adequately capture the interactions between them an alternative strategy is to sequence an acknowledged mixture of host and graft then use in silico methods to classify the individual sequence_reads this is the approach discussed here we demonstrate a simple technique based on an analysis of sequence to whom correspondence should be addressed reads using tophat and a more precise technique based on a k_mer decomposition of the host and graft reference_sequences xenome in both cases the primary goal of the analysis is to classify reads into four classes reads attributable to the host reads attributable to the graft reads which could be attributed to both and reads which are attributable to neither to the best of our knowledge there are no results in the literature examining the classification of high_throughput short_reads from xenograft_models the studies we know of are concerned with microarray expression_profiles or alternative_methods for estimating the amount of host material or cell_types in the samples for example investigate the use of species specific variation in gene length and a multiplex_pcr to ascertain the relative amount of mouse and human dna use microarray gene_profiling data and in silico techniques to estimate the quantity of various tissue_components in there is an analysis of a mouse_xenograft using microarray_data they conclude that if there is more than human dna then the expression_profiles are not unduly skewed they also describe an experimental method for removing homologous_genes based on cross_hybridization analysis of the probes use short_read to study a cancer genome and identify mutations deletions they estimate tumour cellularity using pathological_assessment and state that their xenograft is tumour_cells they also map nod_scid mouse genomic_data to human and mouse genomes reporting and mapping rates respectively and so apply no correction for the murine cells we note that in the context of non uniform rnaseq_data ignoring the contribution of the murine expression can lead to biases tools such as tophat serve a different purpose than that of xenome the former aligns reads to a reference and we can use those alignments for a variety of purposes including the classification task we present here in contrast xenome only performs the classification task itself this is an important distinction since an alignment must assign the read to zero or more positions in the genome the classification merely has to decide if the read was more likely to arise from the genome than not for the remainder of the article we will assume unless otherwise stated that sequence_reads arise from rna_seq however the techniques we present are applicable to genomic dna_sequences including chip_seq and medip_seq and also to other mixtures of dna species our analysis examines two questions whether or not it is technically_feasible to separate host and graft reads in silico and whether or not the fast technique we have proposed xenome yields a worthwhile improvement over the mapping tophat based technique in the first experiment we take a sample of human_cdna sequence_data srr and a sample of mouse cdna sequence_data srr and analyse them both with tophat and xenome and compare the results this allows us to evaluate the degree to which sequences are misclassified assigned to human rather than mouse or vice_versa and the specificity of the classificationthe proportion of sequences which are not classified as both the use of pure human or mouse cdna gives an experiment where the correct assignment of reads is known the second experiment runs the same analysis on sequence_data from a human prostate_cancer xenograft growing in a mouse host in this case however we not only classify the reads but use the tophat mappings to compute approximate levels of gene_expression measured in fragments per thousand bases of transcript per_million or fpkm and use human species specific quantitative_rt qrt_pcr on selected genes to validate the results in this instance we have no gold_standard by which we can judge the xenome only by the tophat analysis tophat or by both xenome and the tophat analysis results but the qrt_pcr will give some degree of validation and known aspects of the biology of the cancer can give some qualitative corroboration tophat uses a global analysis combining the results of all the read mappings to locate exons junctions and so on in contrast xenome performs pre computation on the two reference_genomes then classifies each read independently therefore for each of the three sets of reads we ran tophat with the human_reference and again with the mouse reference_genome then as described in section the mappings were post processed to determine which reads belonged to each of the four classes each of the four partitions of the sets of reads was then partitioned with xenome to allow us to easily determine which reads were classified as the same by both procedures and which were classified differently figures and summarize the results for the three samples the proportion of reads receiving the same classification were and respectively as can be seen from the human and mouse only figures both techniques are accurate in as much as they misclassify only a small proportion of the reads the worst_case being the tophat based analysis of the human_cdna which misclassified of the readsall the other analyses misclassified the main difference between the tophat based and xenome analyses is that the latter yields better specificitythe fraction of reads classed as both is significantly_smaller in the xenome analysis to check for false_positives for the human_cdna dataset we also used blat to map the million_reads which xenome classed as human but which were not mapped to either genome by tophat most of them were successfully mapped with high_quality to the human reference by blat about blat also mapped about of them with very variable quality to the mouse reference this supports our confidence in the accuracy of the xenome algorithm from this we can conclude that the in silico classification of sequences is feasible and accurate we have presented a simple read classification_method based on tophat and our refined classification approach xenome xenome can be used to efficiently and effectively partition the read set for subsequent processing by tools such as tophat what is not apparent from the results above is the relative behaviour at the level of a single gene it should be expected that the distribution of ambiguously mapped_reads classed as both should be non uniform since some genes in the two genomes are more highly_conserved than others the first result we present inon this point is an in silico analysis showing the proportion of each human gene ignoring introns covered by k_mers that are not classed as human it is clear that the vast_majority of genes contain few or no k_mers that are not classed as human the fraction of k_mers which are ambiguous gives a worst_case view of how xenome might be expected to perform in order for a read to be classified as both all of its k_mers must be of the both class or there must be at least one k_mer from each of the two genomes which happens less than of the time in the samples we have tried conversely a single host or graft k_mer is sufficient to classify the read into the respective class therefore for a read to be classified as both the reference must contain a sufficiently long_run of consecutive k_mers of class both and or snps and sequencing_errors must eliminate all the distinctively host or graft k_mers the second result we report on this point presented inis the relative proportion of reads which are classified as both on a per gene basis what is evident in this figure is that although there are many genes for which the proportion of both reads is tightly correlated between tophat and xenome there are a large_number for which the tophat based analysis has significantly more both reads there are genes for which there were at least mapped_reads in the bm xenograft sample of these there were for which xenome assigned both or ambiguous to at least half the reads mapping to the gene there were for which the tophatbased analysis assigned both to at least half the reads_mapped to the gene for the most highly_conserved genes there is not much that can be done with this data directlyfurther signal_processing or other data would be required to determine the relative expression in the host and graft while we have developed xenome with rna_seq on human mouse xenografts in mind we anticipate it will be an effective tool for other similar mixtures for example capturing the differential_methylation around genes between host and graft using medip_seq may shed light on the interraction between the two a plot showing the distribution of human genes with respect to the proportion of xenograft reads which are classed as both by the tophat based analysis and the xenome analysis the reads considered are only those mapped by tophat since xenome does not yield mappings so cannot be used to assign reads to genes only genes for which at least reads_mapped were considered the horizontal axis corresponds to the number of reads classified as both or ambiguous by xenome as a proportion of all the reads that might possibly be human i e both ambiguous or human the vertical_axis corresponds to the number of reads classified as both by the tophatbased analysis once again as a proportion of all the reads that might possibly be human
