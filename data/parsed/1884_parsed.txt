data_and frequent glycan_structure mining of influenza_virus data revealed a sulfated glycan motif that increased viral_infection motivation it is well known influenza_viruses recognize and bind terminal sialic_acid sa on glycans that are found on the cell_surface in this work we used a data_mining technique to analyze the glycan array data of influenza_viruses to find novel glycan_structures other than sa that may be involved in viral_infection results in addition to sa structures noted previously we noted the sulfated structures in the mining results for verification we overex pressed the sulfotransferase that is involved in synthesizing these structures and we performed a viral_infection experiment to assess changes in infection in these cells in our results we found that there is a fold increase in these cells compared with the control thus we have found a novel pattern in glycan_structures that may be involved in viral_infection availability_and the glycan miner tool is available from the rings resource at http www rings influenza_viruses cause highly contagious respiratory_disease in humans with potentially_fatal outcomes and millions of people are affected by influenza every year in addition many animal_species including birds swine horses dogs cats whales and seals can be infected by influenza_viruses viruses of all known hemagglutinin h h and neuraminidase n n subtypes are maintained in aquatic birds and therefore they are considered the natural reservoir of influenza_viruses in humans the known pandemics inwere caused by the h h and h viruses respectively the known epidemics from until now were associated with viruses of the h and h subtypes although not yet pandemic the first human_infections with chicken h n viruses were reported in in hong_kong influenza_viruses bind to sialic_acids sas on the cell_surface to initiate infection and replication human influenza_viruses preferentially bind to n acetylneuraminic acid i e sa attached to the penultimate galactose sugar by an linkage sa gal whereas avian viruses preferentially bind to sa with an linkage sa gal the receptor specificity is shared by the majority of human and avian viruses but it has been reported that the receptor_recognition of some avian viruses was affected by the third saccharide and more distant moieties of the sa gal terminal receptor in addition sulfation of the saccharide core has been shown to produce no effect on binding of duck viruses but chicken and human viruses isolated in in hong_kong showed increased affinity to a sulfated sialyl lewis structure thus it has been shown that negatively_charged groups such as sa and sulfate_groups on glycans might function in binding to viruses in this work we used a data_mining method called closed frequent subtree mining to analyze glycan binding data as produced by glycan array experiments which are available on the web by the consortium for functional glycomics cfg after data_mining of those glycan_structures with high_binding we noted that sulfated structures were found in the results in addition to other terminal sa and sialyl lewis structures as illustrated previously in other works in this work however we focused only on sulfation and to verify the effects of sulfation as shown from these results we overexpressed the sulfotransferase that is involved in synthesizing these structures then we performed a viral_infection experiment to assess the change in the level of viral_infection using the overexpressed cells in our results we found a surprisingly large increase in viral_infection using our overexpressed cells we were particularly surprised because we only overexpressed the sulfation and did not modify any sialyltransferases from these results we can claim that we have found a novel pattern in glycan_structures that is involved in viral_infection using our glycan mining tool to whom correspondence should be addressed
