mobility based prediction of hydration structures of protein_surfaces motivation hydration largely determines solubility aggregation of proteins and influences interactions between proteins and drug molecules despite the importance of hydration structural_determination of hydration structure of protein_surfaces is still challenging from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints the precision of experimental_measurements is often affected by fluctuations and mobility of water_molecules resulting in uncertain assignment of water positions results our method can utilize mobility as an information_source for the prediction of hydration structure the necessary information can be produced by molecular_dynamics simulations accounting for all atomic interactions including waterwater contacts the predictions were validated and tested by comparison to more than crystallographic water positions in hydrated protein molecules including enzymes of biomedical importance such as cyclin_dependent the agreement with experimental water positions was larger than on average the predictions can be particularly useful in situations where no or limited experimental knowledge is available on hydration structures of molecular_surfaces availability_and the method is implemented in a standalone c program mobywat released under the gnu_general freely_accessible with full documentation atwater molecules located on protein_surfaces play fundamental structural and functional_roles in biology for example hydrogen_bonds formed by waters stabilize protein_structure and affect folding surface water_molecules are mediators of the assembly of bamyloid protofilaments of alzheimers_disease and there is evidence that structurally_conserved waters are parts of electron_transfer networks such as respiratory_chain structures of many gprotein coupled receptors are also stabilized by hydration a recent study suggests that structural water_molecules are also

proteins in photochemistry as well as playing a fundamental role in charge_transfer allostery and energy_flow water_molecules are often considered essential parts of the protein_structure and the first hydration shell is a key_determinant of the solubility and aggregation of solute molecules proteinprotein and proteinligand_interactions are influenced by surface bound water_molecules and therefore knowledge of their location is of great_importance during structure_based tightly_bound water_molecules can affect the chemical diversity of designed ligands garca leading to simple rules for the use of water_molecules in drug_design and also in interpretation of ligand based pharmacophore models inclusion of explicit water_molecules in drug_design have been thoroughly studied and was found to be of central importance in ligandprotein docking although hydration structure is important it has hitherto proven to be very difficult to determine at the atomic_level by experimental means largely due to mobility and complexity of interactions of water_molecules located on a protein surface the residence of a water_molecule on the surface and its exchange with bulk are affected not primarily by the strength of proteinwater interactions but it is rather a topography that prevents the water_molecule from exchanging by a cooperative mechanism halle a importantly such a cooperative mechanism of exchange also governs several waterwater interactions that can often be detected between surface water_molecules it is problematic to handle and to predict the residence of water_molecules in the hydration layer of a protein using merely thermodynamic or kinetic approaches crystallography is the prime experimental method for detection of water positions via electron_density and used as the de facto standard however there are still numerous limitations of this method coming from low_resolution of large structural assemblies assignment problems and artifacts due to cryogenic temperatures used a number of computational_methods have been proposed for prediction of hydration structure on protein_surfaces such methods generally require the dry protein_structure as an input and provide predictions for hydration structure using a variety of algorithms a large group of the methods uses fast and simplified approaches disregarding exchange mobility between surface and bulk water_molecules and dynamics of the hydration structure they assume a static picture of hydration shells and focus on finding appropriate binding_sites of water_molecules on the protein surface using scoring_schemes energy calculations prior_knowledge h bonding information or artificial_neural several studies have dealt with construction and use of density_distribution functions of hydration shells for different atom types occurring in proteins limitations of generalized densitybased approaches were discussed in detail these methods ignore dynamics and cooperativity governing hydration with advancement of computational infrastructure and force_fields the efficiency and chemical accuracy of atomic_level montecarlo and molecular_dynamics md_simulations has increased enormously in the past_decades enabling their applications in cutting_edge drug_design projects it has become a routine task to generate md trajectories with explicit water_molecules for virtually any protein of interest atomistic simulations of md hold a conceptual advantage over the static or density based trained methods as the mobility a key_determinant of hydration structure is described directly at atomic_level whereas such benefits of atomic md calculations have been extensively used in analyses there are not many md based_methods for prediction of the hydration structure these approaches focus on all individual positions of hydrating water_molecules and apply various evaluation schemes such as the definition of time averaged positions for calculation of the hydration structure in this study we introduce a mobility based atomic_level method for prediction of hydration structure of molecular_surfaces using only dry protein_structures as input our method was tested on proteins and the corresponding computational procedures are provided in a program mobywat which can be used in conjunction with any md software that can produce all atom md trajectories
