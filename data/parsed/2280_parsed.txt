identification of causal_genes for complex_traits motivation although genome_wide gwas have identified thousands of variants associated with common diseases and complex_traits only a handful of these variants are validated to be causal we consider causal_variants as variants which are responsible for the association_signal at a locus as opposed to association studies that benefit from linkage_disequilibrium ld the main_challenge in identifying causal_variants at associated loci lies in distinguishing among the many closely correlated variants due to ld this is particularly important for model_organisms such as inbred_mice where ld extends much further than in human populations resulting in large stretches of the genome with significantly associated variants furthermore these model_organisms are highly_structured and require correction for population_structure to remove potential spurious_associations results in this work we propose caviar gene causal_variants identification in associated regions a novel method that is able to operate across large ld regions of the genome while also correcting for population_structure a key feature of our approach is that it provides as output a minimally sized set of genes that captures the genes which harbor causal_variants with probability q through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our method not only speeds up computation but also have an average of higher recall_rate compared with the existing_approaches we validate our method using a real mouse high_density data hdl and show that caviar gene is able to identify apoa a gene known to harbor causal_variants for hdl while reducing the number of genes that need to be tested for functionality by a factor of genome_wide gwas have been extremely successful in reproducibly identifying variants associated with various complex_traits and diseases the most common type of genetic_variants comes in the form of single_nucleotide snps which we make the focus of this study because of the correlation_structure in the genome a phenomenon referred to as linkage_disequilibrium ld each gwas associated variant will typically have hundreds to thousands of other variants which are also significantly associated with the trait identifying the variants responsible for the observed effect on a trait is referred to as fine_mapping in the context of association studies the genetic_variants which are responsible for the association_signal at a locus are referred to in the genetics literature as the causal_variants causal_variants have biological effect on the phenotype generally variants can be categorized into three main groups the first group is the causal_variants which have a biological effect on the phenotype and are responsible for the association_signal the second group is the variants which are statistically associated with the phenotype due to ld with a causal_variant even though association tests for these variants may be statistically_significant under our definition they are not causal_variants the third group is the variants which are not statistically associated with the phenotype and are not causal we note that this usage of the term causal has little to do v c the author published_by
