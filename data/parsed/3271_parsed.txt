'non destructive' biocomputing security system based on gas controlled biofuel_cell and potentially used for intelligent medical_diagnostics motivation biofuel cells bfcs based on enzymes and microbes are the promising future alternative sources of sustainable electrical_energy under mild conditions i e ambient_temperature and neutral_ph by combining the adaptive behavior of bfcs self regulating energy release with the versatility of biocomputing we construct a novel gas controlled biocomputing security system which could be used as the potential implantable self powered and smart medical system with the logic diagnosis aim results we have demonstrated a biocomputing security system based on bfcs due to the unique reset reagent of n applied in this work the prepared biocomputing security system can be reset and cycled for a large number of times with no reset reagent based waste this would be advantageous for the potential practical_applications of such keypad lock as well as the development of biocomputing security devices in order to validate the universality of the system and also to harvest energy directly from biofuels with enhanced power_output we replace the glucose with orange_juice as the biofuel to operate bfcs based biocomputing system which also possesses the function of keypad lock in addition by introducing bfcs into the biocomputing security system the adaptive behavior of the bfcs self regulating the power release would be an immense advantage of such security keypad lock devices in potential self powered implantable medical_systems the designed sequence gives the maximum power_output and discriminate itself from the rest of the sequences from this we find that maximizing the dimensionless ratio of gap versus sd of the power_output spectrum a funnel in power outputs gives the quantitative optimal_design criterion therefore our construction here may also provide a practical example and microscopic structural basis for mimicking the real biological_network systems and bridge the gaps between the theoretical concepts and experiments important for biomolecular systems and synthetic_biology contact biofuel cells bfcs based on enzymes and microbes are the promising future alternative sources of sustainable electrical_energy under mild conditions i e ambient_temperature and neutral_ph the uses of the biomass such as glucose endogenously existing in the biological_systems suggest the important potential applications of bfcs as one kind of implantable power sources for biomedical devices including micropumps pacemakers neuromorphic circuits etc so such adaptive behavior of the implantable bfc self regulating the power release would be an immense advantage of these bioelectronic devices logic lies at the heart of modern computers and the components that carry out its operations are logic_gates in electronic computers logic_gates are sculpted on the surface of silicon wafers their inputs and outputs are electrical voltages but these are not the only systems that can form logic circuits in recent_years much research interest was directed to unconventional chemical computing performing boolean logic operations without the involvement of electronic computers and responding to a large variety of activating input signals in homogeneous solutions or at interfaces functionalized with molecular supramolecular moieties recently the combination of unconventional chemical logic_gates and logic circuits has been used for developing keypad locks based on unconventional chemical system it is an attractive research goal in the area of unconventional chemical computing and offers a new approach for protecting information biocomputing belonging to a subarea of unconventional chemical computing and performed by living_organisms e g proteins enzymes dna rna and whole biological cells is aiming at the information_processing using biochemical means two different branches of the biocomputing systems are being developed in different directions one is aiming at competing with traditional electronic computation taking advantages of parallel_computing performed by numerous biomolecules usuallypage in conclusion we have demonstrated a biocomputing security system based on bfcs due to the unique reset reagent of n applied in this work the prepared biocomputing security system can be reset and cycled for a large number of times with no reset reagent based waste this would be advantageous for the potential practical_applications of such keypad lock as well as the development of biocomputing security devices in order to validate the universality of the system and also to harvest energy directly from biofuels with enhanced power_output we replace the glucose with orange_juice as the biofuel to operate bfcsbased biocomputing system which also possesses the function of keypad lock in addition by introducing bfcs into the biocomputing security system the adaptive behavior of the bfcs self regulating the power release would be an immense advantage of such security keypad lock devices in potential self powered implantable medical_systems and the principle of the influence of gas injection and electrolyte agitation on bfc performance is based on dissolved_oxygen and liquid_flow respectively thus based on the relationship between the dissolved_oxygen in blood with ischemic state heart_attack as well as the relationship between the blood flow_rate in blood_vessel with the cardiac_output mean blood_pressure the current biocomputing security system can be used as the potential implant device model for assessing physiological_conditions in living_organisms and for making autonomous decisions on the use of specific tools drugs in various implantable medical_systems nearly all living_organisms need oxygen to carry on life processes and blood_flow to maintain life thus on the other hand on the conceptual level this work might help us understand how living_organisms manage to control extremely_complex and coupled biochemical_reactions that is the hope is to cast biochemical metabolic_pathways in the language of information_theory for example the underlying landscapes of some signal_transduction and metabolic_networks can have global funneled landscapes as a result of sequence of cascade of intricate logic gate like motifs this guarantees the unique direction of the information_flow and biological_functions with robustness and stability we performed a global study and found that maximizing the dimensionless ratio of gap versus sd of the power_output spectrum a funnel in power outputs gives the quantitative optimal_design criterion our construction here may provide a practical example and microscopic structural basis for mimicking the real biomolecular and network systems and bridge the gaps between the theoretical concepts and experiments important for biomolecular systems and synthetic_biology
