prediction of conserved long_range rna_rna in full viral_genomes motivation long_range rna_rna lris play_an in viral_replication however only a few of these interactions are known and only for a small number of viral species up to now it has been impossible to screen a full viral_genome for lris experimentally or in silico most known lris are cross_reacting structures pseudoknots undetectable by most bioinformatical tools results we present lriscan a tool for the lri prediction in full viral_genomes based on a multiple genome alignment we confirmed out of experimentally known and evolutionary_conserved lris in genome alignments of hcv tombusviruses flaviviruses and hiv we provide several promising new interactions which include compensatory mutations and are highly_conserved in all considered viral_sequences furthermore we provide reactivity plots highlighting the hot_spots of predicted lris availability source_code of lriscan freely_available for download atlong range rna_rna lris have been marginally reported in various positive_strand like tombusvirus in cirv and tbsv hepacivirus in hcv coronavirus in tgev flavivirus in denv and wnv luteovirus in bydv apthovirus in fmdv pestivirus in csfv and human_immunodeficiency in hiv according to their definition a long_range interaction spans distances between a few hundred and several thousands of nucleotides kb in tgev lris are often located in loop_regions or internal bulges of local rna_structures known as cis_acting regulatory_elements and therefore build pseudoknot like structures various programs have been developed for general rna rna interaction prediction which can be classified into five groups the first group neglects intra_molecular base_pairs to whom correspondence should be addressed based on the hybrids minimum_free mfe members of this group are rnaduplex and rnaplex or rnahybrid the second category includes rnacofold and pairfold these tools concatenate two interacting rna_sequences and calculate the mfe of the joint rna_sequences the third group considers intra_molecular and inter molecular rna_rna in separated steps however only one binding_site is predicted members of this group are intarna or rnaup the fourth group considers more complex rna_rna and allows also more than one binding_site this group includes tools like ractip interna or inrnas the final group contains e g petcofold rnaaliduplex irbis ripalign and simulfold these tools consider not only a pair of single sequences like the tools mentioned above they use multiple_sequence as input with this comparative method it is possible to reduce the false_positive by incorporating evolutionary_conserved information all of these programs have different properties unsuitable for viral_genomes for example rnaaliduplex is unable to predict pseudoknots and neglects intra_molecular rna foldings petcofold considers both intra_and molecular_interactions as well as pseudoknots but returns per default only a single secondary_structure which makes the detection of multiple functional_binding impossible ripaligns running time makes the program not applicable to viral_sequences and irbis is only applicable for predictions of rna interactions related to rna splice_sites up to now we are aware of a single program that is designed for lri prediction called covarna this tool detects long_range nucleotide covariation from multiple_sequence of eukaryotic_genomes using an index based algorithm to find clusters of covarying base_pairs the extended function covstat determines the statistical_significance of observed covariation cluster covarna has very strict filter criteria and is therefore very conservative in predicting lris for short genomes such as viral_genomes this leads to almost no predicted interactions here we present lriscan for detecting long_range rna_rna in complete viral_genome alignments without prior_knowledge sparse alignment interaction dotplots in combination
