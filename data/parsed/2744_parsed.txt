loftool a gene intolerance score based on loss of function variants in individuals motivation depletion of loss of function lof mutations may provide a rank of genic functional intolerance and consequently susceptibility to disease results here we have studied lof mutations in unrelated_individuals and show that the most intolerant quartile of ranked genes is enriched in rare and early_onset diseases and explains of de_novo haploinsufficient omim mutations more than any other gene scoring tool we detected particular enrichment in expression of the depleted lof genes in brain odds_ratio p value e by searching for de_novo haploinsufficient mutations putatively associated with neurodevelopmental_disorders in four recent_studies we were able to explain of them taken together this study provides a novel gene intolerance ranking system called loftool which may help in ranking genes of interest based on their lof intolerance and tissue expression next_generation has generated a vast amount of genomic_data but for clinical_applications interpretability of the results remains_a whole_exome has recently started to detect_variants related to rare mendelian and complex_diseases usually in a trio setting where both the patient and the parents are exome sequenced in order to identify de_novo disease associated mutations presently several tools exist to predict a single variants pathogenicity like polyphen and sift but they do not extrapolate their predictions to the gene level there are also tools that prioritize candidate disease_causing such as endeavour or prioritizer but these need a priori genetic knowledge of the disease recently a new set of tools that prioritize candidate disease_causing with no a priori disease knowledge has emerged by using the whole exome sequences of individuals from the nhlbi go exome_sequencing project esp devised a residual variance intolerance score rvis from common missense and loss of function lof variants versus total number of protein_coding variants regardless of their frequency in the esp population a complementary_approach for gene level prioritization of disease genes calibrates de_novo mutation_rates per gene based on exome sequenced trios in order to prioritize real excess of de_novo mutations evotol another gene score measures the genes intolerance to mutations using evolutionary_conservation of protein_sequences here we developed an alternative gene score method called loftool based on the mutation_patterns in the exomes of unrelated_individuals from the exome aggregation consortium exac dataset http exac broadinstitute org although lof intolerance is not a synonym of general intolerance lof mutations have the greatest pathogenic_potential and hence are a good proxy for general genic intolerance to functional v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com variation loftool is based on the ratio of lof to synonymous mutations for each gene adjusting for the gene de_novo mutation_rate and evolutionary protein conservation section we evaluate loftool against rvis z_score and evotol and show that it clearly outperforms them in identifying de_novo haploinsufficient disease_causing from the online_mendelian omim database and from studies of neurodevelopmental_disorders we have shown that loftool discriminates between genes that do and do not cause disease mostly early_onset outperforming other state of the art gene scoring_methods loftool predicts genomewide de_novo haploinsufficient mutations accurately and could be of help in search for genetic causes of rare mendelian_diseases moreover its brain expression enrichment coupled to a roc auc of in detecting neurodevelopmental_disorder genes makes loftool also an attractive method for investigating complex brain_diseases with strong genetic effects in addition our loftool score has already been adopted by popular variant annotation tools like annovar snpeff dbnsfp ucsc_genome variant integrator and ensembl variant effect predictor which highlights the wide applicability of our gene intolerance score future work could focus on functional protein_domains rather than the overall gene_mutation burden in order to more easily prioritize the avalanche of rare_variants putativelyloftoolassociated with a phenotype of interest taken together this study provides a novel gene intolerance ranking system that ranks genes based on their loss of function intolerance and tissue expression specificity
