structural_bioinformatics a comprehensive comparison of association estimators for gene network_inference motivation gene network_inference gni algorithms enable the researchers to explore the interactions among the genes and gene_products by revealing these interactions the principal process of the gni algorithms is to obtain the association scores among genes although there are several association estimators used in different applications there is no commonly_accepted estimator as the best one for the gni applications in this study different interaction estimators were reviewed and most promising ones among them were evaluated by using three popular gni algorithms with two synthetic and two real_biological belonging to escherichia_coli bacteria and saccharomyces_cerevisiae yeast influences of the copula transform ct pre_processing operation on the performance of the interaction estimators are also observed this study is expected to assist many researchers while studying with gni applications results b spline pearson based gaussian and spearman based gaussian association score estimators outperform the others for all datasets in terms of the performance and runtime in addition to this it is observed that when the ct operation is used inference performances of the estimators mostly increase especially for two synthetic datasets detailed evaluations and discussions are given in the experimental_results gene network_inference gni algorithms are frequently used in the bioinformatics studies such as detecting the activator genes of the genetic_diseases determining the functions of the regulating and regulated_genes obtaining the drug_targets of the medical cures etc the most important process of the gni applications is to obtain the interaction scores among the cell molecules such as genes or proteins in the gni applications the association score estimators generally use the gene_expression obtained from microarray_data analysis to determine the interaction scores among each gene_pair in this study two synthetic and two real_biological gene_expression are used for evaluation because the biological_datasets involve different kinds of noise caused by experimental processes and computational errors of microarray_data analysis operation it is difficult to obtain interaction scores among the cell molecules if those scores cannot be estimated accurately inference performance of the application would not be good enough whichever gni algorithm is used in this study several gni algorithms are used to evaluate different association score estimators objectively each estimator is separately evaluated with three gni algorithms and four datasets in this manner association estimators that impact the inference performance positively are presented to the researchers interested in this field additionally we tried to illustrate whether the inference performance is mostly influenced by the gni algorithms or by the association estimators it is observed that inference performance of the gni applications are mostly impacted from the association estimators as given in the experimental_results relevance network relnet accurate cellular_networks aracne and conservative causal core networks c net are used as gni algorithms because these are some of the most commonly used ones they were selected for the comparison explanations of these gni algorithms are given in the section of the supplementary_material the purpose of this study is not to investigate the gni algorithms but it is to examine the association estimators that are the most important process of the gni algorithms hence estimators from several association estimator studies which are frequently cited are reviewed from the literature among them most outstanding estimators are chosen in z kurt et_al unpublished to compare in this study in depth explanations are given in z this study differs from the previous study in several aspects first of all we examined almost all available association estimators in the previous review article to decide the most promising ones for using in gni applications rather than performing common experiments however current study extends the preliminary review by involving several experiments common datasets and evaluation measures in the review article the estimators were evaluated only by depending on the declared comparisons in the literature however this study uses several gni algorithms to evaluate the inference performances of the estimators in addition to our unpublished review article a small subset of the estimators was compared in a previous narrow scoped study for only one gni algorithm c net by using only synthetic datasets while this study involves evaluation of to whom correspondence should be addressed estimators for three different gni algorithms by using also real_biological in this section detailed_evaluation and discussion of the association estimators are given according to utilization of ct firstly the results of the experiments in the case of using ct are reported for each dataset separately then the experimental_results in the case of not using ct are given briefly in this study association estimators and three gni algorithms were evaluated by using two synthetic and two real_biological moreover influence of using the ct on the inference performance of the estimators is also examined changing the association estimator has a greater effect on the inference performances than changing the gni algorithm there is no single estimator that can be denoted as the best one it is observed that the best performing estimators are common and compatible according to both the f score and precision metrics for all datasets analyses are firstly performed_separately for each dataset and then discussions are made commonly for all datasets in this sense for two synthetic datasets with respect to both f score and precision metrics by using ct the most promising methods are the bs bs kde pbg and sbg precision score is used to evaluate the estimators when the real_biological are used the bs bs cs kde mm pbg and sbg among mi based_approaches and pcc and scc among correlation based ones exhibit the best precision scores the bs cs and mm become slightly more prominent than the others for the first real_biological dataset while the bs cs kde pcc pbg scc and sbg are the most promising ones for the second real_biological dataset when the estimators are commonly evaluated with respect to all datasets the bs bs kde pbg and sbg are observed as the best performing estimators however the runtime of the kde is large in the applications in which the runtime is more important than the precision of the estimators the bs pbg and sbg estimators should be preferred the ppcn is commonly the worst one because it eliminates much of the tp edges incorrectly the knn is another commonly worst performing estimator moreover the hhg surprisingly exhibits significantly less performance with increasing sample_size it can perform well for only the smallest dataset but its performance become worse with other datasets other observations obtained from the experiments are that inference performance gets better when the number of the samples in the dataset becomes larger furthermore using the ct generally increases the inference performance of the estimators generally the ef discretization technique results in better inference performances than the ew technique when the ct is not used when the ct is used ef and ew show similar performances as expected readers should keep in mind that the aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the association estimators not to compare the gni algorithms however some results about the gni algorithms can be clearly seen from the figures in the experimental_results for example the relnet is the worst performing algorithm because it cannot eliminate the indirect interactions moreover the aracne and the c net perform similar while the c net gives significantly better precision scores than the aracne furthermore optimal average sample number in each bin during the discretization process is also examined ffiffiffiffi n p is observed as a proper choice where n is the sample_size details are given in section of supplementary_material lastly implementing estimators in c results in less runtimes because the pcc scc pbg sbg and ppcn were implemented by using rs custom functions they were not implemented in c parallelized c codes make the hhg kde and knn methods almost twice faster than their serial c codes the parallel c code runtimes of bs cs and mm are greater than their serial counterparts parallel runtimes could be reduced by using a dataset with more samples or a computer with more cores finally we expect this comprehensive study is expected to assist many researchers studying in this field
