genome_analysis dmap differential_methylation analysis package for rrbs and wgbs data motivation the rapid development_of has enabled epigeneticists to quantify dna_methylation on a massive scale progressive increase in sequencing capacity present_challenges in terms of processing analysis and the interpretation of the large amount of data investigating differential_methylation between genome_scale from multiple samples highlights this challenge results we have developed a differential_methylation analysis package dmap to generate coverage filtered reference methylomes and to identify differentially_methylated across multiple samples from reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and whole_genome bisulphite sequencing_experiments we introduce a novel fragment based_approach for investigating dna_methylation for reduced representation bisulphite sequencing_data further dmap provides the identity of gene and cpg features and distances to the differentially_methylated in a format that is easily analyzed with limited bioinformatics knowledge availability_and the software has been implemented in c and has been written to ensure portability between different platforms the source_code is freely_available dmap as compressed tar archive folder from http biochem otago ac nz research databases software two test datasets are also available for download from the web_site test_dataset contains reads from chromosome of a patient and a control which is used for comparative_analysis in the current article test_dataset contains reads from a part of chromosome of three disease and three control samples for testing the operation of dmap especially for the analysis_of example commands for the analyses are included dna_methylation is arguably the most stable epigenetic mark that plays_a in regulating development and disease one of the most fundamental challenges for epigeneticists is to identify dna_methylation differences between genomes for instance differential_methylation between diseased and normal samples interindividual_variation within a population differences between tissues or species and so on are of biological and clinical_relevance the rapid_improvement in next_generation now provides opportunities to interrogate dna_methylation at single_base with high coverage across multiple samples bisulphite treatment converts unmethylated_cytosines to uracils and ultimately to thymine after amplification although leaving methylated_cytosines unchanged therefore bisulphite treatment combined with next_generation bs_seq has become a preferred method to generate base resolution dna_methylation maps because whole_genome bisulphite sequencing wgbs is still expensive and generates challenging amounts of raw_data reduced representation bisulphite sequencing rrbs provides a cost_effective alternative for whole_genome methylation sequencing rrbs has been widely used by several groups worldwide to interrogate functionally_important genomic_regions at high sequencing_coverage and sensitivity during the past_few several alignment tools have been developed to cope with asymmetric mapping issues of bisulphite converted sequenced_reads and to map millions of reads with reasonable speed to the reference_genome some of these aligners are rmap bs seeker bismark rrbsmap batmeth and pass bis recent comparative_analyses have improved our understanding of the efficiency accuracy and algorithm of these aligners additionally tools have been developed for generating methylation calls and visualization integrated genome viewer and methvisual allow visualization of sequenced_reads and regional analysis biq analyzer ht allows site_specific dna_methylation analysis and saap rrbs can perform alignment methylation calls annotation of cpg_sites and visualization methylkit an r package enables_detection of differentially_methylated dmcs methylkit to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as applies a fishers_exact or logistic_regression to calculate p values that are adjusted to q values for multiple test correction using a slim approach for wgbs data bsmooth performs local averaging and sample wise smoothing of methylation_values after alignment and methylation estimates by read position bsmooth applies numerous cpg wise t tests and based on a t test threshold differentially_methylated dmrs are defined biseq an r package performs smoothing of methylation data within cpg clusters considering spatial dependence differential_methylation is then detected in cpg clusters the false_discovery is controlled and finally dmr boundaries are defined in contrast to alignment and visualization_tools the number of software_packages available to detect dmrs is small some tools offer detection of dmcs and some dmrs and most of them are hardwired i e they provide little flexibility in the choice of analysis parameters such as coverage criteria dmr length and the type of statistical_test further most available tools do not provide options for further analysis of dmrs with respect to its genomic_position such as the transcription_start genes cpg features and so on here we describe differential_methylation analysis package dmap a pipeline that can directly import the output from any bisulphite aligner in sequence_alignment sam format and identify differential_methylation we have primarily designed the package to handle data from rrbs experiments which uses bp mspi digested genomic fragments but it can be used effectively to investigate wgbs data for any eukaryotic_genome as well a suite of statistical_tests is included in dmap chi_square fishers_exact and analysis_of anova to identify methylation differences between different groups and conditions for rrbs we introduce a novel approach of identifying differential_methylation based on mspi fragments differentially_methylated fragment dmf further dmap provides genomic relationship information nearest gene exon introns and cpg features for each dmr or dmf a higher number of dmcs is expected compared to the number of dmfs dmrs because each dmf dmr will contain several differentially_methylated cpgs dmf dmr will also contain cpg_sites that individually will not qualify as differentially_methylated further there will be several independent dmcs that will not form part of a dmf or dmr this explains the finding of higher dmcs identified by methylkit and lower dmr dmfs identified by biseq and dmap a frame toframe comparison of differential_methylation patterns between these tools is not possible because each of them uses a different unit of analysis to determine differential_methylation thenote the identgenloc here provides data of chromosome length of the region number of cpg_sites contained within the region p value statistical_test applied distance in relation to the gene calculated from the start of the gene relationship with the gene e g upstream exon intron cpg feature relation strand and the name of the associated gene the in the gene distance column indicates the region is inside the gene body the output is a tab_delimited text_file suitable for importing into microsoft_excel gene distance is calculated from the start of thewe wanted to include all the possible regions for a fair comparison with methylkit during the review process we found that biseq version and contained an erroneous readbismark function which produced a very high number of dmrs for our analysis as a result of false methylation calls the function was corrected in version therefore it is advisable to use several tools in combination to ensure detection of sensible detection of differentially_methylated for biological_interpretation in terms of coverage methylkit called the cpg_sites with or more reads from the aligned sam_files in dmap fragments having two cpg_sites with or more reads were included for analysis in contrast biseq uses a quantile approach for smoothing methylation data where a higher weighting is given to cpg_sites with high coverage and sites with an unusually_high coverage are excluded for example to the quantile in this analysis these differences could account for some of the variation observed in the comparative differential_methylation analysis performed here we present dmap an analysis package that filters and processes aligned bisulphite sequenced data to generate comprehensive reference methylomes tile based and fragment based with flexibility for users from sam_files dmap provides statistically_significant dmrs and relates them to genes and cpgs statistical_approaches for the analysis of genome_wide data are not yet well characterized a caveat to the use of statistical_tests for fragment or window based_approaches is that methylation_values for cpgs within a sequenced read are likely to be correlated and thus statistical_significance can be overestimated therefore further work is needed to devise better statistical_methods for accurate detection of differential_methylation aside from some awk scripts dmap is written in c and executes efficiently in our test runs the diffmeth program was able to produce a list of candidate_regions while processing human rrbs samples in h the output from this step was processed in min by identgeneloc to produce gene features of the candidate_regions although the package was initially_developed for the human_genome the code was modified to work with any eukaryotic_genome optionally dmap has no expectation of an x and y chromosome and can work with any number of autosomal chromosomes we tested the package with zebrafish genome zv assembly which has chromosomes and no x and y chromosome and all the features described in this article worked successfully to our knowledge dmap is the first tool that accepts unsorted raw sam alignment files as an input detects dmr or dmf provides information and distances of nearest genes and cpg features in relation to each dmf or dmr the outputs exported to text_files are relatively easy for bench scientists without bioinformatics expertise to analyze and use with other tools
