structural_bioinformatics improved protein ligand binding_affinity prediction by using a curvature dependent surface_area model motivation hydrophobic_effect plays_a in most protein ligand_binding state of the art proteinligand scoring_methods usually treat hydrophobic free_energy as surface_tension which is proportional to interfacial surface_area for simplicity and efficiency however this treatment ignores the role of molecular_shape which has been found very important by either experimental or theoretical_studies results we propose a new empirical scoring_function named cyscore cyscore improves the prediction_accuracy by using a novel curvature dependent surface_area model which is able to distinguish convex planar and concave surface in hydrophobic free_energy calculation benchmark tests show that this model significantly_improves the proteinligand scoring and cyscore outperforms a variety of well established scoring_functions using pdbbind benchmark sets for binding_affinity correlation and ranking tests we expect the curvature dependent surface_area model and cyscore would contribute to the study of proteinligand_interactions availability cyscore is available to non commercial users atscoring functions are approximate computational_methods for predicting the binding_affinity of two docked molecules especially a protein and a ligand they are widely used in structure based_drug and other molecular_modeling applications including virtual_screening de_novo drug_design and lead_optimization in the past several decades a variety of scoring_functions have been developed in general they can be classified into three types force_field based knowledge based and empirical scoring_functions force_field based scoring_functions are derived from first principle which employs classical force_fields to compute the direct interaction_energies e g van_der and electrostatic energies between the ligand and its target protein sometimes these methods are combined with gb sa or pb sa methods to address the solvation effect knowledge based scoring_functions are derived from statistical_potentials which predict the binding_free using the probabilities of finding atom pairs at a given distance between proteins and ligands they have obtained a high_level of prediction_accuracy according to some recent_studies however knowledge based scoring_functions usually require large_numbers of terms which are prone to over fitting by training and can hardly provide immediate physical interpretation of results those weak points limit their applications empirical scoring_functions incorporate the advantages of both force_field based and knowledge based scoring_functions they calculate the overall binding_free as a sum of several physically meaningful terms while their coefficients are derived from the regression_analysis on experimental_data as they can achieve comparably accurate prediction and provide physical insights of proteinligand binding as well empirical scoring_functions are widely used in structure_based applications in this article we propose a new empirical scoring_function named cyscore it is composed of hydrophobic free_energy van_der interaction_energy hydrogen_bond interaction_energy and ligands conformational_entropy we mainly focus on improving the prediction of hydrophobic free_energy because it is regarded to be dominant in most proteinligand binding hydrophobic_effect is the observed tendency of nonpolar surfaces to association in an aqueous_solution many theoretical approaches have been proposed to study its mechanism such as iceberg model scaled particle theory based void_volume models both experimental and theoretical_studies have pointed_out that hydrophobic_effect depends not only on surface_area but also on shape in the conventional proteinligand scoring_methods hydrophobic free_energy is usually treated as surface_tension which is proportional to interfacial surface_area for simplicity and efficiency obviously this treatment ignores the role of molecular_shape and hinders the more accurate prediction to whom correspondence should be addressed of hydrophobic free_energy inspired by the thermodynamic research of tolman and the pioneer work of we took curvature as the descriptor of shape and proposed a novel curvature dependent surfacearea model our analyses demonstrate that this model is superior to the conventional surface_area model significantly in protein ligand scoring compared to a variety of well established scoring_functions it achieves the top performance using the well known pdbbind benchmark sets the methods and results will be elaborated in the following sections in this section we first give an overview of cyscore then we investigate how the curvature dependent surface_area model is superior to the conventional models in scoring proteinligand_interactions finally to gain an overall performance of cyscore we compare it to a variety of well established scoring_functions using pdbbind benchmarks
