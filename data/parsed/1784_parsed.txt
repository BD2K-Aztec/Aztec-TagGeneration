fast protein binding_site comparisons using visual words representation motivation finding geometrically similar protein binding_sites is crucial for understanding protein functions and can provide_valuable for proteinprotein_docking and drug_discovery as the number of known proteinprotein_interaction structures has dramatically_increased a high_throughput and accurate protein binding_site comparison method is essential traditional alignment_based can provide accurate correspondence between the binding_sites but are computationally_expensive results in this article we present a novel method for the comparisons of protein binding_sites using a visual words representation pbsword we first extract geometric features of binding_site surfaces and build a vocabulary of visual words by clustering a large set of feature descriptors we then describe a binding_site surface with a high_dimensional vector that encodes the frequency of visual words enhanced by the spatial relationships among them finally we measure the similarity of binding_sites by utilizing metric space operations which provide speedy comparisons between protein binding_sites our experimental_results show that pbsword achieves a comparable classification_accuracy to an alignment based method and improves accuracy of a feature_based method by on a non redundant dataset pbsword also exhibits a significant efficiency improvement over an alignment based method availability pbsword is available atproteinprotein interaction as an essential aspect of biological_processes plays_a in determining protein functions and forming protein_complexes the protein_complexes consist of multiple subunits domains or chains that interact via protein_protein ppis the ppis are composed of geometrically and physicochemically complementary binding_sites from the respective subunits in a protein complex each binding_site corresponds to a to whom correspondence should be addressed region of residues that are in close spatial_proximity and can interact with residues from another subunit with the development of high_throughput e g yeast_two screens the size of data_repositories of proteinprotein_interactions has dramatically_increased which makes a comprehensive understanding of the protein_interaction feasible several proteinprotein interactionrelated databases have been constructed such as scoppi pibase intact ipfam and dommino particularly the scoppi database provides an evolutionary and structural_classification of ppis based on scop family sequence_similarity and geometric features of binding_sites to analyze the proteinprotein_interaction mechanisms an efficient method for comparing protein binding_sites is an indispensible tool with a potential impact on protein_function proteinprotein_docking drug_discovery and evolutionary_studies methods for comparing the protein binding_sites can be generally classified into two categories i alignment based and ii featurebased early research_works on alignment_based focused on comparing binding_sites by aligning the corresponding c atoms from different protein_complexes using global structural_alignment tools this group of methods works well when sequence and structure are well conserved however as shown in an earlier work the limitation of global protein_structure is that it cannot usually produce accurate interface alignment since the true interface may not be the first priority for a global structure alignment_method to overcome this issue ialign was developed to align the residues from ppis another method i isiteengine supports alignment of two binding_sites based on the similarity of physicochemical_properties and the shapes of surfaces the alignment_based can provide accurate correspondence between two binding_sites but are usually computationally_expensive which makes them infeasible when working with very large_datasets feature based_methods on the other hand make comparison based on feature descriptor which may be structural and or geometric properties of the binding_site typically the structural_descriptors are distributions of distances between different types of functional atoms of the binding_sites whereas the geometric descriptors include spin image merellithe inputs include a query binding_site and a database of binding_sites the outputs are similarity_scores between the query and the database binding_sites for each binding_site geometric features are extracted and assigned to the nearest visual word from a vocabulary which is generated by a huge set of features collected from the entire database thus each binding_site can be represented by a histogram of occurrence of visual words two binding_sites can be compared by the similarity of two visual words vectors a color version of this figure is available as supplementary d zernike shape distribution moment invariants and many others after generating surface features two binding_sites can be compared using various metric functions in the feature_space to perform high_throughput surface comparisons without explicit alignments existing featurebased methods mainly focus on proteinligand binding_sites which have not been extensively applied or evaluated on proteinprotein binding_site classification and related applications this is important as proteinprotein binding_sites are known to have some unique characteristics such as relatively large areas and flat binding_site surfaces to deal with very large_datasets one can employ the classic method from the information_retrieval area of comparing the similarity between word frequency profiles of two documents which has been successfully utilized in web search_engines recently this idea has been extended to the matching and retrieval of d objects in which a word is represented by a cluster of similar features in the bioinformatics area this technique has been applied in the alignment_free genome sequence_comparisons and in the retrieval of similar protein_structures in this article we further extend the text comparison method and propose a novel approach pbsword for characterizing protein binding_sites with a collection of visual words such that similar binding_sites from the database can be efficiently and accurately_identified we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of pbsword based classification and retrieval of protein binding_sites the experimental_results show that pbsword can achieve comparable_performance to an alignment based method ialign and significantly_outperforms a feature_based method using moment invariant descriptors more importantly comparing pbsword vectors is orders_of than the alignment_based thus pbsword can be used to quickly identify geometrically similar candidates of a query_protein binding_site from a large dataset to demonstrate the significance of this work we compare the performance to current methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency the current methods include an alignment based method ialign which is designed for ppi comparison based on the local substructures of subunits and a feature_based method mi which describes the geometric shape of a binding_site using a feature_vector based on moment invariants we apply pbsword ialign and mi to a non redundant dataset from scoppi to evaluate classification and retrieval_performance for proteinprotein binding_sites during the experiment a query dataset is selected and used to retrieve similar binding_sites from the entire database to evaluate classification_accuracy we use a general metric the correct classification rate ccr which is defined as follows in addition for each query we identify the top results whose scoppi group matches the querys group the ranks of these top results are then accumulated with summary_statistics reported we also use the auc area_under in the roc receiver_operator curve to measure how well each method identifies the other binding_sites from the querys group an auc of would correspond to perfect classification which would rank the binding_sites from the same group as the querys before all other binding_sites whereas an auc of would be expected for a random classifier
