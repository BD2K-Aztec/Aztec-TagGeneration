systems_biology tefma computing thermodynamically_feasible elementary_flux in metabolic_networks elementary_flux efms are important structural tools for the analysis of metabolic_networks it is known that many topologically feasible efms are biologically irrelevant therefore tools are needed to find the relevant ones we present thermodynamic tefm analysis tefma which uses the cellular metabolome to avoid the enumeration of thermodynamically infeasible efms specifically given a metabolic_network and a not necessarily complete metabo lome tefma efficiently returns the full set of thermodynamically_feasible efms consistent with the metabolome compared with standard_approaches tefma strongly reduces the memory_consumption and the overall runtime thus tefma provides a new way to analyze unbiasedly hitherto inaccessible large_scale metabolic_networks availability_and https an elementary_flux efm is a steady_state pathway that consists of an indivisible set of reactions efms permit a system wide analysis of metabolism and can be used to identify engineering targets different approaches were published to calculate efms in large metabolic_models for instance split a metabolic_network into subnetworks and calculated the efms for each subnetwork in parallel others only enumerated the set of the shortest efms or randomly_sampled the full set of efms a complete efm analysis for large genomescale models is still out of reach as the number of efms increases dramatically with the size of the metabolic_network requiring inhibitingly large computing_resources to tackle this problem the biological_relevance of efms needs to be taken into account as only a small set of efms are biologically_relevant therefore tools are necessary to find those subsets of biologically_relevant efms enumerated only those efms that were consistent with a given transcriptional_regulatory here we use a network embedded thermodynamic net analysis to detect and remove thermodynamically infeasible efms already during their enumeration thermodynamic efm analysis tefma applies the net principle and uses metabolite_concentrations and the compounds gibbs_energy of formation to determine the energy surface of an efm at a constant_pressure a biochemical_reaction only proceeds spontaneously if its gibbs_free of reaction is negative if the thermodynamic information is available for a reaction it can be tested for its thermodynamic feasibility tefma does not only analyze the feasibility of an isolated reaction but considers the gibbs_free of reaction for all reactions contributing to an efm tefma is computationally much more efficient than a sequential approach where an ordinary efm analysis is followed by a net analysis the reason for this is that tefma checks the feasibility of intermediate efms continuously and eliminates infeasible ones during the enumeration process this reduces the computational costs significantly by integrating the metabolite_concentrations into the efm enumeration we killed two birds with one stone first we strongly_reduced the memory_usage and the runtime of the efm enumeration second we got a step further to only calculate the set of biological relevant efms both points are essential to reach the final goal of calculating efms in large genome_scale models we stress that tefma greatly_reduces the computational costs thus an efm analysis of medium scale models become possible already on current high end personal_computers and no longer requires a dedicated high_performance environment numbers in brackets list the percentage compared to efma
