sequence_analysis accurate prediction of bacterial type_iv secreted effectors using amino_acid and pssm profiles motivation various human_pathogens secret effector_proteins into hosts cells via the type_iv t ss these proteins play_important in the interaction between bacteria and hosts computational_methods for t ss effector prediction have been developed for screening experimental targets in several isolated bacterial_species however widely_applicable prediction_approaches are still unavailable results in this work four types of distinctive_features namely amino_acid dipeptide composition position_specific composition and auto covariance transformation of position_specific were calculated from primary sequences a classifier t effpred was developed using the support_vector with these features and their different combinations for effector prediction various theoretical tests were performed in a newly_established dataset and the results were measured with four indexes we demonstrated that t effpred can discriminate iva and ivb effectors in benchmark_datasets with positive rates of and respectively the overall accuracy of shows that the present method is accurate for distinguishing the t ss effector in unidentified sequences a classifier ensemble was designed to synthesize all single classifiers notable performance improvement was observed using this ensemble system in benchmark tests to demonstrate the models application a genome_scale prediction of effectors was performed in bartonella_henselae an important zoonotic_pathogen a number of putative candidates were distinguished availability a web_server implementing the prediction method and the source_code are both available atbacterial pathogens translocate numerous effector_proteins into the extracellular_environment of host_cells via secretion_systems these proteins play_critical virulence and survival in gram_negative secretion_systems are classified into seven major evolutionarily and functionally_related subclasses termed types ivii in recent_years type_iii and type_iv t ss and t ss which allow injection of effectors directly into the host_cell cytoplasm have been widely_studied t ss consists of transmembrane multi protein_complexes and exists in many zoonotic_pathogens such as brucella sp bartonella_henselae coxiella_burnetii as well as in some other gram_negative such as bordetella_pertussis helicobacter_pylori and l pneumophila many t ss effectors including two main subtypes called iva and ivb have been confirmed to be involved in the pathogenicity of these species to adapt to different hosts and different survival strategies the arsenal of known effectors varies_widely across bacterial_species and even shows distinct differences between bacterial_strains recently a number of novel t ss effectors have been identified by experimental_approaches such as fusion_protein report assays in many of these studies previously_developed bioinformatics screening_strategies were adopted to predict effector candidates in genomic proteins before experimental translocation verification sequence_homology to known effectors and conserved domain analysis were used to detect putative effectors in the genome of brucella_abortus an omnibus method synthesizing hydropathy profile comparison eukaryotic domain search signal peptide_identification and sequence_similarity alignment was built to scan genomic_sequences of anaplasma_marginale for potential t ss effectors two approaches based on feature_extraction and machine_learning were developed for large_scale effector identification in l pneumophila and c burnetii respectively a hidden semi markov_model hsmm was constructed to describe c terminal patterns and predict type ivb secretion signals with high_accuracy established methods for detecting the regulatory_elements or c terminal translocation signals of eukaryotic_proteins were applied before screening of the experimental targets resulting in most of the t ss effectors being identified in l pneumophila the computational filters in these existing_methods successfully selected a small portion of the genomic proteins as candidates for experimental identification however these methods to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com are not exhaustive enough and are not generally_applicable for secretion signal_detection especially for modelling type iva signal homology_search based on sequence_alignment can only find candidates that are similar to known effectors scanning of regulatory_elements or c terminal signals relies on the known motifs in the sequences of effectors and their promoters which are conserved but specific to effector families furthermore all existing machine_learning are based on sequence_features from a small supply of known effectors from particular bacterial_species therefore they are often not accurate for genomic effector discovery in other bacterial_species there are experimentally_validated effectors in the known effectors stored in the secret database although several methods have reported excellent_performance in identifying t ss effectors in a wide_variety of bacterial_genomes they are not recommended for t ss effector prediction due to low accuracies accurate prediction_approaches that are widely_applicable to mining putative type iva or type ivb effectors in gram_negative are still absent several computational_approaches based on existing machine_learning e g naive_bayes hidden_markov artificial_neural and support_vector svm have successfully predicted t ss secreted signals however the accuracy of machine_learning approach depends on the quantities of authentic negative and positive samples studies identifying t ss effectors are abundant but those identifying t ss effectors are rare the two recently_published databases atlast ss and secret have announced freely_available datasets for t ss components and secreted_proteins these datasets provide numerous samples to train and optimize machine_learning for t ss effectors prediction in this article we propose a svm model using four types of features calculated from residue composition and position_specific pssm profiles the machine_learning model is trained on a set of experimentally_validated t ss effectors and non effectors and is used to provide accurate_predictions of t ss secreted_proteins in evolutionarily distinct bacteria we demonstrate that our model can discriminate between iva effectors or ivb effectors and non effectors with an accuracy of or via leave one tests to the best of our knowledge this is the first method to predict iva effectors in gram_negative genomic_scale prediction of effectors in the zoonotic_pathogen b henselae is also performed and discussed a list of predicted candidates from b henselae may be of academic interest in studying human pathogenic_bacteria the prediction of effectors in bacterial_genomes is an important task for functional analysis of the t ss of human_pathogens comparison of roc_curves for ivb effector prediction using different features the results obtained from amino_acid aac residue pair composition dpc pssm composition pssm and auto covariance transformation of pssm profiles pssm ac as well as the combination of aac and dpc aacdpc the combination of aac and pssm pssmaac the combination of aac and pssm ac pssm aac and the combination of two pssm feature classes pssm pssm ac are shown as color curves a five fold_cross tests in t using four single_feature classes b fold_cross tests in t using four combined feature classesprevious studies demonstrated that t ss effectors in several bacterial_species contained conserved c terminal signals and eukaryotic domains differences in gc_content between the effector_genes and the non effector_genes were also discovered xu et_al reported a hidden_markov model_based to evaluate the distribution pattern of epiya motifs in a broad range of biological species to predict potential t ss effectors but this motif was not widely_distributed from t ss secreted_proteins burstein et_al presented a machine_learning based on known features to predict candidates for genome_wide effector identification in l pneumophila this approach was effective for screening experimental targets but was specific to certain well known bacterial_species because few general_features exist for extensive prediction the hsmm model presented by lifshitz et_al captured ivb secreted signals with a high success_rate but was not usable for the detection of iva effectors we developed a widely_applicable method for accurate prediction of different subtypes of t ss effectors in gram_negative to accomplish this we calculated accs residue pair compositions pssm profiles and their auto covariance transformations we used these features to train svm based predictors for discrimination of effectors from non effectors to assess the performance of our prediction system two reusable datasets were constructed for experimentally_validated effectors and potential non effectors acc analysis showed that hydrophobic_residues especially aliphatic ala gly and val occur with higher_frequencies in non effectors than in effectors on the contrary hydrophilic and polar_residues are more common components of effector sequences as most of the known secreted_proteins exist in aqueous environments such as the cytoplasm of host_cells residue pairs with hydrophilic residues would be expected to have higher compositions in effectors than in non effectors we inferred that some hydrophilic and polar_groups may be important for effector_protein functions performance tests showed that two classes of pssm based features were more helpful for discrimination of effectors than using acc the pssm revealed remote relevance between function related proteins this relevance was conserved throughout evolution although amino_acids continuously mutated for the two pssm feature classes that we used pssm composition indicated the position specific information of each amino_acid type in the query_sequence on the other hand auto covariance transformation of the pssm described the sequence_order positionspecific information the former method performed better than the latter method in benchmark tests feature combination is a frequently used approach for improving classification_performance we combined four different feature_vectors and found that more accurate results were produced using vector combinations the prediction_accuracy for ivb effectors was higher than for iva effectors this can be attributed to different numbers of positive samples and more abundant signals within ivb sequences such as c terminal motifs which are more informative than the known motifs in iva effectors we noticed that taxonomic and functional biases in the training data impacted the assessment and application of our method in t iva sequences were derived from the genomic proteins of nine species i e a marginale anaplasma_phagocytophilum bartonella sp h pylori agrobacterium tumefacien agrobacterium_rhizogenes brucella sp b pertussis and e chaffeensis ivb effectors were selected from l pneumophila and c burnetii the taxonomic distribution of iva sequences showed no obvious bias but bias was present for ivb sequences although all the effectors were experimentally_validated to be secreted by t ss the functions of most of them in host_cells have not been identified therefore the functional bias of these effectors is still unknown to reduce bias for negative sequences we collected non effectors through multiple_channels though biases in datasets are inevitable the results of theoretical validations in several datasets showed that our predictor was both accurate and robust for distinguishing t ss effectors this indicates that our method may be useful for iva effector prediction in various t ss pathogens but should be restricted to legionella sp coxiella sp and their related species for ivb effector prediction it is noteworthy that characteristic signals exist in both some t ss effectors and some t ss effectors which may have similar amino_acid distributions and evolutionary_conservation profiles thus the present method may not completely discriminate between t ss effectors and those secreted through the t ss we improved the prediction_accuracy using multi classifier ensembles with simple voting strategies the in voting and in voting systems are linear discrimination systems that use condition relaxation therefore accurate prediction does not indicate identical prediction_performance in pathogenic genomes accurate discrimination of effectors in bacterial_genomes is the ultimate_goal of developing these prediction_models the prediction results for the b henselae genome demonstrate that our method is effective at distinguishing unknown t ss effectors from genomic_sequences a small list of predicted candidates will help to easily confirm experimental targets in the b henselae genome seven genes_encoding known effector_proteins were all predicted by our classifier ensemble furthermore several proteins located at bh bh and bh bh were repeatedly predicted as positives by multi classifiers indicating strong potential t ss effectors in supplementary table s out of putative t ss candidates are annotated as hypothetical proteins in the b henselae genome the left three are inferred to be relevant to t ss from bartonella most homologs of these proteins in gram_negative are still uncharacterized and the annotated information in available public_databases shows some of the candidates are most likely secreted_proteins a maximum_likelihood phylogenic tree was constructed to reveal the evolutionary_relationship between the iva effectors and the inferred effectors using muscle and mega supplementary conversely no phylogenic trees for ivb effectors could be established by any evolutionary algorithms because no common sites in these sequences were found when computing the distances supplementaryshows that several distinct groups yp yp yp and yp were formed by multiple predicted effectors and an embedded iva protein the seven known effectors of b henselae were grouped in a sub tree sharing a most_recent with bh and displaying close_relationships to the putative effector bh the arrangement of each branch in the tree indicates that the predicted effectors in each sub tree were most likely captured by our model based on the evolutionary_information of their nearest iva effectors we hope that these predicted effectors may serve as a useful resource for the research_community by taking_into all of our results and analyses we can conclude that the present method can detect t ss effectors within unidentified sequences with great power as the features used in our system are sequence_based and are commonly calculated across both genus and species we believe that our method can be widely used for t ss effector screening for confirmed pathogens as well as for other gram_negative bacterial_species
