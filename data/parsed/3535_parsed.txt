systems_biology phosphochain a novel algorithm to predict kinase and phosphatase networks from high_throughput expression data motivation protein_phosphorylation is critical for regulating cellular_activities by controlling protein activities localization and turnover and by transmitting information within cells through signaling_networks however predictions of protein_phosphorylation and signaling_networks remain a significant challenge lagging behind predictions of transcriptional_regulatory into which they often feed results we developed phosphochain to predict kinases phosphat ases and chains of phosphorylation_events in signaling_networks by combining mrna_expression levels of regulators and targets with a motif_detection algorithm and optional prior information phosphochain correctly reconstructed of the yeast mitogen_activated from publicly_available data when tested on yeast phosphoproteomic data from large_scale mass_spectrometry experiments phosphochain correctly_identified more phosphorylation_sites than existing motif detection_tools netphosyeast and gps and predictions of kinasephosphatase interactions overlapped with of known interactions present in yeast databases phosphochain provides a valuable framework for predicting condition specific phosphorylation_events from high_throughput data availability phosphochain is implemented_in and available atprotein post_translational ptms enable proteins to rapidly switch from one state to another signaling_networks exploit this feature to transmit information from the cytoplasm and outside the cell to the genome by interfacing with transcription_factors which themselves form complex gene_regulatory in comparison with gene_regulatory our understanding and prediction of signaling_networks is undeveloped yet critical to a systems view of complex regulatory dynamics protein_phosphorylation is by far the most commonly_studied and predominant post_translational of signaling_networks moreover phosphorylation of signaling proteins is fundamental to cellular_responses health and disease kinases and phosphatases which are responsible for adding and removing phosphates from proteins are common drug_targets the vast_majority of existing_tools for predicting phosphorylation_events tend to focus on predicting phosphorylation_sites from amino_acid this approach is limited because kinases and phosphatases tend to act on many of the same sites and thus it is not clear which factors are active under which conditions therefore we sought to include activity data to improve the predictability of phosphorylation_events and to reconstruct signaling_networks studies of signaling_networks in both yeast and mammalian_cells reveal that the expression of genes_encoding kinases often increases with the activation of the signaling_pathway suggesting that expression might be a predictor of signaling_network activities similarly high_throughput phosphoproteomics studies using biochemical enrichment and mass_spectrometry have led to large experimentally_validated proteomic databases annotating phosphorylation on target_proteins these data map the potential changes of protein activities and can be used to predict new phosphorylation_events and phosphorylation driven regulatory_networks therefore we developed a tool called phosphochain which includes condition specific regulatory information i e kinase and phosphatase activities or proxies thereof to predict ptm regulatory_events and signaling_network activities in comparison with other phosphorylation prediction_tools supplementary only regphos and her module included activity data and regphos only used it to verify their predictions phosphochain works by constructing an alternating decision_tree adtree containing nodes that predict whether a kinase or phosphatase is active as well as the activities of target_proteins based on protein activity patterns and phosphorylation sequence to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as motifs that occur in multiple experiments here we apply phosphochain to the yeast mapk mitogen_activated network as a test case and on a genome_wide scale to predict the entire kinase phosphatase transcription_factor regulatory_network in yeast the decision_tree provides three biologically_relevant predictions i given the measured activity for a few factors it predicts the activity levels for many targets ii it predicts the target_sequence for factors kinases or phosphatases and iii it predicts the chain of post_translational such as in the mapk_pathway that are responsible for downstream transcriptional changes phosphochain is built on the hypothesis that proxies for pa can be used in conjunction with detection and prediction of that describes which kinases and phosphatases acting at specific binding_sites affect the activity of a target protein phosphochain generates rules based on pa measurements and the presence of putative template kinase and phosphatase binding_motifs e g hog is activated and a hog binding_motif is present that predicts the activity level of a target protein e g ste pa levels are estimated from mrna_expression levels in genome_wide expression studies involving genetic_perturbations phosphochain works by iteratively adding good rules to a master list of rules that together lead to a single strong hypothesis phosphochain accepts as input a pa matrix that contains activity measurements for a set of proteins p across a set of experiments e panel i for example to reconstruct the mapk_pathway p is a dataset containing genes_encoding kpt and e contains mrna_expression experiments in which mapk related factors have been deleted including some experiments in which multiple genes were deleted van each experiment is correlated with da measurements for the proteins when the factors f i e known kinases and phosphatases are perturbed to produce an frm for these experiments the da matrix includes proteins and a dataset with perturbations of kinases and phosphatases kp if a da matrix is not available then a subset of the pa matrix containing activity levels for all factors f may be used instead however including prior information through a da matrix is particularly important when using mrna_expression data because it is not the ideal proxy for post_translational related activity similarly phosphochain accepts as input protein_sequences p panel i shows how an sasm is used to generate template consensus motifs n that encapsulate all known target motifs m present on these sequences a boolean mm is then generated that encodes which of the target_proteins contain one or more of the jnj motifs phosphochain then generates a separate tree for each of the target_proteins as shown in panel i the algorithm generates conditions that combine the frm and mm to produce a cm that identifies which conditions are satisfied e g factor is active and template motif is present these conditions are evaluated for each of the jej experiments to produce the cm which is paired with a class vector the class vector represents the activity level for each target protein p during each experiment based on mrna_levels phosphochain then iteratively constructs an adtree by evaluating all jcj conditions panel ii and adding that rule that minimizes a weighted loss function thus phosphochain selects the best rule for predicting ps activity level across all experiments panel ii the experiments are then re weighted so those misclassified by the previously added rule contribute more toward the subsequent rule selected in the next iteration panel ii after t iterations the resulting adtree predicts the activity level of a single protein across all conditions thus each tree predicts the activity level for one protein panel iii and the factors and motifs that contribute to the final activity level panel iii this procedure is repeated for all target_proteins in p and a complete signaling_network is reconstructed by chaining multiple trees together panel iii this is accomplished by simply ordering the predictions of each protein the resulting network includes all predictions thus emphasizing completeness and revealing potential complex network_structure notably during a given experiment only some of the conditions may be satisfied thus phosphochain also predicts condition specific regulation to test phosphochains performance and the relative importance of its components we compared phosphochain to i phosphochain which is phosphochain without the da matrix ii medusa which is the inspiration for phosphochain and is designed to detect transcriptional_regulation and iii adtree which is essentially phosphochain without binding_motifs we tested these algorithms abilities to reconstruct the phosphorylation related portion of the four well studied yeast mapk_pathways shown in supplementary phosphochain was trained using mrna_expression data as pa measurements for gene_deletion experiments van which included deletions of genes that encode the kinases and phosphatases present in the mapk_pathway we used fold_cross to evaluate the cutoff parameters for the frm and mm and to compare phosphochain with other tools the results demonstrate that phosphochain accurately_predicts mrna_expression and that accuracy was stable for nearly all cutoffs supplementary
