a statistical_approach for inferring the d structure of the genome motivation recent_technological allow the measurement in a single hi c experiment of the frequencies of physical contacts among pairs of genomic_loci at a genome_wide scale the next challenge is to infer from the resulting dnadna contact_maps accurate d models of how chromosomes fold and fit into the nucleus many existing inference methods rely on multidimensional_scaling mds in which the pairwise_distances of the inferred model are optimized to resemble pairwise_distances derived directly from the contact counts these approaches however often optimize a heuristic objective_function and require strong assumptions about the biophysics of dna to transform interaction frequencies to spatial distance and thereby may lead to incorrect structure reconstruction methods we propose a novel approach to infer a consensus d structure of a genome from hi c data the method incorporates a statistical_model of the contact counts assuming that the counts between two loci follow a poisson_distribution whose intensity decreases with the physical distances between the loci the method can automatically adjust the transfer function_relating the spatial distance to the poisson intensity and infer a genome_structure that best explains the observed data results we compare two variants of our poisson method with or without optimization of the transfer_function to four different mds based algorithmstwo metric mds methods using different stress functions a non metric version of mds and chromsde a recently described advanced mds methodon a wide_range of simulated_datasets we demonstrate that the poisson_models reconstruct better structures than all mds based_methods particularly at low coverage and high_resolution and we highlight the importance of optimizing the transfer_function on publicly_available hi c data from mouse_embryonic we show that the poisson methods lead to more reproducible structures than mds based_methods when we use data generated using different restriction_enzymes and when we reconstruct structures at different resolutions availability_and a python implementation of the proposed method is available atspatial and temporal d genome_architecture is thought to play_an in many genomic functions but is still poorly_understood van in recent_years the technique of chromosome_conformation c which identifies physical contacts between different genomic_loci and yields information about their relative spatial distance in the nucleus has paved the way for the systematic analysis of the d structure of dna coupled with highthroughput_sequencing genome_wide conformation capture assays broadly referred to as hi c have emerged as promising techniques to investigate the global structure of dna at various resolutions hi c has opened new avenues to understanding many biological_processes including gene_regulation dna_replication somatic copy_number and epigenetic changes a typical hi c experiment yields a dna contact_map that is a matrix indicating the frequency of interactions between all pairs of loci at a given resolution a fundamental_question is then to reconstruct the d structure of the genome from this contact_map two general approaches have been proposed for that purpose i consensus methods that aim at inferring a unique mean structure representative of the data and ii ensemble methods that yield a population of structures consensus approaches model each chromosome by a chain of beads convert the contact_map frequencies into pairwise_distances which we refer as wish distances using various biophysical models of dna and infer a d conformation that best matches the pairwise_distances by solving a multidimensional_scaling mds problem converting interaction counts to physical wish distances requires however strong assumptions that are not always met in practice for example this mapping may change from one organism to another from one resolution to another from one genomic_distance range to another or from one time point to another during the cell_cycle to alleviate this problem proposed chromsde a method that jointly optimizes the d structure and a parameter of the function that maps contact frequencies to spatial distances in addition to modifying the objective_function of mds proposed an approach akin to non metric mds nmds where the d structure and the wish distances are alternatingly optimized in an attempt to preserve coherence between the ranking of pairwise_distances and the ranking of pairwise contact frequencies as for the ensemble methods describe two formal probabilistic_models of contact frequencies and their relationship with physical distances they then use a markov_chain mcmc sampling procedure to produce an ensemble of d structures consistent with the observed contact counts propose an optimization framework that generates a population of structures by enforcing each contact to define an active constraint in only a fraction of the inferred structures thereby mimicking to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the

please_contact permissions_oup com the heterogeneity of contacts coming from each cell in the hi c sample applying a similar method to budding_yeast demonstrate that a large population of structures inferred using known physical constraints of yeast genome_architecture can recapitulate to a large extent the consensus contact_map observed from hi c experiments both consensus and ensemble models have benefits and limitations ensemble approaches are biologically more accurate because hi c data are derived from a population of cells each with potentially a unique d architecture an inferred population of d structures may therefore better reflect the diversity of structures than a single consensus structure in concordance with such ensemble methods a recent development in hi c technology assaying chromatin conformation at a single_cell level demonstrates that chromatin_structure varies highly from cell to cell by modeling the single_copy x chromosomes of a male mouse cell_line however an ensemble approach raises the question of interpretability one often has to fall back to interpreting a mean signal from the population_structure or to selecting a few structures representative in some way of the diversity of the population consensus methods in contrast provide a single structure more amenable to visual_inspection and analysis this structure can be seen as a useful model to recapitulate the rich_information captured in hi c data and to allow easy integration with other sources of data such as rna_seq which are usually also population_based in addition despite the stochasticity of cell to cell variations certain hallmarks of genome_organization observed by consensus methods such as chromosome_territories or topological domain_organization are conserved across different cells computationally ensemble methods are more demanding than consensus methods because they need to sample from a large dimensional_space of possible structures with complicated likelihood landscapes optimization based consensus methods are usually faster to converge to a local optimum but may miss the global optimum corresponding to the best structure when the objective_function is non convex in this work we focus on the consensus approach and we propose a new method to infer a d structure from hi c data we propose to replace the arbitrary loss function minimized by existing mds based_approaches by a better motivated likelihood_function derived from a statistical_model similar to the one used by a previous ensemble_method specifically our proposed method models the interaction frequency between two loci by a poisson_model pm the intensity of which decreases with the increasing spatial distance between the pair of loci similar to the problem of inferring the wish distances from interaction frequencies faced by mds based_approaches our model faces the difficulty of transforming spatial distances into intensities of the poisson_distribution to solve this problem we propose two variant methods the first method pm uses a default transfer_function motivated by a biophysical_model whereas the second method pm uses a parametric family of transfer_functions the parameters of which are automatically optimized together with the d structure to best explain the observed data we compare both pm variants to four mds based_methods including metric mds with two stress functions nmds and chromsde we demonstrate on simulated_data that the new models reconstruct more accurate d structures than all mdsbased methods especially at low coverage and high_resolution we also assess the negative effect of using an incorrect transfer_function and we show that pm is able to overcome this difficulty on real_data we show that compared with mds based_methods pm and pm generate more similar models when applied to replicate experiments performed with different restriction_enzymes or when applied to the same data at varying resolutions the results suggest that the pm methods we describe here provide promising alternatives to current methods for consensus dna_structure inference to assess the relative_strength of our new pm based_methods pm and pm we compare them to a panel of four mds based_methods mds mds nmds and chromsde on simulated_and
