pathwayaccess celldesigner plugins for pathway_databases celldesigner provides a user_friendly interface for graphical biochemical_pathway description many pathway_databases are not directly exportable to celldesigner models pathwayaccess is an extensible suite of celldesigner plugins which connect celldesigner directly to pathway_databases using respective java_application programming interfaces the process is streamlined for creating new pathwayaccess plugins for specific pathway_databases three pathwayaccess plugins metnetaccess biocycaccess and reactomeaccess directly connect celldesigner to the pathway_databases metnetdb biocyc and reactome pathwayaccess plugins enable celldesigner users to expose pathway data to analytical celldesigner functions curate their pathway_databases and visually integrate pathway data from different databases using standard systems_biology and systems_biology availability implemented_in pathwayaccess plugins run with celldesigner version and were tested on ubuntu linux windows xp and and macosx source_code binaries documentation and video walkthroughs are freely_available atcelldesigner is a tool for graphically building biochemical pathway_models which integrate model representation by systems_biology sbml with graphical_representation by systems_biology sbgn there exist many databases providing application_programming api libraries enabling programmatic queries these api libraries include many biologically_meaningful objects which carry out intuitive functions for example a pathway object can report the set of reaction objects it contains a protein complex object can report the monomer objects that contsruct it and a metabolite object might report its smiles and inchi codes the problem is that a pathway object in one api is not the same as a pathway object in the api of a different database the same biological concept is represented using independently developed in silico representations preventing any single application from communicating and integrating across databases to whom correspondence should be addressed
