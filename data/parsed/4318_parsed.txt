snv ppilp refined snv calling for tumor data using perfect phylogenies and ilp motivation recent_studies sequenced tumor_samples from the same progenitor at different development stages and showed that by taking_into the phylogeny of this development single_nucleotide snv calling can be improved accurate snv calls can better reveal early_stage tumors identify mechanisms of cancer_progression or help in drug_targeting results we present snv ppilp a fast and easy to use tool for refining gatks unified genotyper snv calls for multiple samples assumed to form a phylogeny we tested snv ppilp on simulated_data with a varying number of samples snvs read_coverage and violations of the perfect phylogeny assumption we always match or improve the accuracy of gatk with a significant_improvement on low read_coverage recent_studies on cancer tissue suggest that as the disease progresses the original tumor progresses into several different sub clones these sub clones contain not only the original mutations but also new mutations added over time this work focuses on single_nucleotide snvs accurate snv calls can better reveal early_stage tumors identify mechanisms of cancer_progression or help in drug_targeting this phylogenetic assumption has been recently taken into account in by proposing a tool for refining the snv calling of gatks unified genotyper the state of the art snv multi sample caller for next_generation data in this note we present snv ppilp snv calling with perfect phylogenies and integer_linear a tool for refining gatks unified genotyper snv calls for multiple samples we assume these samples form a character based phylogeny the characters being the snvs reported by gatk as in we work with the perfect phylogeny model however we have a new problem formulation for fitting gatks calls to such a phylogeny which we solve exactly using integer_linear ilp snv ppilp can be run especially on low coverage samples without big violations of the perfect phylogeny model for a significant_improvement in accuracy six or more samples are needed
