locnes a computational_tool for locating classical ness in crm cargo_proteins motivation classical nuclear_export signals ness are short cognate peptides that direct proteins out of the nucleus via the crm mediated export pathway crm regulates the localization of hundreds of macromolecules involved in various cellular_functions and diseases due to the diverse and complex nature of ness reliable prediction of the signal remains a challenge despite several attempts made in the last decade results we present a new nes predictor locnes locnes scans query proteins for nes consensus fitting peptides and assigns these peptides probability scores using support_vector model whose feature_set includes amino_acid disorder propensity and the rank of position_specific score locnes demonstrates both higher sensitivity and precision over existing nes prediction_tools upon comparative_analysis using experimentally_identified ness active_transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm controls the localization and functions of many proteins and rnas the majority of nuclear cytoplasmic transport of macromolecules is mediated by nuclear_transport receptors of the karyopherin b kap family which bind nuclear_localization or export signals nlss or ness in their cargoes crm for chromosome_region maintenance also known as exportin or xpo is the best characterized export kap or exportin approximately broadly functioning protein cargoes for crm have been experimentally_identified and compiled into three separate databases nesbase nesdb and many crm cargoes participate in important_cellular such as gene_expression signal_transduction immune_response and cell_differentiation aberrant crm mediated nuclear_export causes diseases such as cancer viral and inflammatory_diseases cognate peptide segments in protein cargoes that bind crm are known as classical nuclear_export signals or ness previously also known as leucine rich ness nes peptides are usually amino_acids with regularly_spaced conserved hydrophobic_residues the first nes consensus of l x x l xwas established from results of in vivo nes randomization selection assays subsequently la cour et_al re defined the nes consensus as u x u x u x u leu val ile phe or met x stands for any amino_acid according to alignment of experimentally defined ness thereafter shortened as experimental ness collected in inclusion of additional hydrophobic_residues significantly_increased the nes consensus coverage kosugi et_al further expanded the nes consensus through analysis of distinct nes peptides obtained from a random_peptide screen the kosugi set of consensus_sequences included four previously_defined patterns termed nes classes a d class a u x u x u x u class b u x u x u x u class c u x u x u x u class d u x u x u x u and two new patterns class u x u x u x u class u x u x u x u to describe additional spacings between key hydrophobic_residues of their nes peptides the set of consensus_sequences also allowed ala thr cys or trp to occur only once at hydrophobic positions of an nes crystal_structures of crm bound to ness from pkia snurportin and the hiv rev protein revealed that ness bind directly to a groove on the convex surface of crm the nes groove contains five hydrophobic pockets that accommodate conserved hydrophobic nes residues the pkia lalklagldi class a and snurportin meelsqalassfsv class c ness adopt a helical conformations at their n termini and transition to loops at the c termini when bound to crm in contrast the crm bound rev nes lpplerltl class adopts an extended conformation examination of crm nes interactions led to a structure based consensus which adds a fifth hydrophobic position at the nterminus of the nes u as modulator of crm nes binding_affinities of the different proposed nes consensus patterns the kosugi set of consensus_sequences has the highest sensitivity with coverage of experimental ness versus for the la cour consensus however the precision rate of the kosugi consensus is low compared to for the la cour consensus the generally low precision rates of the different consensus are probably due to degeneracy of the consensus patterns which describe the turn amphipathic helix that is ubiquitous in the proteome we refined the kosugi consensus_sequences based on analysis of experimental ness collected in nesdb the refined consensus only marginally improved the prediction precision suggesting that nes consensus_sequences alone are insufficient to accurately locate ness in crm cargoes several computational_tools have been developed to predict classical ness a predictor named nes finder http research nki nl fornerodlab nes finder htm was the first available web_server to identify sequence_motifs that fit a subset of nes consensus classes a b and d elm is another pattern matching method although it uses different regular expressions to define ness is the first nes predictor that does not explicitly use consensus patterns la instead it employs machine_learning like neural_networks nn and hidden_markov hmm and relies only on protein_sequence as features netnes integrates the outputs of nn and hmm trained with experimental ness in nesbase to assign a score to each residue in the input protein netnes increased prediction precision to at the cost of lowering the maximum recall_rate to more recently the nes predictor nessential applied simplified consensus patterns to the query_sequence as a pre filter followed by support_vector svm classification that incorporates both sequence and biophysical features such as predicted intrinsic_disorder secondary_structure and solvent accessibilities nessential achieved better precision at lower recall levels when tested with experimental ness collected in validness for example at recall level nessential increased precision by compared with netnes in a nes prediction_tool named wregex was published like nessential wregex scans the query with regular expressions to generate a list of nes candidates a position_specific pssm is then used to compute a score for these candidates comparison between nessential and wregex using nes motifs in human deubiquitinases dubs showed that wregex produces fewer nes candidates than nessential however since wregex does not incorporate predicted biophysical features it takes less time to predict ness in this study we present a new computational_tool named locnes to locate classical ness in crm cargoes locnes first ranks the nes consensus fitting peptides according to its pssm score the pssm score rank protein_sequence consensus pattern and disorder propensity are used as feature_set of a svm model locnes was tested with a large set of experimental ness and showed improved_performance over existing nes prediction_methods locnes is a supervised machine_learning algorithm to predict ness in potential crm cargoes locnes integrates the rank of pssm score peptide_sequence disorder propensity and nes consensus type into an svm model performance comparison between locnes and two latest nes predictors nessential and wregex using two separate test datasets showed that locnes achieved higher_precision at most recall levels with more than increase of auc value than nessential locnes produced at least higher maximum recall_rate than wregex in addition locnes is the only tool that can predict class ness with over recall_rate at the default threshold
