systems_biology a coherent feedforward loop design principle to sustain robustness of biological_networks motivation many studies have investigated the relationship between structural_properties and dynamic behaviors in biological_networks in particular feedback_loop fbl and feedforward loop ffl structures have received a great_deal one interesting and common property of fbl and ffl structures is their coherency of coupling however the role of coherent ffls in relation to network robustness is not fully known whereas that of coherent fbls has been well established results to establish that coherent ffls are abundant in biological_networks we examined gene regulatory and signaling_networks and found that ffls are ubiquitous and are in a coherently coupled form this result was also observed in the species based signaling_networks that are integrated from kegg_database by using a random boolean_network we demonstrated that these coherent ffls can improve network robustness against update rule perturbations in particular we found that coherent ffls increase robustness because these structures induce downstream nodes to be robust against update rule perturbations therefore coherent ffls can be considered as a design principle of human signaling_networks that improve network robustness against update rule perturbations cellular_dynamics are largely controlled by various topological motifs included in large_scale biological_networks which are represented by a huge number of interactions among biological_components such as genes proteins mirnas and other small_molecules one of these topological motifs is a feedback_loop fbl structure and its effects on dynamics have been widely investigated for example it was shown that more robust networks tend to have larger numbers of positive fbls and smaller numbers of negative fbls and the number of fbls involving a node is positively correlated with the functional_importance of the node it was also shown that two diseases are more likely to be comorbid if the genes associated with each disease are connected with fbls of a relatively short_length in a human signaling_network these observations were validated as a design principle of biological_networks through extensive simulations based on computational_models in addition the role of fbls was also investigated in some specific biological_processes for example interlinked fast and slow positive fbls drive reliable cell decisions interlinked positive_and fbls sustain the robustness of biological oscillation and fbls play_important in modulating p pathway in individual cells another well known motif is the feedforward loop ffl structure that has also been investigated for its effects on network_dynamics for example specific ffls are needed for robust carbohydrate uptake in escherichia_coli as well as for adaptation to variations in the critical morphogen level where cell_fate is switched in addition a simple ffl motif composed of three genes was capable of processing external signals robustly and the degree to which an ffl consisting of three positive transcriptional_regulators was sensitive to primary level perturbation was related to the robustness one interesting structural property common to fbls and ffls is coherent coupling when a pair of fbls or ffls of the same sign is coupled this is called a coherent coupling seefor an illustrative example some previous_studies that an individual coherent structure can play_an in the dynamic_behavior of biological_networks for example showed that a coherent ffl serves as a sign sensitive delay element in transcription networks andshowed that a coherent ffl prolongs flagella expression in escherichia_coli on the other hand showed that a coupled positive fbl enhances signal_amplification and bi stable characteristics whereas a coupled negative fbl realize enhanced homeostasis in particular we note a previous study that showed that coherently coupled fbls can be a design principle in a human signaling_network as they make the network more robust this result led us to question about whether the coherent ffl is also an important design principle for robustness related dynamics like the coherent fbls in biological_networks thus in this study we investigate the relationship between robustness related dynamics and the coherent ffl structure through extensive simulations a biological_network such as a gene regulatory or signaling_network can be represented by computational_models among them the boolean_network can be used to analyze the to whom correspondence should be addressed complex dynamics of biological_networks because it provides the most simplified representation for the network state le and kwon a thus we used the boolean_network for the dynamics analysis before examining how the dynamics are related to the coherent ffls we first showed that ffls are ubiquitously found in gene regulatory and signaling_networks and further that they are more likely to form a coherent structure than randomly expected in addition we examined a large set of signaling_networks of species integrated from the kegg_pathway and showed that there is a larger number of coherent ffls than randomly expected in each of species in other words coherent ffls are frequently observed motifs in biological_networks to unravel the role of these coherent ffls we examined the robustness against initial_state or update rule perturbations through the boolean_network to this end two groups of random networks were generated and classified according to the degree of coherency of the ffls through extensive simulations we observed that the networks with relatively high coherency of ffls are more robust against update rule perturbations than those with relatively low coherency of ffls whereas there is little difference between them in terms of robustness against initial_state perturbations in addition we found that coherent ffls can make downstream nodes robust against update rule perturbations and this induces the difference in robustness against update rule perturbations in summary coherent ffls seem to be a design principle to efficiently sustain robust behavior against update rule perturbations in biological_networks
