estimation of pairwise sequence_similarity of mammalian enhancers with word neighbourhood counts motivation the identity of cells and tissues is to a large degree governed by transcriptional_regulation a major part is accomplished by the combinatorial binding of transcription_factors at regulatory_sequences such as enhancers even though binding of transcription_factors is sequence specific estimating the sequence_similarity of two functionally_similar enhancers is very difficult however a similarity measure for regulatory_sequences is crucial to detect and understand functional_similarities between two enhancers and will facilitate large_scale analyses like clustering prediction and classification of genome_wide datasets results we present the standardized alignment_free sequence_similarity measure n a flexible framework that is defined for word neighbourhoods we explore the usefulness of adding reverse complement words as well as words including mismatches into the neighbourhood on simulated enhancer sequences as well as functional enhancers in mouse development n is shown to outperform previous alignment_free measures n is flexible faster than competing_methods and less susceptible to single_sequence noise and the occurrence of repetitive_sequences experiments on the mouse enhancers reveal that enhancers active in different tissues can be separated by pairwise_comparison using n conclusion n represents an improvement over previous alignment_free similarity_measures without compromising speed which makes it a good candidate for large_scale sequence comparison of regulatory_sequences availability the software is part of the open_source c library seqan www seqan de and a compiled version can be downloaded at http www seqan de projects alf html contact mammalian organisms consist of several hundred different cell_types every cell has the same repertoire of genes however only a subset will be expressed to enable cell_type phenotypes many different factors regulate_gene of which genetically_encoded transcriptional_regulation seems to whom correspondence should be addressed to play the major part sequence_dependent gene_regulation is mainly achieved through the binding of transcription_factors at short dna motifs these transcription_factor often occur in regulatory clusters in the genome called cis_regulatory crms some crms can repress_transcription whereas others referred to as enhancers can enhance gene_expression studies in drosophila showed that the combination of binding_sites together with the set of transcription_factors actively recruited to a crm determines its cell_type specificity more generally_speaking regulatory_sequences with a similar binding_site content can be expected to drive similar expression_patterns this is analogous to coding_sequences where sequence_similarity has been used for many years to estimate functional_similarity the pairwise similarity of coding_sequences is usually computed using global or local_alignments this approach works well for sequences which are at least partially alignable however this is not the case for nonhomologous crms the location and orientation of binding_sites in crms that show similar cell_type activity may differ widely making it impossible to produce alignments alignment_free compare sequences according to their word content see for an overview the initial purpose was to design a fast and accurate measure of pairwise dis similarity that could be used in databases where traditional alignments were too slow in the meantime alignment_free have been applied in other contexts such as phylogeny and motif_finding the idea to describe a sequence by its word content directly fits the model of crms where we assume that a similar function is reflected in a similar binding_site content word count based_methods have been used to compare regulatory_sequences however these methods calculate the similarity of sequences based on exact word counts whereas transcription_factor are generally more flexible patterns furthermore the genomic orientation of crms and of the binding_sites within is most often unknown highlighting the need to compare sequences according to the word counts on both strands simultaneously as an example the word w cataat might be bound by the same transcription_factor as the words cttaat and attatg the former having one substitution the latter being on the reverse strand exact word comparison methods consider these words dissimilar more generally let n w bein this study we showed that n improves alignment_free through its flexible extension to word neighbourhood counts thereby covering approximate and orientation independent word_matches previously the d z_score has been extended to allow for approximate matching words using estimates for the expectations and the variances based on a bernoulli background model however no implementation is available the framework that we present here is much more general and powerful we allow for any desired word neighbourhood and associate words with weights such that the signal of words matching exactly is not lost furthermore n can be computed on any background model order which is essential to properly describe genomic_sequences finally n is much faster than d z even without approximate matching suggesting that a z_score calculation for an approximate d score would be infeasible for any dataset of realistic size page the differences between n as used in this study and d are mainly due to the estimation of the background model the better performance of d suggests that the concatenation of the sequences improves the accuracy of the background model however it drastically increases the running time here we observe that the improvement due to the extension to the word neighbourhood n versus n mm rc is better than the improvement due to different background model estimates n versus d with simulation_studies we showed that n performs well on the task it was designed for namely finding similarities between sequences based on shared words importantly n is also able to measure similarity of in vivo identified enhancer sequences this allows us to verify and increase our understanding of the architecture of regulatory_elements word count_based similarity_measures are able to detect tissue_specific activity of enhancers suggesting that crms contain scattered binding_sites that contribute to their tissue_specificity extending the word neighbourhood to the reverse complement n rc improves the performance showing that binding_sites can occur on both strands of the crm extending the neighbourhood to words with one mismatch n rc mm further improves the performance on experimentally_identified enhancers this suggests that there are subtle signals like a common content of similar but not equal words which are characteristic of genomic enhancers in this study we have presented n a novel alignment_free measure of sequence_similarity that overcomes the limitations imposed by traditional exact word count based_methods we have included the general_concept of weighted word neighbourhood counts and shown that it improves the ability to detect similarity between regulatory_sequences the task of pairwise_comparison of regulatory_sequences is much harder than traditional pairwise_alignment since only very few shared words might lead to a similar activity we have demonstrated on a large_scale dataset of mammalian enhancer sequences that pairwise sequence_similarity of non homologous regulatory_sequences is able to estimate similar in vivo activity we
