data_and mouse_model phenotypes provide information about human drug_targets motivation methods for computational drug target_identification use information from diverse information_sources to predict or prioritize drug_targets for known drugs one set of resources that has been relatively neglected for drug_repurposing is animal_model phenotype results we investigate the use of mouse_model phenotypes for drug target_identification to achieve_this we first integrate mouse_model phenotypes and drug effects and then systematically compare the phenotypic similarity between mouse_models and drug effect profiles we find a high similarity between phenotypes resulting from loss_of and drug effects resulting from the inhibition of a protein through a drug_action and demonstrate how this approach can be used to suggest candidate drug_targets availability_and analysis code and supplementary data_files are available on the project_web at https drugeffects a major_challenge currently faced by pharmacological_research is the high rate of attrition in the development of new compounds the increased cost of drug_development and increased regulatory concern about drug_safety and efficacy as a result pharmacological_research is beginning to focus on repurposing existing_drugs for new indications and several large national and international_research initiatives have begun to systematically address drug_repurposing on a broad_scale strategies for drug_repurposing can be divided_into two main types identification of new targets for known drugs and identification of new indications for a known mechanism of action approaches to drug_repurposing include database driven bioinformatics approaches in vivo and ex_vivo studies and high_throughput methods examples of computational_approaches to drug_repurposing include side effect based_approaches in which similarity between drug effects is used to suggest drug_targets and drug indications data_mining of clinical_records and approaches based on analysis of gwas data computational_approaches to drug_repurposing have the highest chance of succeeding if multiple independent data_sources and analysis approaches are combined so that data from several independent domains and studies can be used to identify strong evidence for novel drug indications based on integrating_multiple complementary datasets integrative computational_approaches can use multiple_measures to prioritize candidate targets and drugs one set of resources that has been relatively neglected for drug_repurposing is animal_model phenotype the use of non human species to investigate physiology and pathobiology and the creation of animal_models of human_diseases amenable to experimental_investigation has become a successful paradigm in the biomedical_sciences the development of highthroughput phenotyping has further increased the available amount of phenotype data resulting from targeted mutations in animal_models and pan genomic projects such as the international mouse phenotyping consortium impc aim to delete every protein_coding in an organism and to identify the phenotypes resulting from these mutations it has now become a challenge to systematically analyze the resulting data and use them to provide insights into human_health and novel intervention_strategies in the past several studies have used animal_model data to suggest candidate_genes for genetically_based diseases and one study also suggests that mouse_model phenotypes can be used to provide insights into drug_actions and drug effects in humans despite experimental differences between the two species here we use a phenome wide approach to systematically compare drug effects with mutant mouse phenotypes we provide strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the similarity between drug effects and mouse phenotypes that result from loss of protein_function indicates a similarity in the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work mechanism of action i e an inhibition of the protein through the drug we evaluate our results with experimentally_validated lists of known drug_targets and demonstrate on a genomic_scale that a similarity between drug effects and mutant mouse phenotypes can reveal drug_targets our approach opens the possibility for a systematic analysis of animal_model phenotypes for candidate drug_targets and has a significant impact for integrative computational_approaches to drug_repurposing
