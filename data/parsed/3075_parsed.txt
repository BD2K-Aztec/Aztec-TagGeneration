databases_and molecular_signatures msigdb motivation well annotated gene_sets representing the universe of the biological_processes are critical for meaningful and insightful interpretation of large_scale genomic_data the molecular_signatures msigdb is one of the most widely used repositories of such sets results we report the availability of a new version of the database msigdb with over gene_sets a complete revision of the collection of canonical pathways and experimental signatures from publications enhanced annotations and upgrades to the web_site availability_and msigdb is freely_available use at http www broadinstitute org msigdb microarrays and other high_throughput typically produce long lists of potentially interesting genes which are not always easily interpreted recognizing the importance of coordinately expressed sets of genes our seminal paper introduced gene_set gsea to discover metabolic_pathways altered in human type_diabetes gsea and other analytical enrichment tools summarize genomic_data in prioritized lists of higher_level biological_features as underscored by a recent survey of enrichment tools they critically depend on backend annotation databases typically such databases focus on a particular domain of knowledge or annotation procedure for example gene_ontology go represents a hierarchy of controlled terms to describe individual gene_products while transfac stores information about transcription_factor a growing number of databases obtain sets from gene_expression reported in the literature these include signaturedb genesigdb ccancer and l l and lola molecular_signatures msigdb differs from these resources in several distinguishing aspects i msigdb is explicitly designed to provide gene_sets for enrichment_analysis methods as such it is natively and seamlessly integrated with our gsea software ii msigdb covers a substantially more diverse and wider_range of gene_set sources and types these include signatures extracted from original research to whom correspondence should be addressed publications and entire collections of sets derived from specialized resources such as go kegg transfac and l l iii msigdb gene_sets are acquired both through manual_curation and by automatic computational means whereas other databases emphasize only one of these approaches and sets corresponding to chemical and genetic_perturbations from scientific_publications shows the growth of the msigdb collections and database since the initial release see also online release notes gene_set annotations each msigdb gene_set is a list of genes with relevant annotations and links to external resources msigdb focuses on human gene_sets however we do include sets from some model_organisms and gene_set annotations include organism identification we use hugo gene symbols and as of version human entrez_gene ids serve as universal identifiers these entrez ids are guaranteed to be unique and stable can easily be mapped into a variety of other identifiers and are natively integrated with the genbank resources of primary nucleic and protein_sequences we also preserve whatever original identifiers were used in the gene_set source all sets have unique database_identifiers and names and include brief and full descriptions other annotations depend on the type of gene_set annotations linking to external resources are especially important as they allow researchers to place the sets inthe context of a specific study and facilitate decisions on follow_up experiments gene_sets from publications are the most richly annotated their annotations include the pubmed id of the publication pointers to other gene_sets from the same publication and now also details on the exact table or figure from which the gene_set was extracted for version we updated the names of these gene_sets to make them more descriptive and standardized and the accompanying brief descriptions to follow a more uniform and consistent format other annotation_features introduced with version include links to source datasets in gene_expression geo and arrayexpress canonical pathway sets include links to the pathway at the source web_site file_formats msigdb gene_set files are available for download in plain_text and xml formats the plain text_files contain simple listings of gene_set membership while the xml files also include the annotations to ensure reproducibility of gsea results older versions of the msigdb files are always available note that users of our gsea software do not need to download the msigdb files as the tool directly and automatically retrieves the gene_sets
