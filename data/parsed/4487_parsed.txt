sv bay structural variant detection in cancer_genomes using a bayesian_approach with correction for gc_content and read mappability motivation whole_genome of paired_end can be applied to characterize the landscape of large somatic rearrangements of cancer_genomes several methods for detecting structural_variants with whole_genome sequencing_data have been developed so_far none of these methods has combined information about abnormally mapped read_pairs connecting rearranged regions and associated global copy_number changes automatically inferred from the same sequencing_data file our aim was to create a computational_method that could use both types of information i e normal and abnormal reads and demonstrate that by doing so we can highly improve both sensitivity_and rates of structural variant prediction results we developed a computational_method sv bay to detect structural_variants from whole gen ome sequencing mate_pair or paired_end data using a probabilistic bayesian_approach this approach takes_into depth of coverage by normal reads and abnormalities in read_pair mappings to estimate the model likelihood sv bay considers gc_content and read mappability of the genome thus making important corrections to the expected read_count for the detection of somatic variants sv bay makes use of a matched normal sample when it is available we validated sv bay on simulated_data and an experimental mate_pair dataset for the clb ga neuroblastoma_cell the comparison of sv bay with several other methods for structural variant detection demonstrated that sv bay has better prediction_accuracy both in terms of sensitivity and false_positive detection rate availability_and https github com institutcurie sv baywhole genome_sequencing wgs has become routine for detection of both small and large somatic_mutations i e point_mutations small_indels and structural_variants svs in cancer_genomes pairedend sequencing of mate_pair is often employed when the aim of the study is the detection of large svs i e variants of greater length than the read_length a long insert_size of mate_pair usually kb allows for high physical coverage of sv junctions each type of large svs translocation duplication deletion inversion etc corresponds to a particular paired_end signature pem signature as such deletions are characterized by a larger than expected distance between mapped paired_reads insert_size while insertions have an insert_size shorter than expected supplementary additionally svs often result in a change of copy_number around the breakpoint junction which is reflected in changes in read_depth of coverage doc for instance deleted regions have a relatively low doc whereas duplicated regions are characterized by high doc thus differences in doc and abnormal positioning of mapped_reads often indicate the same genomic abnormality e g a deletion or a tandem_duplication however there has been no effort made to combine these two types of information into one unified computational_approach most of the current sv_detection approaches can be classified into three categories methods based on i pem signatures ii doc and iii split_read mappings each of these approaches has its limits in terms of the type and size of svs that it is able to detect pem based_algorithms can be grouped into two categories those based on read clustering and those based on fragment length_distribution the former identify discordant pems as pems with unexpected orientation or insert_size cluster them and apply statistical_tests to validate candidate clusters whereas the latter compare the observed insert size_distribution of all read_pairs in a given window versus the expected distribution windows with a significant proportion of read_pairs having unexpected insert_sizes are annotated as containing svs in some cases the same package e g breakdancer provides two complementary_methods for sv_detection clustering based breakdancermax and distribution based breakdancermini to detect large and small_size svs respectively doc based_methods detect regions of gain and loss in the genome using doc normalized for gc_content bias a deviation from the expected doc suggests putative gain or loss of genomic material doc based_methods do not provide information about the adjacency of dna regions involved in copy_number changes thus such methods are not able to indicate the type of sv e g tandem_duplication fragment reinsertion translocation causing genomic loss or gain additionally the resolution of such methods rather is low for low doc datasets a coverage dataset allows approximately a resolution of kb for rearrangement breakpoints split_read based_methods use partial read_alignments for sv_detection although such methods may be efficient for data with high read_coverage they may fail to identify svs with breakpoints located in repetitive_elements of the genome ideally these types of approach should be combined with paired_end signatures this idea was implemented in svmerge prism meerkat smufin and delly combining information about discordant pems with changes in doc is a promising solution for the sv_detection problem probabilistic_models integrating both the doc signal and pem signatures provide higher specificity at equal or greater sensitivity than tools that simply use paired_end signatures however most of these methods do not take into account certain important parameters that affect read_count for both normal and abnormal mappings gc_content and read mappability another general drawback of the majority of these methods is their lack of ability to detect all possible types of sv that can be present in cancer data including co amplifications tandem_duplications with inversions linking insertions etc here we propose a bayesian_framework for sv_detection using paired_end or mate_pair implemented as the software sv bay in this framework we combine both pem signatures and information about changes in doc in regions flanking each candidate rearrangement our method takes_into gc_content and mappability the use of a bayesian_framework based on both pem and doc information allows us to significantly decrease the level of false_positive while retaining high_sensitivity additionally sv bay infers different types of structural variant from the detected novel genomic adjacencies supplementary we applied sv bay to simulated and experimental_datasets and were able to demonstrate that it had a higher prediction_accuracy than four other published_methods gasvpro lumpy and the two most popular_methods for sv_detection breakdancer breakdancermax and delly we have selected gasvpro and lumpy since like sv bay these tools take into consideration information about doc changes in the proximity of candidate breakpoints however unlike sv bay they consider only short proximity of breakpoints while sv bay calculates read_counts in maximally large regions around the breakpoint which increases the statistical_power of its probabilistic_approach in addition gasvpro lumpy and delly integrate split_reads into the analysis the version of each software and parameters used are summarized in supplementary table s lumpy was applied to paired_end data only as it does not provide an option to run on mate_pair datasets in the analysis below we assumed that an sv calling method correctly_detected a given sv when i predicted breakpoints laid within a certain distance d from the correct breakpoints and ii there was a match in read orientation distance d corresponded to the maximal fragment length i e bp for simulated matepair data bp for simulated paired_end data and bp for the experimental mate_pair data we have proposed a new method sv bay for the detection of large svs in cancer_genomes sv bay is based on a bayesian probabilistic_model this allows it to be both sensitive and selective discardingabbreviations paired ends pe mate_pairs mp the extremely_long execution time of gasvpro on mate_pair data is explained by the use of split_reads to refine the breakpoint position in mate_pair data the range where the breakpoint can be located according to abnormal read mappings can be extremely_large testing all possibilities requires many hours many artefact clusters of mismapped read_pairs indeed in comparison with other methods sv bay demonstrated a noticeably better sv detection_accuracy both for simulated and experimental_datasets sv bay not only detects novel genomic adjacencies but also where possible groups them into more complex svs such as co amplifications linking insertions tandem_duplications with inversion etc overall sv bay allows the user to skip such data post processing_steps like filtering out links with low number of fragments that do not correspond to copy_number changes filtering out events present both in the tumor and the matched normal control artefacts and germline svs and performing manual inference of complex sv from the detected genomic adjacencies sv bay does not use split_reads to improve the resolution of predicted breakpoints there are two main reasons for this first the read_coverage on breakpoints can be sufficiently_high only for paired_end libraries whereas we intended our method to also be applicable to mate_pair data second structural_variants in cancer often occur in low mappability repetitive_regions or regions that have partial homology additionally there can be insertions of one of several genomic shards between two regions connected by a sv these incidents reduce the capacity of read_mappers to align correctly reads coming from sv junctions like other methods sv bay is tolerant to a certain degree to contamination of the tumor sample by normal cells in the future we intend to extend our model to handle both high normal_cell levels and be able to detect sub clonal svs when values of tumour purity and sub clonal cellularity are provided the current version of sv bay is able to analyze only one tumor normal pair at once one of the interesting possible extensions to our method would be to add the ability to analyze several tumour datasets extracted from the same patient in order to increase the sensitivity of sv_detection we have presented sv bay a computational_method and software to detect structural_variants in cancer using whole_genome sequencing_data with or without matched normal control sample sv bay does not only use information about abnormal read mappings but also assesses changes in the copy_number profile and tries to associate these changes with candidate svs the likelihood of each novel genomic adjacency is evaluated using a bayesian_model in its final step sv bay annotates genomic adjacencies according to their type and where possible groups detected genomic adjacencies into complex svs as balanced translocations co amplifications and so on a comparison of sv bay with breakdancer lumpy delly and gasvpro demonstrated its superior_performance on both simulated and experimental_datasets
