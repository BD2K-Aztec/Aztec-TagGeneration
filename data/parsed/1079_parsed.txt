compendiumdb an r package for retrieval and storage of functional_genomics data currently the gene_expression geo contains public data of over million samples from more than microarray_based functional_genomics experiments this provides a rich source of information for novel biological discoveries however unlocking this potential often requires retrieving and storing a large number of expression_profiles from a wide_range of different studies and platforms the compendiumdb r package provides an environment for down loading functional_genomics data from geo parsing the information into a local or remote database and interacting with the database using dedicated r functions thus enabling seamless_integration with other tools available in r bioconductor availability_and the compendiumdb package is written in r mysql and perl source_code are available from cran http cran r project org_web compen diumdb for all major platforms linux ms windows and os x under the gplv_license public_repositories such as the gene_expression geo and arrayexpress provide a large amount of functional_genomics data from a wide_range of studies performed in different organisms and on different microarray_platforms however retrieving and systematically storing these datasets to extract novel biological_information is often challenging several tools and web_based resources have been developed expression data sample and probe annotation to the relational_database and iii convert experimental_data from the database to an r bioconductor expressionset
