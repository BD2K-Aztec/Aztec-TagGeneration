gene_expression gcmap user_friendly connectivity mapping with r connections between disease_phenotypes and drug effects can be made by identifying commonalities in the associated patterns of differential_gene searchable databases that record the impacts of chemical or genetic_perturbations on the transcriptomehere referred to as connectivity mapspermit discovery of such com monalities we describe two r packages gcmap and gcmapweb which provide a complete framework to construct and query connect ivity maps assembled from user_defined collections of differential_gene data microarray or rnaseq_data are processed in a standardized way and results can be interrogated using various well established gene_set enrichment_methods the packages also feature an easy to deploy web_application that facilitates reproducible_research through automatic generation of graphical and tabular reports availability_and the gcmap and gcmapweb r packages are freely_available for unix windows and mac os x operating_systems at bioconductormicroarray and rnaseq technologies enable the study of transcriptional changes triggered by experimental perturbations gene_expression changes observed after one perturbation often resemble those produced by others suggesting a shared biological mechanism this strategy for establishing links between perturbations can then be used for example to identify bioactive_compounds elucidate their mode of action or reposition approved pharmaceuticals for use in new indications standalone tools modular software libraries or hosted web_applications are available to query the original connectivity_map but tools that allow users to easily compile and search their own reference datasets are lacking the gcmap package provides utilities and memory_efficient structures to create store and query large experimental_datasets gcmap also provides a unified r command_line to multiple gene_set gse approaches permitting their use for querying user created connectivity maps as well as more traditional gene_set collectionse g gene_ontology reactome or wikipathways in addition the companion gcmapweb package provides a customizable browser_based graphical_user and can leverage rs built in web_server or be integrated into a production scale server the gcmap bioconductor_packages combine powerful command_line functionality with a convenient portable web_application the efficient handling of large_datasets empowers users to assemble large connectivity maps from private or public data query them programmatically or through an interactive user_interface and store queries and results in a reproducible report
