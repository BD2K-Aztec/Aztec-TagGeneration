systems_biology noa a cytoscape_plugin for network ontology analysis the network ontology analysis noa plugin for cytoscape implements the noa algorithm for network based enrichment_analysis which extends gene_ontology to network links or edges the plugin facilitates the annotation and analysis of one or more networks in cytoscape according to user_defined parameters in addition to tables the noa plugin also presents results in the form of heatmaps and overview networks in cytoscape which can be exported for publication figures availability the noa plugin is an open_source java program for cytoscape version available via the cytoscape app store http apps cytoscape org apps noa and plugin manager a detailed user_manual is available at http nrnb org tools noa to make use of the vast wealth of data and knowledge to elucidate the function of biological_networks is one of the biggest challenges in bioinformatics the development of high_throughput technology has given rise to an enormous increase of data on biomolecular expression and interactions which results in protein_interaction gene_regulatory signaling_networks and metabolic_networks one approach to understanding networks relies on ontologies such as gene_ontology go and enrichment_analysis common approaches such as bingo regard a network as a list of genes performing gene level annotation and enrichment_methods however it is apparent that the same list of genes with different interactions may perform different functions thus the functional analysis of networks should take into consideration network_topology our previous work introduced the network ontology analysis noa algorithm to perform gene_ontology on biological_networks first noa assigns ontology_terms to interactions based on the known annotations of connected genes via optimizing two novel indexes coverage and diversity then noa generates two alternative reference sets to statistically rank the enriched functional terms for a given biological_network noa was shown to be more efficient not only for dynamic regulatory_networks but also for rewired protein_interaction however there are several shortcomings with the initial_implementation no graphical_interface or visualization of results limited support for species gene names and ontology types no batch mode for large_scale computation and no integration or interoperability with other network tools to overcome these shortcomings we have reimplemented the noa algorithm as a cytoscape_plugin and added interfaces extensible ontology and identifier support new visualizations a batch mode and interoperability with other cytoscape plugins as demonstrated with cythesaurus van and mosaic the following use cases demonstrate the analysis options available in the noa plugin and the types of the results users should expect
