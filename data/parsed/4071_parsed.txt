roundup enabling comparative_genomics for over genomes roundup is an online database of gene orthologs for over genomes including eukaryota bacteria archaea and viruses orthologs are inferred using the reciprocal smallest distance algorithm users may query roundup for single_linkage clusters of orthologous_genes based on any group of genomes annotated query results may be viewed in a variety of ways including as clusters of orthologs and as phylogenetic profiles genomic results may be downloaded in formats suitable for functional as well as phylogenetic_analysis including the recent orthoxml standard in addition gene ids can be retrieved using fasta sequence_search all source_code and orthologs are freely_available availability http roundup orthologs are genes from different organisms that descend from a single ancestral gene in the most_recent in comparative_genomics they are used to infer the function of novel genes from the function of well studied ones to construct phylogenies and explore the evolution of genes and species and to study sequence_conservation and change they are also valuable in analyzing gene_networks studying gene gain and loss and finding genes in model_organisms that correspond to human disease genes advances in high_throughput genomic_sequencing have made it possible to produce many datasets in a relatively short time period for example from to the number of complete proteomes listed in uniprotkb a repository of annotated protein_sequences has increased from around to over to overcome the engineering challenges of computing and publishing orthologs for such a large number of genomes we redesigned the comparative_genomics tool roundup to scale with the rate of genome_sequencing and to enable increasingly more sophisticated comparative_genomics analyses roundup contains orthology data for over genomes providing one of the largest diversities among similar
