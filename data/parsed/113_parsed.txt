genetics_and adaptive gene and pathway trait association testing with gwas summary_statistics background gene and pathway based analyses offer a useful alternative and complement to the usual single snp based analysis for gwas on the other hand most existing gene and pathway based tests are not highly adaptive and or require the availability of individual_level genotype and phenotype data it would be desirable to have highly adaptive tests applicable to summary_statistics for single snps this has become increasingly important given the popularity of large_scale meta_analyses of multiple gwass and the practical availability of either single gwas or meta_analyzed gwas summary_statistics for single snps results we extend two adaptive tests for gene and pathway level association with a univariate trait to the case with gwas summary_statistics without individual_level genotype and phenotype data we use the wtccc gwas data to evaluate and compare the proposed methods and several existing_methods we further illustrate their applications to a meta_analyzed dataset to identify genes and pathways associated with blood_pressure demonstrating the potential usefulness of the proposed methods the methods are implemented in r package aspu freely and publicly_available availability_and https cran r project org_web aspu in spite of the tremendous success of genome_wide gwass due to modest to small effect_sizes of the majority of causal_snps for complex and common disease large_sample and more powerful statistical_tests are always needed furthermore even when some associated snps or loci are identified by the most popular single snp based analysis it is often extremely_difficult to offer a functional_interpretation that can shed light on the underlying biology as alternatives gene and pathway based analyses have been proposed and applied for single traits demonstrating their useful and complementary roles a statistical challenge is that due to unknown true association patterns there is no uniformly most powerful test to detect multiple snp single_trait associations an association test may perform well for one dataset but not necessarily for another for example the presence of non associated snps will largely diminish the power of a standard test if no effective snp selection or weighting is adopted proposed a data adaptive aspu approach based on estimating and selecting the most powerful test among a class of so_called sum of powered score spu tests which cover several popular tests as special cases such as the burden test a variance_component test and a univariate test the main idea is to use various values of a parameter to construct data_driven and varying weights for the snps thus adaptive to unknown signal sparsity and association directions among the multiple_snps being tested furthermore extended the methodology to pathway analysis aspupath in particular two parameters are introduced such that the test is adaptive at both the snp and gene levels as demonstrated therein due to their high data adaptivity the two adaptive tests remained powerful across a wide_range of scenarios however the two adaptive tests for gene and pathway single_trait associations are only applicable to the case with individuallevel genotype and phenotype data due to various reasons it is often difficult for many researchers to obtain access to individuallevel data at the same time it is easier to obtain access to some summary_statistics e g p values of individual snps in a gwas in addition use of some summary_statistics is often necessary for practical meta_analyses which have become increasingly popular and important for complex disease and traits here we propose extending the two highly adaptive tests to the case with only summary_statistics for individual snps demonstrating their applications to a meta_analyzed gwas dataset for blood_pressure in numerical_examples we compared our methods with genebased gates and three pathway based_approaches gates simes hyst and magma all methods are for a single univariate trait gates adopts an extended simes procedure to correct multiple testing while calculating the p value quickly based on snp summary_statistics gates simes extends the main idea of gates to extract the most significant gene level p value for a pathway whereas hyst uses fishers method to combine multiple genes p values magma is based on multiple_regression we also considered one gene_set gsea method i gseagwas an extension of gsea to gwas summary_statistics note that here our goal is global association testing in the category of selfcontained tests with a null_hypothesis h that none of any genes in a pathway is associated with disease in contrast to enrichment or competitive testing with a null_hypothesis h e that the proportion of associated genes in a pathway is no more than that in the rest of the genes since rejecting h e implies rejecting h a global testing is often more powerful than an enrichment_analysis the proposed methods are available in r package aspu which is downloadable from cran we have proposed two adaptive tests aspus and aspuspath respectively for gene and pathway level association_analyses of a univariate trait with the availability of only summary_statistics such as z statistics or p values for individual snps with only summary_statistics like z statistics or p values one has to recourse to some reference_panel to estimate ld or correlations among snps whichadaptive gene and pathway trait association testingmight influence the performance of subsequent association testing overall the p values_calculated from using different panels were similar as shown in our analysis of the wtccc data however depending on the reference_panels being used the results for a small number of the genes or pathways could be different hence caution must be taken and an independent_validation on any detected associations based on summary_statistics becomes more important we have further illustrated the application of the proposed methods to a meta_analyzed gwas data demonstrating their usefulness as compared to the popular single snp based analysis in addition we have compared their performance with several other existing tests since there is no uniformly most powerful test for multiple_snps it would be desirable to have an adaptive test that can robustly maintain high not necessarily highest power across various scenarios which motivated our proposed two tests our proposed tests offer an alternative and complement to existing gene and pathway level association testing we have developed an r package aspu to facilitate their use
