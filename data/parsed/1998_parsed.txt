genetics_and genevar a database and java_application for the analysis and visualization of snp gene_associations in eqtl studies genevar gene_expression variation is a database and java tool designed to integrate_multiple datasets and provides analysis and visualization of associations between sequence_variation and gene_expression genevar allows researchers to investigate expression_quantitative eqtl associations within a gene_locus of interest in real_time the database and application can be installed on a standard computer in database mode and in addition on a server to share discoveries among affiliations or the broader community over the internet via web_services protocols expression_quantitative eqtl_mapping where gene_expression is treated as a phenotypic trait in genome_wide gwas has successfully been employed to uncover genetic_variants that influence expression variation in recent_studies single_nucleotide snp gene_associations from eqtl_analysis can be investigated in populations or among tissue_types in addition to genome_wide eqtl identification combinations of eqtls and lead snps identified by gwas have been provided to interrogate the mechanisms_underlying disease_susceptibility at specific_loci however an analytical and visualization_tool together with a structured repository for multiple datasets is still needed to facilitate the investigation of loci of interest and to share data publicly and among collaborators here we present genevar a database and java tool designed to provide i data warehousing ii real_time computation of correlation significance iii visualization of mapping results in a user_friendly interface and iv an added web_services platform to whom correspondence should be addressed that is implemented as a bridge between the server and multiple users genevar allows published_data to be visually accessible in a secure fashion without the need for users to download raw_data through interactive analysis_pipelines researchers are able to rapidly investigate for instance cis_acting eqtls at the locus of interest complementing already available standalone tools a database centric architecture enables genevar to perform complex queries on the fly and does not have a high memory requirement for prior reading in large_scale datasets furthermore exploiting the convenience of web_based and web launch tools a java interface was developed that connects to both database and web_services the main advantage of this system design is that users can switch between public_services and local data on the same interface default services at the sanger institute currently contain gene_expression and genotypic data from the following two datasets lymphoblastoid_cell from eight hapmap populations individuals unpublished_data and three cell_types derived from umbilical_cords of geneva gencord individuals
