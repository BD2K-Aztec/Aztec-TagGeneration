bioinformatics_discovery data_and inferring therapeutic_targets from heterogeneous data hkdc is a novel potential_therapeutic for cancer motivation the discovery of therapeutic_targets is important for cancer treatment although dozens of targets have been used in cancer_therapies cancer remains a serious disease with a high mortality_rate owing to the expansion of cancer related data we now have the opportunity to infer therapeutic_targets using computational_biology methods results here we describe a method termed anticancer_activity enrichment_analysis used to determine genes that could be used as therapeutic_targets the results show that these genes have high likelihoods of being developed into clinical targets combined with gene_expression data we predicted candidate targets for lung_cancer of which of the top genes are targeted by approved drugs or drugs used in clinical_trials a hexokinase family_member hexokinase domain containing protein hkdc is the only one of the top genes that has not been targeted by either an approved drug or one being used in clinical_trials further investigations indicate that hkdc is a novel potential_therapeutic for lung_cancer conclusion we developed a protocol to identify potential_therapeutic from heterogeneous data we suggest that hkdc is a novel potential_therapeutic for lung_cancer in the past_decade targeted_cancer have improved cancer treatment dozens of molecular_targets have been used in cancer treatment including egfr and vegfr although multiple drugs that selectively_inhibit these targets have been developed and are used in cancer treatment cancer is still a highly_challenging disease therefore discovering novel therapeutic_targets is still an important and challenging_task for cancer treatment several hallmarks of cancer have been defined and have helped guide cancer_therapy of these hallmarks uncontrolled growth is the most critical for cancer propagation therefore a cancer therapeutic_target should have the following two characteristics i the target should be essential for the growth of cancer_cells and inhibition of the target should directly_or suppress cancer cell_growth and ii disturbing the target should have minimal side_effects in normal cells it would be perfect if the target was not expressed in normal cells but highly_expressed in cancer_cells in this study we used a computational_biology method to infer potential_therapeutic from heterogeneous data we first used our previously_published method cdrug to predict anticancer ligands in the chembl database cdrug is a web_server or method used to predict whether a chemical compound has anticancer_activity chembl is a manually_curated chemical database of bioactive_molecules that includes genes and million_compounds we then performed a hypergeometric_test termed anticancer_activity enrichment_analysis acea to determine genes with significant_enrichment of anticancer ligands further investigation revealed that these anticancer ligand enriched genes have high potentials to become clinical targets after overlapping these genes with expression data from lung_cancer tissues we inferred candidate therapeutic_targets for lung_cancer we further propose that hkdc one of these genes is a novel potential_therapeutic for lung_cancer we have developed a computational_biology method acea to determine potential_therapeutic genes further analysis shows that these genes have high likelihoods of being developed into clinical targets combined with gene_expression data we predicted candidate targets for the treatment of lung_cancer further validation investigations suggest that hkdc is a novel therapeutic_target for lung_cancer hkdc encodes the fifth mammalian hexokinase which phosphorylates hexoses because phosphorylationis the first step in glucose_metabolism hexokinases may play_an in regulating energy_metabolism and thus regulating cell_growth hexokinase type_ii hk is a well studied therapeutic_target shows that hk is overexpressed in lung_cancer tissues fold_change p however only hkdc showed a dramatic overexpression in cancer tissues when compared with other hexokinases fold_change p this result suggested that hkdc might play_an in cancer growth that is different from other hexokinases further experimental elucidation of the exact role of hkdc in cancer growth will be important to its development as a therapeutic_target we developed the novel computational_biology method acea to determine which genes are significantly_enriched for anticancer ligands we inferred candidate targets for the treatment of lung_cancer and we suggest that hkdc is a novel potential_therapeutic for lung_cancer
