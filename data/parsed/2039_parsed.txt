genosa inferring and experimentally supporting quantitative gene_regulatory in prokaryotes motivation the establishment of quantitative gene_regulatory qgrns through existing network_component nca approaches suffers from shortcomings such as usage limitations of problem constraints and the instability of inferred qgrns the proposed genosa framework uses a global optimization_algorithm optnca to cope with the stringent limitations of nca approaches in large_scale qgrns results optnca performs well against existing nca derived algorithms in terms of utilization of connectivity_information and reconstruction_accuracy of inferred grns using synthetic and real escherichia_coli datasets for comparisons with other non nca derived algorithms optnca without using known qualitative regulations is also evaluated in terms of qualitative assessments using a synthetic saccharomyces_cerevisiae dataset of the dream challenges we successfully demonstrate genosa in several applications including deducing condition_dependent regulations establishing high consensus qgrns and validating a sub network experimentally for doseresponse and timecourse microarray_data and discovering and experimentally confirming a novel regulation of crp on ascg availability_and all datasets and the genosa framework are freely_available from http e in systems_biology inferring_gene grns has focused

solution_space for inferring v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comgrns once the mathematic model of the grn is established one can deduce and analyze interested regulation through qualitative assessments regardless of regulatory_roles as either activation or repression in grns qualitative grns have been inferred by numerous methods but quantitative analysis and further experimental support is still lacking quantitative grns have been widely investigated sinceproposed an approach for inferring grns with quantitative transcription_rates and realistic descriptions of how a genes regulators influence its expression_level quantitative regulation information can help biologists reveal hidden knowledge in complicated and large_scale grns the network_component nca approach is a wellknown model based decomposition method for inferring grns to deduce valuable information related to the transcription_factor activity tfa and control strength cs of tf gene connectivity networks tfa is defined as the concentration of its subpopulation capable of dna_binding and is difficult to measure experimentally owing to the post_transcriptional and post_translational estimating the quantities of tfas provides a basis for investigating perturbations caused by drug effects genetic_mutations over expression or complex environmental_challenges the linear_model of nca is described in eq where the levels of gene_expression are determined by cs and tfa respectively represented using the matricesand the values in the matrix size m t are the log ratios of expression values of m genes and t time points measured using microarray_technology under specific conditions the connectivity matrix size m n is composed of the regulation between m genes and n tfs and the matrix size n t represents activities of the n tfs on t time points the matrixrepresents the measurement noise or other factors that influence gene_expression but are not directly related to this linear_model the nca derived algorithms must obey the three identifiability criteria serving as constraints the set z is the topologies induced by the network_connectivity pattern the inputs of the nca derived algorithms are the matricesandgiven from gene_expression and connectivity_information respectively the outputs are the values in the matricesand to satisfy the three criteria some valuable connectivity_information such as the known tf gene regulations and some tfs and genes in the grn of interest would be ignored the existing nca algorithm adopts a twostep iterative_method to satisfy the three aforementioned criteria but the obtained solution has two shortcomings i the method adopts a local_search methodology and ii the solution is computationally instable depending on initial_values in matrix the subsequently developed nca algorithm incorporating the tikhonov_regularization method can improve the numerical sensitivity induced by the ill conditioned matrices however the existing nca derived algorithms cannot estimate so many tfas due to insufficient transcriptome data_points in the third criterion hence an enhanced version of the nca algorithm revises the third criterion thus relaxing the theoretical data point limitation the nca algorithm with the revised third criterion and tikhonov_regularization is named ncar in this work however the third criterion is difficult to meet because a single gene can be regulated by a large number of tfs in higher_eukaryotes therefore the nca derived algorithms have to prune some tfs and genes in the original grn of interest to make the grn nca complaint and thus yield a unique_solution therefore the trimming schema was used to extend the applicability of the nca model to the realm of mammalian regulatory network_analysis in addition fastnca non iterative nca ni nca and robnca focused on improving the efficiency of matrix decomposition in the nca model when applied to large_scale grns robnca was more accurate than fastnca and ni nca irrespective of varying noise correlation and or amount of outliers for synthetic datasets numerous studies have successfully used the nca approach for qualitative grns reconstruction although the nca algorithms are still subject to limitations in the matrix and instability in the matrixwith insufficient connectivity_information theoretically the inferred grns using existing nca derived algorithms need to be further refined by biologists and confirmed through biological_knowledge and empirical_evidence this work proposes a framework named gene_networks via orthogonal simulated_annealing genosa for inferring quantitative grns from multiple microarray profiles of doseresponse or timecourse data using a global optimization_algorithm named optnca optnca bases on orthogonal simulated_annealing osa and the best use of prior_knowledge for the initial setting of the connectivity matrixwithout matrix reduction to confine the solution_space of the decomposition problem of the nca model we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in several respects first we adopt nca compliant datasets as benchmarks and show that optnca is superior to existing nca derived algorithms in terms of the true network in silico moreover optnca without using known qualitative regulations is also evaluated in terms of qualitative assessments using one of the widely used datasets of dream challenges second we show the good quality of the inferred grns using genosa to deduce condition_dependent regulations of a crp regulated grn third we apply genosa to establish quantitative grns from overview of a general procedure for reconstructing grns a microarray_experiments are conducted for some control factors e g knockout drug treatment or overexpression b mrna expression_profiles are obtained from doseresponse or timecourse microarray_data c inference methods reconstruct grns with interested regulation from the mrna expression_profiles d the mathematical_model with parameter_values is obtained for a grn with qualitative regulation e qualitative evaluations using in silico networks or biological_experiments on interactions of reconstructed grns doseresponse or timecourse microarray_data and validate quantitative regulations in a small sub network in vitro the wide applicability of genosa suggests that this framework is not only of theoretical use in the reverse_engineering of quantitative grns but also can be practically applied in real_world grns this work proposes a complete framework genosa to infer largescale qgrns using optnca based on the model of nca using an osa algorithm the proposed optnca can efficiently yield a good solution to the decomposition problem without performing matrix reduction to obey the three identifiability criteria existing ncaderived algorithms except optnca usually perform matrix reduction and ignore some genes and transcription_factors of interest however with prior_knowledge of connectivity_information from the literature and existing databases optnca can retain this reliable connectivity_information in inferring grns the generalpurpose genosa can quantitatively estimate cs and tfa as well as discover novel regulations for specific conditions and applications estimating quantitative tfas improves understanding of how the physical states of cells respond to environmental changes and elucidate the transcriptional architectures for various applications such as drug_design optnca performs well compared to existing nca derived algorithms in terms of reliable connectivity_information and reconstruction_accuracy using synthetic and real e coli datasets experimental_results indicate that genosa can infer crp regulated grns to quantitatively deduce condition_dependent and undiscovered regulations in the nca model the quantity of the activity of a tf mainly depends on its target_genes by investigating the stability of a tfa that targets on multiple genes genosa provides a solution to elucidate relative cs of tf mediated genes and the dynamics of tfas upper parts of figs b and c for various dosages and time points while existing nca derived algorithms focus on approximating expression_profiles for grn reconstruction with qualitative regulation or quantitative regulation genosa aims to minimize a profile approximation error while accurately identifying a topological_structure with quantitative regulation for efficiently establishing large_scale grns the framework genosa consists of tools including generation of input_files for optnca and optimization of grns to make the best use of connectivity_information from the literature and regulation databases for time course or doseresponsea crp regulated network crp ybit for a new regulation and their quantitative results we had reconstructed a qualitative grn as shown in a we choose an independent sub network including an unknown regulation between crp and ascg from this grn and design biological_experiments to perform quantitative analysis for genosa the quantitative and correlation results for b dr camp five mutant experiments for each of the three concentrations and c tc is seven mutant experiments for each of the five time points the quantitative values of cs of dr camp and tc is were illustrated by the line width and the activities of tfs are also shown to demonstrate the dynamics of the reconstructed grn upper the correlation between results of qrt_pcr and genosa are plotted lower see supplementary tables s and s in detail each expression is the average of three replicates of qrt_pcr the pearsons correlation_coefficients are and for dr camp and tc is respectivelythe binding_affinities of crp to the promoters of ascf ascg and ybit are determined by emsa b quantified by measuring the intensity of retard bands in subfigure a to retain bands with zero d scan software and c the binding_affinities of crp to the promoters of ascf ascg and ybit are determined by qrt_pcr genosamicroarray datasets we believe that genosa could serve as a fundamental tool for estimating tfas in the reverse_engineering of inferring quantitative grns and lead to the development of a rich set of applications in the field of systems_biology
