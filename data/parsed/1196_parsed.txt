genome_analysis cravat cancer related analysis of variants toolkit advances in sequencing_technology have greatly_reduced the costs_incurred in collecting raw_sequencing academic laboratories and researchers therefore now have access to very large_data of genomic_alterations but limited time and computational_resources to analyse their potential biological_importance here we provide a web_based application cancer related analysis of variants toolkit designed with an easy to use interface to facilitate the high_throughput assessment and prioritization of genes and mis sense alterations important for cancer tumorigenesis cancer related analysis of variants toolkit provides predictive scores for germline variants somatic_mutations and relative gene importance as well as annotations from published_literature and databases results are emailed to users as ms excel spreadsheets and or tab separated text_files with the advent_of sequencing_technology researchers face a bottleneck in terms of the time required to analyse the potential impact on disease aetiology of the many genetic_variants routinely detected computational algorithms can in principle help researchers to prioritize and direct future_experiments by narrowing down the numerous genetic_alterations identified in sequencing studies however in practice it can be challenging to run these algorithms in a researchers own laboratory owing to the requirements of third_party software and databases and large hard disk_space and ram specifications we have developed cancer related analysis of variants toolkit cravat a web_based application that provides a simple interface to prioritize genes and variants important for tumorigenesis allowing users to assess millions of variants in a single upload step numerous web implementations already exist for variant classifiers reviewed in cravat handles both germline and somatic variation but is dedicated to cancer genome_analysis it accepts variant_calls from sequencing studies in either genomic_coordinates hg or hg or transcript coordinatesncbi refseq ccds and ensembl variants are mapped onto the best available transcript using a greedy_algorithm see supplementary methods and those variants that cause missense changes are identified these variants can be scored in terms of their predicted impact on tumorigenesis using the cancer specific high_throughput annotation of somatic_mutations chasm method they can also be scored by their predicted impact on protein_function with the variant effect scoring tool vest genes are ranked by their most significantly scored variant or mutation results are linked with published information from the genomes_project the exome_sequencing project catalogue of somatic_mutations in cancer cosmic genecards and pubmed enabling users to compare predictions with known gene function cancer associations and clinical experimental_studies cravat returns results via email in excel and or tab separated text it can also provide a formatted submission file for mutation position imaging toolbox mupit interactive n niknafs et_al submitted for publication allowing users to visualize variants interactively in d together with position specific annotations we provide an example to demonstrate how the cravat web_server can prioritize and facilitate mutation analysis we obtained genomic_coordinates of mutations from the cancer_genome sequencing study of endometrial tumors from firehose we limited our submission to mutations that were called as missense by firehose yielding mutations options for cancer driver analysis chasm uterus tissue type and include gene_annotation were selected results were received via email after h excel spreadsheet with pages for variant analysis amino_acid level analysis and gene level analysis and a separate text_file to visualize amino_acid in mupit on the variant analysis sheet mutations of which were unique received a chasm false_discovery many significantly scored mutations were involved in pathways previously determined to impact endometrial_cancer e g pi k wnt_signalling mapk signalling and p signalling_pathways several genes from these pathways pik_ca pten tp kras and ctnnb were known endometrial_cancer driver_genes in addition to identifying well known drivers chasm identified potential drivers not previously associated with endometrial_cancer in biologically_relevant pathways viz mtor in the pi k pathway and gsk b in the wnt signalling_pathway
