systems_biology tlm tracker software for cell segmentation tracking and lineage analysis in time lapse microscopy movies motivation time lapse imaging in combination with fluorescence microscopy_techniques enable the investigation of gene regulatory_circuits and uncovered phenomena like culture heterogeneity in this context computational image_processing for the analysis of single_cell behaviour plays an increasing role in systems_biology and mathematical_modelling approaches consequently we developed a software_package with graphical_user for the analysis of single bacterial cell behaviour results a new software called tlm tracker allows for the flexible and user_friendly interpretation for the segmentation tracking and lineage analysis of microbial cells in time lapse movies availability the software_package including manual tutorial video and examples is available as matlab_code or executable binaries at http www tlmtracker tu bs de the discovery of phenotypic variations in clonal microbial_populations led to an increased interest in the investigation of individual cell behaviour it was shown that culture heterogeneity can be caused by stochastic events at the level of gene_expression these lead to transient phenotypes up to stable co existing populations documented examples for bacteria include persistance competence and sporulation however traditional_methods to analyze the dynamics of gene_expression in bacterial_communities and cultures including transcriptome and proteome analyses only capture the average of temporally overlapping expression levels deeper insights into the variability of certain gene regulatory_circuits can be achieved by microscopical visualization of cells_expressing appropriate fluorescence reporters hereby the complex dynamics of individual cells over time can be visualized using time lapse movies successive frames in time lapse movies offer the possibility to both temporal and spatial analyses of gene_expression including proliferation differentiation and migration of cells rapid advances in live_cell fluorescence_microscopy and developments in image_processing allow the computational in vivo tracking and analysis of single cells commonly used image_processing allow the preprocessing of all frames to optimize size brightness and contrast for the identification of background and border regions in the next step called segmentation cells are recognized as meaningful parts that are separated from the background this spatial separation is followed by cell_tracking which is the temporal recognition of cells in this procedure cells are connected over time from frame to frame during the whole process features such as fluorescence_intensity cell dimensions growth_rate and migration are measured these data represent_important parameters for mathematical_modelling approaches in systems_biology several sophisticated approaches to this analysis were realized in both commercial and open_source software_tools however a program that combines sophisticated image_processing and analysis with an intuitive application and a high degree of automatization is still missing to close this gap we developed a new dialogue based_interactive software_package for the analysis of time lapse movies called time lapse movie tracker tlm tracker the tool includes many image preprocessing options and combines them with well established segmentation and tracking algorithms tlm tracker allows both full automatization of the analysis and manual intervention at every image_processing step we applied our software in a case study of a green_fluorescent gfp producing bacillus_megaterium strain the software_package was applied on a growing microcolony of a gfp producing b megaterium strain gfp production is driven by a xylose inducible_promoter cell_division events and the induction of gfp were analyzed using the watershed segmentation_method in combination with tracking by overlapping cell areas the workflow was performed in a completely automated way using predefined processes this example clearly documents that the program is capable of dealing satisfactory with segmentation and tracking despite tlm tracker was developed for the analysis of bacteria it may be used for a variety of other cells
