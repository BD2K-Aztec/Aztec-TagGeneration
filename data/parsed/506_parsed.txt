a single source k shortest_paths algorithm to infer regulatory_pathways in a gene network motivation inferring the underlying regulatory_pathways within a gene interaction_network is a fundamental problem in systems_biology to help understand the complex interactions and the regulation and flow of information within a system of interest given a weighted gene network and a gene in this network the goal of an inference algorithm is to identify the potential regulatory_pathways passing through this gene results in a departure from previous_approaches that largely rely on the random_walk model we propose a novel single source k shortest_paths based algorithm to address this inference problem an important element of our approach is to explicitly account for and enhance the diversity of paths discovered by our algorithm the intuition here is that diversity in paths can help enrich different functions and thereby better position one to understand the underlying system of interest results on the yeast gene network demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach over extant state of the art inference algorithms beyond utility our algorithm achieves a significant speedup over these baselines with advances in high_throughput experimental_technologies we are now witnessing a revolutionary change in our ability to measure and store various forms of interaction data e g proteinprotein proteindna rna proteinmetabolites and genetic_interactions for different organisms the central objective in systems_biology is to fuse and analyze the diverse molecular cellular tissue level and higher_level data_sources to deduce how sub systems and whole organisms work from these network of interactions a node in such a network is usually a gene or its corresponding protein and an edge in a gene network represents a protein_protein ppi or a transcription_factor tf dna_binding a major_challenge here is to identify the underlying regulatory_pathways each of which is a chain of interacting genes within a network a regulatory_pathway begins with a causal gene and ends at a target_gene and each gene in a pathway can either activate or deactivate some functions of its neighboring genes the uncovering of potential pathways across genes helps biologists understand the cellular_functions of each gene and protein as noted earlier a range of experimental methods such as two hybrid analysis have been developed to uncover a large amount of interactions between genes to whom correspondence should be addressed and proteins and gene knock_out experiments and some studies have also computed the confidence_level associated with an interaction on the basis of discovery that genes with high centrality in a gene network usually have higher essentiality lethality and pleiotropy several research_works have focused on inferring the regulatory_pathways on a number of organisms such as fly yeast and human given a weighted directed gene network and a specific gene we seek to develop efficient algorithms for the following sub problems i unknowncausal if the given gene is a target_gene infer possible causal_genes and their pathways ii unknowntarget if the given gene is a causal gene infer possible target_genes and their pathways since given a target_gene some biological_experiments such as expression_quantitative eqtl_analysis can locate an approximate location of a causal gene and thus can provide candidate causal_genes another sub problem is iii candidatecausal given a causal gene infer the most likely causal gene among the candidates recently approaches based on the random_walk model have been suggested as a means to address this problem a random_walk typically starts from the given gene walks through several nodes and terminates according to some pre defined parameters such as walk length and edge_weights generally the number of visits to a node across multiple walks from a given gene gives a measure of influence or importance which in turn provides a measure of how likely that node is involved in a pathway containing the given gene first proposed this model to address this inference problem with an additional requirement rooted in domain_knowledge that the random_walk could visit any node at most once proposed the electrical circuit model as an analogy of gene_networks in which each edge is a resistor and its conductance is proportional to the edges weight this circuit model can be solved according to kirchhoffs and ohms laws and the amount of current flowing through each node can be interpreted as the possibility of this node being involved in a pathway it has been shown that this circuit model can be interpreted as the random_walk model but it cannot directly apply on directed edges the information_flow model stojmirovic used a similar approach to topic sensitive pagerank whereas the electrical circuit model and pagerank based method can be seen as the special cases of the information model as we discuss later these approaches have some important_limitations that we seek to overcome specifically in a clear departure from past work here we discuss a novel approach to solving this inference problem by adapting the
