geneious basic an integrated and extendable desktop software platform for the organization and analysis of sequence_data the two main functions of bioinformatics are the organization and analysis of biological data using computational_resources geneious basic has been designed to be an easy to use and flexible desktop software application framework for the organization and analysis of biological data with a focus on molecular sequences and related data types it integrates numerous industry standard discovery analysis tools with interactive_visualizations to generate publication ready images one key contribution to researchers in the life_sciences is the geneious public application_programming api that affords the ability to leverage the existing framework of the geneious basic software platform for virtually unlimited extension and customization the result is an increase in the speed and quality of development of computation tools for the life_sciences due to the functionality and graphical_user available to the developer through the public api geneious basic represents an ideal platform for the bioinformatics community to leverage existing components and to integrate their own specific requirements for the discovery analysis and visualization of biological data availability_and binaries and public api freely_available for download at http www geneious com basic implemented_in and supported on linux apple osx and ms windows the software is also available from the bio linux package repository at http nebc nerc ac uk news research in the biosciences increasingly depends upon bioinformatics for the effective organization and analysis of biological data and experimental_results having access to the appropriate bioinformatics_tools is crucial to the success of any research_project the field of bioinformatics itself has previously been segregated into the parallel realms of data organization to whom correspondence should be addressed current affiliation google inc databases access integration web_services and search tools and data analysis efficient algorithms and statistical_modeling as a result a large proportion of bioinformatics work involves the chaperoning of data from a variety of sources through a pipeline of analysis tools this approach typically involves a number of ad_hoc labor_intensive steps to convert file_formats and create transitional file types geneious basic was created to provide a general framework for research focused bioinformatics tasks to overcome these challenges and take advantage of modern computing trends highlights of the platform include automated database_searching data backup functionality and an extensible api for the integration of novel bioinformatics_analysis tools the geneious basic graphical_user comprises of three main panels a variety of pull_down menus and many right clickthe relationship of a mt co sequence from an unknown source with similar public sequence sequences were identified from genbank using blast sequences were downloaded then aligned using the geneious aligner and a phylogenetic_tree built using phyml all of these steps were performed within geneious basic functions for common bioinformatics analyses geneious basic displays selected file s in a variety of different ways including sequence view linear and circular dotplot view query centric alignment view protein domain view d structure view text view and notes a number of analysis algorithms are implemented within geneious basic for a given document the user can select from among the appropriate analysis tools to process the data for example in the case of a sequence document the user may choose to perform a blast_search for a given query_sequence against a specific online repository align against other sequences or generate protein translations the combinations of available tools and document types allow for the implementation of complex workflows in a single consistent environment geneious basic has an active community of plugin developers using the public api to contribute third_party plugins and additional functionality within geneious the species_delimitation plugin a plugin for summarizing measures of phylogenetic support for userselected collections of taxa on user supplied trees is one example of scientific_research leveraging the geneious public api for publishable academic_research at the time of the writing of this manuscript there were nine available plugins for geneious basic from plugins wrapping industry standard
