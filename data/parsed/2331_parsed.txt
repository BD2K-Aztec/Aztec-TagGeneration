identifying novel associations between small_molecules and mirnas based on integrated molecular_networks motivation mirnas play crucial roles in human_diseases and newly_discovered could be targeted by small_molecule sm drug_compounds thus the identification of small_molecule drug_compounds sm that target dysregulated mirnas in cancers will provide new insight into cancer_biology and accelerate drug_discovery for cancer_therapy results in this study we aimed to develop a novel computational_method to comprehensively identify associations between sms and mirnas to this end exploiting multiple molecular interaction_databases we first established an integrated sm mirna association_network based on sm to sm interactions mirna to mirna associations as well as known sm to mirna targeting pairs then by performing random_walk with restart algorithm on the integrated_network we prioritized the mirnas associated to each of the sms by validating our results utilizing an independent dataset we obtained an area_under greater than furthermore comparisons indicated our integrated approach significantly_improved the identification_performance of those simple modeled methods this computational framework as well as the prioritized sm mirna targeting relationships will promote the further developments of targeted_cancer mirnas are non coding small_rnas with post_transcriptional regulatory_functions and are dysregulated in most of human_cancers approximately half of the known mirnas are located in cancer associated genome_regions or fragile_sites cumulative studies demonstrated that the mature_mirnas as well as their precursors could be targeted by small_molecular drugs a recent_clinical revealed spc a newly_developed drug could successfully inhibit mir which plays_important the duplication of hepatitis c viruses several approaches then were developed to investigate the interactions between small_molecules and mirna structure based_approaches such as molecular_docking is useful for identifying small_molecular compounds that target mirnas jamal et_al employed a chemical descriptors and machine_learning method which is the first and most comprehensive computational_analysis to predict small_molecule modulators of mirna meanwhile based on the hypothesis that similar small_molecules tend to target similar proteins several computational_systems approaches based on large_scale molecular_networks have been applied to identify molecular_interactions related to small_molecules in this study taking together the advantages of above structureor experiment based_methods and the genome_wide exploration of biological_network based_approaches we firstly apply network retrieval methods on integrated biological_interactions to predict small_molecule mirna associations for understanding mirna binding activities of small_molecules this study provides researchers a practical method to identify the biological regulations of small_molecules and will facilitate the further discovery of chemical drug on mirna mediated human complex_diseases
