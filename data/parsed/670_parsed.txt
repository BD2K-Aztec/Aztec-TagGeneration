gene_expression bayesian ensemble methods for survival_prediction in gene_expression data motivation we propose a bayesian ensemble_method for survival_prediction in high_dimensional gene_expression data we specify a fully bayesian hierarchical_approach based on an ensemble sum of trees model and illustrate our method using three popular survival models our non parametric method incorporates both additive and interaction effects between genes which results in high predictive_accuracy compared with other methods in addition our method provides model free variable_selection of important prognostic_markers based on controlling the false_discovery thus providing a unified procedure to select relevant_genes and predict survivor functions results we assess the performance of our method several simulated and real microarray_datasets we show that our method selects genes potentially related to the development of the disease as well as yields predictive_performance that is very competitive to many other existing_methods gene_expression using dna_microarray has successfully identified molecular classes of cancer and revealed gene_expression that are associated with disease_recurrence or prognosis of patient_survival survival_prediction is often formulated in terms of categorical outcomes e g poor versus good prognosis which may be useful for guiding decisions about cancer management and treatment however due to a large degree of heterogeneity observed within prognostic classes prediction of time to a clinical_event occurrence may not be successful improved accuracy of survival_prediction can be attained by relating time to event measures directly with gene_expression which requires specific survival analysis methods that account for the presence of right censored outcomes such as the multivariable cox to whom correspondence should be addressed proportional_hazards cph model and the accelerated_failure aft in our context we define the uncensored survival time as the dependent_variable of interest representing the time to an event such as death or recurrence and a right censored observation is an observation that is lost to follow_up after the period of study in spite of their widespread use in other settings these standard multivariable survival methods cannot be directly applied to clinical outcome_prediction using gene_expression data because the number of covariates genes under investigation is considerably larger than the number of samples patients the large p small n problem many different strategies have been employed to solve this high_dimensionality problem for example clustering techniques have been applied to group correlated sets of genes linear_combinations of covariates obtained by the partial_least method or the principal_components of the design matrix have been used as explanatory_variables in survival regression_models in addition some authors have proposed the use of penalized versions of the cph model l penalized lasso_regression and l penalized ridge_regression versions for estimating parameters while simultaneously performing variable_selection similarly developed penalized variants of the aft model for fitting high_dimensional bayesian techniques for variable_selection have also been developed for weibull and cph models as well as for the aft model although these strategies address the high_dimensionality problem with some degree of success they fail to incorporate complex interactions between genes because they model genes in an additive and linear manner ensemble methods such as bagging boosting and random_forests are flexible alternatives for accommodating variable interactions that are more stable in high_dimensional settings because ensemble methods use a linear combination of trees to fit data variations such that each tree fits part of the data these methods have been shown to have high predictive_accuracy the ensemble methods were originally developed for modeling binary or continuous responses extensions for modeling survival data often called survival ensembles address the censoring problem by growing relative_risk forests bypage we propose bayesian ensemble methods for survival_prediction for high_throughput data such as gene_expression data using a powerful predictive tool bart we model the covariate_effects via a latent_variable scheme that not only allows stochastic deviations from the parameteric model but also greatly_reduces the computational_complexity we chose bart because it has the flexibility to accommodate a high number of covariates and their interactions in addition our primary reason of working under a bayesian paradigm is that the uncertainty in estimation is propagated at each stage of the hierarchy thus the credible_intervals on all our model_parameters are in some sense exact by conditioning on all sources of variation thus using the selected gene_expression one can estimate the median_survival time and credibility intervals for a given patient using the posterior distributions of the process parameters obtained with the aft tree model or alternatively survival_curves along with confidence bounds for the population using the wei tree and cph tree methods although our method is based on the bart page
