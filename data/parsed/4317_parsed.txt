sequence_analysis snvmix predicting single_nucleotide from next_generation of tumors motivation next_generation ngs has enabled whole_genome and transcriptome single_nucleotide snv discovery in cancer ngs produces millions of short_sequence that once aligned to a reference genome_sequence can be interpreted for the presence of snvs although tools exist for snv discovery from ngs_data none are specifically suited to work with data from tumors where altered ploidy and tumor cellularity impact the statistical expectations of snv discovery results we developed three implementations of a probabilistic binomial mixture_model called snvmix designed to infer snvs from ngs_data from tumors to address this problem the first models allelic counts as observations and infers snvs and model_parameters using an expectation_maximization em_algorithm and is therefore capable of adjusting to deviation of allelic_frequencies inherent in genomically unstable tumor_genomes the second models nucleotide and mapping qualities of the reads by probabilistically weighting the contribution of a read nucleotide to the inference of a snv based on the confidence we have in the base call and the read_alignment the third combines filtering out low quality data in addition to probabilistic weighting of the qualities we quantitatively evaluated these approaches on ovarian_cancer rnaseq datasets with matched genotyping_arrays and a human breast_cancer genome sequenced to haploid coverage with ground_truth data and show systematically that the snvmix models outperform competing approaches availability software and data are available atwe have described two statistical_models based on binomial mixture_models to infer snvs from aligned ngs_data obtained from tumors we demonstrated that a probabilistic_approach to modeling allelic counts obviates the need for depth based thresholding of the data and how fitting the model to real_data to estimate_parameters is superior to maq which uses fixed parameter_settings on the assumption that the data come from a normal human_genome in addition we extended the basic binomial mixture to model mapping and base qualities by using a probabilistic weighting technique this eliminates the need to employ arbitrary thresholds on base and mapping qualities and instead lets the model determine the strength of contribution of each read to the inference of the genotype finally we showed that even further gains in accuracy can be obtained by combining moderate thresholding and probabilistic weighting of the base and mapping qualities importantly gains in accuracy by the snvmix models were shown in both transcriptome and genome data
