sequence_analysis isrna an integrative online toolkit for short_reads from high_throughput sequencing_data integrative short_reads navigator isrna is an online toolkit for analyzing high_throughput small_rna sequencing_data besides the high_speed genome_mapping function isrna provides statistics for genomic location length_distribution and nucleotide_composition bias analysis of sequence_reads number of reads_mapped to known micrornas and other classes of short non_coding coverage of short_reads on genes expression abundance of sequence_reads as well as some other analysis functions are also supported the versatile search functions enable users to select sequence_reads according to their sub sequences expression abundance genomic location relationship to genes etc a specialized genome_browser is integrated to visualize the genomic distribution of short_reads isrna also supports management and comparison among multiple datasets availability isrna is implemented_in c perl mysql and can be freely accessed at http omicslab genetics ac cn isrna the wide_application of high_throughput has given rise to significant needs for powerful bioinformatics_tools to analyze the resulting data and retrieve useful information although there have been some web_based and standalone tools for high_throughput small_rna analysis available many of them mainly focus on microrna mirna identification or small_rna characterization few provide comprehensive feature analysis mining as well as visualization and cross sample comparison functions see supplementary table s for detailed comparison here we introduce integrative short_reads navigator isrna an online toolkit for searching analyzing visualizing and comparing short_sequence isrna integrates several useful tools in a user_friendly way besides mapping short_sequence to a given genome and allowing a genome_browser to visualize the position and distribution of sequence_reads isrna also calculates nucleotide_composition identifies known mirnas and their homologous_sequences predicts the secondary_structure for the surrounding genomic_region of a short sequence and reveals genomic small_rna clusters and genes producing small_rnas it also provides versatile searching functions and allows cross dataset comparisons all these functions are easy to use with user_friendly outputs making isrna suitable for researchers with limited bioinformatics skills
