gene_expression networktrail a web_service for identifying and visualizing deregulated subnetworks the deregulation of biochemical_pathways plays_a in many diseases like cancer or parkinsonss disease in silico tools for calculating these deregulated pathways may help to gain new insights into pathogenic_mechanisms and may open novel avenues for therapy stratification in the sense of personalized_medicine here we present networktrail a web_service for the detection of deregulated pathways and subgraphs in biological_networks networktrail uses a state of the art integer_linear based_approach for this task and offers interfaces to the biological_network analyzer bina and cytoscape_web for visualizing the resulting subnetworks by providing an accessible interface to otherwise hard to use command_line the new web_service enables non experts to quickly and reliably carry out this type of network_analyses availability_and networktrail is a javaserver pages based web_service the algorithm for finding deregulated sub networks has been implemented in c networktrail is available atthe deregulation of cell signaling_pathways plays an important role during tumor development to identify such pathways a number of approaches have been developed during the past_decade the method offor the detection of active subgraphs is available as a cytoscape plug in the bionet software developed bycan be downloaded as an r package http www r project org have developed hotnet which is available as matlab source or through a web_interface the algorithms developed byare provided as c source_code we have recently_published an efficient approach based on integer_linear ilp which is available as executable although a multitude of approaches for the analysis of expression data is exposed through web_services e g martnmartn the tools for the search of deregulated subnetworks aforementioned except hotnet have to be downloaded and installed before usage furthermore the majority of the tools do neither provide a graphical_user nor an option to visualize the resulting subgraphs directly instead most of the programs have to be executed from the command_line and their outputs need to be processed using third_party packages thus besides installing the required software properly users are required to possess intricate technical knowledge of the complete tool chain according to our experiences both tasks can be challenging for non expert users an easy to use web_interface hiding such technical_details and thereby allowing the user to focus on the analysis would overcome these problems therefore we have developed a web_interface called networktrail that enables the user to detect deregulated pathways and subgraphs in biological_networks using our recently_published ilp based_approach based on a score for each node that measures the degree of deregulation of the corresponding gene or protein the heaviest connected subnetwork of a specified size k is computed here connectivity means that the subnetwork contains a designated root node from which all other nodes in the subnetwork are reachable this node can be interpreted as a potential molecular key_player responsible for the observed deregulation by computing all such subnetworks in a specified size_range it is possible to directly_assess the stability of the computed result as input the user can specify a gene_expression geo record if the user desires to analyze raw expression data she he currently is required to normalize the data and provide per gene_expression scores after the computations are completed the resulting subnetwork can then be visualized using cytoscape_web or the biological_network analyzer bina http bina sourceforge net in this article we presented networktrail a web_service for detecting deregulated subnetworks in biological_network data the availability of such a web_service allows non experts to carry out network_analyses without having to struggle with technical_details such as compiling installing software or learning cryptic commands we are convinced that such easy to use web_services will help to elucidate pathogenic_mechanisms and that they may also prove to be useful for therapy stratification in cancer_therapy in the future networktrail will be enhanced by including further analysis methods and pre defined networks the user is guided through the workflow from uploading data to visualizing the results for each step a detailed tutorial is available
