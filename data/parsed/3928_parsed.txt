structural_bioinformatics recognizing metal and acid radical ion binding_sites by integrating ab_initio modeling with template based transferals motivation more than half of proteins require binding of metal and acid radical ions for their structure and function identification of the ion binding locations is important for understanding the biological_functions of proteins due to the small_size and high versatility of the metal and acid radical ions however computational_prediction of their binding_sites remains difficult results we proposed a new ligand specific approach devoted to the binding_site of metal_ions zn cu fe fe ca mg mn na k and acid radical ion ligands co no so po that are most frequently seen in protein databases a sequence_based ab_initio model is first trained on sequence_profiles where a modified adaboost algorithm is extended to balance binding and non binding residue samples a composite method ioncom is then developed to combine the ab_initio model with multiple threading alignments for further improving the robustness of the binding_site predictions the pipeline was tested using fold cross_validations on a comprehensive set of non redundant proteins bound with small ion ligands significant_advantage was demonstrated compared with the state of the art ligand_binding methods including coach and targets for high_accuracy ion binding_site identification detailed data analyses show that the major advantage of ioncom lies at the integration of complementary ab ini tio and template based components ion specific feature design and binding library selection also contribute to the improvement of small ion ligand_binding predictions availability and implementationproteins perform their function by interacting with other ligand_molecules more than half of the proteins are found to have the binding interaction with small acid radical and metal_ions to stabilize their structure and regulate the biological_functions for instance the binding of phosphate ions po with protein enzymes can result in phosphorylation that turns the enzymes on and off and therefore alter their function and activity similarly the binding of the metal iron ions fe with hemoglobin is critical for their function for carrying and transferring oxygen through blood a fundamental life process of all vertebrates except for the fish family channichthyidae and some of invertebrates the binding of metal zn ions with nucleases and transcription_factors plays a critical structural role in the formation of zn finger domains for the receptor_proteins to recognize dna and rna_molecules and to up or down regulate the expression of specific genes therefore accurate identification of the proteinion binding_sites is important for understanding the mechanism of protein_function and for new drug_discovery many computational_methods have been proposed in the last two decades for predicting general ligand protein binding_sites which can be roughly grouped into two categories of sequencebased and structure based_approaches the sequence_based mostly rely on residue conservation analyses under the assumption that ligand_binding residues are functionally_important and therefore should be conserved in the evolution although the sequence based_approaches have the advantage in generating binding_site from sequence alone the precision of the predictions is generally low as many nonbinding residues are often conserved due to the diverse roles such as maintaining a stable structural fold the structure based_approaches are designed to predict the ligand_binding either from structure alone e g by the identification of pocket or cavity on the surface of protein_structure or from structure based template comparison and transferal more recently a consensus based_approach coach was proposed to combine multiple structure based_methods which demonstrated considerable advantage over individual component predictors despite the success most of the above ligand_binding modeling_methods have been designed for the ligands of medium to large size and are not optimal for small ligand prediction such as for metal and acid radical ions due to their small_size the interactions of the small ions with proteins are often found significantly more versatile and flexible compared with larger_size ligands in particular many of the current ligandbinding prediction_methods were developed using generic training approaches built on all ligands without carefully discriminating different physicochemical_characteristics for different types of ligand_molecules binding_sites usually differ chemically and structurally in different categories the recent community_wide ligand binding_experiments in casp have suggested the advantage of evaluation on the basis of chemo type categories of ligand_binding an optimal training based on ligand specific feature selections should help improve the small ion binding recognitions in this work we aim to develop new algorithms devoted specifically to the recognition of small ligand_binding ligand specific features will be designed with a focus on the thirteen metal and acid radical ions that have been most frequently seen in the ligandbinding databases and proven to be important to various protein functions to systematically examine the strengths_and of the approach large_scale benchmark tests will be conducted on a comprehensive dataset containing all non redundant ion protein binding_interactions from the pdb which will be compared with the state of the art methods from both generic and ligand specific binding prediction_approaches we presented two ligand specific methods for small ligand_binding predictions from metal and acid radical ions the sequencebased ab_initio method ionseq uses only sequence_information and adopts a modified adaboost method that was extended to eliminate the imbalance effect of the data sample that has been dominated by the non binding residues the second method ioncom combines the ab_initio and template based_methods to generate composite ionbinding site predictions the two methods were tested on a non redundant set of the ion binding_proteins extracted from a semi manually_curated ligandbinding sites database biolip the experimental_results demonstrated the significant_improvement of the composite methods over individual component predictors the detailed data analysis shows that the major_contributions for the improvement are due to the complementarity of the component predictors from different prediction principles meanwhile the ligand specific feature_selection and the adaboost training helped improve accuracy of the sequence_based predictors that are critical for modeling the targets that lack close homologous templates although the generic predictors with ligand nonspecific features have on average a lower mcc training with the generic feature sections can improve the binding_site accuracy of some proteins that bind with multiple ion ligands finally it is found that the training library selection with a manually cleaned and biologically_relevant binding dataset has further impact to enhance the binding_site compared with the automated geometry based binding datasets despite the encouraging data results compared with peer methods the overall accuracy of the current methods is still low for some ions with a high binding variability such as na and k there are also problems for the approaches to identify specific binding locations when multiple_ligands are associated with the same target_proteins future_directions of developments will be to explore more specific feature selections e g integrating physicochemical features of the small ion ligands to increase the specificity of the binding recognitions meanwhile appropriate selection and refinement of the negative sample i e non binding residues should also help to increase the binding_specificity and reduce the noise from non specific ligand_binding
