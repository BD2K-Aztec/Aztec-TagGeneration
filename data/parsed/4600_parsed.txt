databases_and the gmod drupal bioinformatic server framework motivation next_generation have led to the widespread use of omic applications as a result there is now a pronounced bioinformatic bottleneck the general model_organism database gmod tool kit http gmod org has produced a number of resources aimed at addressing this issue it lacks however a robust online solution that can deploy heterogeneous data and software within a web content management system cms results we present a bioinformatic framework for the drupal cms it consists of three modules first gmod dbsf is an application_programming module for the drupal cms that simplifies the programming of bioinformatic drupal modules second the drupal bioinformatic software bench biosoftware bench allows for a rapid and secure deployment of bioinformatic software an innovative graphical_user gui guides both use and administration of the software including the secure provision of pre publication datasets third we present genes all experiment which exemplifies how our work supports the wider research_community conclusion given the infrastructure presented here the drupal cms may become a powerful new tool set for bioinformaticians the gmod dbsf base module is an expandable community resource that decreases development time of drupal modules for bioinformatics the biosoftware bench module can already enhance biologists ability to mine their own data the genes all experiment module has already been responsible for archiving of more than studies of rnai from lepidoptera which were previously unpublished the software presented here was built specifically for the research_communities that are only now emerging into the omics era for example ngs transcriptome_data are widely used to address central biological_questions in non model species but many laboratories do not yet have the means to make the best use of these data due to funding constraints these communities also have a paucity of bioinformaticians developed tools must therefore be general enough so that they can be used between laboratories and also straightforward to customize so that wet_lab biologists with a bit of training in programming can deploy and maintain the software supporting this new cadre of bioinformaticists is vital in order for the communities of emerging model species to reap the rewards that ngs_technologies have to offer we have shown that our software can assist with development of bioinformatic web_services because drupal modules are licensed under the gnu public license and our software was built to be generic and expandable it would be of interest to the bioinformatic community to expand it to assist users and developers we have provided screencast tutorials via another drupal project scivee http scivee tv which can be accessed via http gmod org gmod dbsf we anticipate that the uptake of the drupal cms by the bioinformatic community will result in a powerful new set of tools
