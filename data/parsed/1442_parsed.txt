databases_and dive a data intensive visualization engine modern scientific investigation is generating increasingly larger datasets yet analyzing these data with current_tools is challenging dive is a software framework intended to facilitate big_data analysis and reduce the time to scientific insight here we present features of the framework and demonstrate dives application to the dynameomics project looking specifically at two proteins availability_and binaries and documentation are available at http www dynameomics org dive divesetup exe the advent of massive networked computing_resources has enabled virtually unlimited data_collection storage and analysis from low_cost genome_sequencing high_precision molecular_dynamics simulations and high_definition imaging data for radiology to name just a few examples this explosion of big_data is changing traditional scientific methods instead of relying on experiments to output relatively small targeted datasets data_mining are being used to analyze data stores with the intent of learning from the data patterns themselves unfortunately data analysis and integration in large data storage environments is challenging even for experienced scientists furthermore most existing domain specific tools designed for complex_heterogeneous datasets are not equipped to visually analyze big_data dive is a software framework designed for exploring large heterogeneous high_dimensional using a visual_analytics approach supplementary visual_analytics is a big_data exploration methodology emphasizing the iterative process between human intuition computational_analyses and visualization dives visual_analytics approach integrates with traditional_methods creating an environment that supports data exploration and discovery the impetus for dive was data_mining the dynameomics dataset van_der dynameomics is a large data intensive project that contains atomistic molecular_dynamics md_simulations of the native_state and unfolding pathways of representatives of essentially all protein_folds these protein simulations and associated biophysical analyses are stored in a mixed data_warehouse and file system environment distributed over multiple servers containing hundreds of terabytes of data and times as many structures as the protein_data representing the largest collection of protein_structures and protein simulations in the world in the domain of structural_biology dynameomics exemplifies the challenges of big_data here we present dive applications involving two proteins where specialized modules built on the dive framework are used to accelerate biophysical analysis to whom correspondence should be addressed
