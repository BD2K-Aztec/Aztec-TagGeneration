genome_analysis purityest estimating purity of human tumor_samples using next_generation data we developed a novel algorithm purityest to infer the tumor_purity level from the allelic differential representation of hetero zygous loci with somatic_mutations in a human tumor sample with a matched normal_tissue using next_generation data we applied our tool to a whole cancer_genome datasets and demonstrated the accuracy of purityest compared with dna_copy based estimation availability purityest has been implemented in perl and is available atnext generation sequencing ngs provides a platform to comprehensively characterize somatic_mutations dna_copy changes and rearrangements in tumor_tissues because tumor_tissues usually consist of a mixture of multiple tumor clones and normal cells including fibroblasts and infiltrating lymphocytes the observed magnitude of copy_number changes is diminished which is basis of tumor clone purity estimation using snp_array converted mapped_reads to dna_copy ratios between tumor and normal genomes for purity estimation in principle ngs also provides an alternative to copy_number based_methods which is to use mutant_allele fractions in the heterozygous loci with somatic_mutations in a tumor mixture however modeling the mutant_allele fractions is complicated by two factors one is that mutant_allele fractions in a sample may take multiple levels the founder_mutations may have the higher levels and latent mutations lower levels the second factor is that copy_number change can also alter the observed fractions when the mutant_allele is amplified the observed mutant_allele fraction can be increased when the wild_type allele is amplified lost the mutant_allele fraction can be decreased increased when the mutant_allele is lost the mutant_allele is simply not observable here we propose a simple approach to the purity estimation problem we assume that the tumor_tissue can be largely approximated by a mixture of a normal clone and a tumor clone our method gives a purity estimate from somatic_mutations in each chromosome and takes a robust average of the chromosome wide estimates to be the purity estimate of the tumor_tissue since copy_number changes can both enrich and deplete the fractions of mutated_alleles depending on whether the copy_number change occurs to the mutated allele or the wild allele it is unlikely to affect the chromosome wide estimate drastically
