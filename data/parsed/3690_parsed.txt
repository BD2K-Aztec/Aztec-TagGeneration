genome_analysis premer cg inferring nucleotide level dna methylation_values from methylcap seq data motivation dna_methylation is an epigenetic change occurring in genomic cpg sequences that contribute to the regulation of gene_transcription both in normal and malignant_cells next_generation has been used to characterize dna_methylation at the genome_scale but suffers from high sequencing cost in the case of whole_genome or from reduced resolution inability to precisely define which of the cpgs are methylated with capture based techniques results here we present a computational_method that computes nucleotide_resolution methylation_values from capture based data by incorporating fragment length profiles into a model of methylation analysis we demonstrate that it compares_favorably with nucleotide_resolution bisulfite_sequencing and has better predictive_power with respect to a reference than window based_methods often used for enrichment data the described method was used to produce the methylation data used in tandem with gene_expression to produce a novel and clinically_significant gene_signature in acute myeloid leuke mia in addition we introduce a complementary statistical_method that uses this nucleotide_resolution methylation data for detection of differentially_methylated features availability software in the form of python and r scripts is available at http bioserv mps ohio state edu premer and is free fordna methylation the addition of a methyl_group to cytosine residues in a cpg_dinucleotide pair is one of the best characterized epigenetic changes in eukaryotes and plays_a in silencing gene_transcription in diverse biologic settings including embryonic_development lyonization autoimmunity and cancer in the context of cancer with the discovery that dna_methylation may carry prognostic_information and with the advent of novel dna hypomethylating_agents i e aza nucleosides the study of the biologic diagnostic prognostic and pharmacodynamic role of dna_methylation has immediate relevance in the design of novel treatment approaches a variety of methods to determine dna_methylation have been developed and can be broadly categorized on the basis of methylation readout bisulfite converted versus capture based techniques and of sample or data throughput throughput ranges from low_throughput analysis of a small number of loci e g methylation profiling of tumor_suppressor gene_promoter cpg islands to array based_methods with on the order of probes in the case of the infinium_humanmethylation to next_generation ngs based_approaches that offer high_resolution broad genomic coverage at extremely high_throughput supplementary text and supplementaryfurther describe these techniques and categorize methylation analysis techniques in terms of readout and throughput the gold_standard for the characterization of genome_wide dna_methylation is whole_genome wgbs with the current ngs_platforms data yields in excess of gb per flow cell the costs associated with data generation and analysis for this approach still remain out of reach especially if a relatively large number of patient samples need to be evaluated at diagnosis and at sequential time points after treatment genome complexity reduction methods such as reduced_representation rrbs double enzyme rrbs infinium arrays and goldengate methylation assay have been developed to make bisulfite based_approaches more suitable for large_scale studies however one notable drawback of these methods is the limited proportion of the genome and types of regions these assays interrogate additionally researchers should be aware that the bisulfite_conversion process may occur with limited efficiency and cannot distinguish between the two alternative bases methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine which are likely to have different biologic significance in contrast to methylcytosines to whom correspondence should be addressed dna_methylation is well established as an epigenetic regulator in a wide_variety and recent_years have seen tremendous_progress in the laboratory and computational_techniques of methylation analysis bock et_al analyzed two pairs of samples using two enrichment compared with medip_seq methylcap seq gave rise to peaks of methylated_dna with higher dynamic range higher peaks and lower_baseline signals and the authors noted that bisulfite based_methods generally confirmed the enrichmentbased methods overall when compared with rrbs the methylcap seq method had richer and more even coverage of the entire_genome including within key features such as cpg islands and promoter_regions methylation of which is known to affect transcription capture based_methods in combination with ngs offer the potential of cost_effective whole_genome methylation analysis with the added benefit of the possibility to distinguish alternative cytosine modifications many capture based sequencing methods have been implemented with success assessing methylation in genomic windows typically bp and larger we have previously_published a technique for the analysis of methylcap seq data in which the genome is divided intoknowledge we are the first group to use this highly available yet underused information in dna_methylation analysis using paired rrbs data from the same samples we compared premer cg with our prior bp window based method and demonstrated_superior discriminatory_power in addition we provide a non parametric statistical_method methmage for detecting changes in methylation within a defined genomic_region feature and demonstrated its utility in identifying regions with methylation differences we recognize there are limitations in the present method first these methylation calls are only inferences suitable for discovery and hypothesis_generation important findings must be validated by alternative_techniques second in any pulldown experiment there is an inherent bias vis_a the actual fragments pulled down density and spatial_arrangement of methylated cpgs are known to affect pulldown and there may exist some other unknown_factors that influence the affinity of the methyl binding_domain protein for the dna finally using rrbs as the standard for comparison in the generation of the roc_curves may be complicated by the potential differences in methylation affinities assessed by the two methods i e rrbs may report both methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine while methylcap may report only methylcytosine this confounding_factor may explain the somewhat low reported auc values as dna_methylation analysis is increasingly important in the clinical arena sample_preparation is moving away from manual preparation to automation in manual sample_preparation a gelbased approach is used for fragment selection it produces a tight distribution of fragment sizes although ranges can still vary significantly from sample to sample as depicted in with automation fragment selection is performed by paramagnetic bead selection which produces a broader size_distribution data not shown and a longer fall from one to zero in the ccdf this heightens the importance of a probabilistic_method such as premer cg to take into account library fragment_size an added incentive in using premer cg is its accuracy in estimating the empirical distribution of fragment_size in a sequencing library we compared the premer cg derived fragment_size to fragment_size calculated from aligning paired_end to the genome and found excellent concordance of the distributions supplementary paired_end data from methylcap seq libraries will allow assignment of the true length for each fragment rather than using our probabilistic_approach however paired_end experiments are more costly to that end our method is the most cost_effective means to infer nucleotide level methylation_values for a large clinical_trial the power of this approach is well illustrated by the derivation of a prognostically significant signature by combining gene_expression and methylation data in a cohort of aml patients in conclusion we have presented an algorithm for inferring nucleotide_resolution methylation signal from a capture based technique and a companion statistical_test to detect dimefs using this nucleotide level information discriminatory_power was demonstrated using biological_samples acute_leukemia bm blasts and our approach warrants further study in future_experiments
