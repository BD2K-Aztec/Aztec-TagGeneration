tracking global changes induced in the cd t cell receptor repertoire by immunization with a complex antigen using short stretches of cdr protein_sequence motivation the clonal theory of adaptive_immunity proposes that immunological_responses are encoded by increases in the frequency of lymphocytes carrying antigen specific_receptors in this study we measure the frequency of different t cell receptors tcr in cd t cell_populations of mice immunized with a complex antigen killed mycobacterium_tuberculosis using high_throughput parallel sequen_cing of the tcr chain our initial_hypothesis that immunization would induce repertoire convergence proved to be incorrect and therefore an alternative approach was developed that allows accurate stratifi cation of tcr repertoires and provides novel insights into the nature of cd t cell receptor_recognition results to track the changes induced by immunization within this heterogeneous repertoire the sequence_data were classified by counting the frequency of different clusters of short or continuous stretches of amino_acids within the antigen binding complementarity_determining cdr repertoire of different mice both un supervised hierarchical_clustering and supervised support_vector analyses of these different distributions of sequence clusters differentiated between immunized and unimmunized mice with efficiency the cd tcr repertoires of mice and days_post immunization were clearly different from that of unimmunized mice but were not distinguishable from each other however the repertoires of mice days postimmunization were distinct both from naive mice and the day animals our results reinforce the remarkable diversity of the tcr repertoire resulting in many diverse private tcrs contributing to the t cell response even in genetically identical mice responding to the same antigen however specific motifs defined by short stretches of amino_acids within the cdr region may determine tcr specificity and define a new approach to tcr sequence classification availability_and the analysis was implemented in r and python and source_code can be found in supplementary data adaptive_immunity is carried_out by populations of b and t lymphocytes which collectively express a large set of different antigen specific_receptors created during haemopoesis by a unique process of somatic_cell gene_rearrangements the clonal theory of immunity proposes that lymphocytes carrying receptors that specifically bind an antigen to which the immune system is exposed for example during infection or vaccination respond by proliferating and differentiating this population of expanded and differentiated_cells then confer on the system the ability to respond specifically to the antigen to which they had previously been exposed the clonal theory therefore explains the immune system properties of specificity and memory a prediction of this theory is that the frequency of lymphocytes that have been exposed to antigen i e memory or effector_cells will be greater than the frequency of those that have not i e naive this prediction has been verified for t cells in a wide_variety of models using antigen_specific readouts such as cytokine_responses and major_histocompatibility mhc multimer binding to identify expanded lymphocyte clones the selective expansion of specific clones has also been inferred from global measurements such as v region usage or spectratyping a technique sometimes referred to as the immunoscope previous_studies have distinguished between private t cell receptors tcrs found in one or a few individuals and public tcrs found within the responding repertoire of a majority of individuals the response to many antigens seems to consist of a mixture of public and private specificities the introduction of short_read parallel high_throughput hts provides an alternative approach to measuring lymphocyte receptor frequencies allowing evaluation of the global receptor repertoire of particular lymphocyte populations rearranged receptor genes or their mrna products are expanded and then sequenced directly and the number of times each unique receptor sequence is found is simply counted this approach can in principle generate an accurate estimate of the number of times each unique lymphocyte receptor is present in a particular population and this information should reflect the prior antigen_exposure of the individual several previous to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons

interesting_properties of the bcr and tcr repertoire used hts to show non uniform v d j gene_segment usage in humans during recombination which has been attributed to chromatin conformation complementary work on antibody repertoire diversity has also been conducted in the zebrafish again showing non uniform v d j recombination that is qualitatively conserved between individuals also show that this repertoire is shaped by maturity with a greater skew in v d j usage observed at months compared with week old individuals other studies have used hts to provide unexpected insight into the naive and memory t cell_compartments revealing that the memory compartment may be far more diverse than previously_thought a major_goal is to use the hts lymphocyte receptor sequence_data to identify antigen_specific changes in the repertoire at a global level there remain some major challenges however first hts generates primary sequence_data which cannot be easily mapped onto three_dimensional receptor conformation much less onto intrinsic antigen specificity second current_technologies do not yet provide easy ways to link the two chains of the antigen_specific receptor heavy and light for antibody and or and for t cells at a single_cell level the majority of studies of t cell repertoires using hts have focused only on chains the antigen specificity of the receptor will depend on the pairing of a specific and chain and therefore cannot be inferred from chains alone despite these limitations there are a number of indications that local_features of protein primary structure may contain hidden information that reflects specific proteinprotein interactions_occurring at the level of a fully folded tertiary or quaternary_structure one interesting example is the analysis of conserved amino_acid within a family of homologous_proteins that has recently been used to predict with remarkable accuracy the structure of the fully folded protein on the basis of conserved proteinprotein_interactions consequently some success has also been achieved using a primary protein_structure to predict antibodyantigen docking from a machine_learning perspective these approaches are reminiscent of algorithms that use local low_level features such as individual words or image fragments to produce remarkably efficient classification of complex large_datasets such as sets of documents or images surprisingly good results can be achieved with little regard for the semantic content or meaning of these types of data we thought that local sequence_features could be used to define antigen_specific changes in the tcr repertoire following immunization reflecting underlying information on the nature of interactions between tcr and peptide_mhc in this study we develop an approach based on the well studied bag of words bow algorithm to categorize and classify sets of tcr sequences from immunized and unimmunized mice at different times postimmunization our data highlight the extraordinary diversity of the t cell repertoire which result in every individual mouse expressing a majority of receptors that are unique to that individual within this ocean of diversity conventional methods to identify the antigen_specific component of the response by looking for shared expanded clones are problematic surprisingly however localized sequence_features similar short stretches of adjacent amino_acids can be used to generate a high_dimensional feature_space in which the distinct experimental_groups can be readily_distinguished with a high degree of accuracy short motifs in complementarity_determining cdr primary sequence may therefore play_an in determining tcr specificity our results suggest that the response to antigen may be an emergent property of the repertoire dominated by clones found only in that individual private specificities and distributed over many low_frequency lymphocytes each with different receptors
