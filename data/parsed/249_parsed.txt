systems_biology amigo a toolbox for dynamic modeling optimization and control in systems_biology motivation many problems of interest in dynamic modeling and control of biological_systems can be posed as non linear optimization_problems subject to algebraic and dynamic constraints in the context of modeling this is the case of e g parameter_estimation optimal_experimental and dynamic flux_balance in the context of control model based metabolic_engineering or drug dose optimization_problems can be formulated as multi objective optimal_control problems finding a solution to those problems is a very challenging_task which requires advanced numerical_methods results this work presents the amigo toolbox the first multiplatform software_tool that automa tizes the solution of all those problems offering a suite of state of the art multi objective global optimizers and advanced simulation_approaches availability_and the toolbox and its documentation are available at sites google com site amigo toolbox optimization is at the core of many problems related to the modeling and design of biological_systems for example model parametric identification involves two types of optimization_problems parameter_estimation to compute unknown_parameters by data fitting and optimal_experimental to design the best experimental dynamic scheme for model identification the organization and behavior of biological_systems can also be described based on optimality principles this is the case in e g dynamic flux_balance or in the analysis of activation of metabolic_pathways in this context model based dynamic optimization aims the computation of time varying fluxes or enzyme concentrations and expression rates that minimize or maximize a given objective_function biomass_production or the best trade_off between various objectives models can be used to confirm hypotheses to draw predictions and to find those time varying stimulation conditions that result in a particular desired behavior via multi objective optimal_control this is the case in e g model based metabolic_engineering pattern formation or drug dose_optimization all these problems can be stated asor transformed to multiobjective non linear_programming problems with algebraic and dynamic constraints their solution requires the combination of the control vector parameterization approach a simulation method and a global optimizer amigo is the first multi_platform matlab based environment that automatizes the solution of all these problems seeand supplementary tables s and s it fully covers the iterative identification of dynamic_models it allows using optimality principles for predicting biological_behavior and it deals with the optimal_control of biological_systems using constrained multiobjective dynamic optimization
