systems_biology prediction and early_diagnosis of complex_diseases by edge network motivation in this article we develop a novel edge based network i e edge network to detect early signals of diseases by identifying the corresponding edge biomarkers with their dynamical network bio marker score from dynamical network biomarkers specifically we derive an edge network based on the second order_statistics representation of gene_expression which is able to accurately represent the stochastic dynamics of the original biological system with gaussian_distribution assumption by combining with the traditional node network which is based only on the first order_statistics representation of the noisy_data in other words we show that the stochas tic network of a biological system can be described by the integration of its node network and its edge network in an accurate manner results by applying edge network_analysis to gene_expressions of healthy_adults within live influenza experiment sampling at time points before the appearance of infection symptoms we identified the edge biomarkers edges with densely_connected genes discovered in edge networks corresponding to symptomatic adults which were used to predict the subsequent outcomes of influenza_infection in particular we not only correctly predict the final infection outcome of each individual at an early time point before his her clinic symptom but also reveal the key molecules during the disease_progression the prediction_accuracy achieves under the leave_one furthermore we demonstrate the superiority of our method on disease classification and predication by comparing with the conventional node biomarkers our edge network_analysis not only opens a new way to understand pathogenesis at a network level due to the new representation for a stochastic network but also provides a powerful_tool to make the early_diagnosis of diseases time course data are increasingly used to study dynamical biological_processes or disease_progression like drug treatment or virus_infection that evolves in a stochastic and temporal fashion instead of a snapshot of gene_expression the timecourse gene_expression over several continuous time points allows investigators to study or even predict dynamic behaviors of a biological system based on high_throughput time course data although there are extensive works to identify molecular_biomarkers for diagnosing complex_diseases it is strongly demanded to develop a systematical framework by exploiting such dynamical and stochastic information to predict early signals of disease_states and also their occurrence times from both theoretical and computational viewpoint which is also crucial to achieve predictive and preventive_medicine in particular molecular_network is widely used to analyze the molecular response as well as biomarkers for distinguishing disease and normal samples traditionally a molecular_network with node e g gene or protein as basic element i e nodenetwork is constructed mainly in the following two ways one is to extract the conditional existence of known molecular_interactions which consist of a subnetwork induced from a given background network such as weighted correlation network_analysis the other is to directly infer de_novo molecular associations which represent a significant topological_structure connecting molecules such as aracne infergrn and narromi this network can represent associations or interactions among molecules but cannot directly describe the stochastic dynamics of a biological system generally a biological system at a molecular level can be described by stochastic dynamics modeled by a master_equation as shown in with the linearization and gaussian_distribution assumption the system can be exactly expressed by two sets of equations i e one for the mean vector of molecules used in first order_statistics representation and another for the covariance_matrix of molecules used in second order_statistics representation however the traditional molecular_network e g gene network or protein_interaction is based only on the equations of mean vector rather than the equations of covariance_matrix e g a set of linear equations for molecular concentrations which cannot represent whole stochastic dynamics of the original system i e it is the representation of a biological system without any stochastic fluctuation or with zero noise different from to whom correspondence should be addressed those conventional node networks we propose a new edge based network i e edge network to exploit higher order_statistics information among molecules where a node represents a pair of the connecting nodes i e an edge in the traditional nodenetwork as indicated in the edge network is based on the covariance_matrix of molecules governed by lyapunov differential_equation in an edge network a node is not a molecule but a pair of molecules i e an edge and a link represents the relationship between two molecule pairs i e between two edges rather than between two molecules as in a node network clearly an edge network reflects the secondorder statistics information and therefore theoretically with gaussian_distribution assumption on each molecule expression it is able to recover stochastic dynamics of the original biological system by combining with the node network first order_statistics recent_studies show that the second order_statistics information can be used to predict the predisease state the state of an individual before the appearance of clinical_symptom and thus achieve the early_diagnosis of a disease by detecting its dynamical network biomarker dnb in contrast to the molecular_network that is mainly used to identify molecular_biomarkers or nodebiomarkers for the diagnosis of a disease thus one major advantage of the edge network is its predictive_power for early_diagnosis of a disease which can not only predict the future occurrence of a disease but also estimate the critical time when the change from a normal to a disease_state happens as shown in the progression of the disease_progression e g influenza_infection can be considered to have three stages or states i e i normal stage possibly with the gradual progression of the disease ii predisease stage that is considered as the limit of the normal stage just before the disease symptom appears and iii disease or infection stage after the disease symptom appears our edge biomarkers derived from the edge network are able disease_progression dnbs and time course gene_expression of healthy_adults within live influenza experiment a the progression of the influenza_infection can be considered to have three stages i e i normal stage with the gradual progression of the disease ii predisease stage that is considered as the limit of the normal stage just before the symptom appears and iii disease or infection stage after the symptom appears b edge biomarkers or dnbs are able to identify the predisease stage due to dynamical and higher order_statistics information and therefore predict the outcome of the influenza_infection before the symptom appears c the biological time course expression data contains subjects challenged with influenza h n wisconsin for which subjects are infected sx whereas subjects stay healthy asx finally gene_expression were obtained and measured on whole peripheral_blood drawn from all subjects at an interval of h post_inoculation hpi through hpi in all gene microarrays were obtained for all subjects at time points including baseline hpi for the purpose of the prediction we only use the data with non symptom to identify the edge biomarkers node network and edge network for a biological system a biological system at a molecular level can be modeled as a master_equation where p is the probability of x w is the propensity function x is the numbers or concentrations of molecules following gaussian_distribution with a mean vector and a covariance_matrix and s is the changes of molecules by liberalizing the master_equation we have two sets of the equations i e one is linear equations corresponding to the traditional molecular_network or node network which is based only on the firstorder statistics information or average values of molecules and another is lyapunov differential_equations corresponding to our edge network which is based on the second order_statistics information or covariance between molecules theoretically the information from those two level statistics can fully recover the stochastic dynamics of the original system the first order_statistics information or traditional node network is used to distinguish the disease and normal samples for disease diagnosis by identifying molecular_biomarkers or node biomarkers whereas the second order_statistics information or edge network is able to distinguish the predisease and normal samples by identifying edge biomarkers or dnbs thereby achieving the early_diagnosis or the prediction of the disease to identify the predisease stage due to its dynamical and additional covariance information and therefore predict the outcome of the complex disease e g influenza_infection before the clinic symptom appears specifically by applying edge network_analysis to gene_expression of healthy_adults within time points across the whole live influenza experiment we discovered edges with densely_connected genes involved in edge networks of most symptomatic adults before the appearance of clinic symptom which were used as edgebiomarkers to predict the subsequent outcomes of influenza_infection for each individual our results indicated that those edge biomarkers in this case have similar dynamical features to dnb in particular the results show that these edge biomarkers can predict the outcomes of influenza_infection with accuracy under leave_one loocv i e not only predict the final infection outcome of each individual or subject but also estimate the early time point of the subsequent infection furthermore we compare the results with the conventional biomarkers and methods and also conduct the functional analysis on the edge biomarkers which all demonstrate the superiority of our method on disease classification and prediction we also investigate the molecular_mechanism of the disease development after virus_infection by analyzing the identified key molecules at the critical time points in all our edge network_analysis opens a new way to deeply understand disease_progression e g influenza_virus induced pathogenesis from dynamical features and higherorder statistics information of big biological data and also provides a powerful_tool to prevent disease occurrence or make the early_diagnosis of a disease for each individual although there already have many elegant experiments of the study of host response to invading_pathogens how to predict the outcome of the influenza_infection from the observed data before the appearance of disease symptom and what are the key molecules to result in the transition from a healthy state to a disease_state still remain_unclear thus we carried edge network_analysis on the biological data gse downloaded from ncbi geo which tried to predict live influenza_infection
