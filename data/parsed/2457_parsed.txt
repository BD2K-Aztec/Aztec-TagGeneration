data_and inferring microrna mrna causal regulatory_relationships from expression data motivation micrornas mirnas are known to play_an in the post_transcriptional in plants and animals currently several computational_approaches have been developed with a shared aim to elucidate mirnamrna regulatory_relationships although these existing computational_methods discover the statistical relationships such as correlations and associations between mirnas and mrnas at data level such statistical relationships are not necessarily the real causal regulatory_relationships that would ultimately provide useful insights into the causes of gene regulations the standard method for determining causal_relationships is randomized controlled perturbation experiments in practice however such experiments are expensive_and our motivation for this study is to discover the mirnamrna causal regulatory_relationships from observational_data results we present a causality discovery based method to uncover the causal regulatory relationship between mirnas and mrnas using expression_profiles of mirnas and mrnas without taking_into the previous target information we apply this method to the epithelial_to emt datasets and validate the computational discoveries by a controlled biological experiment for the mir family a significant portion of the regulatory_relationships discovered in data is consistent with those identified by experiments in addition the top genes that are causally regulated by mirnas are highly_relevant to the biological conditions of the datasets the results indicate that the causal discovery method effectively discovers mirna regulatory_relationships in data although computational predictions may not completely replace intervention experiments the accurate and reliable discoveries in data are cost_effective for the design of mirna experiments and the understanding of mirnamrna regulatory_relationships availability the r scripts are in the supplementary_material contact thuc duy micrornas mirnas are short nt endogenous non_coding that regulate_gene by promoting mrna_degradation and repressing translation they recognize target_mrnas by base_pairing to complementary_sequences in the untranslated_region utr of the target_mrna mirnas have also been observed to target_genes through sites in the utr and sometimes in the open_reading it has been demonstrated in a body of literature that mirnas regulate a wide_range in proliferation metabolism differentiation esquela development apoptosis cellular signalling and even cancer_development since the advent of microarray_data on gene_expression programs various statistical data_mining methods have been devised in recent_years in an attempt to discover the mirnamrna regulatory_relationships this research into the regulatory_relationships between mirnas and mrnas can be recognized in two main streams in the first stream researchers developed various methods to identify a group of co expressed mirnas and mrnas in data for instance applied bayesian_network parameter learning proposed a population_based probabilistic learning model andused a rule_based method in the second stream attempts were made to predict the regulatory_networks of mirnas and mrnas for specific biological_processes some highlights in this direction includeapplying a probabilistic graphic model adopted from the authortopic model in information_retrieval using bayesian_network learning andproposing a graphical_model inspired by the correspondence latent_dirichlet these methods although varied all identify only the statistical relationships in the data these relationships are either correlations or associations between the two types of variables mirna and mrna however correlations or associations are not causality for instance the expression values of an mirna to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com and an mrna may be strongly correlated across samples but it is not sufficient to conclude that the mirna regulates the mrna the strong correlation between the mirna and the mrna may be a result of the mrna regulating the mirna or a third molecule regulating both the mirna and the mrna in this article our ultimate_goal is to discover which mirnas causally regulate which mrnas a regulatory relationship between an mirna and an mrna means that a change in the expression_level of the mirna will result in a change in the expression_level of the mrna associations or correlations are not the right tools to test the causal hypothesis therefore we aim to discover the causal_effects of an mirna on an mrnas we refer to this causal_effect as mirna causal regulatory relationship to emphasize the difference between causal discovery and statistical discovery the gold_standard method for tackling this problem is randomized control experiments for example we can use gene_knockdown experiments to knockdown mirnas one by one while measuring changes i e causal_effects in the expression_level of mrnas however such experiments are time consuming expensive and not necessarily definitive fortunately with the foundation created by the recent_advances in causal discovery research have opened the door to discovering causal_relationships from observational_data instead of conducting controlled experiments we can use do calculus to estimate the causal_effects of a variable on other variables based on observational_data the do calculus requires a causal structure of the variables to be given as a dag directed_acyclic however such a structure is often unknown in reality to bridge the gap proposed a method to estimate causal_effects from observational_data alone the method is called intervention calculus when the dag is absent ida and it includes two main phases i to learn a causal structure from observational_data and ii to apply do calculus to infer causal_effects our method is based on ida given the observational_data of variables ida can capture the causal_effects of the variables on one single response variable we extend the application of ida and build our model for multiple response variables and then apply the model to discover the mirna causal regulatory_relationships in our problem mirnas and mrnas are nodes or variables in the model and observational_data are the expression_profiles of the mirnas and mrnas we can view genes as subjects and mirnas as analogous to treatments which may have causal_effects on the responses i e expression levels of the genes our aim is to measure the causal_effect of each mirna on mrnas applying this approach we tackle two drawbacks of current mirna regulatory_relationships research first the method discovers causal_relationships between mirnas and mrnas not just the statistical relationships second we assume that mirnas and mrnas interact with each other in a complex system for instance an mirna can causally regulate mrnas as well as other mirnas this assumption is more reasonable than the commonly used approach that considers only the bipartite of interactions between mirnas and mrnas for example shows that let can regulate other non_coding including mirnas in this work we first derive the solution to discover the causal mirna regulatory_relationships based on the ida approach then we apply the method to the epithelial_to emt datasets we implement a controlled experiment for the mir family to validate the results the outcome shows that the causal mirna regulatory_relationships discovered using our method largely overlap the findings from the experiment suggesting that the causal_relationships between mirnas and mrnas can be identified from expression_profiles in this section we present the results and analysis of applying our algorithm to the nci dataset for emt
