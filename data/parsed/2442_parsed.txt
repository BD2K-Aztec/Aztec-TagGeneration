inferring cancer subnetwork markers using density constrained biclustering motivation recent genomic studies have confirmed that cancer is of utmost phenotypical complexity varying greatly in terms of subtypes and evolutionary stages when classifying cancer tissue_samples subnetwork marker approaches have proven to be superior over single gene marker approaches most importantly in cross_platform evaluation schemes however prior subnetwork based_approaches do not explicitly address the great phenotypical complexity of cancer results we explicitly address this and employ density constrained biclustering to compute subnetwork markers which reflect pathways being dysregulated in many but not necessarily all samples under consideration in breast_cancer we achieve substantial improvements over all cross_platform applicable approaches when predicting tp mutation status in a well established non cross_platform setting in colon_cancer we raise prediction_accuracy in the most difficult instances from to for cancer versus non cancer and from to astonishing for with versus without liver_metastasis in well established cross_platform evaluation schemes availability software is available on request contact throughout the decades cancer has been not only a most daunting but also most intriguing disease to study it is daunting since it persistently keeps escaping our deeper_understanding while at the same time it is the reason for as many as of human deaths worldwide as a mere object to study however it is also most fascinating since it is crucially entangled with the mechanisms which are responsible for cellular welfare clearly a deeper_understanding of cancer would shed light on a wealth of aspects being essential for eukaryotic life in the meantime there has been abundant evidence that cancer is phenotypically of utmost complexity on one hand most recent_studies on cancer_genomes reveal the extent of dna_damage hampton to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint last numbers of copy_number and genomic_rearrangements are so large that one can hardly believe that cancer_cells are viable at all on the other hand it has been well known that cancer_cells evolve starting out as healthy human cells they gradually undergo phenotypical changes through accumulating genomic_alterations first transforming into malignant and finally into metastatic and or therapy_resistant specimens in conclusion it is safe to assume that no two cancer_genomes of two different people at least at first glance even look similar and even one persons cancer is made up by a variety of different cell_types belonging to the different stages of cancer evolution nevertheless it is possible to classify cancer to identify subtypes common to many people and also to cure or at least to slow down progression in many patients by means of identical therapy protocols therefore one of the most driving questions in most recent research is to reveal the genetic_alterations common to all cancer_cells within and also across its many subtypes to successfully classify cancer tissue_samples one needs reliable criteria on the biomolecular level that is disease markers while markers serve as indicators of cancer and or its subtypes in the first place they can also point at the crucial processes and perturbations giving rise to cancer such that it may be worth studying them beyond their role as classification features in a seminal study successfully identified_differentially which can successfully distinguish between two leukemia subtypes similar approaches determined differentially_expressed for b_cell breast van and lung_cancer which served as monogenic that is single gene markers sgms however sgm sets determined based on differential_expression varied_considerably when inferring them from different platforms such that they were useless in cross_platform studies hence of no universal applicability finally pointed_out that multigenic markers were able to address_this multigenic markers consist of several differentially_expressed which also form a connected region in proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks and proved to be more stable predictors in cross_platform evaluation schemes similar approaches followed where only the latter focuses on cancer while the primary purpose of subnetwork marker computation is to provide cross_platform applicable indicators of disease they can also yield further insights on cancer because they usually reflect parts of dysregulated pathways
