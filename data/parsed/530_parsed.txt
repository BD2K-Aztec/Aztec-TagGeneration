phylogenetics assigning duplication_events to relative temporal scales in genome_wide studies motivation in genome_wide analyses the relative age of gene_duplications is often estimated by measuring the rate of synonymous_substitutions ds between paralogous sequences on the other hand recent_studies the feasibility of inferring at genomic scales the relative age of duplication_events from the topology of gene_family trees this represents a promising alternative for large surveys requiring an automatic methodology to establish a timeline of duplication_events and that are usually limited to the use of ds which presents known limitations such as a fast saturation of the signal however both measures have never been compared in a common framework results topology based placement of duplications on a relative time scale corresponding to periods between speciation_events were found to be highly_consistent providing the same placement for of a reliable set of gene_pairs duplicated in a single_event for recent evolutionary periods ds and topological measures showed a strong correlation we conclude that the topology based_approach is more appropriate for assigning duplications to temporal scales when analyses need to include ancient events and that the study of recent duplications may benefit from a combination of ds and topology_information the level of sequence_divergence between two related protein_coding can be expressed as the corrected number of residue substitutions occurring at the level of their dna_sequences these substitutions can be classified as non synonymous or synonymous depending on whether the nucleotide_change results in a amino_acid in the encoded_protein since synonymous_substitutions are considered relatively free of selective_pressures at least at the protein level these are often assumed to accumulate with time in a linear fashion that depends on the species generation time and mutation_rates accordingly the rate of synonymous to whom correspondence should be addressed substitutions between two sequences ds is extensively used as a proxy for their relative divergence time in the particular case of genes that diverged through duplication paralogs ds is often used as an estimator for the relative age of the duplication event i e to ascertain which duplications are more recent or ancient with respect to the others without necessarily assigning a specific date for the duplication many recent_studies have used this methodology to address the evolution of duplicate genes at a genomic_scale however in such studies the central assumption that ds increments linearly with time in the ranges considered is never tested possibly due to a lack of appropriate benchmarks most importantly a significant number of the detected duplications are discarded due to saturated ds values usually applying a threshold that is set around ds it must be noted that all these studies were well aware of the effects of ds saturation and therefore this measure was applied within appropriate limits however the implications that the possible sampling effect may have in the generality of their conclusions are usually not discussed the effect of ds saturation has been described earlier and constitutes one of the main known limitations of this methodology additionally other necessary assumptions such as the existence of a molecular_clock or the absence of selection at synonymous sites have been shown to be often violated in the light of such caveats alternative_methods such as assigning duplication_events to a relative temporal scale based on the topology of phylogenetic_trees may prove more adequate here we will refer to this methodology as phylogeny based relative dating phylogeny based relative dating uses the species relationships determined by the gene tree_topology to locate speciation and duplication_events this can be done by using a more or less sophisticated algorithm to reconcile the gene_tree with a known species_tree see for instance or alternatively by simply detecting overlaps in the species content between the daughter branches of a given tree node in either approach the relative age of each duplication is subsequently inferred according to the species found in the post duplication branches of the tree this is considering that a duplication event should have preceded all speciations found in more recent branches such event is assumed to have occurred prior to the most ancient of the subsequent speciation_events in contrast to ds phylogeny based relative dating does not provide a continuous scale of time but it only assigns duplicationsoverall our results show the strengths and caveats of using ds rates or phylogeny based relative dating as a proxy for estimating relative divergence times in genome_wide studies saturation of ds rates is a well known limitation and accordingly all studies use this measure within appropriate limits however the extent to which ds saturation is affecting genome_wide studies is generally not quantified alternative_strategies based on phylogeny based relative dating such as the one proposed by us have shown to be consistent and less prone to saturation hence being ideal for assigning ancient duplications to relative temporal scales the use of phylogenetic_trees to detect duplication_events and provide a relative age has the additional advantage of allowing a better resolution in the detection of paralogy relationships for instance phylogenetic_trees can differentiate among one toone one to many and many to many relationships thus better accounting for the complexity of the evolution of large gene_families moreover phylogeny based relative dating provides relative age estimates that can be readily associated with specific evolutionary periods that is they can be framed within the context of the speciation_events observed in the tree implementations of this method in large_scale phylogenetic_analysis tools such as ete or mantis will enable its wider use in genome_wide analyses aimed at addressing relevant questions such as the content of ancestral_genomes or the discovery of functional trends in duplicated_genes it must be noted however that there is still room for improvement since a correct topological mapping relies on the quality of the underlying phylogenetic_tree the absence of horizontal_transfer events the breadth and density of taxonomic sampling and our level of understanding of the phylogeny of the species involved in this context as noted before and confirmed here the presence of low coverage genomes may result in largely incorrect phylogeny based relative datings at affected nodes in such scenarios ds relative dating would be more reliable providing that the affected nodes fall within the non saturated range considering all this the combination of both strategies may provide best results in the evolutionary_analysis of gene_duplication for instance the use of phylogeny based relative dating can provide a reliable overview of the relative age of the duplications under study as well as establishing the limits of ds saturation subsequently ds can be used to provide a more detailed view on the sequence_divergence within the subset of most recent duplications being aware of the advantages and limitations of both methodologies as well as combining them in a sensible manner will increase our analytical potential and most importantly avoid possible misinterpretation of the data
