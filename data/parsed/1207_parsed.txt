cross_species common regulatory_network without requirement for prior gene affiliation motivation cross_species meta_analyses of microarray_data usually require prior affiliation of genes based on orthology information that often relies on sequence_similarity results we present an algorithm merging microarray_datasets on the basis of co expression alone without any requirement for orthology information to affiliate genes combining existing_methods such as co inertia analysis back transformation hungarian matching and majority_voting in an iterative non greedy hill climbing approach it affiliates arrays and genes at the same time maximizing the co structure between the datasets to introduce the method we demonstrate its performance on two closely and two distantly_related datasets of different experimental context and produced on different platforms each pair stems from two different species the resulting cross_species dynamic bayesian gene_networks improve on the networks inferred from each dataset alone by yielding more significant network_motifs as well as more of the interactions already recorded in kegg and other databases also it is shown that our algorithm converges on the optimal number of nodes for network_inference being readily extendable to more than two datasets it provides the opportunity to infer extensive gene_regulatory availability_and source_code matlab and r freely_available for download at http www mchips org supplements microarray_technique albeit barely older than a decade is now both mature and ubiquitous accumulating an unprecedented amount of quantitative genome_wide information although each study is conducted to generate valuable insights in and of itself it becomes more and more desirable to put them into a larger context various meta_analysis techniques combine individual studies conducted by different authors were among the first authors to introduce meta_analysis for microarray_data most meta_analysis studies have to whom correspondence should be addressed been performed on cancer in this field of research biomaterial is often limited in other cases the price for the microarrays is the bottleneck in typical microarray_based studies tens_of of genes variables are only investigated across at most hundreds of biological_samples observations the asymmetry of the data tables poses a problem for inferring_gene grn by reverse_engineering alleviating the asymmetry by combining the datasets therefore largely increases their use for systems_biology a multitude of algorithms have been reported for network_inference from gene_expression data dynamic_bayesian dbn capture conditional_independence between variables they are relatively easy to interpret yielding directed_graphs they can handle noisy_data and even feedback_loops in biological_systems in order to maximize the number of samples accounted for in one grn reverse_engineering step it seems preferable for any method to first combine the data instead of combining the resulting networks later on several methods can be applied to this end however all of these methods take as input the affiliation of genes between the datasets when combining data stemming from different species sequence_homology can be used to affiliate orthologs however due to the ambiguity of orthology relations mapping across species is challenging lineage_specific gene_duplications can give rise to a different number of paralogs in one species compared to another species one cannot tell which paralog or in paralog retains the function of the ancestral gene or has been co opted into a new function we present a way of combining datasets that does not need any genes or samples to be affiliated beforehand while such information can be easily incorporated to assist the process our algorithm also performs well without being provided with any affiliations purely driven by coherences among the data that opens_the to fully_automated combining and modeling of all microarray_datasets accumulated to date
