sequence_analysis pybamview a browser_based application for viewing short read_alignments current sequence_alignment browsers allow visualization of large and complex next_generation datasets however most of these tools provide inadequate display of insertions and can be cumbersome to use on large_datasets i implemented pybamview a lightweight web_application for visualizing short read_alignments it provides an easy to use web_interface for viewing alignments across multiple samples with a focus on accurate visualization of insertions availability_and pybamview is available as a standard python_package the source_code is freely_available under the mit_license at https mgymrek github io pybamview the rapid_growth of next_generation ngs_technologies has led to a wide_variety of short_read dna datasets manual_inspection of sequence_alignments is an important aspect of quality_control while the majority of ngs analyses have focused on single_nucleotide snps recent bioinformatics advances allow analysis of more complicated variants such as small_insertions larger structural_variants and short_tandem furthermore widely used genome_engineering techniques such as the crispr_cas system can often produce a wide_range of complex variants in these cases visualization of insertion_and is a particularly critical analysis step current genome_browsers such as the ucsc_genome and the integrative_genomics igv offer visualization of alignments from sam bam_files across multiple samples and integration of many layers of genomics datasets however most existing_tools have two important_limitations first most are based on alignments to an ungapped reference_sequence which provides inadequate visualization of insertions the sam specification supports a padded reference which captures multiple_sequence information and results in accurate insertion display by most browsers however most bam_files consist of pairwise_alignments of short_reads to a reference and do not use this feature as a result insertions are represented by an icon such as a vertical bar which does not provide any visual_information about the size or sequence of the inserted nucleotides second the majority of alignment browsers are cumbersome to use especially to visualize the large_datasets typical of ngs experiments they either require that the user upload large data_files to a remote server or involve complicated installation and large resource requirements to run locally several alignment browsers such as bambino consed and the text_based samtools tview overcome_these they display the sequence of insertions even when using the standard ungapped reference and are run locally with relatively low system requirements however tview does not allow the user to view multiple bam_files at once and none of these tools allow for exporting alignments as snapshots or for sharing alignments remotely through a web_browser here i present pybamview a lightweight web_application for viewing alignments from bam_files pybamview provides alignment visualizations that accurately represent snp insertion_and that can easily be exported to create publicationready figures it runs locally from the command_line with minimal resource requirements and displays alignments in a web_browser this interface allows users to quickly view alignments locally and to easily share alignments with local or remote collaborators
