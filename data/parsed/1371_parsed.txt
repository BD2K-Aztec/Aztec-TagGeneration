deterministic identification of specific individuals from gwas results motivation genome_wide gwass are commonly_applied on human genomic_data to understand the causal gene combinations statistically connected to certain diseases patients involved in these gwass could be re identified when the studies release statistical_information on a large number of single_nucleotide subsequent work however found that such privacy attacks are theoretically possible but unsuccessful and unconvincing in real settings results we derive the first practical privacy attack that can successfully_identify specific individuals from limited published associations from the wellcome_trust wtccc dataset for gwas results computed over randomly_selected loci our algorithm always pinpoints at least one patient from the wtccc dataset moreover the number of re identified patients grows rapidly with the number of published genotypes finally we discuss prevention methods to disable the attack thus providing a solution for enhancing patient privacy availability_and proofs of the theorems and additional experimental_results are available in the support online documents the attack algorithm codes are publicly_available at https sites google com site zhangzhenjie gwas attack zip the genomic dataset used in the experiments is available at http www wtccc org uk on request genome_wide gwas are widely used to identify loci in the human_genome associated with a specific diseases the basis of these studies is to associate single_nucleotide snps or genotypes with the disease phenotype in a casecontrol design although a scientific article may present gwas results at low precision e g correlation between genotypes shown only in a heat map detailed and accurate results are often available upon request it is standard to protect the privacy of the participating subjects by keeping patient identities confidential since gwas results are statistical in nature until recently most researchers believed that it is safe to share and publish such deidentified results this belief was challenged by recent bioinformatics which shows that it is theoretically possible to re identify individual participants using only aggregate genomic_data notably describe the first such method based on statistical_hypothesis this method requires aggregate information from many genotypes e g tens_of to obtain high_confidence regarding an individuals presence in the aggregate in contrast a gwas usually publishes statistics for a much smaller number of genotypes therefore using the approach suggested by homer et_al access to the whole genotype association dataset would be necessary to accomplish this identification access to such complete datasets is restricted and limited only to qualified biomedical_researchers with proper vetting e g refer to nihs policy for sharing gwas data http grants nih gov grants guide notice files not od html propose a more ambitious approach that aims to find all genotypes for every patient in the gwas this attack however rarely succeeds because the number of unknowns far exceeds the number of known values in fact wang et_al report only one particular synthetic gwas involving snps and patients on which the attack succeeded a follow_up study tested this attack with gwas instances from randomly_selected sets of snps and did not find any instance on which the attack succeeded we conclude that none of the existing_methods poses a direct threat to gwas participants privacy based on the data that is presented in standard publications in data security the development of effective countermeasures requires the identification of a successful attack algorithm in this article we devise a strong privacy attack on published gwas results which successfully identifies specific patients by using a strategy of constructing deterministic proofs of study inclusion
