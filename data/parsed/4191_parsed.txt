systems_biology senssb a software toolbox for the development and sensitivity analysis of systems_biology models senssb sensitivity analysis for systems_biology is an easy to use matlab based software toolbox which integrates several local and global sensitivity methods that can be applied to a wide_variety of biological_models in addition to addressing the sensitivity analysis problem senssb aims to cover all the steps involved during the modeling process the main features of senssb are i derivative and variance based global sensitivity analysis ii pseudo global identifiability analysis iii optimal_experimental oed based on global sensitivities iv robust parameter_estimation v local sensitivity and identifiability analysis vi confidence_intervals of the estimated parameters and vii oed based on the fisher_information fim senssb is also able to import models in the systems_biology sbml format several examples from simple analytical functions to more complex biological_pathways have been implemented and can be downloaded together with the toolbox the importance of using sensitivity analysis techniques for identifying unessential parameters and designing new experiments is quantified by increased identifiability metrics of the models and decreased confidence_intervals of the estimated parameters availability senssb is a software toolbox freely downloadable from http www iim csic es gingproc senssb html the web_site also contains several examples and an extensive documentation sensitivity analysis sa is receiving an increasing attention in the field of systems_biology and several tools have been developed namely sbml sat potterswheel and systems_biology toolbox however neglecting any of the steps of the model_building cycle as considered in the area of systems identification can lead to wrong models or models with a low predictive capacity that is why in senssb the use of global optimization_methods for parameter_estimation pe and optimal_experimental oed has been coupled with other computational procedures based on sa for checking identifiability and other related measures another additional advantage is that to whom correspondence should be addressed the toolbox is able to handle deterministic non linear dynamic_models described by sets of ordinary_differential odes differential algebraic equations daes or even black boxes model_building can be regarded as a cycle starting from a goal definition purpose of the model and some a priori_knowledge e g preliminary data and initial_hypothesis a model framework is chosen and a model structure system of equations is proposed the validity of this structure should be tested by means of an identifiability analysis e g making use of sa tools that can help to identify critical and negligible parameters and to establish a parameter ranking if experimental_data are available pe is then carried_out leading to a first model otherwise a set of experiments must be designed and performed before the pe the quality of these estimators should be assessed by checking the correlation between them and computing their confidence_intervals this initial model must be validated with new experiments which in most cases will reveal a number of deficiencies thus a new model structure and or a new experimental_design must be planned and the process is repeated iteratively until the validation step is considered satisfactory all these tasks were implemented in matlab generating gateways for calling external fortran codes when needed these fortran codes were implemented as matlab mex files leading to an integrated environment able to perform robust pe identifiability analysis and oed of dynamic experiments moreover senssb includes a novel methodology for performing oed based on global sensitivities with a great_potential on the systems_biology field where experiments can be very expensive_and in order to make the problem implementation easier senssb includes a user_friendly graphical_interface where the model and other inputs e g initial_values measurement times control variables etc can be specified the matlab gui graphical_user generates an input_file that senssb uses for performing all the requested tasks as detailed below results are displayed on the screen and saved as an output_file together with several graphic files
