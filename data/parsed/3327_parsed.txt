structural_bioinformatics omokage search is a service to search the global shape similarity of biological_macromolecules and their assemblies in both the protein_data pdb and electron_microscopy data bank emdb the server compares global shapes of assemblies independent of sequence_order and number of subunits as a search query the user inputs a structure id pdb id or emdb id or uploads an atomic model or d density_map to the server the search is performed usually within min using one dimensional profiles incremental distance rank profiles to characterize the shapes using the gmfit gaussian_mixture fitting program the found structures are fitted onto the query structure and their superimposed structures are displayed on the web_browser our service provides new structural perspectives to life_science researchers availability_and omokage search is freely_accessible at http pdbj org omokage electron_microscopy of cellular macromolecules provides d density maps of many important molecular machines more than density maps are now stored in the electron_microscopy data bank emdb atomic_models obtained by x_ray and the current hybrid method are also available in the protein_data pdb we have been providing web_based services em navigator and yorodumi for both databanks shape comparisons among these d density maps and atomic_models facilitate the elucidation of structural_differences and conformational changes and the generation of atomic_models from the density maps however very few web_services look for shapes represented as d density maps that are similar to the atomic_models the web_server em surfer was recently_developed for searching d density maps however it only handles d density maps in the emdb and not in the pdb and does not provide d superimpositions here we describe our new search service omokage search based on the global shape similarity of the structure data for both the pdb and emdb our server provides superimposed structures using the program gmfit users can visually assess the similarities by the d superimpositions
