databases_and non redundant compendium of human ncrna genes in genecards in recent_years there has been a massive expansion of knowledge regarding the non coding rna ncrna gene universe following the encode_project it is now accepted that while of the genome is transcribed only of the genome is protein_coding whereas an increasing body of evidence_supports the existence of purifying_selection as well as binding of transcription_factors to regulate the expression of ncrna genes and lends strength to some ncrna entries it is still unclear what fraction of this immense molecular repertoire is functional furthermore well documented ncrna genes do not exceed of all transcripts obviously this state of affairs points to a potential of tremendous future augmentation of ncrna gene counts some classes of ncrna genes e g rrna and trna have been known for a very long time while the discovery of the diversity and magnitude of ncrna genes has been accelerated in the past_few reviewed in mattick and makunin unlike protein_coding which have been extensively_studied in structure orthologue identification and single_nucleotide annotation the study of ncrna genes lags behind there exist more than a dozen ncrna gene databases some are dedicated to particular ncrna classes such as mirbase snorna lbme db and pirnabank sai while others such as rfam rnadb and frnadb include a variety of ncrna classes many ncrna genes are also included in the conventional gene databasesensembl ncbis entrez_gene hgnc and genecards interestingly these databases vary_greatly in their human ncrna gene counts partly because of the use of different sources and integration mechanisms grand unification is thus urgently_needed we have initiated some steps towards this ambitious goal based on the integration capacities within genecards genecards is an integrated human gene compendium which strives to consolidate information about all human genes its previous v included rna genes mined from a limited number of sources ensembl entrez_gene and hgnc we have launched an expansion and integration protocol based chiefly on the use of frnadb which in turn is mined from seven sources currently untapped by genecards using judicious unification protocols we report here the augmentation of the ncrna gene count to in v while this fold enhancement is in large part due to the addition of non redundant pirna genes sai our pipeline has also resulted in the addition of genes belonging to other classes yielding a comprehensive upgradable compendium of ncrna genes to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comthe field of ncrna genes is a dynamic one new genes and even new classes are continuously discovered we have strived to generate a comprehensive integrated list of human ncrna genes within genecards thereby placing them in the context of a complete human gene compendium for that two large and mutually complementary sources of human ncrna genes were put to use conveying the content of more restricted databases this resulted in the inclusion of genecards for ncrnas when compared with in genecards v and to after the reclassification of previously uncategorized entries as ncrnas respectively fold and fold increases the ncrnas added in this unification process were derived from genome mapped frnadb and other source entries the latter were pruned to unique more reliable ncrnas i e after clustering and removal of purely predicted singletons candidates for integration into genecards there was a surprisingly small overlap of entries between the pruned ncrnas and the past genecards embodiment probably stemming from the existence of partially orthogonal worldwide pipelines for ncrna discovery and the almost mutually_exclusive source lists for frnadb and genecards genecards v thus contains molecularly identified functional gene entries protein_coding and ncrnas in addition this version has entries for pseudogenes gene_clusters genetic disease_loci and uncategorized providing a grand total of a major step in the frnadb pruning process was clustering of ncrna entries with extensive genome overlaps greatly extending the removal of redundant entries already performed within frnadb the arguably arbitrary clustering cutoff we have used is not much different from that employed by others as exemplified by the case of pirnabank sai whereby the entries represented in frnadb have undergone local removal of redundancies to quite similar to our procedure our method further eliminated sequences that were predicted only once as ncrnas on the basis of sequence_conservation and or secondary_structure alone this is because such predictions were reported to comprise a high fraction of false_positives up to we believe that the resulting list of ncrnas represents an adequately comprehensive compendium in which purely predicted entries are only minimally presented allowing effective future scrutiny genecards v already included pirna related entries with symbols pirc these were mined from hgnc and originally from pirnabank and constitute clusters of sai individual pirnas we have decided that genecards will have a card for each individual pirna with annotation indicating cluster affiliation in genecards aliases and descriptions section forcontinuity and comprehensive consistency with hgnc the pirc entries are included as well this decision is inspired by the fact that pirc coordinates are computationally predicted with limited hard evidence for the existence of the pircs as transcripts another reason is not omitting pirnas that are not included in pirc clusters finally recent_studies have found a link between individual pirnas and tumour_development emphasizing the importance of regarding each pirna as an individual gene in the future we also intend to add annotations for pircs according to several algorithms that provide cluster boundaries often differing from one another sai lakshmi and some of the criteria applied in our clustering procedure are somewhat arbitrary such as the use of positional overlap however we verified that this criterion does not impact much the number of multi membered clusters created supplementary when comparing the original genecards version to the newly added ncrna sources we found that only ncrna entries were shared while entries were unique to genecards and were seen only in the added sources this is surprising since our expectation from the much larger_size of newly_introduced ncrna collection was that it would include most or all of the original genecards ncrna entries however many of the non overlap cases are easily explainable of these frnadb unique entries are pirnas and are ncrna predictions from evofold rnaz and ncrnasearch both not included in genecards v leaving to be accounted for conversely of the genecards unique entries come from ensembl a data source not mined by frnadb which addresses only ncrna specific databases thus such mutual omissions may not be suspected as erroneous the foregoing underline the fact that our unification process results in the most comprehensive dataset of human ncrna genes containing entries absent in the newly added sources these are ncrna genes uniquely found in the general gene databases entrez_gene and ensembl but not in ncrna specific compendia further frnadb and the other added sources contain a considerable number of redundant entries which in our procedure are judiciously unified into clusters based on genomic location finally the reduced compendium of ncrna genes within genecards v is based on the notion that genes predicted by only one source are less likely to be valid in the current version such genes are removed in the future they will be presented with a prediction score probability indicator see below we make a distinction between two sets of predicted ncrnas the first set is predicted purely by computational algorithms as exemplified by rnaz and evofold entries in frnadb the second set includes rfam entries predicted based on known ncrna seeds and in turn serving along with mirbase entries as prediction templates for ensembl ncrnas similarly ensembl relies on lincrna discovery that includes identification of chromatin methylation outside protein_coding therefore we included all ensembl ncrna predictions while the frnadb predictions were further filtered in the future other filtration methods will be considered e g based on the reported prediction scores in addition we will make the predictive arsenal more comprehensive including the use of additional algorithms such as alifoldz or improved versions of presently utilized algorithms such as rnaz while at present genecards policy is to mine existing repositories of prediction outputs we will consider also performing prediction runs on our own when needed we provide here a status description for genecards version notably genecards is a dynamic data_structure with three version updates each year the mining of ncrna genes from all sources has now become part of the standard genecards generation_process thus all inclusion and annotation aspects would be frequently revised frnadb released a minor update in march and is expected to undergo a major update in december followed by subsequent releases about every half year genecards in turn will retrieve new frnadb content at each of its own updates three times a year and add directly primary_sources not updated by frnadb the encode_project predicts that of all genomic territories are transcribed in one fashion or another using integrated genecards information and disregarding overlaps we estimate that of the gb of the genome is occupied by genes taking_into cumulative lengths of all preprocessed mrna including introns the cumulative gene territories of all ncrna genes in our genecards integration effort is of which the newly added clusters add the total genome territory thus covered amounts to of the human_genome such difference between encode and genecards may simply be due to dataset input and computation discrepancies however at least some of this difference may represent genes mainly ncrnas still awaiting identification and characterization
