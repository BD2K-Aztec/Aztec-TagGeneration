sequence_analysis virome an r package for the visualization and analysis of viral small_rna sequence_datasets rna_interference rnai is known to play an important part in defence against viruses in a range of species second_generation allow us to assay these systems and the small_rnas that play_a with unprecedented depth however scientists need access to tools that can condense analyse and display the resulting data here we present virome a package for r that takes aligned sequence_data and produces a range of essential plots and reports availability_and virome is released under the bsd_license as a package for r available for both windows and linux http virome sf net additional information and a tutorial is available on the ark genomics website http www ark genomics org bioinformatics rna_interference rnai is mediated by small_rnas such as micornas mirnas of nt small_interfering sirnas of nt and piwi_interacting pirnas of nt and these molecules regulate many biological_processes these pathways are also a major part of the antiviral_response in both insects and plants including a variety of important mosquito_borne diseases of humans and animals such as west_nile dengue_virus and chikungunya_virus in arthropods these are characterized by the production of nt virus derived small_interfering virnas or nt viral pirna like molecules second generation sequencing allows scientists to assay these systems in unprecedented depth and short_reads capture both the nt sirnas and the nt pirnas however there is a need for scientists to be able to summarize analyse and visualize the results of such experiments here we present virome a package for r which takes aligned sequencing_data in the bam format and produces a variety of plots and reports that are essential to the analysis of data from viral sirna datasets software_packages to analyse viral sirna data exist paparrazi is designed to reconstruct viral_genomes from sirna data and produces some similar plots to virome alternatively visitor an informatic pipeline for analysing short_read virna data also produces several similar plots however both are implemented in perl and are limited to the linux unix operating system they include alignment as part of the analysis therefore using an alternative aligner would require programming_skills finally the plots are generated in batch mode hence there is no interaction between the user and the software as a package for r virome improves on these software_packages in several ways including i virome allows interaction between the user and the software during report and graph generation ii virome is available on any operating system that supports r and has been tested on microsoft windows and several linux distributions iii virome separates visualization from alignment therefore the user is free to use any alignment software they wish and iv as an r package virome integrates seamlessly with other r packages from the bioconductor_project
