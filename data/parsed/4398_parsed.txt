systems_biology stability of gene rankings from rnai screens motivation genome_wide rna_interference rnai experiments are becoming a widely used approach for identifying intracellular molecular_pathways of specific functions however detecting all relevant_genes involved in a biological_process is challenging because typically only few samples per gene knock_down are available and readouts tend to be very noisy we investigate the reliability of top scoring hit lists obtained from rnai screens compare the performance of different ranking_methods and propose a new ranking_method to improve the reproducibility of gene_selection results the performance of different ranking_methods is assessed by the size of the stable sets they produce i e the subsets of genes which are estimated to be re selected with high_probability in independent_validation experiments using stability_selection we also define a new ranking_method called stability ranking to improve the stability of any given base ranking_method ranking_methods based on mean median t test and rank_sum and their stability augmented counterparts are compared in simulation_studies and on three microscopy image rnai datasets we find that the rank_sum offers the most favorable trade_off between ranking stability and accuracy and that stability ranking improves the reproducibility of all and the accuracy of several ranking_methods availability stability ranking is freely_available as the r bioconductor_package starank atgenome wide gene_silencing experiments are important in many fields of biology and medicine as they provide a first overview of which genes might play a role for a specific experimental_condition many screens have been performed to study signaling in model_organisms like drosophila_melanogaster in infection biology viruses such as influenza and hiv as well as bacteria including salmonella bartonella and shigella to whom correspondence should be addressed have been analyzed to identify the key host_genes involved in pathogen entry into the cell in cancer research rna_interference rnai screens have been used to study dysregulated signaling_pathways and to identify novel drug_targets in such high_throughput experiments one faces the problem of detecting the typically few relevant_variables from a large highdimensional noisy dataset we focus here on data from microscopy image_based rnai screens where genes are knocked_down individually by post transciptional gene_silencing small_interfering sirnas of base_pairs are introduced into a cell where they induce cleavage and degradation of a target messenger_rna complementary to the sirna and thus to the eventual depletion of the respective protein a typical setup for such a microscopy image_based screen consists of several well plates where each well contains cells with exactly one gene knocked_down there are different strategies for the knock_down two of which will be covered by different datasets we analyze in section the first is to take replicates of the same biological experiment meaning that for each gene the same sirna knock_down is performed several times the second strategy uses biologically different experiments per gene here each well for the same gene contains a different type of sirna targeting the gene a third approach is to pool these different sirnas in one well each of them in lower concentration this strategy adresses two main problems of sirnas the first is inefficient knock_down of a gene for example due to inefficient sirna binding secondly an sirna can have so_called off target effects arising from limited binding_specificity or other often unknown pharmacological_effects after transfection with sirnas the cells are put in the experimental_condition to be studied and subsequently they are imaged the images are processed by an image_segmentation and analysis software and the final experimental readout consists of one or more phenotypic measures retrieved from fluorescence signals of stained proteins in most cases the goal of a first genome_wide screen is to prioritize genes to select a set of top scoring hits for which a secondary validation experiment is performed for a d readout the usual procedure is to rank the genes by their mean or median readout across replicates however to account for the variation among replicates genes can also be ranked according to a testwe have applied the concept of stability_selection to gene rankings to generate more reproducible ordered hit lists for data generated from phenotypic rnai experiments we have shown that the robustness of different ranking_methods can be very different and that the stable set size can be used as a measure of reproducibility since imagebased rnai screening data tend to be very noisy and sparse the use of stability ranking can improve stability especially in the top part of the rankings which is of main interest in the present study the ranksum test ranking and its stability ranking version have resulted in the most reproducible hit lists stability ranking is very flexible and can be applied to any gene ranking_method it does not only improve ranking statistics that ignore the gene wise variance such as mean or median but it also improved the reproducibility of a statistic like the rank_sum thus irrespective of the chosen ranking statistic it appears beneficial to complement the selection of top scoring genes with stable genes to increase validation rates in secondary screens in principle the stable sets could also hint at a reasonable cutoffs for hit selection analyzing the growth_curve of the stable sets for the datasets used in the present study no such cutoff was be found but this may be investigated further in future work on different
