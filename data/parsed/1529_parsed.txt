databases_and edam an ontology of bioinformatics operations types of data and identifiers topics and formats motivation advancing the search publication and integration of bio informatics tools and resources demands consistent machine understandable descriptions a comprehensive ontology allowing such descriptions is therefore required results edam is an ontology of bioinformatics operations tool or workflow functions types of data and identifiers application domains and data_formats edam supports semantic annotation of diverse entities such as web_services databases programmatic libraries standalone tools interactive applications data schemas datasets and publications within bioinformatics edam applies to organizing and finding suitable tools and data and to automating their integration into complex applications or workflows it includes over defined concepts and has successfully been used for annotations and implementations availability the latest stable version of edam is available in owl format from http edamontology org edam owl and in obo format from http edamontology org edam obo it can be viewed online at the ncbo bioportal and the ebi ontology lookup service for documentation and license please refer to http edamontology org this article_describes version available at http edamontology org the number and diversity of bioinformatics_tools including data resources grows vastly to aid users in finding comparing selecting and integrating tools into workflows or workbenches it is important having the tools consistently described with respect to a number of categories these include their application domain e g protein_structure metagenomics function e g alignment construction type of input and output data e g accession feature record and available formats of the data e g fastq pdb format in the absence of accepted standards for such tool descriptions the categorization of tools has been left to providers of tool catalogues or workbenches in this undesired situation tools have to be described again every time they are integrated into a new framework not only duplicating efforts this also leads to fragmented descriptions and inconsistent categorization we present edam an ontology of bioinformatics operations types of data and identifiers data_formats and topics its name originates from embrace data and methods as it was initiated by the embrace project its primary goal is as a means of creating coherent machine understandable annotations for use within resource catalogues such as biocatalogue or myexperiment information standards such as biodbcore web_services http www w org standards webof services collaborative infrastructures such as elixir http www elixir europe org tool collections e g bio linux and debian med and integrated workbenches e g edam is also intended to complement standards for data_exchange enrich provenance metadata offer a shared markup vocabulary for bioinformatics data on the semantic_web and aid text_mining by defining interrelated terms and synonyms in addition edam must be conveniently usable by annotators and tool users ranging from programmers to lab biologists to ensure good coverage of common concepts numerous tools and databases have been semantically annotated with edam functionality that makes use of edam annotations has been implemented in a set of representative frameworks a suite of bioinformatics_tools emboss an integrated workbench for data_sharing and analysis esysbio http esysbio org and a workflow system thus testing the usability of edam we have presented edam the ontology that applies to semantic annotation of tool functions types of data and identifiers data_formats and the domains of diverse resources within bioinformatics the development of edam has been application driven but edam is not application specific its usability has been tested by annotating a multitude of tools and data resources edams applicability to searching categorizing and automatic handling of resources has been validated by implementations in esysbio bio jeti and emboss demonstrating its relevance to resource catalogues tool libraries and integrative workbenches within bioinformatics edam is also relevant to data provenance text_mining and the semantic_web applicability of edam as one of the markup vocabularies for bioinformatics data in rdf was tested at the fourth biohackathon in kyoto example at https github com dbcls bh wiki bioxsdsequence record in rdf edam does not try to cover all aspects of computational_biology it focusses purely on the semantic axes delineated by its four main sub ontologies operation data including identifier topic and format in which it targets the common bioinformatics concepts especially those reused in multiple contexts concepts from distinct edam sub ontologies are related by a few basic relations in addition to generalization is a which constitutes the basic hierarchy edam does not define theaggregation relation is part of has part has a or contains what particular computational steps are done inside an operation is defined by a particular algorithm or a workflow and it may vary between different implementations of the same operation in the same way for a type of data what parts it must or may contain is defined by a concrete data model or format an information standard or reporting requirement the included parts of data both mandatory and optional differ between different formats of the same type of data while not defining data and operation parts universally edam does offer concepts for annotating the parts of a particular data format or dataset and concepts for annotating the steps of a particular bioinformatics algorithm or workflow computational aspects that are not specific to bioinformatics should preferably be covered by independent information_technology ontologies such as for example the swo http theswo sourceforge net and the wsio http wsio org the development of both of which is coordinated with the development of edam and the boundary concepts are referenced edam agnostically links to multiple upper ontologies allowing a plurality of future semantic integration approaches some specific detailed concepts of data and methods are in focus of other ontologies such as in case of the cdao devoted to phylogenetics in these cases edam excludes detailed concepts and instead refers to the boundary ones in the more specialized ontology different ontologies focussing on different semantic axes than edam are clearly useful for enriching the annotations of tools or datasets such as the so which may denote particular sequence_features in focus of a tool or a dataset in obvious candidates for such annotations the relevant ontologies are referred to such as in feature record and feature prediction concepts in edam pointing to sequence feature in so edam aims at being comprehensive for common concepts good coverage demands recurring input from the scientific_community in particular within specialized domains in which the core developers of edam lack expertise for this purpose a broader sustainable consortium should evolve in the future edam will keep following the agile organic development model tested throughout the accomplished iterations thanks to the stable uris and the deprecation mechanism annotations remain valid with a release of a new version of the ontology edam will continue being coordinated in harmony with related efforts such as with swo wsio bioxsd and potentially others the edam developers will continue improving edam while being dependent on the community input and feedback from annotators developers and users of bioinformatics_tools additions and corrections can be suggested using a public issue tracker http www ebi ac uk panda jira browse bmb the edam team will continue providing support to the annotators and the application developers
