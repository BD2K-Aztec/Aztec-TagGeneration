iris construction of arg networks at genomic scales given a set of extant haplotypes iris first detects high_confidence recombination_events in their shared genealogy next using the local sequence topology defined by each detected event it integrates these recombinations into an ancestral recombination graph while the current system has been calibrated for human population data it is easily extendible to other species as well availability iris identification of recombinations in sequences binary files are available for non commercial use in both linux and microsoft windows and bit environments fromgenetic recombination is a key evolutionary force shaping the sequence_variability of the recombining genome yet individual recombination_events have played a limited role in studies on phylogenetics and population characteristics recombinational analysis generally relies on estimated population recombination_rates which are statistical averages among individuals from the same population over many generations in vitro sperm typing experiments define individual recombination_events and so do familial datasets of related individuals across generations however these analysis are restricted in time depth both by the human generation time and the family sizes the inherent difficulty in identifying past recombinations shared among unrelated_individuals lies in the palimpsestic nature of the recombining genome over successive generations recombinations conjoin potentially divergent sequences often overwriting the traces of older events making the task of reconstructing the true recombining genealogy almost impossible even under simplifying assumptions such as the wright fisher population model and the parsimony principle the problem of reconstructing the ancestral recombination graph arg from the haplotypes has been shown to be np complete thus attempts to solve the reconstruction problem exactly do not scale beyond a few sequences iris identification of recombinations in sequences is a suite of programs to study the recombinational variations in populations it constructs the arg from the haplotype_data in two phases in to whom correspondence should be addressed work done during internship at ibm research the first phase it detects the recombinations and only the ones with high_confidence are used in the next phase in the second phase these recombinations along with local topology_information are reconciled into an arg network to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that an arg network is being constructed at a genomic_scale for hundreds of samples the arg is not fully resolved due to the difficulties discussed above hence we call it a subarg page the fidelity of the reconstructed subarg to the true arg is shown here cosi simulates a demographic scenario with african blue asian yellow and european green extant samples and denotes the true arg the mrca of all the samples is toward the top right corner the internal nodes and edges of the reconstructed subarg are shown in red note that all the leaf nodes i e the blue yellow and green colored nodes are trivially reconstructed in the subarg the remaining nodes and edges of the true arg are shown in gray the network is rendered using pajek http vlado fmf uni lj si pub networks pajek we present a software_suite to study genetic_recombination while most currently available software systems estimate only the recombination_rate we undertake the orthogonal task of identifying individual events and reconstructing the arg network the system is currently calibrated for human population data based on realistic coalescent cosi simulations to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that an arg network has been constructed at a genomic page scale for hundreds of samples we believe that iris is an invaluable tool to comprehensively understand the dynamics of recombining genomes
