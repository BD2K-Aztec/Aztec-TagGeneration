data_and the faf drugs server a multistep engine to prepare electronic chemical compound collections the faf drugs server is a web_application that prepares chemical compound libraries prior to virtual_screening or that assists hit selection lead_optimization before chemical_synthesis or ordering the faf drugs web_server is an enhanced version of the faf drugs package that now includes pan assay interference compounds detection this online toolkit has been designed through a user centered approach with emphasis on user_friendliness this is a unique online tool allowing to prepare large compound libraries with in house or user_defined filtering parameters availability the faf drugs server is freely_available atthe most established method for the identification of hit compounds modulating the functions of a target is experimental high_throughput hts alternatively or in parallel screening can be performed in silico virtual ligand screening or vls in order to prioritize compounds for in vitro screening the screening process involves measurement prediction of activities of sometimes millions of chemical_compounds in vitro on cells or in silico the first two in particular are time consuming and costly and as such the preparation of the compound collections is critical analyses of past failures have led to a much better understanding of crucial properties that distinguish any chemical from an interesting drug_candidate or a relevant chemical_probe thus the concept of screening high_quality compound collections in terms of improved admet absorption distribution metabolism excretion toxicity properties and containing a reduced number of nuisance compounds is gaining momentum hence we decided to develop a user_friendly online tool dedicated to the preparation of compound collections in fact such a service freely_available and able to handle several thousands of compounds with either predefined filtering parameters to whom correspondence should be addressed or user tuned parameters assisting decision_making has not been reported to date our online in silico filtering engine is based on a significantly_improved version of a previously_reported stand alone package named faf drugs standing for free admet filteringdrugs which was successfully employed for preparing compound datasets for different projects as in while many free online services are available to compute molecular_properties faf drugs is the first free web_based package capable of preparing compound libraries through physicochemical rules functional_groups and pan assay interference compounds pains detection in the present application note we describe the faf drugs server highlighting the new functionalities introduced as compared with the original stand alone package
