data_and bigwig and bigbed enabling browsing of large distributed datasets bigwig and bigbed files are compressed binary indexed files containing data at several resolutions that allow the high performance display of next_generation experiment results in the ucsc_genome the visualization is implemented using a multi_layered software approach that takes_advantage of specific capabilities of web_based protocols and linux and unix operating_systems files r trees and various indexing and compression tricks as a result only the data needed to support the current browser view is transmitted rather than the entire file enabling fast remote access to large distributed data_sets availability_and binaries for the bigwig and bigbed creation and parsing utilities may be downloaded atrecent improvements in sequencing_technologies have made it possible for labs to generate terabyte sized genomic data_sets visualization of these data_sets is a key to scientific interpretation typically loading the data into a visualization_tool such as the genome_browser provided by the university of california santa_cruz ucsc has been difficult the data can be loaded as a custom annotation track but for very large_data the upload form times out before the data transfer finishes to work around this limitation some labs with access to solexa and later generation sequencing_machines have installed a local copy of the genome_browser but this requires a significant initial time investment by systems administrators and other informatics professionals as well as continuing efforts to keep the data in the local browser installation current to whom correspondence should be addressed though visualization of results is just one of the many informatics challenges of next_generation it is one that we are well positioned to address at ucsc we have developed two new data_formats bigwig and bigbed that make it practical to view the results of next_generation experiments as tracks in the ucsc_genome the bigwig and bigbed files are compressed binary indexed files that contain the data at several resolutions rather than transmitting the entire file only the data needed to support the current_view in the genome_browser are transmitted collectively bigwig and bigbed are referred to as big binary indexed bbi files
