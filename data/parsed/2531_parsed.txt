gene_expression interactional and functional centrality in transcriptional co expression networks motivation the noisy nature of transcriptomic_data hinders the biological_relevance of conventional network centrality_measures often used to select gene_candidates in co expression networks therefore new tools and methods are required to improve the prediction of mechanistically important transcriptional_targets results we propose an original network centrality measure called annotation transcriptional centrality atc computed by integrating gene_expression from microarray_experiments with biological_knowledge extracted from public genomic_databases atc computation algorithm delimits representative functional_domains in the co expression network and then relies on this information to find key_nodes that modulate propagation of functional influences within the network we demonstrate atc ability to predict important genes in several experimental_models and provide improved biological_relevance over conventional topological network centrality_measures availability atc computational routine is implemented in a publicly_available tool named funnet www funnet info in complex cellular environments biological_functions are emerging properties that cannot be understood without taking_into the system as a whole molecular_interactions allow for cellular_components to function and for cells to live and perform their tasks within the organism it is through chemical and physical_interactions that molecules influence one another and carry out biological_functions since some of these influences may have a greater impact than others a hierarchical characterization of their relative importance can be very useful in exploring the functional_architecture of the cellular environments the concept of interactional centrality is borrowed from social_sciences where it is used to estimate the relative importance of individuals within societies biological_processes viewed as to whom correspondence should be addressed associations of molecules whose relations to each other assure a particular function have a strong interactional nature understanding interaction_patterns is therefore crucial in untangling the functional_architecture of cellular environments network_analysis plays_an in the exploration of complex interactional systems in numerous domains in biology they are used to study regulation of the transcriptome proteome metabolome methylome and other cell systems key_properties of biological_networks are shared with other complex interaction systems such as the scale_free distribution of node connectivity or the small_world aspect of their fast synchronization others like the existence of a hierarchical architecture of modules formed by functionally_related components i e genes enzymes and metabolites or the presence of various types of hubs i e highly_connected or central_nodes which modulate key interactions at distinct levels in the cell are thought to have a particular relevance in biology the existence of strong relationships between the biological_roles of molecules and the modular_organization of their interactions was demonstrated through analyses of integrating gene_expression with information on phylogenetic variability sharing of common transcriptional binding_sites results from mutagenesis experiments and available knowledge on genes biological_roles hub molecules with important biological_properties are identified in these networks through topological interactional centrality_measures relying on results from mutagenesis experiments showed that highly_connected hub proteins that occupy central positions in the network architecture of yeast proteinprotein_interactions are three times more likely to be biologically essential than those with only a small number of links in the network several other studies have shown that proteins with high betweenness_centrality scores i e measure of total number of shortest_paths that connect each two nodes in the network passing through a given one are more likely to be functionally essential others have demonstrated strong correlations of network topological centrality indices with specific patterns of phylogenetic variability microarray_technology has been very successful in biomedical_research over the past_decade the study of gene expressionour assessment shows that conventional topological centrality indexes are not equally useful in predicting essential genes in yeast_cell co expression networks indeed degree centrality appeared to perform better than betweenness in spotting essential genes this finding contradicts previous data published by which showed that node betweenness_centrality is a better indicator of functional essentiality than degree in regulatory and other directed networks however as suggested by in yeast protein_interaction essential proteins tend to participate in biological_processes that are densely interconnected and which are therefore more likely to be hubs i e highly_connected nodes in our context the advantage of degree centrality over betweenness could be explained by an increased sensitivity of the later to the high amount of noise which is often wired in the structure of the co expression networks this observation is also supported by our assessment which associates the highest sensitivity to artificial random noise with betweenness_centrality see supplementary tables s and s on the other hand atc predicts essentiality better than both betweenness and degree centrality in the transcriptional co expression network built from cell_cycle data our assessment indicated also that atc is significantly more robust to experimental_noise than topological measures this advantage may be related to the fact that atc computation relies not only on the topology of the co expression network but also on its functional_architecture furthermore no significant_difference between atc distributions computed with the three annotation systems gocc gobp and kegg was observed this finding suggests an equal usefulness of the available annotation systems despite the fragmentary character of the background_knowledge on which they rely it is expected that annotation coverage and its biological precision will continue to increase in the future and thus further improve atc prediction abilities
