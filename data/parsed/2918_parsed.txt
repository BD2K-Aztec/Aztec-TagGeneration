genome_analysis metarank a rank conversion scheme for comparative_analysis of microbial_community compositions motivation metagenomics involves sampling and studying the genetic materials in microbial_communities several statistical_methods have been proposed for comparative_analysis of microbial_community compositions most of the methods are based on the estimated abundances of taxonomic units or functional_groups from metagenomic_samples however such estimated abundances might deviate from the true abundances in habitats due to sampling_biases and other systematic artifacts in metagenomic data_processing results we developed the metarank scheme to convert abundances into ranks metarank employs a series of statistical hypothesis_tests to compare abundances within a microbial_community and determine their ranks we applied metarank to synthetic samples and real metagenomes the results confirm that metarank can reduce the effects of sampling_biases and clarify the characteristics of metagenomes in comparative_studies of microbial_communities therefore metarank provides a useful rank based_approach to analyzing microbiomes metagenomics is a field that involves sampling sequencing and analyzing the genetic_material of uncultured microorganisms in microbial_communities in metagenomic experiments the nucleic_acids of microorganisms are directly isolated from natural_environments this direct approach is not hampered by the limitation that most microorganisms are uncultured in the laboratory and provides a more complete picture of a microbial_community recent_advances have fueled an increase in both the number and scope of metagenomic_projects and large_amounts of data are being accumulated for analyzing microbiomes a key_question in metagenomics is whether and how changes in the microbial abundances of taxonomic to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as units or functional_groups relate to alterations of the habitats to characterize the relationship it is important to compare microbial_community compositions in different environments several statistical_methods developed for comparative_metagenomics try to identify differentially_abundant features between microbial_communities most of these methods are designed to compare two communities e g xipe totec img m megan rammcap galaxy and stamp however a few methods like metastats are developed specifically for comparing two sets of multiple communities while other methods such as shotgunfunctionalizer are capable of performing both kinds of comparative_analysis all of the above methods_employ statistical hypothesis_tests to determine_whether member taxonomic unit or functional_group abundances are equal in distinct communities and focus on the quantitative differences between microbial_community compositions the drawback of the above methods is that they are highly dependent on the precision of estimated_values e g proportions in member abundances the estimated_values might be noisy due to sampling_biases and other systematic artifacts in metagenomic data_processing e g s rrna chimeras and copy_number artificial replicates and inaccurate binning although systematic artifacts can be corrected through improvements in data_processing techniques sampling_biases will remain unavoidable unless exhaustive inventories of different organisms in microbial_communities become available according to the recent study of an exhaustive sample for per liter of seawater requires trillions flx pyrosequencing reads currently only a fraction of genetic materials in habitats are collected as non exhaustive samples in metagenomic experiments and no dataset comprises trillions of reads therefore in comparative_analysis of metagenomes sampling_biases inevitably have impact on the analyzing accuracy of the above methods to mitigate the effects of sampling_biases we propose the metarank scheme which performs a series of rank conversions for analysis of microbial_communities based on the relative order of member abundances rather than their estimated_values the rationale behind metarank is that since the relative order of largemost current statistical_methods for comparative_analysis of microbial_community compositions rely on estimated abundances however when processing metagenomic_data sampling_biases and systematic artifacts cause noisy deviations such that estimated abundances differ from true abundances in this study we propose a rank conversion scheme metarank which converts highly abundant members into larger ranks since the ranks of highly abundant members are robust to small deviations the ranks converted by metarank in samples are less affected by sampling_biases empirical tests on synthetic samples and two real metagenomes confirmed that using metarank is able to reduce the variability between samples resulting from sampling_biases facilitates the comparative_analysis of metagenomes and
