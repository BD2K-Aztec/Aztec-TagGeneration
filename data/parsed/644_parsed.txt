genome_analysis badger an accessible genome exploration environment high_quality draft_genomes are now easy to generate as sequencing and assembly costs have dropped dramatically however building a user_friendly searchable web_site and database for a newly annotated genome is not straightforward here we present badger a lightweight and easy to install genome exploration environment designed for next generation non model_organism genomes availability badger is released under the gpl and is available at http badger bio ed ac uk we show two working examples i a test_dataset included with the source_code and ii a collection of four filarial nematode genomes contact high_throughput has revolutionized genome_sequencing new sequencing_technologies and improved computational_tools mean that a high_quality draft eukaryotic_genome can be sequenced and assembled in days on a budget accessible to most researchers this has produced an explosion of genome_projects an increasing number of which involve_multiple species or strains genome data and annotation must be made accessible to collaborators via a restricted environment and to the wider research_community following publication several genome exploration environments gees exist including ensembl and national_center ncbi genomes http www ncbi nlm nih gov but these do not allow real_time updates or restrictions on data access ensembl can be used as a stand alone gee as can projects like genedb but these require skills not available in groups new to genome informatics gees that use the generic model_organism database gmod chado database model including tripal and chado on rails http gmod org wiki chado on rails are similar to ensembl in scope tripal is the most mature gmod gee and is widely used but requires a dedicated software engineer to develop and design each genome instance we here present badger an easy to install gee for genome scientists who need to produce a web accessible portal for new data a single installation of badger can contain data from multiple species and each species can have multiple genome drafts and gene_sets
