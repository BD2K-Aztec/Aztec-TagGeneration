bayesian_inference with historical_data based informative priors improves detection of differentially_expressed motivation modern high_throughput biotechnologies such as microarray are capable of producing a massive amount of information for each sample however in a typical high_throughput experiment only limited number of samples were assayed thus the classical large p small n problem on the other hand rapid propagation of these high_throughput has resulted in a substantial collection of data often carried_out on the same platform and using the same protocol it is highly_desirable to utilize the existing data when performing analysis and inference on a new dataset results utilizing existing data can be carried_out in a straightforward fashion under the bayesian_framework in which the repository of historical_data can be exploited to build informative priors and used in new data analysis in this work using microarray_data we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of deriving informative priors from historical_data and using them in the problem of detecting differentially_expressed through simulation and real_data analysis we show that the proposed_strategy significantly_outperforms existing_methods including the popular and state of the art bayesian_hierarchical based_approaches our work illustrates the feasibility and benefits of exploiting the increasingly available genomics big_data in statistical_inference and presents a promising practical strategy for dealing with the large p small n problem high_throughput such as microarray and next_generation have become indispensable tools in biomedical_research these technologies can generate a rich set of information for each biological_sample which can be summarized into a comprehensive picture of the underlying biological_processes or systems however due to the relatively high_cost and complexity of sample_preparation the number of samples surveyed in each experiment is much smaller than the number of features surveyed in each sample the key characteristic of such datasets can be summarized as large p small n this presents a tremendous challenge when conducting statistical_inference on these data such as detecting differentially_expressed de genes a fundamental problem in gene_expression hierarchical_models which are designed to borrow strength across features provide a solution under the highdimensional data setting and have been shown to be effective in dealing with high_throughput genomics data kerr and churchill the hierarchical_model framework has been increasingly utilized in genomics research it is widely_accepted that hierarchical_models possess key_advantages over navenave separate inference on individual_features the key idea is that hierarchical_models assume that distribution parameters of all features e g probes are random draws from an upper_level prior_distribution hyperprior as a result the posterior distributions of these parameters regress toward the middle despite its success such a strategy could be a double edged sword on the one hand this approach alleviates the problem of poor inference results due to small_sample on the other hand it inadvertently introduces biases when estimating the variances of genes that have intrinsic high or intrinsic low variance it is a reasonable strategy if no additional information except the current experimental_data is available however in reality given the explosion of genomics datasets that are publicly_available there is abundant information that can be utilized and should be considered a unique and fundamental advantage of the bayesian_inference framework lies in its capability to incorporate existing prior information bayesian_inference achieves seamless_integration of prior_knowledge and observed data hence is desirable in solving real practical problems because technologies like microarray have been widely_adopted there are plenty of publicly_available data referred to as historical_data hereafter we believe such information should be taken advantage of and the bayesian_framework provides an attractive avenue for implementing such a strategy although historical_data have been exploited in other contexts for example applied a historical database of microarray_experiments to adjust background for dna_microarrays we found none of the existing_methods for detecting de genes explicitly utilizes historical_data in a bayesian setting our hypothesis is that the expression value of each gene or its surrogate probe on the microarray has its unique distribution which reflects its intrinsic biological_properties for example when historical_data collected under diverse conditions were aggregated together compounded with limited signal range of the microarray_technology measurements of house_keeping genes tend to show high means but relatively small variances across conditions whereas genes responding to stimuli tend to have large variances since their expression values can go either way therefore assuming proper normalization has been performed across samples to perform statistical_inference we believe it is perhaps a better strategy to use data that are collected from different experiments but the same gene than data collected from the same experiment but different genes to illustrate the point using normal solid tissue microarray_datasets obtained by affymetrix_genechip u a from the global gene_expression map of microarray_data built by details about the datasets can be found in the results section we plot standard_deviation versus mean on probes of their normalized and log_transformed expression values we observe a crescent shape in the plot probes with low or high means tend to have small variance measured by standard_deviation in figures and tables while probes with mid level means tend to have large variance we choose probes from each of the three spots that correspond to low mean small variance mid level mean large variance and high mean small variance respectively and perform a gene_ontology go enrichment_analysis on each set of the corresponding genes using david more details can be found in the supplementary tables s s and the result appears to support our hypothesis we find that the genes in group are mostly involved in housekeeping activities evidenced by enriched functional_categories such as translation_elongation or ribosome related genes in group are mostly known for being responsive to stimuli genes in group show no functional enrichment perhaps because they are barely expressed in this study we present a novel strategy of reutilizing relevant_information contained in historical_data to improve de gene detection simulation_studies applications show that our method ipbt significantly_outperforms other existing_methods in terms of both accuracy and consistency in detecting de genes in particular when the de genes have relatively low intrinsic variances methods based on the bayesian hierarchical_models perform poorly whereas ipbt maintains its superior_performance bayesian_hierarchical provides an attractive statistical_framework for handling large p small n inference problems bayesian_inference with historical_data based informative priorsbecause it can borrow information from all genes in the genome to aid the inference on a single gene so that the poor_performance due to limited sample_size can be improved however as we showed in this study the bayesian_hierarchical approach can suffer from the over correction problem and produce false_negatives in addition the empirical bayesian_approach assumes a common prior for every gene which will limit the effectiveness of the approach for genes with dramatically different behaviors in contrast ipbt assumes gene specific informative priors with the rapid_proliferation of high_throughput genomics big_data deriving these informative priors is no longer an issue meta_analysis is a powerful_tool for combining multiple studies of a related hypothesis and has been applied to microarray_data our approach is different from meta_analysis because historical_data used in ipbt may come from experiments with a different hypothesis and the historical_data is used indirectly in the form of informative priors in bayesian_inference there is much room for improvement in ipbt first the informative prior used in ipbt is gene specific so de gene analysis is done gene by gene in reality we know some genes are correlated with each other such as genes_located in the same pathway or sharing similar biological_functions a potential extension of ipbt is to introduce correlation among genes correlation information can be derived from biological_knowledge or historical_data recent_studies the benefit of incorporating correlation information in the inference of de genes second the current ipbt method uses normal distribution to model log_transformed expression measures the distribution choice is made mainly for mathematical convenience one can replace normal distribution with other non normal ones to achieve robustness in inference in the same way ashave done in their study of de gene detection third we assume the expression values used by ipbt have already been background corrected and normalized this is possible with the powerful normalization techniques such as rma it is however desirable if additional consideration is factored in the model to account for subtle experiment to experiment biases in the data as shown in studies such as this will potentially make ipbt more flexible and further improve its performance we are planning to pursue such extensions to ipbt in future follow_up studies
