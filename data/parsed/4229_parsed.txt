short_read with populations of genomes the increasing availability of highadvancements in next generation low_cost high_throughput dna_sequencing have made it possible to sequence a large number of human and other species genomes several large_scale sequencing_efforts are under way including the genomes_project the and the international cancer genome_project more than individuals have already been sequenced by the genomes_project although the next_generation technologies_provide a vast amount of data samples for advancing genomic_research the everincreasing volume of genomic_data has become a tremendous challenge on multiple fronts one challenge is the alignment of the short dna_sequences short_reads produced by these technologies to reference_genomes to discover the variation of a newly sequenced_genome with respect to the previously_sequenced human_genomes short_read is a common first step during genomic_data analysis and plays_a in medical and population_genetics several efficient short_read programs such as bwa soap and bowtie have been developed in the past_years these methods use the_burrows bwt which facilitates linear time alignment to a large reference string such as a genome and requires only a limited amount of memory these aligners typically precalculate the bwt and some associated auxiliary structures of a single reference_genome and then map the newly sequenced_reads to it using a variant of the bwt backwards search_procedure any observed differences from the chosen reference_genome are treated as novel genomic_variants or sequencing_errors e g in light of the increasing availability of thousands of sequenced human_genomes and databases of human genome_variation the requirement of these methods to use a single human_reference leads to inherent biases towards the arbitrarily chosen reference biased alignment output can be a hindrance to the in depth and comprehensive understanding of the cancer genome evolutionary_history mendelian_diseases and numerous other domain applications beyond human to date millions of genomic_variants have been observed in a wide_variety of species and can serve as a valuable resource for alignment for example many inbred_mouse have been sequenced to characterize their genomic_variation two such mouse_strains can have up to million differences between them as a result when they are crossed their f offspring are heterozygous at all loci that differ between the parents aligning_reads from the f offspring to either parents genome using current alignment_techniques will ignore this known heterozygosity and result in alignment bias towards the chosen reference_strain this can make it difficult to perform an experiment like rna_seq which relies on high_quality mappings the limitations of using conventional references and aligners are even more pronounced when sequencing organisms with a large amount of genomic_variation among individuals for example the sea squirt ciona savignyi has a polymorphism rate of with such a high polymorphism rate the genome of any newly_sequenced individual of this species will be very different from a single conventional reference_sequence current short_read operating on a single reference_genome are simply not designed to handle this scenario and will result in poor alignment_accuracy although humans have a lower polymorphism rate the reference bias remains an important problem even though individual alignment results may be only slightly biased when aligning with conventional techniques in a large study involving thousands of individuals this effect can add up to distort the studys conclusion a vast number of genomic_variants in human populations have already been discovered and are maintained in publicly_accessible databases such as dbsnp and snpedia the majority of variations between a newly sequenced_genome and the reference are likely to already exist in these databases moreover structural_variants such as transpositions large_insertions and to whom correspondence should be addressed in this article we proposed a compact_representation for a collection of genomes the reference multi genome that captures the genomic_variations in the collection and presented bwbble a bwt based short read_aligner that operates on this compiled reference we demonstrated the performance of bwbble on a human reference multi genome incorporating variants from individuals a limitation of our reference multi genome representation is its use of read length_dependent padding to capture structural_variants which to achieve best results necessitates multiple reference indices to be built for each particular read_length in addition padding can also cause a significant increase in the length of the reference for highly_variable species although aligning to the reference multi genome is much slower than to a single_genome it is considerably more efficient than aligning to each genome in a large collection separately as the number of sequenced_genomes grows aligning with bwbble should become much more time and space efficient moreover because bwbble can align_reads that span long known indels its utility will increase once large_databases of structural_variants are available bwbble can also be useful in functional_genomics assays of parent_offspring trios where unbiased peak_calling is desired finally bwbble can output important information about the snps and structural_variations that a given read was mapped to e g the number of genomes in the collection that contain this particular variation which should simplify and improve the current post alignment processing pipeline
