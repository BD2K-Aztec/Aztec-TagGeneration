simple rapid and accurate genotyping by sequencing from aligned whole genomes with arraymaker whole_genome has revolutionized the study of genetics genotyping by sequencing is now a viable method of genotyping yet the bioinformatics involved can be daunting if not prohibitive for some laboratories here we present arraymaker a user_friendly that extracts accurate single nucleotide polymorph ism genotypes at pre defined loci from whole_genome alignments and presents them in a standard genotyping format compatible with association analysis software and datasets genotyped on commercial array platforms using this tool geneticists with only basic computing ability can genotype samples at any desired list of markers facilitating genome_wide fine_mapping candidate variant assessment data_sharing and compatibility of data sourced from multiple technologies availability_and arraymaker is licensed under the mit_license and can be freely obtained at https github com cw arraymaker the program is implemented in perl and runs on linux operating_systems the rapid evolution of whole_genome wgs technologies and decline in sequencing_costs in recent_years has seen an increase in utilization of wgs in genetic experiments wide_ranging research_questions can be asked of such datasets but for identifying genes underlying phenotypes of interest genome_wide gwas remains a crucial first step in localizing candidate_regions for sequence investigation commercially_available single_nucleotide snp_arrays have been dedicated to this task genotyping samples at carefully_selected informative markers from wgs_data genotyping by sequencing gbs enables us to create array type data yet a simple tool to extract snp genotypes at informative sites into array format is currently lacking in light of this we developed arraymaker tool to extract snp genotypes from mammalian wgs alignments at pre defined loci with the resultant output in a gwas ready format producing array type files at known informative markers enables gwas to be carried_out on wgs datasets it also offers an interface for compatibility between wgs_data and samples that have been genotyped on commercial snp_array platforms arraymaker can also genotype samples at bespoke lists of snp markers facilitating fine_mapping and providing a means of assaying candidate loci across multiple samples without the need for extensive post alignment steps the sequencing_platform and alignment protocols used do not preclude compatibility of snp genotypes called from various datasets enabling a platform independent common_language amongst samples sourced from diverse studies arraymaker provides a straightforward method of quickly extracting accurate snp genotypes from bam_files at any combination of snp loci the tool can replicate existing and obsolete snp_array datasets create gwas ready files from bespoke marker lists and rapidly genotype candidate snp loci in new samples without the need for complicated post alignment bioinformatics it requires minimal computing time and resources and is user_friendly written in perl to run on a linux platform with simple command_line operation only an alignment a reference genome_sequence a list of snp markers and samtools are required additional steps such as formatting the marker list including the conversion of legacy array datasets into current reference_genome coordinates or the ascertainment of dataset polymorphic snps for fine_mapping or candidate variant analysis may be required prior to the application of arraymaker using alternate tools such as liftover or samtools respectively following its use arraymaker data can be readily interrogated with plink for the determination of population allele_frequencies gwas and other useful analyses given the shift towards wgs in genetic research_projects gbs is increasing in popularity and there are many existing_tools that return accurate genotypes from whole_genome sequence_data however calling and filtering variants can be a daunting computational task for those inexperienced in bioinformatics arraymaker simplifies the task of extracting snp genotypes at prescribed loci by packaging a popular calling algorithm with a light resource footprint into a user_friendly that emits genotypes in a human_readable gwas ready format
