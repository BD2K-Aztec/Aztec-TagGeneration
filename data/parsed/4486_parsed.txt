genome_analysis sva software for annotating and visualizing sequenced human_genomes here we present sequence variant analyzer sva a software_tool that assigns a predicted biological_function to variants identified in next_generation studies and provides a browser to visualize the variants in their genomic contexts sva also provides for flexible interaction with software implementing variant association tests allowing users to consider both the bioinformatic annotation of identified_variants and the strength of their associations with studied traits we illustrate the annotation_features of sva using two simple examples of sequenced_genomes that harbor mendelian mutations availability_and freely_available on the web atrecent advances in next_generation ngs_technologies have made it possible to search through entire genomes for variants that influence traits of interest however analyzing ngs_data still requires addressing a number of considerable computational challenges a variety of methods have been developed to firstly align the sequence_reads and secondly to identify the genetic_variants in this work we focus on the downstream annotation necessary for the analysis of variants and provide simple_means of visualizing variants in their genomic_context using a built in genome_browser one fundamental_difference from the previous approach of using genome_wide gwas is that many of the variants identified in ngs will be newly_discovered a second fundamental_difference is that unlike gwas data sequence_data at least in principle provides complete a screenshot of sva highlighting a frameshift indel that is located on exon of the factor_viii gene and is the cause of type a hemophilia information about the variation present in a genome for both of these reasons it is essential to develop a computational environment that can assess the likely functions of the variants observed and whether or not they are present in existing variant databases in most contexts such functional assignments will need to be considered along with statistical_association evidence in order to prioritize variants in terms of their likelihoods of influencing traits of interest we also emphasize that in the early days of interpreting sequence_data for complex_traits the sequence_data itself will often not be sufficient to provide statistical confidence of association instead the bioinformatic prioritization helps to point towards variants of interest that can be evaluated in much larger sample_sets by direct genotyping we have designed sequence variant analyzer sva to meet these challenges and in this report we use two examples to illustrate some of the annotation_features the sva tool utilizes a knowledgebase of gb which is compiled and compressed into dvd rom or can be downloaded from the sva website the main annotation functionality is performed locally and does not require an active internet connection this tool has two distinct modules that allow analysis of the genomes included in a given project the annotation module is used to determine genomic_context and to predict the potential biological_function of the identified_variants for example synonymous or nonsynonymous essential splice etc in each genome the results can then be visualized in svas built in genome_browser visualization module the annotated variants can also be exported to a separate statistical tool for example atav http www duke edu minhe atav to assess their statistical associations with traits importantly sva is designed to conveniently connect its bioinformatic annotations with the statistical_association tests so that users are allowed to consider them both and even suggestive association evidence may catch the users attention there are also a number of integrated bioinformatic listing functions in sva designed to help prioritize genetic_variants in broad overview therefore sva inputs a set of identified_variants for each genome annotates them for possible functionality and permits the user a variety of ways to visualize and filter the resulting data with relationship to phenotypic_information the basic_principles of these core analyses are fairly simple but the strength of these analyses is their ability to be seamlessly run across multiple_genomes to prioritize all variants and genes at once two examples illustrate svas utility to illustrate the simple annotation_features of sva we have analyzed the sequence_data for subjects with two different mendelian_diseases hemophilia a is an x linked recessive disorder that is characterized by excessive_bleeding due to improper clotting genetic_mutations in the factor_viii gene are known to cause hemophilia a therefore it is possible to use this disease as a positive control we annotated case and control genomes and found that the gene with the most cases harboring a rare mutation was factor_viii f an sva genome_browser view of one of the identified indels is shown in metachondromatosis mc is an autosomal_dominant condition affecting bone_growth our center performed a whole_genome of one mc patient following a linkage_analysis that implicated six candidate_regions spanning a total of mb we took a three step strategy we first applied svas genomic_region filter we next applied svas novelty filters to identify variants that were absent in dbsnp and absent in all eight control genomes and finally we applied svas functional filters to identify proteintruncating variants these filtering steps quickly identify an bp frameshifting deletion on the ptpn gene as the cause which was validated in a separate family we note that for these simple cases no association tests are required beyond rarity or absence in controls whereas in the case of complex_traits sva would normally be used alongside a program like atav to facilitate the consideration of variants that are both annotated as functional and that show some degree of statistical_association with trait_values
