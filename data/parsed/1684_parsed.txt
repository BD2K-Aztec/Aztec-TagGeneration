genome_analysis expands expanding ploidy and allele_frequency on nested subpopulations motivation several cancer_types consist of multiple genetically and phenotypically distinct_subpopulations the underlying mechanism for this intra tumoral heterogeneity can be explained by the clonal_evolution model whereby growth advantageous mutations cause the expansion of cancer cell subclones the recurrent phenotype of many cancers may be a consequence of these coexisting subpopula tions responding unequally to therapies methods to computationally infer tumor evolution and subpopulation diversity are emerging and they hold the promise to improve the understanding of genetic and molecular_determinants of recurrence results to address cellular subpopulation dynamics within human tumors we developed a bioinformatic method expands it estimates the proportion of cells harboring specific mutations in a tumor by modeling cellular frequencies as probability_distributions expands predicts mutations that accumulate in a cell before its clonal_expansion we assessed the performance of expands on one whole_genome sequenced breast_cancer and performed sp analyses on glioblast oma multiforme samples obtained from tcga our results inform about the extent of subclonal diversity in primary glioblastoma subpopulation dynamics during recurrence and provide a set of candidate genes_mutated in the most well adapted subpopulations in summary expands predicts tumor_purity and subclonal composition from sequencing_data availability_and expands is available for down load atthe clonal_evolution model initially proposed by peter c nowell posits that a single_cell of origin or clone that underwent transformation from a normal to a cancerous state undergoes clonal_expansion and through successive acquisition of mutations generates genetically_diverse subclones subsequent pressure from the cancer microenvironment selects the fittest subclone s driving their expansion into subpopulations sps as a consequence the resulting neoplasm is composed of multiple genetically_diverse sps that are best adapted to their microenvironment cancer_therapies are hypothesized to eliminate some but not all sps within a tumor resulting in altered sp composition of tumors that recur post_treatment a better understanding of the sp composition and dynamics of individual tumors is expected to have significant_clinical especially for highly recurrent and therapy resistant_tumors glioblastoma gbm a grade_iv astrocytoma is the most common cns tumor in adults despite aggressive standard_therapy consisting of surgery radiation and adjuvant_chemotherapy with the dna alkylating drug temozolomide gbm invariably recur within months following initial diagnosis and typically become resistant to the first line therapy they have been exposed an sp with stem like properties the cancer_stem is one potential culprit for recurrence and therapy_resistance in gbm gbm exhibit substantial subclonal diversity as evidenced by previous comparative_genomic cgh analyses fluorescence_in studies and areal sampling of surgical tissue followed by molecular_analyses moreover heterogeneity within gbm is maintained by crosstalk between genetically_distinct tumor_cell sps however genome_wide analyses of intra tumoral to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work heterogeneity and the clonal cellular sp dynamics within gbm have yet to be performed clonal architecture analyses as previously performed for acute_lymphoblastic single cells are difficult to perform for solid_tumors that are a tight mix of distinct sps and various fractions of non neoplastic_cells knowing the purity of a tumor sample is important to determine sample quality and to adjust parameters during copy_number estimation and detection of somatic_mutations the advances in next_generation ngs technologies_provide emerging tools for computational_methods to overcome those hurdles absolute for example is an analytic_method that predicts tumor_purity and the distribution of mutations within the tumor from exome_sequencing the inferences made by absolute do not include the number of tumor sps and the size of each sp in the tumor bulk these are however desirable parameters when quantifying genetic_heterogeneity an emerging biomarker for clinical_outcome shah et_al have developed another bioinformatic approach to predict the number and distribution of subclones from deepsequenced selected mutated genes and to infer the clonal_evolution of triple_negative by this method two sps with the same mutation in the region that was deep sequenced would be indistinguishable even if greatly divergent in other areas of the genome this approach further relies on prior_knowledge or hypotheses regarding genes of interest and does not allow for unbiased exploration of the cancer genome nik zainal et_al modeled the observed patterns of clonal and subclonal mutations with a hierarchical bayesian dirichlet_process this approach was designed specifically for the mutations detected in the whole_genome of a hypermutated breast_cancer sequenced at high coverage fold the authors inferred a plethora of information about the evolution and subclonal structure of this cancer genome by using various ways to look at the data as described in yet their combined approaches are not available as one automated method the resolution of the aforementioned approaches increases with depth of coverage we propose that the accuracy in the identification of sps is dependent not only on depth of coverage but also on breadth of coverage i e the fraction of nucleotides in the genome sampled by the assay here we intend to complement existing_methods by pairing an unbiased genome_wide sequencing approach with a robust analytic algorithm we present expanding ploidy and allele_frequency on nested subpopulations expands a method that characterizes coexisting sps in a tumor using copy_number and allele_frequencies derived from exome or whole_genome input_data the model amplifies the statistical_power coexisting genotypes by fully exploiting run specific tradeoffs between depth of coverage and breadth of coverage our results indicate that expands is superior to absolute in predicting tumor_purity of highly_heterogeneous tumor_samples in addition to tumor_purity expands predicts the number of clonal expansions the size of the resulting sps in the tumor bulk and the mutations specific to each sp this information can be useful to identify candidate gene_regulators of tumor_growth and recurrence the article outline is as follows in section we formulate the problem and describe the expands model section describes the performance of expands on a simulated dataset data obtained from one previously_published whole_genome sequenced breast_cancer case and tcga gbm exomesequenced samples section shows how our approach results inform about sp composition in primary gbm and sp changes on recurrence and what genes are mutated in the most welladapted sps finally in section we discuss limitations to our method and propose future_directions for the approach of tumor mixture separation
