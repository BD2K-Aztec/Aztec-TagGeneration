spex automated concise extraction of spatial gene_expression from fly embryo ish images motivation microarray profiling of mrna_abundance is often ill suited for temporalspatial analysis of gene_expressions in multicellular_organisms such as drosophila recent_progress in image_based genome_scale profiling of whole_body mrna patterns via in situ_hybridization ish calls for development of accurate and automatic image_analysis systems to facilitate efficient mining of complex temporalspatial mrna patterns which will be essential for functional_genomics and network_inference in higher organisms results we present spex an automatic system for embryonic ish image_processing which can extract transform compare classify and cluster spatial gene_expression in drosophila_embryos our pipeline for gene_expression pattern extraction outputs the precise spatial_locations and strengths of the gene_expression we performed experiments on the largest publicly_available collection of drosophila ish images and show that our method achieves excellent_performance in automatic image annotation and also finds clusters that are significantly_enriched both for gene_ontology functional_annotations and for annotation terms from a controlled_vocabulary used by human curators to describe these images availability software will be available atin multicellular_organisms such as the metazoans many important biological_processes such as development and differentiation depend fundamentally on the spatial and temporal_control of gene_expression to date the molecular basis and regulatory circuitry underlying metazoan gene_regulation remains_largely numerous algorithmic approaches have been attempted to infer networks of regulatory_elements from highthroughput experimental_data such as microarray profiles chip_chip genome localization data and protein_protein data based on formalisms such as bayesian_networks or graph mining however a key deficiency of these approaches is that they rely heavily on highthroughput biological data like microarrays that only capture average behaviour of the genes and proteins in a large cell_population from e g a cell_culture a dissected tissue or even a homogenized whole animal for multicellular_organisms such as drosophila and human gene_expressions must be described in a spatiotemporal context which reveals the histological specificities and temporal_dynamics to whom correspondence should be addressed of the activities of the gene such information is not available from the standard whole animal microarray_data which record only the average expression of each gene over all cells in the body nor is it easily_obtainable from tissue_specific microarray assays using advanced micro dissection and cell_sorting techniques in situ_hybridization ish assay is an imaging method to visualize mrna_expression in tissues and cells without homogenizing the specimens to be analyzed and therefore retains the original histological context of gene_expression such information is indispensable for in depth analysis of gene_regulation networks developmental_mechanisms and oncogenic processes in higher eukaryotic_organisms montalta systematic profiling of ish images capturing gene_expressions over the entire span of drosophila embryogenesis are now being undertaken at a whole genome_scale offering an unprecedented opportunity for investigators to compare the spatio temporal_behavior of genes and begin assembling realistic pictures of gene_regulatory underlying the developmental_process the fast_growing expression pattern database under the berkeley drosophila genome_project now contains around digital_images of expression_patterns of over genes as of now the only mining approach offered by the bdgp to search for for example co expressed genes or anatomical and histological annotations of the gene_expressions is based on manuallabeling of the images by a domain expert using a controlled_vocabulary however with the rapid_growth of data volume manual_analysis is no longer feasible and automatic_analysis techniquesspex represents the first step towards automatic functional analysis of ish images of drosophila_embryos namely concise extraction of spatial gene_expression our extraction system employs a pipeline of analytical_techniques to first standardize the embryo via embryo outline extraction orientation detection and correction and registration and then extracts spatial expression signal via filters and probabilistic segmenters finally it converts the spatial signals into a low_dimensional feature representation suitable for advanced analysis we evaluated our system by using the resultant features for automatic pattern annotation and clustering using simple classification_techniques and our sophisticated feature_extraction pipeline we achieved a significant_improvement in annotation accuracy over existing_systems we also clustered the drosophila ish images and conducted enrichment_analysis on both pattern term annotations and go functional_annotations we found significant_enrichment in both scenarios the next step is a more detailed analysis of ish images using this feature representation the current work has focused on clustering images from a single time stepin the future we plan to study image_analysis across time another important question to be addressed is how to combine microarray_data with ish image data to be able to be able to leverage two independent sources for joint analysis the concise spatial_pattern of genes extracted from ish images by spex can also be used as a token of gene_expression and applied to infer a gene regulation_network as with microarray_data a detailed study along this direction involves some additional technicalities and is therefore beyond the scope of this paper finally another direction of future_research would be to find timevarying gene_regulatory using this data such analysis would allow us to capture spatial variations at a single time stage as well as varying relationships between genes across time a first step in this direction has been taken for microarray_data by ahmed and xing we intend to develop extensions of this model for drosophila ish images thus enabling us to discover spatialtemporal gene_regulation networks
