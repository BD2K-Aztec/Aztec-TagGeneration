genetics_and ferret a user_friendly java tool to extract data from the genomes_project the genomes kg project provides a near comprehensive resource on human genetic_variation in worldwide reference_populations kg variants can be accessed through a browser and through the raw and annotated data that are regularly released on an ftp server we developed ferret a user_friendly java tool to easily extract genetic_variation information from these large and complex data_files from a locus gene s or snp s of interest ferret retrieves genotype data for kg snps and indels and computes allelic_frequencies for kg populations and optionally for the exome_sequencing project populations by converting the kg data into files that can be imported into popular pre existing_tools e g plink and haploview ferret offers a straightforward way even for non bioinformatics specialists to manipulate explore and merge kg data with the users dataset as well as visualize linkage_disequilibrium pattern infer haplo types and design tagsnps availability_and ferret tool and source_code are publicly_available at http limou sophie github io ferret the genomes kg project is an international_consortium to establish a human_genome map of genetic_variations snps indels and cnvs with a minor_allele as low as in the coding_regions and in the rest of the genome in multiple reference_populations genomes this publicly_available near comprehensive catalogue of human_genome diversity contributes to improve the human reference_sequence and furthers understanding of the evolutionary_history of populations and of the genetic_contribution to diseases and traits the kg variants can be directly queried through the kg browser however the process to access some information can become tedious requiring a good knowledge of the website architecture and many clicks raw and annotated data are regularly released on the kg ftp server but manipulating these large data_files requires advanced bioinformatics skills finally kg offers the vcf to ped converter to transform snp_genotype of a locus from the kg vcf files into files that can be loaded into the haploview visualization_tool we developed ferret as a user_friendly to easily extract genotype data from kg snps and indels into files that can be imported into popular pre existing_tools while also computing allelic_frequencies ferret unique features are to i handle snp and indel genotype data ii extract data from a locus gene s or snp s of interest iii calculate snp indel and cnv allele_frequencies in kg and exome_sequencing project exome variant server nhlbi go exome_sequencing project esp seattle wa http evs gs washington edu evs populations iv create plink and haploview output_files and v provide a user_friendly for the non bioinformatics specialists ferret is therefore a straightforward program that permits easy manipulation exploration and visualization of kg genotype data with well known pre existing_tools
