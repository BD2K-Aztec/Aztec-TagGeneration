metscape bioinformatics tool for the analysis and visualization of metabolomics and gene_expression data motivation metabolomics is a rapidly_evolving that holds_promise to provide insights into genotypephenotype relationships in cancers diabetes and other complex_diseases one of the major informatics challenges is providing tools that link metabolite data with other types of high_throughput molecular data e g transcriptomics proteomics and incorporate_prior of pathways and molecular_interactions results we describe a new substantially redesigned version of our tool metscape that allows users to enter experimental_data for metabolites genes and pathways and display them in the context of relevant metabolic_networks metscape uses an internal relational_database that integrates data from kegg and ehmn databases the new version of the tool allows users to identify enriched pathways from expression_profiling data build and analyze the networks of genes and metabolites and visualize changes in the gene metabolite data we demonstrate the applications of metscape to annotate molecular_pathways for human and mouse metabolites implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis induced acute_lung for the analysis of gene_expression and metabolite data from pancreatic_ductal and for identification of the candidate metabolites involved in cancer and inflammation availability metscape is part of the national_institutes supported national center for integrative biomedical_informatics ncibi suite of tools freely_available atlarge scale omics studies have been successful at revealing differences in gene_expression protein and metabolite abundance and post_translational protein_modifications thus providing different level views of the molecular_processes that lead to disease_phenotypes molecular pathway_databases and metabolic maps that contain computationally predicted and literature derived information provide a path to connecting these views together while many tools have been developed for the analysis of gene_expression and proteomics_data to date there are few that allow the user to analyze metabolomics_data and to link them with other omics_data high_quality genome_scale reconstructions represent a critical component in developing such a tool the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg was one of the first database to provide information about biological_pathways in conjunction with gene data from a range of different organisms over organism specific metabolic reconstructions were published providing excellent sources of information about metabolic_pathways genes_encoding metabolic_enzymes reactions catalyzed by them and the compounds that participate in these reactions in addition to the information about the components of metabolic_pathways databases like kegg biocyc and smpd provide data visualization in the form of individual pathway charts or the overall view of metabolic_pathways the pathway charts are actively used by many researchers to help interpret their data formulate new hypotheses and present the results however as the data input volume and complexity grow such manual_analysis is becoming increasingly difficult efforts have been made to visualize the experimental_data over the static pathways charts or make these charts interactive one recently_developed tool paintomics provides the ability to load gene_expression and metabolite measurements and visualize them over kegg_pathway maps a more interactive tool vanted has been developed for the explorationfirst we describe the features of metscape next we demonstrate several potential workflows with three applications we show that metscape was useful in visualizing the data linking them to prior_knowledge of metabolic_pathways and helpful for generating new hypotheses thereby contributing to the overall understanding of the underlying biological_processes visualization of genes enzymes metabolites pathways and their relationships proved is an important step in biological_interpretation of high_throughput omics experiments and understanding molecular_mechanisms of diseases the ability to link different types of biological data and examine them within the same framework further enhances this understanding while there is an abundance of tools for visualizing molecular_pathways few currently offer the level of interactivity desired by many researchers we have
