improved ancestry_inference using weights from external reference_panels motivation inference of ancestry using genetic data is motivated by applications in genetic_association population_genetics and personal_genomics here we provide methods and software for improved ancestry_inference using genome_wide single nucleotide poly morphism snp weights from external reference_panels this approach makes it possible to leverage the rich ancestry information that is available from large external reference_panels without the administrative and computational complexities of re analyzing the raw genotype data from the reference_panel in subsequent studies results we extensively validate our approach in multiple african_american latino american and european_american datasets making use of genome_wide snp weights derived from large reference_panels including hapmap populations and european_americans from the framingham_heart we show empirically that our approach provides much greater_accuracy than either the prevailing ancestry informative marker aim approach or the analysis of genome_wide target genotypes without a reference_panel for example in an independent set of european_american genome_wide samples we attained prediction_accuracy r of and for the first two principal_components using our method compared with and using published aims or and by applying principal_component directly to the target samples we finally show that the higher accuracy in inferring ancestry using our method leads to more effective correction for population_stratification in association studies availability the snpweights software is available online at http www hsph harvard edu faculty alkes price software applications in genetic_association population_genetics and personal_genomics motivate inference of genetic ancestry using single_nucleotide snp genotypes in genetic_association ancestry_inference can be applied to control population_stratification which can lead to spurious association between the genetic_variant and the phenotype under study in personal_genomics many private companies provide genetic_testing on ancestry which involves inference of ancestry based on information of genetic data from a single individual in genome_wide gwas several methods have been proposed to adjust for population_stratification methods that explicitly infer genetic ancestry include structured association principal_component pca and multidimensional_scaling to infer genetic ancestry these methods can be either applied to the target samples only or applied to the target samples combined with an external reference_panel to improve accuracy when inferring ancestry for a single target individual in a personal_genomics setting it is necessary to include an external reference_panel as an alternative to applying these methods to genome_wide data they can be applied to a subset of ancestry informative markers aims for example aim panels have been developed for european_americans and latino americans the use of raw genotypes from a large reference_panel to improve accuracy poses several complexities including the logistics of obtaining and managing additional raw genotype data concerns about sharing raw genotype data owing to privacy or other reasons and increased computational_cost although the aim approach can ameliorate some of these complexities restricting to aims when genome_wide data are available reduces accuracy given that data on genome_wide markers now can be generated through low_coverage at very low_cost an approach that can fully use the ancestry information of genome_wide markers is needed here we propose methods and software for ancestry_inference based on genome_wide snp weights this approach_requires just the raw genotypes from the target samples and a set of genomewide snp weights pre_computed using external reference_panels notably the reference_panels of genotypes do not need to be shared inferring ancestry using the genome_wide snp weights to whom correspondence should be addressed does not depend on the sample_size or diversity of the study samples and can infer ancestry for related samples for which direct pca is often confounded by family_structure to demonstrate our method we first built an ancestry_inference model for african_americans using genome_wide snps and validated our model using independent hapmap samples this model_predicts the first principal component pc for african_americans and can also transform predicted pc into european_ancestry we determined that predicted ancestry using genome_wide snp weights is more accurate than predicted ancestry using a limited number of aims we extended the model to infer ancestry from east_asian european and west african_populations using pc and pc from these populations once again predicted ancestry using genome_wide snp weights was extremely accurate finally we built an ancestry_inference model for european_americans using northwest european nw southeast european se and ashkenazi_jewish aj ancestral_populations we used european_american reference samples from the framingham_heart fhs share data to build the model and validated the model with independent samples from a bipolar_disorder bd gwas and a breast_cancer bca gwas for both bd and bca datasets the predicted pc and pc attained higher accuracy than direct_application of pca in addition simulations showed that our method outperforms the aim approach in correcting population_stratification in gwas ancestry_inference software incorporating snp weights for all of the populations considered here can be downloaded from http www hsph har vard edu faculty alkes price software in this study we presented methods and software for ancestry_inference using genome_wide snp weights derived from large reference_panels we showed empirically that this approach can accurately_predict pcs and ancestry in populations of admixed continental ancestry and in european_americans which have more subtle population_structure our results highlight the advantage of inferring ancestry using genome_wide snps obtained from a large external reference_panel we further compared predicted pcs obtained by using genome_wide snps with those obtained by using subsets of random snps or aims and showed that predicted pcs using genome_wide snps have the highest_accuracy aim panels have been proposed for ancestry_inference in african_americans latino americans and european_americans for african_americans it had been suggested that accurate ancestry_inference requires only aims however we observed that genome_wide snps provide more accurate ancestry estimates than even aims in african_americans thus our approach based on genome_wide snp weights outperforms the use of aim panels our simulation_study of population_stratification further confirmed this point by showing that adjustment using our method outperforms adjustment using aims in applications in real_data analysis the aim approach has the advantage that it requires less genotyping work if genome_wide snp genotypes are not available however as the genome_wide marker data can now be generated at very low_cost genotyping costs are less likely to be a limitation going forward we also stress that our method can be used even when the input genotypes contain an incomplete set of snps compared with the genome_wide snp weights for example if they were typed on a different genotyping platform our simulations show that random snps or random snps are sufficient to predict ancestry with high_accuracy in african_americans or european_americans respectively however a smaller number of random snps genotyped in candidate_gene or targeted replication studies would not be sufficient to infer ancestry in these populations by constructing snp weights with a carefully_selected unrelated reference_panel our approach can accurately infer ancestry for related target samples while direct pca on related target samples may provide inaccurate estimates of populationof ancestry due to relatedness but the ancestry_inference is limited to the unrelated target samples which may have insufficient sample_size and diversity by using a large external reference_panel to compute the snp weights our method is not limited to the target samples and can attain accurate ancestry_inference for related target samples another advantage of our method is that it is based on precomputed snp weights the pre_computed snp weights can be readily shared with our software release on the contrary the existing_methods for accurate ancestry estimation usually require raw genotypes from a large external reference_sample access to raw genotypes entails substantial administrative complexities which can be time consuming the sharing of snp weights is also more privacy preserving than the sharing of raw genotypes we note that it may be plausible to detect whether a given individual is in the set of samples used to calculate the snp weights analogous to detecting whether a given individual is in the set of samples used to calculate summary_statistics however because the samples that we used to calculate snp weights in were ascertained without regard to any phenotype inferring whether a given individual is in that set of samples reveals less information than inferring whether a given individual is in a set of samples ascertained for a particular phenotype our method also has the advantage of reduced running time existing software requires time o mn to compute pcs where m is the number of snps and n is the number of samples in theory randomized eigenvector approximations can reduce the running time to o mn however a colleague of ours reports that efforts to apply this approach to genetic data have not yet been successful as in large_datasets eigenvalues may be highly_significant reflecting real population_structure in the data but only slightly larger than background_noise eigenvalues and thus sometimes missed by randomized methods n patterson personal communication thus our simple o mn approach offers real practical advantages our method relies on including samples from the appropriate ancestral_populations to build the model to correctly infer ancestry component for given admixed samples however the predicted pcs reflect the pcs obtained by performing pca on the combined raw genotypes from the admixed population and the ancestral samples irrespective of which ancestral samples were included in the analysis in the analyses presented here we built ancestry_inference models using samples from three continental populations or nw se and aj european_populations when applying our method to samples with no good match in the ancestral_populations used we still accurately_predicted the top pcs from pca although caution is warranted in interpreting the results of either of these analyses with respect to the ancestral_populations used we can readily extend our method to build models with samples from other ancestral_populations for example similar models can be built for indian and native_american populations using appropriate reference_panels extension to more than three ancestral_populations is straightforward but accuracy is contingent on the sample_size and diversity of the ancestral samples as lower pcs may represent more subtle population_structure in summary we have developed a method for ancestry_inference using genome_wide snp weights our method only requires genotypes from the target samples and publicly_available snp weights and is highly computationally_efficient the method can be readily applied in genetic_association for population_stratification adjustment and in personal_genomics for predicting the ancestry component of an individual for diseases or health_outcomes associated with ancestry the predicted ancestry values can be used for risk_stratification and risk prediction
