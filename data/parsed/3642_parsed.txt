predicting giant transmembrane barrel architecture motivation the barrel is a ubiquitous fold that is deployed to accomplish a wide_variety of biological_functions including membrane_embedded pores key influences of barrel lumen_diameter include the number of strands n and the degree of shear s the latter value measuring the extent to which the sheet is tilted within the barrel notably it has previously been reported that the shear value for small antiparallel barrels n typically ranges between n and n conversely it has been suggested that the strands in giant antiparallel barrels such as those formed by pore_forming cholesterol_dependent cytolysins cdc are parallel relative to the axis of the barrel i e s the s arrangement however has never been observed in crystal_structures of small barrels therefore the structural basis for how cdcs form a barrel and span a membrane remains to be understood results through comparison of molecular_models with experimental_data we are able to identify how giant cdc barrels utilize a near parallel arrangement of strands where s n furthermore we show how side chain packing within the barrel lumen is an important limiting_factor with respect to the possible shear values for small barrels n strands in contrast our models reveal no such limitation restricts the shear value of giant barrels n strands giant barrels can thus access a different architecture compared with smaller barrels the barrel structure is central to a large number of functionally diverse proteins barrels are deployed as enzymes e g the outer_membrane protease ompt as water_soluble transport proteins e g lipocalins as fluorescent_proteins e g green_fluorescent and as membrane_embedded channels e g porins the properties of small barrels have been well characterized in particular the shear value s of the barrel describes the stagger of individual strands for a given number of strands n the to whom correspondence should be addressed greater the shear value the greater the slope each strand is relative to the axis of the barrel lumen conversely the lower the s value the closer to parallel the strand is relative to the axis of the barrel lumen supplementary a shear value of results in strands that lie parallel to the barrel lumen most importantly when the number of strands and the shear value is known for a barrel the diameter can be calculated for cylindrical barrels with a high degree of accuracy for small barrels n that are structurally_characterized the s value of these structures lies between n and n to date the structures of over transmembrane barrels have been determined analysis of these data reveal that membrane barrels obey the same structural rules observed for their soluble counterparts a subset of transmembrane barrels includes structures that are formed by homo oligomerization examples of such barrels include tolc and pore_forming toxins such as haemolysin although membrane barrels have contributed to our understanding of small pore_forming toxins less is known about the giant homo oligomeric barrel pores formed by members of the cholesterol_dependent cytolysins cdc membrane_attack perforin macpf superfamily this superfamily includes key bacterial_virulence produced by gram_positive as well as the major immune effectors of mammals no crystal_structure of a macpf or cdc pore has been determined to date however the resolution cryo_electron em structure of pneumolysin reveals that this cdc forms a giant diameter barrel that contains monomers to make this barrel each pneumolysin monomer contributes two amphipathic hairpins i e four antiparallel strands initial models presented through em studies of the cdc pneumolysin suggested that the strands are parallel to the lumen in order to reach and fully span the lipid_bilayer as a barrel however such an arrangement would not be consistent with a shear value between n and n as observed in the known crystal_structures of transmembrane barrels here using molecular_models we show that the optimal shear value of these giant barrel structures is s n i e arranged in a near parallel fashion with respect to the barrel lumen we further demonstrate that barrels with strands are unable to readily access such architecture as a consequence of luminal side chain packing constraints
