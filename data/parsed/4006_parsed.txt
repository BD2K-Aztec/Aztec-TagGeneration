structural_bioinformatics ribomaker computational_design of conformation based riboregulation motivation the ability to engineer control systems of gene_expression is instrumental for synthetic_biology thus bioinformatic_methods that assist such engineering are appealing because they can guide the sequence design and prevent costly experimental screening in particular rna is an ideal substrate to de_novo design regulators of protein expression by following sequence to function models results we have implemented a novel algorithm ribomaker aimed at the computational automated design of bacterial riboregulation ribomaker reads the sequence and structure specifications which codify for a gene regulatory behaviour and optimizes the sequences of a small regulatory_rna and a untranslated_region for an efficient intermolecular interaction to this end it implements an evolutionary design_strategy where random_mutations are selected according to a physicochemical model based on free_energies the resulting sequences can then be tested_experimentally providing a new tool for synthetic_biology and also for investigating the riboregulation principles in natural_systems availability_and web_server is available at http ribomaker jaramillolab org source_code instructions and examples are freely_available for download at http sourceforge net_projects ribomaker regulatory_rnas have been identified at the core of many cellular_processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes among all possible mechanisms here we focus on regulatory_rnas that interact with a given mrna to control protein expression by applying engineering principles we can design synthetic regulatory_rnas to create genetic modules from which to program novel functions in the cell in bacteria this can be achieved by means of a small_rna srna whose length varies from tens to hundreds nucleotides and which is highly_structured the srna interacts with the untranslated_region utr of a given mrna as this region controls the ability to interact with the ribosome this control of gene_expression only relies on structural changes in the utr without any rna_processing which makes it independent of any additional cellular_machinery this riboregulatory mechanism allows harnessing physicochemical models to predict rna interaction and function we take advantage of rna_folding prediction_methods as well as methods for predicting rna interactions to perform the de_novo design of srnas and utrs with a base_pair energy_model then the designed rna systems can be exploited for instance to control metabolic_pathways in bioproduction applications in this work we present an evolutionary method to design nucleic_acid implementing riboregulatory modules for that a multi objective combinatorial optimization_algorithm is implemented where the free_energies and secondary_structures of the system are considered importantly fully synthetic sequences obtained by computational_design have been already verified for functionality in vitro and in bacterial cells in contrast to our previous method the present is not restricted to a neutral evolution within the inverse folding of predefined rna_secondary therefore the full specification of the intramolecular structures of the species is not essential this dramatically speeds up the optimization ribomaker is devised for the computational_design of conformation based riboregulation and in particular of bacterial riboregulation it designs the riboregulator srna and the targeted utr of a given mrna moreover srnas can be designed to activate or repress protein expression it can also design only one element utr or srna provided the other is fixed the resulting sequences can then be tested_experimentally in a living_cell provided promoter_sequences ribomaker could be expanded to account for the computational_design of further riboregulatory mechanisms to whom correspondence should be addressed
