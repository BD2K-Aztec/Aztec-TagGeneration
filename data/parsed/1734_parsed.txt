genetics_and famagg an r package to evaluate familial_aggregation of traits in large_pedigrees familial_aggregation analysis is the first fundamental step to perform when assessing the extent of genetic_background of a disease however there is a lack of software to analyze the fa milial clustering of complex phenotypes in very large_pedigrees such pedigrees can be utilized to calculate measures that express trait aggregation on both the family and individual_level providing valuable directions in choosing families for detailed follow_up studies we developed famagg an open_source r package that contains both established and novel methods to investigate familial_aggregation of traits in large_pedigrees we demonstrate its use and interpretation by analyzing a publicly_available cancer dataset with more than participants distributed across approximately families availability_and the famagg package is freely_available at the bioconductor repository http www bioconductor org_packages famagg the investigation of whether a disease or symptom trait recurs more often among close_relatives than in the general_population is a deeply rooted subject in genetic_epidemiology often termed as familial_aggregation analysis while segregation_analysis was the tool of choice to identify patterns of mendelian_diseases there is no unique method to highlight familial clusters for complex_diseases especially in situations involving very large_pedigrees lacking a regular family_structure in this setting more than three decades_ago a computational_method was first developed to highlight familial_aggregation of various cancer_types the method was based on the kinship coefficient u ij which is the probability that two subjects i and j share the same allele identical by descent at one locus and represents a suitable measure to quantify the relationship between two individuals in the pedigree in this early approach the average kinship between all affected pairs was compared to the mean kinship of multiple sets of randomly_selected matched_controls this and other kinship based_methods have been successfully_applied to very large_pedigrees to assess whether diseases such as autism or parkinsons disease showed evidence of familial_aggregation the kinship based_approach was also extended to be used with time to event data the presence of familial_clustering is assessed based on disease incidence_rates thus accounting for the time to disease_onset driven by the lack of open_access tools for familial_aggregation analyses in large_pedigrees we have developed an r package providing this functionality besides basic pedigree_analysis sub setting and plotting methods it implements the previously_published based on average kinship and disease incidence_rates as well as two novel approaches to detect familial_aggregation employing statistics based on kinship coefficients combined with monte_carlo techniques
