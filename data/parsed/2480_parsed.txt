inps md a web_server to predict stability of protein variants from sequence and structure motivation protein_function depends on its structural_stability the effects of single point variations on protein_stability can elucidate the molecular_mechanisms of human_diseases and help in developing new drugs recently we introduced inps a method suited to predict the effect of variations on protein_stability from protein_sequence and whose performance is competitive with the available state of the art tools results in this article we describe inps md impact of non synonymous variations on protein_stability multi dimension a web_server for the prediction of protein_stability changes upon single point variation from protein_sequence and or structure here we complement inps with a new pre dictor inps d that exploits features derived from protein d structure inps d scores with pearsons_correlation to experimental ddg values of in cross_validation and of on a blind test_set the sequence_based inps scores slightly_lower than the structure based inps d and both on the same blind test_sets well compare with the state of the art methods availability_and inps and inps d are available at the same web_server http inpsmd biocomp unibo it stability of protein variants may or may not be different for wild_type this information is relevant to understand the relation between protein variants and insurgence of diseases several methods have been developed so_far to predict stability change in protein variants either based on protein_sequence or structure features recently we developed inps a sequence_based method devised to predict protein_stability change ddg upon single point variations well comparing with the state of the art methods here we present a web_server inps md that includes the sequence_based inps and a new method inps d exploiting descriptors derived from the protein d structure benchmark results performed on two experimentally_derived datasets of variations show that the structure based inps d performs better than the sequence_based inps when predicting the change in protein_stability upon variation inps md is available at http inpsmd biocomp unibo it
