automated tracking and analysis of centrosomes in early caenorhabditis elegans_embryos motivation the centrosome is a dynamic structure in animal cells that serves as a microtubule_organizing during mitosis and also regulates cell_cycle and sets polarity cues automated and reliable tracking of centrosomes is essential for genetic_screens that study the process of centrosome assembly and maturation in the nematode_caenorhabditis results we have developed a fully_automatic system for tracking and measuring fluorescently_labeled centrosomes in d time lapse images of early c elegans_embryos using a spinning disc microscope we monitor the centrosome cycle in living embryos from the up to the cell stage at imaging intervals between and s after establishing the centrosome trajectories with a novel method involving two layers of inference we also automatically detect the nuclear_envelope in each cell_division and recognize the identities of the centrosomes based on the invariant cell_lineage of c elegans to date we have tracked centrosomes in over wild_type embryos with almost no manual correction required availability the centrosome tracking software along with test data is freely_available atgenetic screens that produce and require analysis of massive_amounts of image data are becoming a major tool in functional_genomics here we do so to study the assembly and maturation of centrosomes an organelle in animal cells that serves as a microtubule organizing centre during mitosis in the nematode_caenorhabditis in principle centrosomes can be of any size the embryo however exhibits remarkable precision in setting centrosome size in relation to cell size that get progressively smaller through development this is crucial because centrosome size in turn sets the length of the mitotic_spindle and is involved in signaling activities within the cell several studies have identified genetic_factors of centrosome size but the molecular_mechanism of how a cell adopts the size of its dynamic organelles remains_poorly in these studies only the spatial but not the temporal_information of centrosome growth has been considered and so we aim to overcome this shortcoming by to whom correspondence should be addressed frame p s nebd in frame ems s nebd in frame abp s nebd in frame aba s nebd in frame ems p precisely quantifying the kinetics of centrosome growth in wild_type embryos to visualize centrosomal proteins of interest in living c elegans_embryos we use fluorescent markers such as gfp and reduce their levels by rna_interference rnai in order to assay function we then produce d time lapse images of such labeled and or genetically_altered centrosomes in this article we present a suite of algorithms that analyze these images in the earliest related work report a system that identifies and tracks nuclei and meta phase chromosomes in c elegans via histone gfp their goal is to trace the cell_lineage up to hundreds of cells in one color channel and use a second color channel to monitor gene_expression compared to our problem the objects tracked are large their phase easily distinguished by their shape and their frame to frame movement is small none of which are true for centrosomes recently present an algorithm for tracking centrosomes in neuron cells for the study of neuron migration short_sequences of only time points at s intervals are recorded and the analysis cannot handle multiple centrosomes at the same x y location these circumstances are thus considerably simpler than those considered here to robustly solve the problem of tracking centrosomes in developing c elegans_embryos we have extended a bipartite
