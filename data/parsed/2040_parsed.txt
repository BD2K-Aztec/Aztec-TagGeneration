genome_analysis genotype_calling and mapping of multisite variants using an atlantic_salmon iselect snp_array motivation due to a genome duplication event in the recent history of salmonids modern atlantic_salmon salmo_salar have a mosaic genome with roughly one third being tetraploid this is a complicating_factor in genotyping and genetic_mapping since polymorphisms within duplicated regions multisite variants msvs are challenging to call and to assign to the correct paralogue standard genotyping software offered by illumina has not been written to interpret msvs and will either fail or miscall these polymorphisms for the purpose of mapping linkage or association studies in non diploid species there is a pressing need for software that includes analysis of msvs in addition to regular single_nucleotide snp markers results a software_package is presented for the analysis of partially tetraploid genomes genotyped using illumina_infinium beadarrays illumina inc that includes pre_processing clustering plotting and validation routines more than salmon from an aquacultural strain in norway distributed among full sib families were genotyped on a k beadarray including both snp and msv markers a total of snps and msvs were identified with average call accuracies of and respectively a total of msvs polymorphic in both paralogs were dissected and mapped to their respective chromosomes yielding insights about the salmon genome reversion to diploidy and improving marker genome_coverage several retained homologies were found and are reported availability_and r package beadarraymsv freely_available on the web at http cran r project org salmonid fishes have experienced several whole_genome wgd events in their evolutionary_history the r hypothesis states there have been two early wgd events common for all jawed_vertebrates which were followed by subsequent r common for all ray_finned fishes and r duplications unique for the salmonid lineage usually wgd to whom correspondence should be addressed is followed by extensive modifications of both the genome and transcriptome with a gradual return to diploidy occurring over time the key event during reversion to diploidy is the switch from tetrasomic to disomic inheritance i e from having four chromosomes forming a quadrivalent to having two pairs each forming a bivalent during meiosis salmon is still in the process of returning to diploidy after the latest wgd and the genome displays substantial evidence of retained homologies single_nucleotide snp markers have proven useful in linkage and association studies and next_generation have created exciting_opportunities for genome_sequencing and snp discovery the process of snp discovery is not straightforward however and duplicated genomes in particular contain paralogous sequence_variants psvs which are readily mistaken for snps a psv is created when there is a base_pair difference between the sequences of two paralogs but the substitution does not segregate within either paralogue another source of variation in polyploid genomes are multisite variants msv which in contrast to psvs segregate for a base substitution in one or both of the paralogous loci msvs are polymorphic and potentially informative however lack of designated software for polyploid genomes makes analysis difficult in atlantic_salmon and other salmonids the large_numbers of msvs and psvs have complicated the use of snp_arrays in genome_wide association gwas and population_genetics studies this is also true for polyploid species of major agronomic importance such as wheat and potato illuminas infinium technology illumina inc is one of the most widely used snp_array technologies which allows simultaneous genotyping of thousands to millions of snps in samples run in parallel on a single silicon slide the assay chemistry translates the sample allele composition into red and green fluorophores see steemers andfor more detail illuminas proprietary genomestudio genotyping analysis module v or an earlier relative converts red and green signals for each snp into a and b signals whose values reflect the relative_abundance of arbitrarily assigned a and b alleles signal is converted into polar coordinates using the manhattan distance_metric for the intensity r and with theta representing angle degrees each marker is clustered in cartesian coordinates and the genotypes aa ab bb are assigned to samples in clusters close to theta an example of a typical diploid snp with well separated clusters is given in
