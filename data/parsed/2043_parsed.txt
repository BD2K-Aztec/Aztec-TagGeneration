genetics_and genowap gwas signal prioritization through integrated analysis of genomic functional_annotation motivation genome_wide gwas has been a great success in the past_decade however significant challenges still remain in both identifying new risk_loci and interpreting_results bonferroni_corrected significance_level is known to be conservative leading to insufficient statistical_power when the effect_size is moderate at risk locus complex structure of linkage dis equilibrium also makes it challenging to separate causal_variants from nonfunctional ones in large haplotype_blocks under such circumstances a computational_approach that may increase signal replication rate and identify potential functional sites among correlated markers is urgently_needed results we describe genowap a gwas signal prioritization method that integrates genomic functional_annotation and gwas test_statistics the effectiveness of genowap is demonstrated through its applications to crohns_disease and schizophrenia using the largest studies available where highly ranked loci show substantially stronger signals in the whole dataset after prioritiza tion based on a subset of samples at the single_nucleotide snp level top_ranked snps after prioritization have both higher replication rates and consistently stronger enrichment of eqtls within each risk locus genowap may be able to distinguish functional sites from groups of correlated snps in the past ten years genome_wide gwas have been designed and applied to identify disease genes for almost all complex_diseases as of single_nucleotide snp from over publications have been documented in the gwas catalog despite its great success in identifying disease associated loci scientists have noted several limitations of current gwas approaches first although linkage_disequilibrium ld is the basis of gwas it also hinders the interpretation of association results due to the complex ld_structure among snps it is the disease associated haplotype_blocks varying in size from a few kb to more than kb that are identified in gwass therefore the resolution of gwas is not sufficient for distinguishing causal_variants from a large group of correlated snps especially in non coding_regions where the mechanism of genomic function is still largely v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com unknown second although bonferroni_corrected significance threshold i e is widely_accepted as the standard cutoff in gwas analysis it is well known that bonferroni_correction as an approach that controls family_wise is conservative when the number of hypotheses is large and there are many weak to moderate signals in fact for most complex_diseases numerous genomic_loci are involved in disease_etiology while each locus only has a moderate_effect therefore studies based on high_throughput genomic scan may be underpowered if the sample_size is not large enough this has led to so_called missing_heritability which refers to the gap between the narrow sense heritability estimated from twin pedigree_analysis and the proportion of the variance explained by significant snps identified from gwas that has been reported for many diseases one explanation of missing_heritability is the insufficient statistical_power to identify all the disease associated snps variant_prioritization techniques are crucial for post gwas analysis on different scales locally it may be able to reveal truly functional sites within each significant locus globally signals at some loci can be enhanced if proper prior information is used many variant_prioritization methods have been proposed supervised_learning based statistical_tools for predicting deleterious variants are probably the richest among available approaches so_far most of the existing deleteriousness prediction_tools only focus on protein_coding in the human_genome however coding_region based tools are not sufficient for gwas signal prioritization because nearly of the significant snps identified in gwas are intronic or intergenic a few tools targeting non coding variants have been proposed detailed comparisons of these methods were reviewed elsewhere unlike the extensively_studied protein altering variants very few non coding pathogenic_variants have been revealed so_far moreover non coding variants span a much wider functional spectrum varied and complex mechanisms from cell specific transcription_factor tfbs to enhancers insulators short and long_range epigenetic and structural effects on dna make it challenging to understand non coding variants in the human_genome therefore existing noncoding variant prioritization_tools based on supervised_learning may suffer from the potentially biased training data their performance in gwas signal prioritization remains to be further investigated finally although deleteriousness of a single snp is crucial for identifying causal_variants it does not provide all the information needed in gwas signal prioritization where each snp in gwas also carries information of nearby variants that are not genotyped a better informed method should be able to measure the functional potential for the surrounding region of each genotyped marker recently lu et_al developed genocanyon a statistical_framework to predict functional non coding_regions in the human_genome through integrated analysis of multiple biochemical signals and genomic conservation measures its unsupervisedlearning framework makes genocanyon suffer less from our limited knowledge of non coding genome moreover since the resolution of its functional prediction is at the nucleotide level it is possible to use genocanyon scores to evaluate the surrounding region of each genotyped snp in this paper we propose genome_wide association prioritizer genowap a gwas signal prioritization approach that integrates genocanyon functional prediction and gwas p values we apply the method on two smaller gwass of crohns_disease and schizophrenia respectively to prioritize snps the performance is evaluated using the results from large gwas meta_analyses of these two diseases compared to the top loci ranked on p values only top_ranked loci after prioritization tend to show substantially stronger signals in large gwas_studies within each locus genowap may be able to distinguish true signals among highly_correlated snps the method has the potential to reduce noises caused by ld and rescue marginal signals in gwass with insufficient sample_sizes in this study we developed and applied genowap to two sets of gwas data to illustrate its performance in gwas signal prioritization compared to p values genowap posterior scores can better prioritize snps in many different ways at the locus level posterior score is more efficient in the sense that fewer snps are needed to identify the same number of top loci moreover noises due to chance are effectively reduced and the highly ranked loci using posterior scores may be more likely to contain functional_elements than the top loci selected purely based on p values at the snp level markers with high posterior scores have both better replication rates local performance in studies of schizophrenia from top to bottom the three panels show the p values from the pgc study the posterior scores and the p values from the pgc study respectively a local performance at the risk locus on chromosome q the top signals at this locus in the pgc study reside upstream of gene fxr while the posterior scores pull_down those signals and suggest the importance of snps in fxr this agrees with the signal pattern in the pgc study b local performance at the risk locus on chromosome q posterior scores diminish most of the correlated snps at this locus leaving three separate signal peaks the peak near m is suggested to be the strongest signal source which cannot be seen using p values from the pgc study the signal peaks suggested by posterior scores perfectly match the strongest signals in the pgc study figures are generated using locuszoom genowapand consistently stronger enrichment of eqtls than the top snps based on p values more importantly within each risk locus identified in gwas posterior scores can effectively suggest potential functional sites among a large number of correlated snps the performance of genowap depends on the accuracy of functional_annotation due to our limited understanding of non coding genome it is challenging to provide accurate genomic functional_annotation genocanyon is a convenient tool that provides functional prediction at the nucleotide level yet its predictive_ability can still be improved large consortia such as encode and roadmap project are continuously generating diverse types of epigenetic annotation data from a variety of cell_types the performance of genowap may be further enhanced when these data become available in the future in our implemented software we allow users to use their own annotation file genowap also depends on the quality of gwas data if no information is contained in the gwas dataset then genowap can only provide limited insight finally we emphasize that genowaps ability to identify precise functional factors is limited genowap is a region based tool and is powerful in identifying regions that are more likely to have a functional impact within ld blocks however definitive proof for functionality of any given snp still requires thorough allele specific experimentation more than gwass have been published in the past_decade and the number continues to grow it is well known that our ability to identify new risk_loci for complex_diseases has surpassed our ability to interpret the results however although we are overwhelmed by the large amount of information detected in gwass evidence such as missing_heritability still suggests that many risk_loci remain to be discovered therefore there is pressing need for gwas signal prioritization_tools and our method has great_potential for future_application since genowap uses only p values as the input it is convenient to apply our method on published results which may help reveal potential functional sites within large haplotype_blocks and ultimately help understand disease_etiology moreover for multi_stage gwass genowap can be used to better prioritize snps from the discovery stage to the validation planning and increase the replication rates finally next_generation is widely_recognized as the future of genomic epidemiology however the high_cost of sequencing usually leads to insufficient sample_sizes and many other challenging issues the combination of genowap and the rich collection of publicly_available gwas data has the potential to provide functional candidates and guide sequencing analysis in the future
