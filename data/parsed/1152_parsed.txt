context specific metabolic network_reconstruction of a naphthalene degrading bacterial_community guided by metaproteomic data motivation with the advent of meta omics_data the use of metabolic_networks for the functional analysis of microbial_communities became possible however while network based_methods are widely developed for single organisms their application to bacterial_communities is currently limited results herein we provide a novel context specific reconstruction procedure based on metapro teomic and taxonomic data without previous_knowledge of a high_quality genome_scale for each different member in a bacterial_community we propose a meta network approach where the expression levels and taxonomic_assignments of proteins are used as the most relevant clues for inferring an active set of reactions our approach was applied to draft the context specific metabolic_networks of two different naphthalene enriched communities derived from an anthropogenically influenced polyaromatic hydrocarbon contaminated_soil with cn or without cn bio stimulation we were able to capture the overall functional differences between the two conditions at the metabolic level and predict an important activity for the fluorobenzoate degradation_pathway in cn and for geraniol metabolism in cn experimental_validation was conducted and good agreement with our computational predictions was observed we also hypothesize different pathway organizations at the organismal level which is relevant to disentangle the role of each member in the communities the approach presented here can be easily transferred to the analysis of genomic transcriptomic and metabolomic_data microbes are shaping the world and by forming communities are causal of geochemical cycles human_health and biotechnological_processes thus it is not surprising to find increasing interest in studying how these consortia lead to function the analysis of microbial_communities begins by assessing the structure of the population which is currently often achieved using metagenomic_data the next step consists of characterizing the metabolic_capacity of the microbial_community but this has proven to be a considerable challenge even when using metatranscriptomic data this need has led to the development of metaproteomics by which at least the abundance of metabolically active_molecules can be detected in parallel methods for analysing these data have arisen and evolved from the outset computational_methods have been essential for capitalizing on data to obtain clear and novel insights traditional approaches described in the literature typically map data for genes proteins or metabolites onto well known pathways or gene_ontology go terms this enables identifying molecular_functions of identified proteins in light of metabolic_pathways however the high connectivity among biological_pathways has shifted the focus to networks which allows us to capture more global properties molecular_networks integrate different pathways and constitute a more general framework for interpreting omics_data on the single species level different computational_methods have been developed to analyse omics_data using genome_scale in particular a number of approaches have been specifically_designed to incorporate gene_and data as well as metabolite and flux levels to characterize context specific metabolic phenotypes based on these methods novel insights into the metabolic organization of organisms have been obtained and more practical questions have arisen such as how to improve the efficiency of industrial biosynthetic processes these approaches start from genome_scale which are reconstructed from the annotated genome of an organism and a reference metabolic database as input information thiele anddescribed the steps for accurately building a metabolic_network which can be time consuming easily taking from months to years with the aim of easing this process the model seed provides an integrative and automatic approach that substantially speeds up the time required to obtain a first network draft for microbial_communities the reconstruction of metabolic_networks is more complicated and faces new challenges ideally each organism can be represented by its own metabolic_network and its input_output metabolites define its possible interaction with other members of the consortia should this information be available recently_developed constraint based modelling approaches could be applied in this situation methods mentioned above to incorporate omics_data for single organisms could be extended to deal with bacterial_communities however in complex bacterial_communities the number of organisms could be extremely_high most typically lacking a high_quality genome_scale which makes the identification of shared components between organisms even more complicated for this reason current approaches have been applied to well known microbial consortia including only a limited number of organisms typically or dos to overcome this issue the use of a supraorganism or metanetwork has been proposed which ignores boundaries for each organism but models community level metabolism in an early work using a graph theoretical_approach metagenomic_data were used to reconstruct the human_gut metanetwork in different conditions finding key variations in patients with obesity and inflammatory_bowel in this study we exploit this metanetwork strategy and present a novel computational procedure for obtaining a context specific metabolic_network for a bacterial_community using metaproteomic data in contrast with the work presented in we did not use a graph theoretical_approach but a constraint based one which takes_into stoichiometric relationships in particular our approach takes some ingredients from the mathematical optimization model presented in the model seed however our approach is fundamentally different it is designed for bacterial_communities not for a single_organism and focuses on the usage of metaproteomic data which directly leads to a contextualized network that gives cohesion to identified proteins we also use the taxonomic_assignment of the identified proteins to favour the inclusion of enzymes annotated in the genomes of those organisms in cases where such information is available our approach is applied to draft the metabolic_networks of two different naphthalene enriched communities derived from an anthropogenically influenced polyaromatic hydrocarbon pah contaminated_soil with cn or without cn bio stimulation with calcium ammonia nitrate nh no and kh po and the commercial surfactant iveysol v r naphthalene a model pah compound is a common persistent pollutant in crude_oil and industrial chemical manufactures that can be released into the environment i e soils through anthropogenic_activities current treatments for naphthalene and other pah contaminated_sites involve the use of bio surfactants and additional electron_acceptors as well as nitrogen sources nitrate and ammonia to improve the bioavailability and bioremediation of these compounds it has also been observed that many bacteria are capable of degrading and growing on naphthalene and their activities might only be limited by environmental_conditions thus gaining insight into the mechanisms_underlying naphthalene degradation can aid in the design of better remediation strategies in this study we present a novel computational procedure for obtaining a context specific functional metabolic_network for a bacterial_community using metaproteomic data our approach was based on the mathematical optimization model presented in the model seed however we adapt this model to incorporate metaproteomic data and obtain a context specific metanetwork in which the identified proteins from the multiple_organisms making up the community are coexpressed to this end we also include important technical differences in particular we use a step iterative procedure based on linear_programming and mixed_integer our approach is an alternative to previously_reported methods dos where the role of each organism is explicitly represented in a different metabolic compartment and therefore their relationships can be directly analysed these methods require the genome_scale of each organism in the community as input_data which in consortia involving a high number of species as we have here is typically not available therefore we turn to a metanetwork approach which involves several assumptions first we need a consensus biomass equation that represents the metabolic requirements of the community to support growth with metametabolomics approaches being developed it is expected that consensus biomass equations will be refined in the near future second a free exchange of metabolites between species is allowed as boundaries between individual_organisms are not defined however a metanetwork could serve as a basis to disentangle the role of each organism in the community as suggested in section more sophisticated approaches need to be developed for this task for example analysing the role of a single_organism in the context of the entire metanetwork our approach was applied to draft the context specific metabolic_networks of two different naphthalene enriched communities analysis of the resilience to single reaction elimination and the ability to grow on different sources suggests that cn metabolism is more varied than cn then we used kegg maps to obtain a global picture of the reconstructed draft networks we were able to capture the overall functional differences between growth_curve of cn and cn enrichment cultures in bushnell hass minimal_medium in the presence of w v fluorobenzoate and geraniol respectively at c and rpm as shown within the examined time frame no appreciable growth was observed in cultures of the cn and cn consortia in the presence of geraniol and fluorobenzoate respectively heatmap showing the contributions of the most relevant bacterial members of cn and cn to the kegg maps relative_contributions of each of the distinct species found to constitute the cn and cn communities are differentiated by a colour code a high_resolution image can be found in supplementary_material v cn and cn at the metabolic level we showed that cn and cn utilize different metabolic_pathways to synthesize essential metabolites for growth in particular we hypothesized an important role for the fluorobenzoate degradation_pathway in cn and for geraniol metabolism in cn experimental_validation was conducted and good agreement with our computational predictions was observed on the other hand we showed that these metabolic differences lead to a different pathway organization at the organismal level for example while naphthalene degradation map seems to be supported by achromobacter in both cn and cn mesorhizobium septentrionale and pseudoxanthomonas japonensis may be involved in an alternative_pathway in cn in addition while metagenomic_sequences outlined the broad metabolic_capabilities of the abundant populations present in an adapted community proteomics guided metabolic reconstructions allowed us to focus on the pathways that were actually expressed and refine the assignment of roles for community_members not only in naphthalene degradation but also in the assimilation of the low_molecular produced from it these results show that network based_methods represent a promising strategy for exploiting the value of data and the available bioinformatics_tools allowing us to obtain a better understanding of biological_systems as the available meta omics_data from scientific_studies at different levels are increasing reconstruction procedures will play_an in disentangling contexts specific metabolic phenotypes the approach presented here can be extended to meta genomic and meta transcriptomic_data and will clearly benefit from the availability of meta metabolomic_data mainly to address the failure to detect all different enzymes ecs that catalyze different reactions amending our approach to include these data is straightforward
