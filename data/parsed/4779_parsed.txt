uncover disease genes by maximizing information_flow in the phenome interactome network motivation pinpointing genes that underlie human inherited_diseases among candidate_genes in susceptibility genetic regions is the primary step towards the understanding of pathogenesis of diseases although several probabilistic_models have been proposed to prioritize_candidate using phenotype similarities and proteinprotein_interactions no combinatorial approaches have been proposed in the literature results we propose the first combinatorial_approach for prioritizing candidate_genes we first construct a phenomeinteractome network by integrating the given phenotype similarity profile proteinprotein_interaction and associations between diseases and genes then we introduce a computational_method called maxif to maximize the information_flow in this network for uncovering genes that underlie diseases we demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in prioritizing candidate_genes through a series of cross_validation experiments and we show the possibility of using this method to identify diseases with which a query gene may be associated we demonstrate the competitive_performance of our method through a comparison with two existing state of the art methods and we analyze the robustness of our method with respect to the parameters involved as an example application we apply our method to predict driver_genes in copy_number aberration regions of melanoma our method is not only able to identify several driver_genes that have been reported in the literature it also shed some new biological_insights on the understanding of the modular property and transcriptional_regulation scheme of these driver_genes although the past_few have evidenced many successful stories of identifying genetic_variants that underlie human inherited_diseases through statistical_methods such as linkage_analysis and association studies uncovering genes that are truly associated with these diseases from susceptibility genetic regions obtained by these statistical_analyses still remain as a great challenge and appeal for the development of effective computational_methods to tackle this problem several approaches have been proposed from the viewpoint of one class novelty learning for example the guilt by direct association principle suggests ranking candidate to whom correspondence should be addressed genes in a susceptibility region according to their relevance to genes that are already known as associated with the disease under investigation based on this principle a wide_variety of information including protein_sequences gene_expression functional_annotations literature descriptions proteinprotein_interactions ppi and many others has been used to facilitate the prioritization of candidate_genes recently a number of studies have also suggested the guilt byindirect association principle which resorts to the modular nature of human genetic_diseases and utilizes ppi_information and similarities between disease_phenotypes with a variety of computational_models to infer genes that are truly associated with diseases for example proposed a bayesian_model to integrate ppi and phenotype similarities developed a regression_model to explain phenotype similarities using gene proximities also proposed to align the phenotype network against the ppi_network li and patra utilized a random_walk model called an rwrh to simulate the stationary distribution of the strength of associations for genes proposed a network propagation method called prince to mimic the sharing of disease status among genes these recent methods not only exhibit the stateof the art performance but also open the possibility of identifying genes that are responsible for diseases whose genetic_bases are completely unknown the success of the above methods relies largely on the use of ppi_networks for estimating functional_similarities between genes the functional_similarities between a pair of genes are typically measured by using the shortest_path between genes in a ppi_network since the shortest_path measure considers only a single optimal path between a pair of genes and overlooks all other paths the reliability of the optimal path and the robustness of the resulting method may therefore be adversely_affected moreover most of the above methods are based on probabilistic_models which are typically very computation
