databases_and footprintdb a database of transcription_factors with annotated cis_elements and binding interfaces motivation traditional and high_throughput techniques for determining transcription_factor tf binding_specificities are generating large volumes of data of uneven quality which are scattered across individual databases results footprintdb integrates some of the most comprehensive freely_available libraries of curated dna_binding and systematically annotates the binding interfaces of the corresponding tfs the first release contains unique tf sequences dna_binding and dna motifs a survey of the included data_sources organisms and tf families was performed together with proprietary database transfac finding that footprintdb has a similar coverage of multicellular_organisms while also containing bacterial regulatory data a search_engine has been designed that drives the prediction of dna motifs for input tfs or conversely of tf sequences that might recognize input regulatory_sequences by comparison with database entries such predictions can also be extended to a single proteome chosen by the user and results are ranked in terms of interface similarity benchmark experiments with bacterial plant and human data were performed to measure the predictive_power of footprintdb searches which were able to correctly recover and of the tested sequences respectively correctly_predicted tfs had a higher interface similarity than the average confirming its diagnostic value availability_and web_site implemented in php perl mysql and apache freely_available from http floresta eead transcription is one of the most important processes in gene_expression and it is modulated primarily by the binding of regulatory_proteins called transcription_factors tfs to short dna_sequences called cis_elements or dna_binding dbss the dbs recognition mechanism is generally degenerate as one tf can usually bind to a collection of similar but different cis_elements which can be grouped together to define a dna_motif motifs are most frequently represented as position_specific pssm that capture the occurrence of nucleotides in aligned positions of the underlying dbss furthermore motifs are frequently plotted as sequence_logos which graphically summarize the binding_specificities and or affinities of tfs see supplementary traditional experimental methods to identify dbss are technically_challenging and have been frequently limited to determining cis regulatory_sites for one tf at a time these methods such as dna footprinting or electrophoretic_mobility o yield high_quality data and have been the primary source of data for expert curated databases such as regulondb however these approaches do not scale well and are currently being replaced by protocols that allow high_throughput discovery of dbss such as protein binding microarrays chip_chip or chip_seq these procedures produce large volumes of raw_sequence which must be preprocessed and filtered to derive dna motifs databases such as jaspar and transfac are increasingly annotating dbss produced by such protocols fueled by articles that report experimentally_derived dbss and motifs for large repertoires of tfs on other side there are experimental_approaches for characterizing the interface residues of tfs those in charge of recognizing the nucleotide_bases of target cis_elements beyond site_directed o the most accurate methods are x_ray and nuclear_magnetic studies of proteindna complexes the resulting structures are maintained and published at the protein_data pdb by further digesting these structural_models the d fooprint database routinely annotates the interfaces of all dna_binding contained therein following simple geometrical criteria interface residues must form hydrogen_bonds or hydrophobic contacts with nitrogen bases or else locate heavy_atoms within a of any nitrogen base here we present footprintdb a meta database which integrates the most comprehensive freely_available libraries of curated dbss and systematically annotates for the first time to whom correspondence should be addressed the binding interfaces of the corresponding tfs furthermore we survey the redundancy of all included databases and compare them with transfac a subscription based commercial alternative besides allowing users to compare dna_sequences motifs with records in the database as most included repositories do footprintdb can also interrogate complete proteomes to identify which tfs are likely to recognize input cis_elements annotated interfaces are particularly valuable for the second type of query as our benchmarks indicate that tfs with similar interface residues are more likely to bind to similar dbss the three unique features of footprintdb are as follows i the possibility to search against multiple curated databases at the same time or to add custom databases ii the annotation of interface residues within dna_binding protein_domains and iii the support for browsing tfs within user provided proteomes which are most likely to bind a dbs of interest this resource is available at http
