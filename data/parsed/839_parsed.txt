cafe a tool for binding_affinity prediction using end_point free_energy methods accurate prediction of binding_free is of particular importance to computational_biology and structure_based among those methods for binding_affinity predictions the end_point approaches such as mm pbsa and lie have been widely used because they can achieve a good balance between prediction_accuracy and computational_cost here we present an easy to use pipeline tool named calculation of free_energy cafe to conduct mm pbsa and lie calculations powered by the vmd and namd programs cafe is able to handle numerous static coordinate and molecular_dynamics trajectory file_formats generated by different molecular_simulation packages and supports various force_field availability_and cafe source_code are freely_available under the gnu_general via github at https github com huiliucode cafe plugin it is a vmd plugin written in tcl and the usage is platform independent accurate estimation of binding_affinity alternatively binding_free is among the most attractive and challenging topics in both computational_biology and computer_aided drug_design cadd on one hand noncovalent association is ubiquitous and essential in the cell machinery it is involved in the processes of enzymatic_catalysis signal_transduction molecular_recognition and receptor_activation knowledge of the thermodynamic basis of association at the molecular level provides insights into the underlying_mechanisms of various biological_phenomena on the other hand from a pharmaceutical point_of the major_goal of drug_design and discovery is to identify new chemical_entities with high_affinity to a certain pharmaceutical target obviously these research_fields would benefit from reliable_methods for estimating binding_affinity a number of computational_methods have been proposed to predict binding_free there are some theoretically rigorous ones based on statistical_mechanics however these methods are timeconsuming and thus their applications in real_life cadd are limited another kind of approaches frequently used is so_called scoring_functions they are often embedded in molecular_docking programs for which simplicity and speed are generally required however it usually comes with the loss of accuracy the third type of free_energy prediction_methods is referred to as end_point methods which sample conformations only with the free and bound_states and get binding_free by taking a difference between these states these methods can reach a good balance between accuracy and efficiency the results are shown_inand e both methods show high correlation_coefficients with experimental values in the showcased example which is in line with our previous evaluations using different force_field to facilitate the prediction of binding_affinity of proteinprotein ligand we present an automated tool cafe which provides a userfriendly choice for researchers who want to perform a post md energetic analysis using the end_point methods
