data_and early immunologic correlates of hiv protection can be identified from computational_analysis of complex multivariate t cell flow_cytometry assays motivation polychromatic flow_cytometry pfc has enormous power as a tool to dissect complex immune_responses such as those observed in hiv_disease at a single_cell level however analysis tools are severely lacking although high_throughput systems allow rapid data_collection from large cohorts manual data analysis can take months moreover identification of cell_populations can be subjective and analysts rarely examine the entirety of the multidimensional dataset focusing instead on a limited number of subsets the biology of which has usually already been well described thus the value of pfc as a discovery tool is largely wasted results to address this problem we developed a computational_approach that automatically reveals all possible cell_subsets from tens_of of subsets those that correlate strongly with clinical_outcome are selected and grouped within each group markers that have minimal relevance to the biological outcome are removed thereby distilling the complex dataset into the simplest most clinically_relevant subsets this allows complex information from pfc studies to be translated into clinical or resource poor settings where multiparametric analysis is less feasible we demonstrate the utility of this approach in a large n retrospective parameter pfc study of early hiv_infection where we identify three t cell_subsets that strongly predict progression to aids only one of which was identified by an initial manual_analysis the immune_response to infection vaccination or malignancy can be characterized by examining changes in the expression of a wide_array of proteins expressed on leukocytes either generally or on antigenspecific b or t cells these proteins identify an enormous variety of cell_types and it is often not known which subsets of cells are clinically_relevant in some settings the immunologically relevant cell subset represents a small minority of the bulk cell_population therefore gross measurements taken from heterogeneous_samples as generally done with microarrays may mask immunologically or clinically_significant signals this limitation can be overcome with polychromatic color flow_cytometry pfc where protein expression can be assessed among a large number of cell_subsets at the single_cell level the need for pfc is particularly apparent in studies of hiv were the strongest cellular correlate of clinical_outcome cd_t provides little help in identifying those individuals who would benefit from early initiation of highly_active haart recent_studies of simian_immunodeficiency siv infection of non_human provide some guidance demonstrating that the level of central memory t cells may be a relevant predictor of the need for early therapy similarly our recent study of early hiv_infection suggests the presence of long_lived t cells during early infection correlateswe described a computational_approach to analyze a highdimensional clinical flow_cytometry dataset that was previously investigated through laborious manual_inspection the findings from our analysis both replicate and extend the original analysis by human_experts revealing the t cell_subsets and markers most highly_correlated with hiv progression the pipeline consists of five steps i automated identification of positive_and populations for each marker ii quantification of subsets defined by every combination of markers iii identification of those cell_subsets whose frequency is most highly associated with clinical_outcome iv calculation of the impact of each individual marker and v
