systems_biology dosesim a tool for pharmacokinetic_pharmacodynamic analysis and dose reconstruction assessing and improving the safety of chemicals and the efficacy of drugs depends on an understanding of the biodistribution clearance and biological_effects of the chemical s of interest a promising methodology for the prediction of these phenomena is physiologically_based pharmacokinetic_pharmacodynamic modeling which centers on the prediction of chemical absorption distribution metabolism and excretion pharmacokinetics and the biological_effects pharmacodynamics of the chemical on the organism strengths of this methodology include modeling across multiple_scales of biological_organization and facilitate the extrapolation of results across routes of exposure dosing levels and species it is also useful as the foundation for tools to i predict biomarker_levels concentrations of chemical_species found in the body that indicate exposure to a foreign chemical given a chemical dose or exposure ii reconstruct a dose given the levels of relevant biomarkers and iii estimate population variability despite the importance and promise of physiologically_based phar macokinetic pharmacodynamics based_approaches to forward and reverse dosimetry there is currently a lack of user_friendly freely_available implementations that are accessible and useful to a broad range of users dosesim was developed to begin to fill this gap the rational_design of drugs and drug dosing_regimens and the risk and safety_assessment for environmental_toxicants depend on an understanding of the pharmacokinetics_and pk_pd of the chemicals of interest a methodology that is increasingly used for pk_pd analyses is physiologically_based pbpk modeling pbpk models integrate_information across multiple time and spatial_scales through the specification of biological biochemical and physiological information at the tissue organism and population levels these models can then be used to predict the absorption distribution metabolism and excretion and potential biological_effects of chemicals to the exposed individual
