integration of molecular_network data reconstructs gene_ontology motivation recently a shift was made from using gene_ontology go to evaluate molecular_network data to using these data to construct and evaluate go dutkowski et_al provide the first evidence that a large part of go can be reconstructed solely from topologies of molecular_networks motivated by this work we develop a novel data_integration framework that integrates multiple types of molecular_network data to reconstruct and update go we ask how much of go can be recovered by integrating various molecular_interaction data results we introduce a computational framework for integration of various biological_networks using penalized non negative matrix tri factorization pnmtf it takes all network data in a matrix form and performs simultaneous clustering of genes and go terms inducing new relations between genes and go terms annotations and between go terms themselves to improve the accuracy of our predicted relations we extend the integration methodology to include additional topological information represented as the similarity in wiring around non interacting genes surprisingly by integrating topol ogies of bakers yeasts proteinprotein_interaction genetic_interaction gi and co expression networks our method reports as related of go terms that are directly related in go the inclusion of the wiring similarity of non interacting genes contributes to this large go term association capture furthermore we use our method to infer new relationships between go terms solely from the topologies of these networks and validate of our predictions in the literature in addition our integration method reproduces of cellular_component of molecular_function and of biological_process go terms outperforming the previous method in the former two domains of go finally we predict new go annotations of yeast genes and validate our predictions through gis profiling in many areas of biomedical_research ontologies play_an in unification of knowledge as a hierarchy of terms and their mutual relationships among widely used ontologies is gene_ontology go which describes genes and gene_products in terms of their associated biological_process bp molecular_function mf and cellular_component cc go is a current major source of information for annotating genes and proteins across various species and providing tools for systematic_assessment of experimental gene_sets via enrichment_analysis since its foundation go has been growing in size and complexity containing today vast_amounts of annotated biological data initially go was manually_curated by domain_experts and members of the research and annotation communities however because of their inconsistency in translation to go terms and relations manual curations have encountered many difficulties additionally rapid development of technologies for biological data_acquisition has resulted in an accumulation of biological data exceeding our ability to interpret to overcome these problems many computational_tools for automatic gene and protein annotation have been devised much effort has been invested in assessing the accuracy of such annotation predictions methods for gene_annotation prediction have either followed approaches that transfer annotations from well observed to partially observed genes based solely on sequence_similarity or approaches that directly predict function of unknown genes using machine_learning recent methodologies focus more on integration of distinct biological data_sources which contribute to more accurate_predictions of gene_annotation the availability of genomic_level information from highthroughput measurements of genetic and protein interactions messenger_rna expression_profiles and metabolic_pathways has created new opportunities for function prediction a major_challenge is how to integrate all these diverse data to predict annotations of yet unannotated proteins among the widely used computational_methods addressing this problem are bayesian reasoning network based analysis kernelbased statistical_learning and matrix_factorization based data fusion all these methods have demonstrated that the integration of complementary biological data significantly_improves accuracy of gene function_annotation prediction recent work incorporated large gene and protein_interaction into a probabilistic clustering procedure to reconstruct the go it identified new terms and relations that were missing from go based solely on network_topology this work provides evidence that a large part of go can be reconstructed using only topologies of molecular_networks in this work we propose a new data_integration method for prediction of go term annotations of unannotated genes and finding new relations between existing go terms purely from network_topology the method is based on penalized nonnegative matrix tri

for prediction of disease associations identification of cancer_subtypes predicting proteinprotein_interactions ppis and detecting phenotypegene associations here we extend this method to take multiple types of molecular_network data and use them to reconstruct and update go with new information we apply our method to saccharomyces_cerevisiae data used by ppi_network genetic_interaction gi network gene co expression co ex network and integrated functional network known as yeastnet our method_takes all data in a matrix form and performs simultaneous clustering of genes and go terms inducing new associations between genes and go terms and between go terms themselves we extend the integration methodology to include similarity in wiring around non interacting genes we measure this by distance graphlet_degree vectors gdvs graphlets and graphlet based measures have bridged molecular network_topology and biological_function for instance simple homogeneous clustering of proteins in a ppi_network based on the gdv similarity has revealed groups of proteins with a common biological_function therefore we add these to incorporate more topology into the integration_process and improve accuracy of predictions using various measures for assessing the quality of our prediction we systematically examined the contribution of these additional topological_constraints to go prediction graphlet based similarity has not been exploited in any of the previous network integration approaches surprisingly we find that our method can successfully reconstruct almost the entire go by using solely topology of molecular_interaction furthermore we predict new go term associations and gene_annotations from integrated topologies of molecular_interaction and validate our predictions
