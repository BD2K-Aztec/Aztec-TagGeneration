composition bias and the origin of orfan_genes motivation intriguingly sequence_analysis of genomes reveals that a large_number are unique to each organism the origin of these genes termed orfans is not known here we explore the origin of orfan_genes by defining a simple measure called composition bias based on the deviation of the amino_acid of a given sequence from the average composition of all proteins of a given genome results for a set of prokaryotic_genomes we show that the amino_acid bias of real proteins random proteins created by using the nucleotide frequencies of each genome and proteins translated from intergenic_regions are distinct for orfans we observed a correlation between their composition bias and their relative evolutionary age recent orfan proteins have compositions more similar to those of random proteins while the compositions of more ancient orfan proteins are more similar to those of the set of all proteins of the organism this observation is consistent with an evolutionary scenario wherein orfan_genes emerged and underwent a large number of random_mutations and selection eventually adapting to the composition preference of their organism over time one of the consistent and intriguing observations that emerged from the extensive availability of whole genome_sequences is the large_number that seem to encode unique proteins that do not exist in other organisms or exist only in very closely_related organisms this appears to be the case even when using sophisticated sequence comparison methods like psi_blast these genes are commonly called orfan_genes and the resulting proteins are called orfan proteins it was estimated that of the open_reading in a given genome are orfans these observations were made early in the history of genome_analysis when only the first organisms had to whom correspondence should be addressed been sequenced at that time the common explanation was that these unique genes were not unique at all but that not enough organisms had been sequenced to follow the evolution of these genes however while the fraction of orfan_genes has somewhat decreased as more genomes became available it also became clear that the phenomenon is not a mere artifact of a small_sample rather even with the availability of the complete_sequence of close to a thousand genomes there remain a large_number whose evolutionary_history is not accounted for several possible explanations were given over the years for this phenomenon for a review see one explanation is that those sequences are not real genes rather they may represent open_reading that are never expressed however several studies have shown that these genes are expressed and some of the resulting proteins have even been subjected to d structure analysis another possible explanation is that these genes came from lateral_gene lgt in order for this explanation to be logically relevant the transfer should have come from genomes whose sampling is sparse and thus can serve as a reservoir for the unique genes viral and phage_genomes have been suggested as such a reservoir although other recent_studies have indicated that lgt cannot be the source for most of these genes another possibility that has been suggested is that orfan_genes originated from ancestral genes but because of fast evolutionary_rate these genes have mutated their sequence to such an extent that their ancestors are no longer recognizable yet another possibility is that some orfan_genes emerged de_novo from non coding_regions of each genome without being inherited in the regular evolutionary path for example by shifting the reading_frame a phenomenon called overprinting see e g or by mutations that change non coding_regions to open_reading it is well known that protein_sequences have different amino_acids compositions i e not all of the amino_acids appear in proteins with the same frequency of the composition is different for different organisms and has both evolutionary and functional origin and consequences furthermore within genomes different sequences have different compositions and we term the deviation of each sequence from the average composition of the organism as composition bias the composition of sequences has been used as one of the main considerations in predicting the sub cellular_localization of proteins furthermore it was observed thatthe list of the genomes and the number of proteins and orfan proteins in each genome is given in supplementary table s we started by calculating the composition bias of the proteins translated from the coding_genes from random genes based on the nucleotide frequency of the entire_genome from the antisense strands of the coding_genes and from the intergenic_regions of the genome the histograms section of the composition biases are shown infor six organisms as the number of sequences in the intergenic sets is of those of the other sets section their histograms were normalized by multiplying each value by the real proteins have smaller composition bias as is evident from the fact that their histogram is the leftmost than the composition bias of the random proteins this is expected since the compositions are compared with the average compositions of the real proteins surprisingly the composition bias of the antisense proteins is greater than that of the random proteins we also note that for all organisms the composition bias histogram of proteins translated from intergenic_regions are further shifted to the right we next compared the composition bias of orfan proteins to that of the other datasets shows the composition bias histograms of real proteins random proteins and orfan proteins scaled up to the size of the other groups for several genomes we noticed that orfan proteins from different species behave differently in their similarity to either the coding or the random groups the orfans of e coli and r conorii look like random proteins the orfans histograms showing the composition bias for six organisms of several sets of proteins all histograms were computed by using the average composition vector of the real proteins as the reference and the composition bias of each protein relative to that reference was calculated as expected the real proteins have the smallest bias surprisingly the composition bias of intergenic proteins is significantly_larger than that of random or antisense proteins for the random genes very similar_results when using either the genomes coding or non coding frequencies of treponema_pallidum and aeropyrum pernix resemble real proteins while the orfan proteins of corynebacterium_glutamicum and clostridium_acetobutylicum have intermediate assignments from the results of the calculations for all organisms we noticed that indeed there is a range in the similarity of the composition bias between the orfan proteins and the real and random proteins in an effort to understand this range we looked at the relative age of the orfans as determined by the phylogenetic_tree section as a possible explanation first we checked the correlation between the number of orfans in each genome and their relative age and found a weak correlation a more significant correlation was found between the relative age of the orfans and the percentage of orfan_genes from the total number of coding_genes in the organism see scatter plots in supplementary next we found a surprising strong correlation_coefficient of between the relative age of the orfans and the distance between the average composition bias of the orfan and the random proteins similarly the correlation_coefficient between the relative age and the distance between the average composition bias of the orfan and the real proteins is see scatter plots in supplementary figures s a and b to make sure that these high correlations are not dependent on the particular way of comparing the composition bias we also calculated the correlation between the relative age and the ratio of the overlaps section and got similar results correlation_coefficient of see supplementary the main finding of this study is the correlation between the relative age of the orfans and the degree of similarity of their composition to that of the real proteins of the organism we found a significant correlation correlation_coefficients between and between the relative age of the orfans and their composition bias as determined by various measures of the composition distance between the set of the orfan proteins and the set of real proteins thus the older the orfans i e the more ancient the organism the more the amino_acid of its orfans resembles that of the rest of the proteins young organisms i e organisms that split from their ancestor organisms more recently tend to have orfan_genes with composition that is more different from that of the rest of the proteins and more similar to that of the random genes we tested to see if there are other factors that correlate with the relative age of the orfan proteins and with the composition bias as expected we found that the fraction of orfan_genes among all coding_genes in each organism is correlated with the evolutionary age of the organism correlation_coefficient of older organisms that have almost by definition fewer close_relatives tend to have more orfan_genes no other factors that we tested including the gc_content of the organism the size of the genome and the ratio of coding to intergenic_regions showed a strong correlation with the orfan behavior thus our data are consistent with a model wherein orfan_genes emerged with a composition that was similar to the random composition of the genome then during evolution and due to the selective_pressures that shape the composition bias of each organism the composition of orfan_genes gradually converged to be more similar to the composition of the rest of the proteins of the genome we may examine the three possible explanations for the origin of orfan_genes in light of this observation the first explanation is that orfan_genes originated from bacteriophages see a review in we think that this is unlikely first note that bacterial genes that have known homologues in bacteriophage are not considered orfans by our definition second for six bacteria for which sufficient bacteriophages have been sequenced we compared the composition of the orfan_genes with the composition of bacteriophage proteins and found that the composition of the orfan_genes of the bacteria is not similar to the composition of the bacteriophage proteins see supplementary the second possible explanation is that orfan_genes emerged de_novo from non coding_regions of the genome see a review in this is also not consistent with our observation that protein created from intergenic sequences are distinct further to the right in from the random proteins while the orfan proteins fall between the random and the real proteins if orfan proteins emerged from intergenic_regions then we would expect the orfan_genes to behave more closely to intergenic non coding_regions of the genome and not like random_sequences the third explanation is that orfan_genes result from a very fast evolutionary clock rate of mutations operating on genes that are under positive_selection this explanation is the most consistent with our observations random_mutations are likely to create nucleotide_sequences that have a c g t frequencies that are similar to random_sequences thus creating novel proteins whose amino_acid have composition bias similar to the random proteins that we have created over time the sequences underwent further mutations and selection that changed their composition and brought their composition bias to be more similar to that of the rest of the proteins
