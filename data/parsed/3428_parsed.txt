pareto_optimal phylogenetic tree_reconciliation motivation phylogenetic tree_reconciliation is a widely used method for reconstructing the evolutionary_histories of gene_families and species hosts and parasites and other dependent pairs of entities reconciliation is typically performed using maximum_parsimony in which each evolutionary event type is assigned a cost and the objective is to find a reconciliation of minimum total_cost it is generally understood that reconciliations are sensitive to event costs but little is understood about the relationship between event costs and solutions moreover choosing appropriate event costs is a notoriously_difficult problem results we address this problem by giving an efficient algorithm for computing pareto_optimal sets of reconciliations thus providing the first systematic method for understanding the relationship between event costs and reconciliations this in turn results in new techniques for computing event support values and for cophylogenetic analyses performing robust statistical_tests we provide new software_tools and demonstrate their use on a number of datasets from evolutionary gen_omic and cophylogenetic studies phylogenetic tree_reconciliation is a fundamental technique for studying the evolution of pairs of entities such as gene_families and species parasites and hosts and species and geographical_regions recent algorithmic advances in tree_reconciliation have led to seminal biological discoveries among these are the finding that of extant gene_families arose during the archaean period between and billion_years a study showing that interactions of species and their ecological_niches are strongly conserved across the entire tree of life g and new insights into the relationship between pathogenic rna_viruses and their hosts the reconciliation problem takes as input two trees and the associations between their leaves and seeks a mapping of one tree onto the other such that incongruence between the two trees is accounted for by a set of evolutionary_events in the context of gene_family evolution the two trees are the gene_tree and the species_tree and in the well studied duplication transfer loss model dtl the events are speciation duplication transfer and loss unlike the simpler duplication loss dl reconciliation model dtl accounts for transfer events and is thus broadly_applicable across the tree of life in the context of parasites and their hosts the corresponding events are co speciation independent speciation host switch and loss respectively in the context of species and area cladograms these four events correspond to vicariance sympatric speciation dispersal and loss respectively henceforth we refer to this set of events as the dtl model and use the dtl event names dtl reconciliation is generally performed in a maximum_parsimony framework in which each event type has an associated user_defined cost and the objective is to find a reconciliation of minimum total_cost probabilistic approaches for dtl reconciliation which do not require event cost assignments also exist but these require estimates of other parameters such as species divergence times and are prohibitively slow for trees with more than a few leaves if the species_trees are fully dated then maximum_parsimony reconciliations can be found in polynomial time however accurately dating the internal nodes of a phylogenetic_tree is generally difficult in the absence of dates reconciliations may be time inconsistent in the sense that they can induce contradictory constraints on the relative order of the internal nodes the problem of finding optimal time consistent dtl reconciliations in undated trees is known to be np_hard therefore a common approach and the one followed in this article is to relax the time consistency requirement which permits an optimal although not necessarily time consistent solution to be found in o mn time where m and n denote the number of nodes in the gene parasite and species host trees respectively experimental_evidence suggests that the solutions found using this approach are generally timeconsistent but see also maximum_parsimony reconciliations depend on the event costs in the dtl model speciations are considered null events and are therefore typically assigned a cost of while duplications transfers and losses are assigned positive costs shows a species host tree in black and a gene parasite tree in gray along with associations between their leaves if duplication transfer and loss each cost then the reconciliation inis optimal comprises one speciation and one transfer and has total_cost however if duplication and loss cost and transfer costs then the maximum_parsimony reconciliation inis optimal comprises one speciation one duplication and three losses and has total_cost even small differences in event costs to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms

please_contact permissions_oup com can induce different solutions when the trees are larger for example we have found that in many datasets the default costs used in treemap and jane give rise to different reconciliations than those using the default costs in angst and rangerdtl despite great advances in the efficiency and accuracy of dtlreconciliation little is understood about the relationship between event costs and the resulting maximum_parsimony reconciliations a systematic way to handle the difficulty in determining appropriate event costs is to optimize for event counts rather than total numerical cost we define an event count vector for a reconciliation to be a triple h i denoting the number of duplications transfers and losses respectively these vectors do not explicitly count the number of speciation_events because the number of speciations is implicit it is m an event count vector v h i is strictly better than an event count vector v h i if each entry of v is less than or equal to the corresponding entry in v and at least one entry of v is less than its corresponding entry in v a reconciliation is pareto_optimal if there is no reconciliation with a strictly better event count vector we use the term pareto_optimal for both reconciliations and their corresponding event count vectors given the set of all pareto_optimal event count vectors we can partition the space of possible event cost assignments into equivalence_classes or regions such that any two event cost assignments within the same region lead to the same optimal reconciliations these regions provide insights into the relationships between event costs and maximum_parsimony reconciliations and have numerous applications including new definitions and algorithms for computing event consensus support in this section we demonstrate the utility of our algorithms and tools on a diverse collection of datasets currently reconciliation analyses infer evolutionary_events by choosing a set of event costs often the default costs in the software although most tools recommend experimenting with different costs and constructing reconciliations based on these costs because event costs are not easily estimated and the choice of costs affects the reconciliations we seek here to understand the impact of event costs on the resulting reconciliations we first analyzed a biological dataset consisting of predominantly prokaryotic species sampled broadly from across the tree of life this consisted of gene_trees with at least two extant genes over species but for efficiency we restricted our analyses to a subset of gene_families from randomly_sampled species and evaluated event counts and their corresponding event cost regions for transfer and loss costs ranging from to with respect to the unit cost of duplication the results presented here exclude gene_families for which eventscape used more than the allocated gb of ram in our experimental_setup using the costscape tool we observed that of the gene_families induce at least two regions have at least five regions and that the number of regions grows as a function of tree_size thus the common practice of selecting a single cost setting or a small fixed number of cost settings e g considered three settings andcan result in missing potentially important parts of the solution_space additionally many regions have zero area e g lines or points meaning that the associated reconciliations are unlikely to be discovered by an ad_hoc choice of event costs for this dataset of the gene_families have at least one region with zero area and for of the gene_families more than half of the regions have zero area we also found that a systematic choice of event costs e g using costscape can cover a substantial portion of the solution_space for example for all gene_families studied here an appropriately selected subset of five or fewer regions covers the majority of the event_cost and coverage of the event_cost appears to follow a power_law distribution supplementary although these results seem to suggest that a small set of event costs and their associated regions is representative of the entire event_cost we note that coverage of event_cost is a biased measure as some large regions may include cost ratios that are biologically unrealistic while other regions containing biologically_plausible ratios might cover a small fraction of the event_cost regions of zero area for example are generally abundant and may contain a biologically_relevant solution while these results provide some preliminary understanding of the relationship of event costs and the space of maximum_parsimony reconciliations further research is needed to understand the properties of this space and ultimately to determine appropriate event costs next we focus on the identification of well supported events across the event_cost given a user specified event_cost that is a range of costs on transfer and loss with respect to the unit cost of duplication we used the eventscape tool to infer the pareto_optimal regions and the sets of events that are common to k regions where k is the total number of regions in the event_cost we define an event to have consensus support s s with respect to the event_cost if the event is found in every reconciliation in at least a fraction s inclusive of the regions note that this is one of many possible measures of event support and our algorithms can be used to define and compute other measures fig pareto regions for the a gopher louse and b indigobird finch datasets colors are arbitrary and are used to match regions with the event counts in the legend the displayed event counts comprise the number of speciations in addition to the number of duplications transfers and losses in addition the count field indicates the number of distinct reconciliations in each region while most regions are polygons regions may also be points or lines such as in the first region in the legend in a c results of a permutation_test on the gopher louse dataset using random trials for c only green indicates significance at the level yellow represents significance between and and red indicates lack of significance at the level brightness of green yellow and red indicates differences in p values with brighter shades indicating smaller p values using this definition we investigated the fraction of events supported at various support thresholds almost universally speciations are the best supported type of event with of speciations supported under strict consensus that is found in all regions manual_inspection revealed that speciations found near the root of the tree were often conserved across multiple regions however when analyzing gene_family evolution we are typically interested in the inferred duplications transfers and losses collectively the dtl events and we found that few of these have high support for example only of duplications of transfers and of losses have at least support though the percentage of events with at least support is substantially_higher with of duplications of transfers and of losses supported at that level interestingly we observed a jump in the number of supported events around a support threshold of also in general for most support thresholds duplications are the most supported type of event after speciation followed by transfers then losses however for low support thresholds the three types of dtl events show roughly_equal support these results have important implications for existing analyses that rely on dtl reconciliation and suggest that many inferred events are highly_specific to the user_defined event costs in this study we have investigated a specific range of event costs transfer and loss ranging from to relative to the unit cost of duplication the number of regions and thus the level of consensus support depends on this range moreover our analyses permitted cost combinations in which duplications are more expensive or less expensive than transfers and losses adding constraints on these cost relationships could alter the levels of support we also note that manual_inspection revealed that loss events and to a lesser extent transfers are often fungible in the sense that they can be moved from one location to another without changing the total_cost of the solution and thus any individual loss or transfer event is not likely to be strongly supported by looking at the event_cost and supported events our tools allow the elucidation of the complex_interplay between event cost assignments and event support under various ranges and constraints of event costs for completeness we also determined event support as measured by fraction of the event_cost rather than fraction of the number of regions covered yielding similar results the main difference between these two measures is that event support increases gradually with increasing region coverage but tends to jump with increasing event_cost coverage this confirms our finding that the event_cost is dominated by a few large regions otherwise duplications also show a clear demarcation from no support to high support at coverage to demonstrate the applicability of our tools on cophylogenetic datasets we performed similar analyses on five hostparasite datasets and found results consistent with those above supplementary section s supplementary finally the average runtimes for our tools is on the order of seconds supplementary to demonstrate scalability we also ran costscape on the full taxa tree of life dataset also using transfer and loss costs ranging from to and found that the median runtime remains min whereas a sampling_approach would necessarily capture only a subset of the event_cost using the tools based on our algorithms we have conducted experiments on a broad array of datasets these results show that the space of maximum_parsimony solutions is complex and sensitive to the event costs and thus choosing ad_hoc event costs may result in misrepresenting evolutionary_histories at the same time we cannot discount ad_hoc procedures for finding event costs for example through comparison to event inferences on a biological dataset as in in particular such approaches may elucidate the boundaries for biologically reasonable event cost assignments which could then be used as input into our tools for more systematic analysis in addition by defining notions of consensus support based on the number of regions that share an event we found that while many speciation_events have high consensus support most other events do not thus inferring events based on non systematically selected event costs is likely to provide only a piece of a complex_picture and our tools motivate further investigation into the robustness of analyses based on dtl reconciliation there are numerous interesting directions for future work in particular this work affords opportunities to explore many variants of event consensus support for example our work uses the most specific definition of an event in computing support for a speciation duplication or transfer to be supported across different reconciliations a gene parasite tree node must map to the same species host tree node and to the same event and transfers must also yield the same transfer edge similarly for two losses to be supported across different reconciliations they must be found along the same branch of both the gene_tree and species_tree in some cases analyses only require the species mapping or event mapping and thus the support values must be considered for these relaxed definitions of events our algorithms can be modified accordingly in addition to identifying highly supported events it is desirable to find highly supported whole reconciliations in the spirit of promising recent work on this problem for fixed event costs one promising research direction is to identify and succinctly represent whole reconciliations that are robust across the space of event costs in summary this work provides techniques and tools that are immediately useful in the phylogenomic cophylogenetic and biogeography analyses and offers avenues for further research that leverages the pareto_optimal reconciliation methods developed here
