genetics_and imputation of coding variants in african_americans better performance using data from the exome_sequencing project although the genomes haplotypes are the most commonly used reference_panel for imputation medical sequencing_projects are generating large alternate sets of sequenced samples imputation in african_americans using haplotypes from the exome_sequencing project compared with haplotypes from genomes_project increased effective_sample by for coding variants with minor_allele no loss of imputation quality was observed using a panel built from phenotypic extremes we recommend using haplotypes from exome_sequencing project alone or concatenation of the two panels over quality_score based post imputation selection or impute s two panel combination genotype_imputation is a common practice for both genotyping and sequencing studies increasingly_large reference_panels available in the public_domain e g those from the genomes_project and uk k project together with improved statistical_methods howie to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first four and the last two authors should be regarded_as z on behalf of the national_heart lung and blood institute go exome_sequencing have enhanced imputation quality especially for rare_variants with minor_allele maf these improvements have resulted in both discovery and refined mapping of association with complex_traits however few studies have examined the use of large study specific reference_panels particularly the use of exome_sequencing derived panels in admixed_populations here we present a new resource for imputation in african_americans built from african_americans sequenced by the exome_sequencing project esp we assessed the use of the esp data as an imputation reference_panel and compared the results with those obtained using the genomes_project phase g version march release data additionally we evaluated the potential_consequences of using a reference_panel built from samples selected on the basis of phenotypic extremes or disease status instead of a population_based random_sample lastly we compared multiple approaches to combine the esp and g panels for the imputation of rare coding variants we note that esp is heavily enriched for extremes from several phenotypes rather than a single phenotype thus it is unclear whether these results generalize to a design where sequenced subjects are selected based on extremes for a single phenotype we did not attempt to select one phenotype for evaluation as doing so would reduce our reference size to below which we view as of little value for the imputation of rare_variants we expect such extreme panels to make little difference for imputation overall and may affect imputation in the specific trait associated regions when the causal_variant s exert large effect s although we recommend the concatenation of esp and g we observed only modest gains in imputation quality by combining the two previous_studies suggest that these gains may depend in part on the ethnic make up of the study subjects and whether g data add substantial haplotype diversity these gains should be weighed against the logistical challenges of combining data from multiple sources to avoid batch_effects e g mismatched strands inconsistent marker naming schemes or systematic_differences in genotype_calling qc or phasing in summary we found that the esp african_american reference_panel outperformed the g reference_panel for the imputation of rare coding variants in african_americans both in terms of imputation quality the number of imputable markers and consequently power for trait association testing the finding was robust to adjustment of reference size and matching on ethnicity we did not observe loss of imputation quality because of the esp design for enriched sequencing of subjects selected for phenotypic extremes regarding the optimal way to combine the two panels our evaluations suggested that esp alone or concatenation of the esp and g reference_panels was superior to either post imputation selection based on rsq or impute s implementation of two separate reference_panels we focused here on imputation of coding variants from esp however we believe that the conclusions drawn here apply to rare_variants across the genome as recently reported by several whole_genome based studies in individuals of european_ancestry these studies and our present work strongly suggest that population matched_samples even in diverse populations such as african_americans can clearly outperform g imputation performance therefore we recommend investigators routinely consider sequencing for the design and analysis of the study samples
