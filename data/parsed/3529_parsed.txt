genome_analysis phenonet identification of key networks associated with disease phenotype motivation at the core of transcriptome analyses of cancer is a challenge to detect molecular differences affiliated with disease_phenotypes this approach has led to remarkable progress in identifying molecular_signatures and in stratifying patients into clinical groups yet despite this progress many of the identified signatures are not robust enough to be clinically used and not consistent enough to provide a follow_up on molecular_mechanisms results to address_these we introduce phenonet a novel algorithm for the identification of pathways and networks associated with different phenotypes phenonet uses two types of input_data gene_expression data rma rpkm fpkm etc and phenotypic_information and integrates these data with curated pathways and proteinprotein_interaction information comprehensive iterations across all possible pathways and subnetworks result in the identification of key pathways or subnetworks that distinguish between the two phenotypes availability_and matlab_code is available upon request beginning in the mid s through unique conventions on public sharing and through the concentrated efforts of different groups around the world an ever growing abundance of transcriptome_profiling sets of data have provided the systems medicine community with the foundations of what is now referred to as molecular_signatures many of these signatures have concentrated on identifying sets of genes that classify patients into relevant clinical affiliations followed by the use of enrichment tools to further affiliate sets of genes with biological_processes additional layers of mechanism understanding have been introduced with the use of network metrics to quantify the orchestrated behavior of genes within the transcriptome ben these network approaches and the resulting insight suggest that biological cellular and disease outcome strongly depend on the complex of interactions between genes proteins and other molecules throughpathways in patients who exhibited liver_metastasis versus patients who remained recurrence free after follow_up integrated pathway_information with disease classification procedure to classify disease by looking at the activity signaling_pathways or protein_complexes proposed a classification_method based on probabilistic_inference of pathway activities developed a network method for estimating pathway activation in tumors from model signatures in a recent work by the authors provided a server for identifying network based biomarkers that correlate with patient_survival data kim andmodified the gillespie algorithm by adding the hill function to describe protein activation they applied their algorithm to simulate expression data that show switch like and oscillatory_behavior in the metabolite_production system of microorganisms here we have developed phenonet which is a network based phenotype classification_tool that integrates gene_expression data rma rpkm fpkm etc clinical data and ppi knowledge for the identification of key subnetworks whose behavior and derived index stratifies the clinical states phenonet works under the assumption that specific regulation_mechanism can control specific phenotype by doing so phenonet is able to detect phenotype dependent gene gene_associations by scanning all known ppis phenonet is able to detect a specific single subnetwork with strong regulation in phenotype a and with a lesser impact regulation in phenotype b such associations are identified through measuring correlation and lack of correlation among ppi components because of the fact that these specific regulations are present in only one phenotype we can assume that the absent or present of them is meaningful for disease course to the best of our knowledge phenonet is the first tool that is tuned to identify these changes according to their phenotype affiliations although available tools are structured to identify mutation or methylation modifications across phenotypes they are not structured to detect subnetworks that undergo changes in their gene gene_associations phenonet while completely unconcerned with mutation or methylation status is structured to identify modifications in associations between gene_pairs across a subnetwork the identification of these changes may be a key for catalyzing new treatment and understanding specific phenotype mechanisms at the core of the method is the calculation of correlations between all known ppis phenonet is able to identify the most varied subnetwork that stratifies tested phenotypes phenonet returns a single subnetwork for every two phenotypes presented this network is the most varied between the two phenotypes cancer is not a static disease disease_progression correlates with molecular modifications to evade natural defenses and to adapt to new environmental and micro environmental circumstances such drastic changes that stands at the core of the cancer phenotype are not isolated incidents but are systemic modifications indeed the initiation and progression of the disease are driven by a large set of factors such as interactions among genes proteins and the environment rather than by single alterations in genetic_variants systemic approaches enable the integration of biological and computational knowledge and help address fundamental_questions regarding the complexity and connectivity of this system wide rewiring different molecular_phenotypes are the manifestations of different molecular_characteristics within the same single disease such complex profiles of molecular_phenotypes are determined using molecular and genetic_information from tumor_cells oncogenesis may be better considered not only as the rearrangement of chromosomes but also as the rearrangement of regulatory_networks their interactions and their interconnections cancer is not a disease of a few genes but of a cluster of genes whose altered global interactions evolve into the transformed and malignant state these considerations as well as their multilayered association with network_features call for a network behavior tool with the ability to identify core network alterations that are at the root of phenotypic changes here we describe phenonet a novel algorithm for the identification of subnetworks of genes or known pathways whose molecular co behavior stratifies phenotypes correlations between the expression levels of interacting genes indicate regulatory_control between network nodes we search for subnetworks whose synchronization is visible in one phenotype and contrasted by another thus when we identify a highly_correlated subnetwork in one group of patients and then identify the loss of this correlation in another the assumption is that this regulation is fragmented during the course of progression into or out of the phenotype phenonet is able to identify such networks wrote that a regulatory_network acts as the control system of a biochemical nanofactory with the rate of production of certain compounds being determined by the probability that certain sets of agents are activated the approach presented here uses the known regulatory ppi_network to extract a subnetwork that acts as a control system distinguishing between the two phenotypes to determine phenonet robustness we compared it with a set of highly informative and well structured tools survnet biolayout express and c net for this analysis we used the two breast_cancer datasets that were tested see above on phenonet phenonet results demonstrated a overlap between the networks discovered for the two breast_cancer datasets this robustness was not repeated in the three tested tools as informative and useful as these tools are and without specific criticism of the important results that can be obtained using them they did not repeat the results obtained from the two datasets supplementary figs s and s supplementary tables s s this highlights a unique and important feature b a scatterplot showing the correlation between abl and ywhag in luminal a patients and the lack of correlation in luminal b patients in both datasets of phenonet i e robustness which is a necessity in transcriptomics based biomarker_discovery we first applied phenonet to stratify network rewiring in breast_cancer clinical_subgroups tn er pgr her and the non tn using breast_cancer rna_seq from the tcga the network identified by phenonet as the most significant in distinguishing between those two groups was dominated by t gene also known as brachyury as can be seen in the t box family of genes is a group of highly_conserved transcription_factors tf that play_an in embryonic_development it has been found that the t box tf brachyury induces in tumor_cells epithelial_mesenchymal markers down_regulation of epithelial markers and an increase in cell_migration inhibition of brachyury resulted in loss of cell_migration and reduced the ability of human tumor_cells to form lung_metastasis these findings may support some of the results shown in this article although the subnetwork identified in the tn group is highly_correlated this same subnetwork is uncorrelated in the non tn group this network may be the cause of the high_level of aggressiveness of the tn tumors as long as this network is controlled by t gene migration invasion and metastasis are promoted once this control mechanism is lost and with it the subnetwork correlation the breast_cancer phenotype becomes less aggressive and is manifested as non tn the use of two additional breast_cancer datasets to validate our approach using samples from tumors with receptor status er pgr and her classified as luminal a and er pgr and her classified as luminal b demonstrated how phenonet directs the identification of a key_player in the stratification of the subnetworks in both datasets namely ywhag ywhag belongs to the family of proteins that regulate many cellular_processes that are important in cancer_biology such as apoptosis and cell_cycle check points a recent study showed an association_between in ywhag and breast_cancer subtype er and her p value in addition ywhag was also found to be correlated with the expression pattern of er protein in breast_cancer in a way that correlated with patient outcome taken together this may suggest an important role played by ywhag in controlling the networks and in stratifying the two subtypes the article presented here provides means to identify core processes that are tightly_linked with different phenotypic manifestations of disease we believe that network target_identification is the key for constructing drug_target networks and for improving the understanding of disease_etiology
