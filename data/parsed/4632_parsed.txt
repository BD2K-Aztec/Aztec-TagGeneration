sequence_analysis the rna shapes studio motivation abstract shape analysis first proposed in allows one to extract several relevant structures from the folding space of an rna_sequence preferable to focusing in a single structure of minimal free_energy we report recent extensions to this approach results we have rebuilt the original rnashapes as a repository of components that allows us to integrate several established tools for rna_structure analysis rnashapes rnaalishapes and pknotsrg including its recent extension pkiss as a spin off we obtain heretofore unavailable functionality e g with pkiss we can now perform abstract shape analysis for structures holding pseudoknots up to the complexity of kissing hairpin motifs the new tool palikiss can predict kissing hairpin motifs from aligned sequences along with the integration the functionality of the tools was also extended in manifold ways availability_and as before the tool is available on the bielefeld bioinformatics server at
