structural_bioinformatics automatic generation of protein_structure cartoons with pro origami protein topology diagrams are d representations of protein_structure that are particularly useful in understanding and analysing complex protein_folds generating such diagrams presents a major_problem in graph drawing with automatic approaches often resulting in errors or uninterpretable results here we apply a breakthrough in diagram layout to protein topology cartoons providing clear accurate interactive and editable diagrams which are also an interface to a structural search method availability pro origami is available via a web_server at
