structural_bioinformatics interevscore a novel coarse_grained interface scoring_function using a multi body statistical potential coupled to evolution motivation structural prediction of protein interactions currently remains a challenging but fundamental goal in particular progress in scoring_functions is critical for the efficient discrimination of near native interfaces among large sets of decoys many functions have been developed using knowledge_based but few make use of multi body interactions or evolutionary_information although multi residue interactions are crucial for proteinprotein binding and protein interfaces undergo significant selection_pressure to maintain their interactions results this article_presents interevscore a novel scoring_function using a coarse_grained statistical potential including two and three body interactions which provides each residue with the opportunity to contribute in its most favorable local structural environment combination of this potential with evolutionary_information considerably improves scoring results on the test cases from the widely used protein_docking benchmark for which evolutionary_information can be collected we analyze how our way to include evolutionary_information gradually increases the discriminative_power of interevscore comparison with several previously_published scoring_functions zdock zrank and spider shows the significant progress brought by interevscore proteinprotein_interactions play_a in virtually all cellular_processes despite the growing number of available d structures for protein_complexes in the protein_data computational_prediction of protein interfaces turns out as an important tool for the exploration of interactomes a large variety of methods have been developed in the past_years to improve the success_rate of computational proteinprotein_docking and the combination of various methods can improve the accuracy of docking_results docking methods can be classified in two broad and complementary categories template based homology docking based on the availability of d complex structures similar to the complex of interest and template free docking in the present work we focus on the second type of approach classically the template free docking procedure can be divided in two steps the first step consists in sampling a large number of candidate interfaces also called decoys this sampling is often performed using a rigid_body method which allows for fast search in the large decoy conformational_space in particular fast_fourier based_algorithms are highly_efficient the most recent strategies often succeed in generating several near native conformations however the second step of the docking process which involves scoring and ranking the many decoys that have been generated often fails to distinguish these near native conformations from incorrect models and there is still room for improvement of the scoring_functions used in proteinprotein_docking scoring_functions can be divided in three categories physicsbased functions which provide an estimate of the free_energy of binding using physico_chemical principles knowledge based empirical potentials relying on statistics and hybrid potentials combining the two those methods are embodied in the programs of the most successful participants in the critical assessment of prediction of interactions capri docking and scoring experiments among the successful programs some rely mainly on physico_chemical scoring_functions such as haddock attract zdock pydock or firedock whereas others such as itscorepp rely on an iterative knowledge based scoring_function hybrid approaches were also implemented in scoring_functions such as zrank or piper and in the switch from low to high_resolution scoring_functions in the rosetta program an ideal scoring_function would describe the energetics of the protein interface in atomic detail however in a context where low_resolution approaches are needed given the highly combinatorial nature of protein_docking rigid_body sampling is largely favored as a first step coarse_grained knowledge_based less sensitive to atomic details such as side chain to whom correspondence should be addressed positioning seem appropriate for discriminating false interfaces from rigid_body near native decoys and have been shown in several occasions to retain most of the useful information contained in all atom potentials a limitation of most statistical_potentials developed so_far is the decomposition of interface contacts into pairs leaving out multi body interactions which are known to be important for binding a few statistical_potentials developed for protein_structure take into account three body and four body interactions most recently the spider scoring_function has been developed for protein interface scoring based on multi residue patterns with no theoretical size limitation one of the major difficulties toward the development of multi body docking potentials is the scarcity of interface contact statistics we recently designed the interevol database to explore the structure and evolution of protein_complexes this database contains non redundant interfaces including non obligate heteromeric interfaces which form a large and robust basis for the extraction of reliable two and three body interaction statistics a complementary source of information about protein interfaces comes from the conservation of quaternary_structures and binding_modes which is observed above sequence_identity to predict the location of binding_sites and the structure of complexes different types of evolutionary_information were used they consist either in the analysis of correlated_mutations in the mapping of evolutionary_rates or in the detection of residue contact complementarities the use of correlated_mutations successful in some cases was found to have strong limitations and sophisticated_statistical treatments together with a large number of sequences were found beneficial to reach high_precision scores integrating conservation profiles or residue_contacts likelihood extracted from multiple_sequence msas were found to improve the prediction of binding_sites at protein_surfaces as for docking scoring_functions have also been developed that bias interface detection toward evolutionarily conserved_residues the development of the scotch method highlighted a remarkable plasticity in the way interface physicochemical complementarities are maintained through evolution moreover in a recent study of pairs of homologous heteromeric interfaces we showed that although interface contacts are highly versatile some contact conservation signal can be extracted in particular when considering specific interface descriptors in the present article we introduce interevscore a novel scoring_function for protein_docking which combines a multi body statistical potential with evolutionary_information derived from coupled msas for each partner in the complex and from our previous observations on the evolution of homologous interfaces to our knowledge interevscore is the first scoring_function for docking applications relying on both two and three body statistical_potentials combined with the scoring of interface contacts inferred from msas this way of integrating evolutionary_information was found significantly superior to solely accounting for conserved positions we also show that interevscore achieves significant_improvement compared with several scoring_functions namely zdock zrank and spider in the detection of near native conformations among large sets of decoys from the widely used proteinprotein_docking benchmark interevscore is freely_available as a standalone python program and can be run using different modes to take advantage of available structural and evolutionary_information
