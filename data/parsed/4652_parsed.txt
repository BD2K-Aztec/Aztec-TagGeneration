genome_analysis the uniqueome a mappability resource for short tag sequencing quantification applications of short tag sequencing_data such as cnvseq and rnaseq depend on knowing the uniqueness of specific_genomic at a given threshold of error here we present the uniqueome a genomic resource for understanding the uniquely mappable proportion of genomic_sequences pre_computed data are available for human mouse fly and worm genomes in both color_space and nucletotide space and we demonstrate the utility of this resource as applied to the quantification of rnaseq_data availability files scripts and supplementary data are available from
