a varying threshold method for chip peak_calling using multiple sources of information motivation gene_regulation commonly involves interaction among dna proteins and biochemical conditions using chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip technologies proteindna_interactions are routinely detected in the genome_scale computational_methods that detect weak protein binding signals and simultaneously maintain a high_specificity yet remain to be challenging an attractive approach is to incorporate biologically_relevant data such as protein co occupancy to improve the power of protein binding detection we call the additional data related with the target protein binding as supporting tracks results we propose a novel but rigorous statistical_method to identify protein occupancy in chip data using multiple supporting tracks pass we demonstrate that utilizing biologically related information can significantly increase the discovery of true protein binding_sites while still maintaining a desired_level of false_positive calls applying the method to gata restoration in mouse erythroid cell_line we detected many new gata binding_sites using gata co occupancy data understanding the association between protein occupancy and the target gene_expression is essential to study the mechanism of gene_regulation the first step is to identify the protein binding_sites in the genome current chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip technologies coupled with microarray_hybridization chip_chip or parallel dna_sequencing chip_seq enable the identification of transcription_factor in vivo in the genome_wide scale many computational_methods have been developed to detect transcription_factor occupancy from chip_chip and chipseq data which we refer to as peak_calling making choices of program parameters and choosing significance thresholds to accurately control genome_wide false_positives fps however is often difficult we have previously_developed a statistical_method that can precisely control the expected number of genome_wide fp peak calls in the context of correlated multiple_comparisons with fps controlled it is further desired to improve the peak_calling methods to reduce false_negative instances gene_regulation is a complex process that usually involves the cooperation of multiple transcription_factors which may interact to form a regulatory module that binds to a dna_segment to regulate their target_genes expression certain histone_modifications may also play crucial roles in regulatory_mechanisms heintzman to whom correspondence should be addressed the binding_potential of a target transcription_factor therefore can be partially learned from the cobinding proteins and features that jointly participate in a regulatory module within the cell as the prevalent chip technologies increase the need for analyzing chip_chip and chip_seq several studies have made efforts to utilize multiple biological_features into chip data analysis for example methods have been developed for segmenting the genomic_regions into active intervals of interest few methods for peak_calling however have incorporated the joint effects of related biological_features while detecting binding_sites for a target protein datta andhave proposed a method that uses a log linear_model to infer co binding associations between two or more transcription_factors their method is a post_processing algorithm that takes the p values from existing peak_calling algorithms as input but cannot incorporate general types of data in this article we propose a novel yet rigorous method that accounts for the co binding information and relevant biological_features to detect dna occupancy of a target protein from chip data without assuming distributions of the related biological_features which we call supporting tracks we first use a logistic regression_model to describe the correlation between the binding of the target protein and the supporting tracks the output is the probability of each position being potentially occupied by the target protein predicted by the supporting tracks we then introduce a varying threshold method to call significant peaks from the chip data of interest where the threshold for each probe is adjusted by its predicted probability of protein binding our approach is similar to that of a bayesian_method that incorporates prior_knowledge of protein binding into the analysis different from bayesian_methods we still control the family wise fp rate or false_discovery fdr at a user specified level our varying threshold method called pass is a generalization from the pass algorithm and is related with conditional test in statistics using simulation_studies and real_datasets of gata binding in a mouse erythroid regulation study we show that the proposed method can identify many more gata binding_sites than using the target chip data alone when the fdr is controlled at a common level our study shows that the proposed_framework is robust with respect to irrelevant supporting data added to the model the additional binding_sites detected by incorporating the related biological_features are potentially real gata binding_sites many of which are either experimentally_verified or enriched near refseq genes to our best knowledge the proposed method is the only algorithm that incorporates multiple sources of information in peak_calling to improve the power of detecting weak protein binding signals and simultaneously ourpage i i i we introduced a new statistical_method to improve the power of detecting protein binding in chip data by combining additional a b this region also shows depleted h_k and enriched h_k signals horizontal black lines indicate signal means biological_features the proposed method not only improves the sensitivity of peak_calling than traditional_methods but also precisely controls a user specified level of fp rate or fdr the additional sites detected by our method are those regions with medium or low binding signals which cannot pass the genomewide statistical_significance control after taking_into of the correlation between the binding_sites and biologically related supporting features regions coincide with strong supporting signals will become detectable by our method using both simulation and real_data analysis we observed that our method can effectively detect more true binding_sites than traditional peak_calling methods under all scenarios we tested our method also precisely controlled the proportion of fp calls at fdr level we further observed that the proposed method is robust to irrelevant data tracks added to the model our method does neither assume any distributions on the supporting data nor it attempts to estimate data distributions empirically such assumptions and estimation procedures may introduce unwanted bias and uncertainty in peak_calling our method is flexible to incorporate any types of biological_information that overlap with the chip regions by converting continuous data into bins the binding probabilities computed from our logistic regression_model will be robust to outliers and extreme_values our analysis showed that a proper discretization method applied to supporting tracks can also have significant impact on peak_calling results
