genome_analysis pgap pan genomes analysis_pipeline with the rapid development of dna_sequencing increasing bacteria genome data enable the biologists to dig the evolutionary and genetic_information of prokaryotic species from pan_genome sight therefore the high_efficiency pipelines for pan genome_analysis are mostly needed we have developed a new pan_genome analysis_pipeline pgap which can perform five analytic functions with only one command including cluster_analysis of functional_genes pan_genome profile analysis genetic_variation analysis of functional_genes species evolution analysis and function enrichment_analysis of gene_clusters pgaps performance has been evaluated on streptococcus_pyogenes strains availability pgap is developed with perl script on the linux platform and the package is freely_available from http pgap sf net with the rapid development of dna_sequencing many large_scale microbial_genomes projects are being processed such as ten thousand microbial genomes_project and nih human_microbiome hmp accumulations of bacterial whole genome_sequences also give the biologists more opportunities to explore and test the evolutionary hypotheses on a larger scale than before in tettelin and colleagues introduced a new conception pan_genome soon afterwards pan_genome has been widely used to provide insight into the analysis of the evolution of streptococcus_pneumoniae haemophilus_influenzae escherichia_coli and so on besides evolution pan_genome has been widely used to detect strain specific virulence_factors for some pathogens legionella_pneumophila d it is also helpful to investigate the pathogens of epidemic diseases by scanning variable functional_genes in core genomes and develop vaccines against bacterial_pathogens from reverse vaccinology sight to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as in order to make pan genome_analysis for one bacterial_population as easy as possible there is a great need to develop high_efficiency tools for bacterial pan genome_analysis for pan genome_analysis there are only panseq and pgat so_far panseq does well in extracting the core and accessory regions among genomic_sequences and detecting the snp among core_regions however it is short of the ability to present the pan_genome profiles of given strains trace the evolutionary_history with multiple materials and point out the variation and function enrichment of functional_genes as a web_based database pgat has integrated ortholog assignments gene content queries sequences polymorphisms and metabolic_pathways information however so_far it only provides analytical result of limited species in the database and it cannot analyze the genome data from users we have developed a new stand alone program called pan genomes analysis_pipeline pgap which has integrated multiple function models and could be used to study the evolutionary_history of bacteria discover pathogenic mechanism and prevent and control epidemics
