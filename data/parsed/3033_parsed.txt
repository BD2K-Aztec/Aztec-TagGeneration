databases_and model based gene_set for bioconductor gene_ontology and other forms of gene category analysis play_a in the evaluation of high_throughput experiments in molecular_biology single category enrichment_analysis procedures such as fishers_exact tend to flag large_numbers of redundant categories as significant which can complicate interpretation we have recently_developed an approach_called model based gene_set mgsa that substantially reduces the number of redundant categories returned by the gene category analysis in this work we present the bioconductor_package mgsa which makes the mgsa algorithm available to users of the r language our package provides a simple and flexible application_programming for applying the approach availability the mgsa package has been made available as part of bioconductor it is released under the conditions of the artisticgene ontology go analysis and other forms of gene_set have become a standard exploratory tool for understanding the results of large_scale genomics experiments and for generating new hypotheses most early approaches investigated each go term one at a time for example testing for significant_enrichment of responder genes in each term using fishers_exact in contrast two recent methods gengo and model based gene_set mgsa have been developed as global approaches in which one aims to find the best combination of go terms to explain the observed biological response such global or modelbased approaches avoid problems connected with the statistical_dependencies inherent in large ontologies such as the go in which gene_annotations are propagated to ancestor terms or in any collection of gene_sets in which the categories share many annotated_genes mgsa analyzes all go categories at once by modeling gene response as a function of the combination of active go terms it employs probabilistic_inference via a metropolis hasting algorithm to estimate the probability of categories to be active the mgsa approach naturally takes category overlap into accountpage the mgsa package is not restricted to the go but allows analysis with arbitrary gene_sets this flexibility is illustrated on a dataset in which gene_expression for two yeast_strains that differ by a single allele pho is compared we ask which transcription_factor s could together best explain the set of transcripts that show differential_expression we stored these as vector of gene identifiers observations ybr c ybr w ybr c have compiled a regulatory_network for yeast by integrating data of in vivo transcription_factor binding from chip_chip together with transcription_factor motif analysis and sequence_conservation we defined as gene_sets the sets of targets of each transcription_factor of the network with intermediate cutoffs for binding intensities and conservation this network contains a total of targets across transcription_factors we simply stored it as a named list of vectors of gene identifiers sets abf ypl c ypl c ypl w ace yor w yor c ynl w the mgsa package gives users of bioconductor programmatic_access to mgsa thus it can be incorporated into scripts and pipelines written in r and be combined with many other packages of the bioinformatics community the package comes with a simple but flexible api which allows researchers not only to use go asposterior std error categories whose posterior is above are interpreted to be active according to the mgsa model source of gene_sets but also other categorization schemes like the kegg_pathways or the broad institute gene_sets that are easily available through other bioconductor_packages for instance via gseabase
