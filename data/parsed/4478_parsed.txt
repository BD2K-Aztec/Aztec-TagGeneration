surrogate_variable using partial_least sva pls in gene_expression studies motivation in a typical gene_expression study our prime objective is to identify the genes that are differentially_expressed between the samples from two different tissue_types commonly standard analysis_of anova regression is implemented to identify the relative effects of these genes over the two types of samples from their respective arrays of expression levels but this technique becomes fundamentally flawed when there are unaccounted sources of variability in these arrays latent_variables attributable to different biological environmental or other factors relevant in the context these factors distort the true picture of differential_gene between the two tissue_types and introduce spurious signals of expression heterogeneity as a result many genes which are actually differentially_expressed are not detected whereas many others are falsely identified as positives moreover these distortions can be different for different genes thus it is also not possible to get rid of these variations by simple array normalizations this both way error can lead to a serious loss in sensitivity_and thereby causing a severe inefficiency in the underlying multiple_testing in this work we attempt to identify the hidden effects of the underlying latent_factors in a gene_expression study by partial_least pls and apply ancova technique with the pls identified signatures of these hidden effects as covariates in order to identify the genes that are truly differentially_expressed between the two concerned tissue_types results we compare the performance of our method sva pls with standard anova and a relatively recent technique of surrogate_variable sva on a wide_variety of simulation_settings incorporating different effects of the hidden variable under situations with varying signal_intensities and gene groupings in all settings our method yields the highest sensitivity while maintaining relatively reasonable values for the specificity false_discovery and false non discovery rate application of our method to gene_expression for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia shows that our method detects an additional six genes that are missed by both the standard anova method as well as sva but may be relevant to this disease as can be seen from mining the existing_literature availability the r code for our method sva pls is freely_available on the supplementary website_http www somnathdatta org supp svpls contact hidden array specific subject specific factors in microarray_analyses may constitute a substantial source of gene_expression heterogeneity the effects of these factors are not detectable from outside and also cannot be removed by any standard normalizing method but they can perturb the primary signals of differential_gene and lead to erroneous_conclusions on the detection of differentially_expressed this problem is relatively unexplored in gene_expression studies in this article we have developed a novel technique for identifying these latent_factors by using pls and applied it to a wide_variety of simulation_settings characterizing different patterns of viable gene_expression studies we have shown that the technique of pls by virtue of its basic principle of projecting to latent structures can produce precise estimates of the hidden_factors causing the spurious signal heterogeneity these estimates surrogate variables when incorporated in the anova model enhances detection of the genevariety interaction effects thereby leading to a large gain in sensitivity of the underlying bioinformatics screening procedure the resulting method sva pls also yields a reasonably high_specificity for a wide_range of data_structures thereby ensuring an efficient control over the incorrect detection of many silent genes the fdr is marginally_higher for our method but is sufficiently well compensated by a substantially large gain in the margin of sensitivity overall sva pls emerges as the winner when compared with two other competing_methods in a range of controlled settings the utility of our method in detecting potentially interesting genes missed by other methods is also demonstrated by an analysis of a real_dataset on amkl patients unaccounted sources of variation hidden_variables in a model can adversely_affect the outcomes of statistical_tests this is particularly true if the unmeasured variables are confounders i e correlated with the variables in the model whose effects on the outcomes are being tested in a simple two group comparison a standard assumption for the validity of the commonly used two sample pooled t test is that the error variances in the two groups populations are equal a departure from this model assumption is known as the behrensfisher problem and has received a great_deal of assumption in the statistics literature see e g a common solution to this problem is to use separate variance estimates for the error_distribution in two groups and resort either to an approximate t distribution or to a large sample normal_approximation of the distribution of the test_statistics indeed if one assumes as in our formulation the existence of an unmeasured factor contributing to the outcome in a linear_model formulation of the two sample problem that is equated with the model errors one gets a model with unequal variances in the two groups thus our method may provide an alternative_solution to page
