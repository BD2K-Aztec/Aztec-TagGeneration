sequence_analysis umelt prediction of high_resolution melting_curves and dynamic melting profiles of pcr_products in a rich web_application umelt sm is a flexible web_based for predicting dna melting_curves and denaturation profiles of pcr_products the user defines an amplicon sequence and chooses a set of thermodynamic and experimental parameters that include nearest_neighbor stacking energies loop entropy effects cation monovalent and mg concentrations and a temperature_range using an accelerated partition_function algorithm along with chosen parameter_values umelt interactively calculates and visualizes the mean helicity and the dissociation probability at each sequence position at temperatures within the temperature_range predicted curves display the mean helicity as a function of temperature or as derivative plots predicted profiles display stability as a function of sequence position either as helicity temperatures or as the helicity probability at specific temperatures the loss of helicity associated with increasing_temperature may be viewed dynamically to visualize domain formation within the molecule results from fluorescent high_resolution experiments match the number of predicted melting domains and their relative temperatures however the absolute melting_temperatures vary with the selected thermodynamic_parameters and current libraries do not account for the rapid melting rates and helix stabilizing dyes used in fluorescent melting experiments umelt provides a convenient platform for simulation and design of high_resolution assays availability_and the application was developed in actionscript and can be found online atdna melting analysis with fluorescent_dyes is a new method to conveniently scan for genetic_variation without sequencing the ability to predict the shape and position of melting_curves is essential for assay_design and optimization umelt builds on existing_models of dna melting using nearest_neighbor thermodynamics and recursive calculations using statistical_mechanics to whom correspondence should be addressed to predict fluorescent melting analysis of pcr_products in a rich web_application
