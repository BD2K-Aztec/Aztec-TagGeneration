structural_bioinformatics the labelhash server and tools for substructure based functional_annotation the labelhash server and tools are designed for large_scale substructure comparison the main use is to predict the function of unknown_proteins given a set of putative functional_residues labelhash finds all occurrences of matching substructures in the entire protein_data along with a statistical_significance estimate and known functional_annotations for each match the results can be downloaded for further analysis in any molecular viewer for chimera there is a plugin to facilitate this process availability the web_site is free and open to all users with no login requirements at http the function of many proteins is still poorly_understood for proteins with low sequence_identity to any other proteins structural_comparison can be used to identify distant homologs both the number and diversity of structures is rapidly increasing this helps make the results of a structural approach to functional_annotation more informative but at the same time also computationally more challenging the function of a protein can often be characterized by a structural_motif a representative substructure formed by functional_residues the function of an unknown protein can therefore be inferred from high similarity of a substructure in this protein to a motif with known function a variety of methods have been proposed that compute matches to a motif in a collection of structures some of which are also accessible through a web_server or as downloadable program they differ significantly in one or more of the following aspects representation of a motif matching algorithm statistical_model and the set of targets a motif can be matched against the underlying algorithm for the labelhash web_server makes it possible to match motifs against the entire protein databank with minimal restrictions and still obtain results within a matter of minutes to whom correspondence should be addressed
