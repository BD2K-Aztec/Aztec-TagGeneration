genetics_and ftec a coalescent simulator for modeling faster than exponential_growth recent genetic_studies as well as recorded history point to massive growth in human population_sizes during the recent_past to model and understand this growth accurately we introduce ftec an easy to use coalescent_simulation program capable of simulating haplotype samples drawn from a population that has undergone faster than exponential_growth samples drawn from a population that has undergone faster than exponential_growth show an excess of very rare variation and more rapid ld decay when compared with samples drawn from a population that has maintained a constant size over time availability source_code for ftec is freely_available for download from the university of michigan center for statistical genetics wiki atrecent human sequencing studies have uncovered a pattern of genetic_variation characterized by a large proportion of very rare variation sequenced individuals across two genes and found on average variant every bases singletons and doubletons accounted for of variant sites other studies with between and individuals have found that of observed variants are found in at most two individuals exome_sequencing project unpublished_data m r submitted for publication a large fraction of extremely_rare variation in a population is evidence of recent dramatic population growth growth in the human population has traditionally been modeled as either instantaneous or exponential posited that the pattern of variation observed in their data may have resulted from population growth occurring at an explosive faster than exponential_rate incorporating faster than exponential_growth into statistical_models aimed at estimating population_genetic parameters has the potential to improve estimate accuracy additionally refining statistical_tools that test for the role of rare_variants in disease and trait etiology will require simulated_data with an accurate distributionunder a model of faster than exponential_growth on average of variants in our samples were singletons and were doubletons these findings contrast with the exponential_growth model where on average of variants were singletons and were doubletons as well as the constant populations size model where on average of variants were singletons and were doubletons and the instantaneous growth model where on average of variants were singletons and were doubletons the rate of pairwise linkage_disequilibrium decay is quite similar across the models investigated looking closely linkage_disequilibrium decays slowest in constant populations and at an intermediate rate in populations with faster than exponential_growth ld decays fastest in exponentially_growing and instantly growing populations average pairwise r was until a distance of and kb for the constant size population faster than exponential_growth instantaneous growth and exponential_growth models respectively results for d decay are qualitatively_similar supplementary_material ftec provides the opportunity to study easily a broader range of population growth models under the coalescent than has previously been possible as ever larger sequencing studies bring the rarest portion of the site_frequency into focus we have provided a tool that can help test theories of how the rarest variation arose and simulate data with a realistic distribution of variants
