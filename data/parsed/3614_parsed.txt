sequence_analysis poretools a toolkit for analyzing nanopore sequence_data motivation nanopore sequencing may be the next disruptive technology in genomics owing to its ability to detect single dna_molecules without prior amplification lack of reliance on expensive optical_components and the ability to sequence long fragments the minion tm from oxford nanopore technologies ont is the first nanopore se quencer to be commercialized and is now available to early access users the minion tm is a usb connected portable nanopore sequen cer that permits real_time analysis of streaming event data currently the research_community lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets results we introduce poretools a flexible toolkit for exploring data_sets generated by nanopore sequencing devices from minion tm for the purposes of quality_control and downstream_analysis poretools operates directly on the native fast an application of the hdf standard file_format produced by ont and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization_tools availability_and poretools is an open_source and is written in python as both a suite of command_line utilities and a python application_programming dna_sequencing with biological nanopores was proposed almost years_ago this approach relies on the direct electrical detection of single dna_strands in contact with an individual pore single_molecule detection and the absence of a prior amplification step means that extremely_long fragments can be sequenced without any loss in quality in may oxford nanopore technologies released minion tm the first commercially_available nanopore dna_sequencing device minion tm is noteworthy for its portability size around the same length as an iphone tm and usb connectivity meaning it can be run on a standard internet connected laptop research groups throughout the world are actively evaluating this device for a broad range of applications sequencing with the minion yields raw signals reflecting modulation of the ionic_current at each pore by a dna_molecule the resulting time series of nanopore translocation events are base called by proprietary software running as a cloud service the resulting files for each sequenced read are stored in fast format an application of the hdf format however at present no specific software is available to facilitate downstream_analyses starting with this file_format the poretools software helps solve pressing requirements for analysis of nanopore sequencing_data by focusing on the python development environment and adopting expected interface conventions as popularized by other popular bioinformatics_tools such as samtools and bedtools we expect that users will be able to rapidly exploit the functionality offered by this software we anticipate that other toolkits will become available written in other programming_languages further efforts are required for downstream_analysis for common tasks including alignment and de_novo of both event and base called sequence_data from this platform
