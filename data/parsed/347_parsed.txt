an image_based multi_label human protein subcellular_localization predictor ilocator reveals protein mislocalizations in cancer tissues motivation human cells are organized into compartments of different biochemical cellular_processes having proteins appear at the right time to the correct locations in the cellular_compartments is required to conduct their functions in normal cells whereas mislocalization of proteins can result in pathological diseases including cancer results to reveal the cancer related protein mislocalizations we developed an image_based multi_label subcellular_location predictor ilocator which covers seven cellular localizations the ilocator incorporates both global and local image descriptors and generates predictions by using an ensemble multi_label classifier the algorithm has the ability to treat both single and multiple location proteins we first trained and tested ilocator on normal_human images that have known subcellular_location information from the human_protein the ilocator was then used to generate protein_localization predictions for protein images from seven cancer tissues that have no location annotations in the human_protein by comparing the output data from normal and cancer tissues we detected eight potential cancer_biomarker proteins that have significant localization differences with p value the knowledge of the subcellular organelle localization of protein molecules can provide important help for understanding their functions in cells in the past_decade a variety of methods have been developed for predicting the subcellular_localizations of proteins these methods can be grouped into two categories one dimensional d amino_acid sequencebased and two_dimensional d image based_methods the sequence_based usually generate protein subcellular_location predictions through homology transfer target signal search or statistical machine_learning these methods have been successfully_applied to genome_wide large_scale function_annotations but they are hard to detect protein translocations which often cause changes in the related biological_network functions one reason is that when the translocation occurs the primary sequences of the translocated protein are about the same which cannot be detected by the sequence_based comparisons therefore the intuitive d image based_algorithms are explored in this situation efforts on the d image based_approaches are mainly focused on three aspects i studies on new representative image descriptors with examples including the subcellular_location features slfs for protein distributions as proposed by ii studies on improving the accuracy of classification algorithms with examples including the classification based on multi resolution subspaces as reported by and the two discriminative models by which extended the logistic_regression with structure latent_variables and iii applications of existing predictors to the data analysis most of the d methods are single label predictors i e they assumed that each protein corresponds to only one location however nearly of human proteins co exist at different subcellular_locations these multi_label proteins often contain significant biological_information such as protein complex transcription in cell cycles only few studies have attempted to predict distribution from human protein images in multiple location cases these studies tried to use statistics of fluorescence objects to differentiate location patterns in these approaches protein fluorescence objects in images are detected and clustered into several types based on their shape size and position in cells then each single label pattern is represented by a set of objects in distinct types finally a multi_label image is linearly decomposed into the object frequencies in each type such methods have several limitations i overlapping objects and filamentous proteins will confuse the object_detection algorithm because a continuous region of pixels was defined as an object and ii prediction_accuracy is limited by the simple linear_model the former limitation may lead to incorrect object to whom correspondence should be addressed targets and the latter tends to cause the constructed classifier to be too sensitive to the noise and overfitting instead of the linear statistics in this study we seek to develop a more flexible and accurate machine_learning predictor named ilocator which can handle multi and single label samples simultaneously three factors critical for machine_learning algorithm developments including high_quality benchmark_dataset highly discriminative image descriptors and accurate multi_label algorithms will be carefully_designed and systemically examined for benchmark training and testing we will collect the highresolution immunohistochemistry ihc microscopy_images from the human_protein hpa http www proteinatlas org pont n et_al the efficiency of both global and local image descriptors will be examined as input to the classifiers the global features contain the haralick texture_features and the dna distribution features which both belong to the well defined slfs the local binary patterns lbps are applied for the first time to this multi_label problem to describe the local details moreover we will implement an ensemble classifier in ilocator composed of two multi_label modes i e binary relevance br and classifier chains cc because both have been reported performing well in multi_label image pattern_recognition for normal cell function it is critical to have the proteins appear at the right location at the correct time for forming appropriate interactions with correct molecular partners mislocalization will make the proteins inaccessible and thereby not be integrated into the proper functional biological_networks or pathways protein_function loss caused by the mislocalization will inevitably affect the whole biological system which has been found to be associated with many human_diseases several potential reasons can result in aberrant protein locations such as amino_acid in targeting signal_sequence changes in the post_translational and the expression_level and trafficking machinery deregulations to fully understand_the of the protein mislocalizations it is important to first identify the mislocalized protein targets although studies to look for biomarker proteins have been previously_reported these studies only involved single label classifiers which cannot detect changes from multiple_locations to a single location from a single location to multiple_locations or from multiple_locations to different multiple_locations considering the fact that there are human proteins co localized in more than one location these changes can occur frequently for example in a healthy cell protein cylin d can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm in contrast a reduction of cyclin_d exported from the nucleus can lead to overexpression of this protein in the nucleus and the inactivation of retinoblastoma which is a tumor suppressing protein other such multiple location shuttling proteins associated with cancers include p brca sox and apc detecting these changes requires accurate multi_label predictors in this study ilocator has been applied to screen such potential mislocated biomarkers in our protein dataset which includes multi_label proteins by comparing the predictions output from ilocator between cancer and normal_tissues several proteins have been detected as potential cancer biomarkers we have built an ihc image_based multi_label human protein subcellular_location predictor ilocator and presented a framework to screen cancer biomarkers the ilocator is an efficient bioimage based predictor that can handle both single and multiple location site proteins simultaneously by applying ilocator to the datasets from both normal and cancer tissues eight proteins were identified as cancer biomarkers we showed that those proteins that can shuttle between multiple subcellular_locations are important for normal cell functions and losing one of the locations may cause disease these identified mislocated diseasecausing protein targets have also opened a new avenue for the therapeutic treatment of some human_diseases for example by relocating these mislocated proteins to the correct subcellular_localizations they can restore their correct functions which are helpful to cure the diseases although these techniques are still in the infancy stage they have a promising and bright future based on the current study the following efforts will be made in future_studies toward improving the performance of ilocator in this article we used both the global and local_features as the input to the prediction engine and found that the local_features are sensitive to detect the distribution differences among multiple_locations here we used lbp as the local feature which is a baseline texture descriptor actually some lbp variants such as local ternary patterns and local quinary patterns have been proposed and proven to be powerful in image descriptions therefore we will try to use these lbp variants as a future development to handle high_dimensional image feature_vectors the feature_reduction is demonstrated necessary in our experiments and other studies the sda method was used in this article to select representative features and performed well as an alternative we also tested the random subspace ensemble of svm for it saves the feature selection_step and performs well in other studies according to our experiments the random subspace ensemble of the svm approach is not as good as the ensemble of br and cc algorithms used in this study data not shown the reason could be that the random selected_features are not informative to reflect the multi_label samples and the output of the follow_up single classifiers can cause the fluctuation of the voting results which are sensitive to noise these results demonstrate the importance of the development of an effective control mechanism that is able to make the subspace approach suitable to handle multi_label samples fusion of br and cc algorithms in ilocator is demonstrated useful for enhancing the classification_accuracy of multilabel samples the performance of cc mode confirms that passing association information among labels is able to reflect the different propensities of cellular_component co localizations of proteins thus for the bioimage based multi_label protein classification_problem it is also important to dig into the existing large_databases to model the associations among labels the sequence_based and image_based protein subcellular_location prediction_approaches differ in many ways including the feature descriptors and classification algorithms considering that they both deal with protein samples the combination of the two strategies should help enhance the classification_accuracy because of the complementarities which can also provide a better understanding of the protein translocations both intuitively and at the amino_acid level in the next step we plan to explore the idea and combine our d sequence_based protein subcellular_location predictor cell ploc and the d image_based ilocator as developed in this work
