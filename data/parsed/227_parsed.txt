alp falp c libraries for pairwise local_alignment e values motivation pairwise local_alignment is an indispensable tool for molecular_biologists in real_time i e in about s alp ascending ladder program calculates the e values for proteinprotein or dnadna local_alignments of random_sequences for arbitrary substitution score matrix gap costs and letter abundances and falp frameshift ascending ladder program performs a similar task although more slowly for frameshifting dna protein_alignments availability_and to permit other c programmers to implement the computational efficiencies in alp and falp directly within their own programs c source codes are available in the public_domain at http go usa gov gtsw under alp and falp along with the standalone programs alp and falp finding and aligning similar sequences is arguably the most fundamental task in bioinformatics the main method for analysing biosequences novel proteins ancient_dna environmental metagenomics dna single_molecule sequencing_data whole genomes etc is to compare them to sequence_databases or to each other it is important to know whether a similarity is significant i e unlikely to occur by chance alone for gapless alignments e value estimation is rapid because of analytic formulas but for gapped_alignment it has traditionally required hours to days to pre calculate the statistical parameters for arbitrary scoring_schemes and letter abundances many alignment programs therefore limit users to the specific substitution score matrices gap costs and letter abundances corresponding to the pre calculations with adverse consequence to the sensitivity of sequence searches particularly in applications e g where the limitations are inappropriate supplementary table s compares blast and other alignment programs blast does not allow scoring_schemes usefully tailored to searching for remote protein homology remote dna_homology at rich genomes or bisulphite converted dna in particular because of skewed compositions blast can yield misleading p values relevant to the genomes of clinically important_pathogens like at rich malaria or gc_rich tuberculosis several other alignment programs also allow only a limited set of scoring_schemes
