systems_biology a statistical_approach to virtual cellular experiments improved causal discovery using accumulation ida aida motivation we address the following question does inhibition of the expression of a gene x in a cellular assay affect the expression of another gene y rather than inhibiting gene x experimentally we aim at answering this question computationally using as the only input observational gene_expression data recently a new statistical algorithm called intervention calculus when the directed_acyclic is absent ida has been proposed for this problem for several biological_systems ida has been shown to outcompete regression based_methods with respect to the number of true_positives versus the number_of for the top predicted effects further improvements in the performance of ida have been realized by stability_selection a resampling method wrapped around ida that enhances the discovery of true causal_effects nevertheless the rate of false_positive predictions is still unsatisfactorily high results we introduce a new resampling approach for causal discovery called accumulation ida aida we show that aida improves the performance of causal discoveries compared to existing variants of ida on both simulated and real yeast data the higher reliability of top causal_effect predictions achieved by aida promises to increase the rate of success of wet_lab intervention experiments for functional studies understanding of the complex molecular_networks underlying cellular_processes is the key challenge of systems_biology here we focus on gene_regulatory interpreting these networks causally requires a direction of information_flow given a causal network the most basic question is if i perturb gene x what happens to gene y of course this question can be answered experimentally by inhibiting x e g by pcr based gene_deletion strategy rna_interference or crispri screening and observing y we here discuss to what extend the same question may be answered in a virtual way i e without the need to perform a cellular perturbation experiment a high_throughput version of this problem would be the following find all pairs of genes x y where perturbing x affects y we refer to this causal data_mining approach as causal discovery statistically the challenge is to estimate causal_effects between random_variables from purely observational_data for gene_expression data the causal_effect of gene x on gene y can be defined as the number of units gene y changes in expression if the expression of gene x is experimentally altered by one unit causal networks are a well established statistical_framework for analyzing this problem in causal transcriptional_networks the nodes of a directed_acyclic dag are random_variables representing genes and their v c the author published_by we aim at distinguishing between valid and invalid effects both within multisets of effects and across subsampling runs if the causal network is known the back door criterion and other graph_based criteria can be used if the network is not known we argue that the distribution of effects across subsampling runs is helpful to estimate the true causal_effect we use estimated causal_effects from simulated_data using known causal networks to study features of the estimated cpdags and the distributions of valid causal_effects versus invalid causal_effects improved causal discovery in virtual cellular experimentsare no strict requirement to calculate causal_effects certain benign mistakes do not impede causal_effect estimation if the estimated parents fulfill the back door criterion they yield valid estimates even if they are not true parents for a given dag with edge_weights that represent direct causal_effect strengths we can generate artificial gene_expression data details are given in the supplementary_materials section we generated samples for a random dag of nodes drew subsamples of size n and ran the pcalgorithm as implemented in on each subsample resulting in cpdags from all pairs of nodes x y we calculated the multisets of possible estimated parents of x since we know the correct parents of x in the simulation scenario we can count how often the pc algorithm correctly identifies a parent set in these cases ida can derive valid causal_effects however finding the correct parent sets is a sufficient but not a necessary criterion to get valid estimates in fact every gene_set z that fulfills pearls back door criterion also yields valid causal effect_estimates in our simulations from known networks see_supplementary for details on data simulation we can verify whether an estimated parent set fulfills this criterion and count how often this is the case shows that although estimated parent sets often are not the true parents they nevertheless frequently fulfill the backdoor criterion and will hence generate valid estimates of causal_effects in other words finding the true parents is difficult whereas obtaining a set of estimated parents satisfying the back door criterion is not for example in more than of the cause effects pairs the back door criterion was fulfilled in more than of the estimated parent sets over the subsampling runs conversely there were no subsampling runs that contained at least true causal parent sets similar observations can be made when reconstructing real biological_networks supplementary this explains in part why ida and cstar are successful in spite of the poor_performance of the pc algorithm aida and cstar were applied to both simulated_datasets and two gene_expression microarray_datasets from saccharomyces_cerevisiae using the order independent implementation of the pc algorithm for the simulated_datasets true causal_effects are known from the simulation process for the microarray_datasets the target set of causal_effects is calculated as described infrom interventional experiments single knock_out strains see details in section of the supplementary_materials we presented aida a method to estimate causal_effects from observational_data in situations where we have many variables but only few observations a common situation in biology due to costs of the experiments and availability of biomaterial aida does not require any knowledge about the causal network underlying the data it uses ida in a subsampling approach to account for small_sample while ida and cstar take the comparison of the partial area_under up to false_positives for the simulated_datasets with nodes n samples a and a dense and a sparse underlying true graph respectively black bars show values for aida gray bars show values for cstar the error_bars indicate standard_errors across the datasets minimum absolute value of causal_effects from k subsampling runs aida uses the whole multisets of causal_effects the estimate for the true causal_effect is the mode of the density calculated over all estimated sets of causal_effects across k subsampling runs ida and all its extensions require among other assumptions that the multivariate_gaussian is faithful to the dag kalisch and b hlmann i e statistical conditional independencies can be inferred from the underlying dag faithfulness in general is not testable and of course there is no evolutionary selection_pressure that makes biological_networks faithful an additional limitation of all existing_approaches for causal discovery is that feedback_mechanisms cannot be captured by a dag therefore ida cstar and aida cannot replace wet_lab but are a good starting_point for experimental_design we show that aida outperforms cstar on both simulated_and with respect to the partial area under the receiver_operating roc_curve up to false_positives besides yielding improved estimates of the top candidates for intervention experiments the results on simulated_data suggest that aida performs better than existing algorithms on small_sample in summary aida improves the estimation of causal_effects from observational_data these findings_suggest aida as a useful tool for experimental_design of functional studies improved causal discovery in virtual cellular experiments
