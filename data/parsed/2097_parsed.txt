sequence_analysis gossamer a resource efficient de_novo assembler motivation the de_novo of short_read high_throughput sequencing_data poses_significant computational challenges the volume of data is huge the reads are tiny compared to the underlying sequence and there are significant numbers of sequencing_errors there are numerous software_packages that allow users to assemble short_reads but most are either limited to relatively small_genomes e g bacteria or require large computing infrastructure or employ greedy algorithms and thus often do not yield high_quality results results we have developed gossamer an implementation of the de_bruijn approach to assembly that requires close to the theoretical minimum of memory but still allows efficient processing our results show that it is space efficient and produces high_quality assemblies availability gossamer is available for non commercial use from http www genomics high_throughput have enabled researchers to produce unprecedented volumes of short_read the de_novo of such data is a core problem in bioinformatics with numerous applications in the analysis of genomes metagenomes and transcriptomes there are several common approaches to the de_novo of short_read including those based on greedy extension overlap layout extension and de_bruijn our assembler gossamer is an extension of a prototype based on the succinct representation of de_bruijn assembly graphs as a bitmap or set of integers it assembles base space paired_reads such as those from an illumina sequencing_platform
