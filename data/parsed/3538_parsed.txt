phoxtrack a tool for interpreting comprehensive datasets of post_translational of proteins we introduce phoxtrack phosphosite x tracing analysis of causal kinases a user_friendly freely_available software_tool for analyzing large_datasets of post_translational of proteins such as phosphorylation which are commonly gained by mass_spectrometry detection in contrast to other currently applied data analysis approaches phoxtrack uses full sets of quantitative proteomics_data and applies non parametric statistics to calculate whether defined kinase specific sets of phosphosite sequences indicate statistically_significant concordant differences between various biological conditions phoxtrack is an efficient tool for extracting post_translational information of comprehensive proteomics datasets to decipher key regulatory_proteins and to infer biologically_relevant molecular_pathways availability phoxtrack will be maintained over the next years and is freely_available as an online tool for non commercial use at http phoxtrack molgen mpg de users will also find a tutorial at this web_site and can additionally give feedback at https groups google com d forum phoxtrack discuss
