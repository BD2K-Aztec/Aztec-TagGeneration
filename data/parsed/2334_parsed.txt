genome_analysis identifying small_interfering loci from high_throughput small_interfering sirnas are produced from much longer_sequences of double_stranded precursors through cleavage by dicer or a dicer like protein these small_rnas play_a in genetic and epigenetic_regulation however a full understanding of the mechanisms by which they operate depends on the characterization of the precursors from which they are derived results high_throughput of small_rna populations allows the locations of the double_stranded precursors to be inferred we have developed methods to analyse small_rna sequencing_data from multiple biological_sources taking_into replicate information to identify robust sets of sirna precursors our methods show good performance on both a set of small_rna sequencing_data in arabidopsis_thaliana and simulated_datasets availability our methods are available as the bioconductor www bioconductor org package segmentseq version and above small_interfering sirnas are short rnas of nt in length cleaved from much longer double_stranded dsrna precursors by dicer or dicer like ribonucleases sirnas are known to play_a in genetic and epigenetic_regulation but a full understanding of the mechanisms by which sirnas themselves are regulated depends in part on the characterization of the dsrnas from which the sirnas derive it is clear that when two sirnas derive from the same precursor they must share at least some upstream regulatory_factors as a result the abundances and functions of the sirnas derived from the same locus may be correlated providing increased biological_information for downstream_analyses dsrnas are highly transient and not easily examined however sirnas that have been stabilized by association with some protein complex e g the rna_induced are relatively easy to characterize using one of the technologies developed for high_throughput when sirnas are derived from to whom correspondence should be addressed the same precursor dsrna we expect to see the sequenced_reads align to the genome in close_proximity to each other and with non independent abundances by looking for regions of the genome which show an abundance of reads above background_levels we can establish maps of sirna loci on a genome these loci approximate the regions of the genome from which the dsrna precursor is transcribed identification of sirna loci from high_throughput sequencing_data must address a number of issues in sequencing sirnas we generally expect to also sequence other classes of small_rnas srnas with alternative_mechanisms of production these other srnas can if they have been sufficiently characterized be filtered from the sequenced_reads alternatively they can be allowed to remain and be treated in the same way as the sirna reads as many other types of srna reads will also be generated from some longer precursor and thus appear as a locus in the worst_case these srna reads will form an additional source of background_noise within the data a degree of background_noise is expected in any case as a result of sequencing_errors and the presence of breakdown_products from longer molecules such as rrnas trnas and mrnas among other factors consequently not every sequenced read needs be associated with an srna locus the greatest difficulty in identifying sirna loci is the problem of accumulation bias within an sirna locus some of the sirnas will be stabilized by association with some protein complex and be available for sequencing while others will not high variation in the coverage of bases within an sirna locus is therefore expected with some regions within an locus containing no sequenced_reads at all these accumulation biases within sirna loci distinguish the data from those found in chip_seq and mrna seq experiments solutions to the problems of peakcalling in chip_seq and transcript discovery in mrna seq which in general depend on much more consistent_patterns of sequenced_reads aligning to the genome are thus not directly applicable to sirna locus discovery and a new set of techniques for the analysis of sirna loci is required a further difficulty is the problem of multireads sequenced_reads that match to multiple places in the genome the sirna loci show strong association with repetitive_elements such as transposons and so many sirna loci match multiple times in the genome moreover whole loci may be replicated exactly or nearly so throughout the genome and should all be identified previous attempts to identify sirna locus maps have taken a relatively naive approach to defining the loci these methods look for genomic_regions in which the number of sequenced_reads exceeds some minimum value and there exists no large_gap without an aligned sequenced read the nibls algorithm of develops this approachby examining the density of sequenced srna reads upon the genome via a graph_theoretic approach whereby srna reads are connected if the genomic_distance between them lies below some threshold and a region is considered a locus if it is sufficiently connected apart from the somewhat arbitrary nature of the thresholds used a substantial weakness of these approaches is that they allow the analysis of at most two samples neglecting replicate data existing_methods are thus unsuitable for robustly defining sirna loci from large sequencing_experiments we develop a novel set of methods for constructing sirna locus maps based on high_throughput of srnas from replicated samples coming from diverse biological conditions the aim of these methods is to split the genome into non overlapping segments of which some will be sirna loci regions from which in at least some biological condition a dsrna is expressed and produces sirnas and some will be nulls regions in which there is no sirna locus present in any observed biological condition the methods are shown to perform well on both simulated and true_biological data and represent a significant step_forward in the generation of stable sets of sirna loci from sequencing_data derived from diverse experimental_conditions we test our methods using data from samples gene_expression accession_number gse of arabidopsis_thaliana in which srnas from a variety of tissues have been sequenced there are six distinct replicate groups sets of sequenced samples that can reasonably be identified as replicates within a replicate group we expect to see replication of loci that is for a locus to be positively_identified it should appear consistently within all members of that replicate group however a locus need not appear in all replicate groups as some sirna loci will be expressed only in specific tissue_types or due to technical effects be found only in some library preparations the samples and the methods used to process them are described in supplementary_materials we next take the maps derived from the biological data and use them to estimate_parameters for simulation_studies on which we can compare the methods the empirical bayesian_approach is shown to offer substantial improvements over the heuristic methods in both biological and simulated_data
