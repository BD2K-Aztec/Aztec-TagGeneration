classifyr an r package for performance assessment of classification with applications to transcriptomics although a large collection of classification software_packages exist in r a new generic framework for linking custom classification_functions with classification performance_measures is needed a generic classification_framework has been designed and implemented as an r package in an object oriented style its design places emphasis on parallel processing reproducibility and exten sibility finally a comprehensive set of performance_measures are available to ease post_processing taken together these important characteristics enable rapid and reproducible benchmarking of alternative classifiers availability_and classifyr is implemented in r and can be obtained from the bioconductor projectclassification is an important and frequently asked question in omics work there are a large number of r packages providing a myriad of classification algorithms and tools however there are presently no packages which provide a generic framework for incorporating custom classification_functions and cross_validation cv estimation of performance_measures most cv classification errors in existing packages are provided as specific functions associated with individual classification algorithms these functions return the classification errors in differing formats hence researchers need to write wrapper functions to process the results each time they use a different function created by a different author an effective classification package should exhibit the characteristics of fast computational time reproducible results flexibility to incorporate user_defined classification_functions and post processing_tools for performance assessment there are some r packages which provide a subset of these desirable features for example sprint provides a new framework for parallelizing classification algorithms in r but requires new classification_functions to be coded in c or fortran this is challenging for users who are only proficient in r many popular r packages such as e and pamr provide classifiers but are not extensible caret is a popular framework which provides parallelization and customisable classifiers but almost no post processing_tools similar packages such as mlinterfaces cma and mcrestimate are also available from bioconductor but are also not comprehensive classification solutions an extensive list of classification packages is viewable on comprehensive_r cran to address_these a new r package classifyr is introduced it provides an implementation of a general framework for classification and provides simple ways to calculate multiple performance_measures and explore the stability of feature_selection while being easily extensible we will also illustrate an aspect of itsflexible feature_selection capability by demonstrating feature_selection in both a differential_expression de setting as well as differential variability dv the concept of dv was first introduced in ho et_al and it selects genes with different variability between two classes of interest this potentially selects different features to de and offers a different perspective for identifying interesting biomarkers the selection of dv features will be explored and classification_performance examined for dv
