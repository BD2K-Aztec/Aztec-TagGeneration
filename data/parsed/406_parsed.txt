gene_expression an r package suite for microarray meta_analysis in quality_control differentially_expressed gene analysis and pathway enrichment detection with the rapid advances and prevalence of high_throughput integrating information of multiple relevant genomic studies has brought new challenges microarray meta_analysis has become a frequently used tool in biomedical_research little effort however has been made to develop a systematic pipeline and user_friendly software in this article we present metaomics a suite of three r packages metaqc metade and metapath for quality_control differentially_expressed gene identification and enriched pathway detection for microarray meta_analysis metaqc provides a quantitative and objective tool to assist study in clusion exclusion_criteria for meta_analysis metade and metapath were developed for candidate marker and pathway detection which provide choices of marker detection meta_analysis and pathway analysis methods the system allows flexible input of experimental_data clinical_outcome casecontrol multi class continuous or survival and pathway_databases it allows missing_values in experimental_data and utilizes multi core parallel_computing for fast implementation it generates informative summary output and visualization plots operates on different operation systems and can be expanded to include new algorithms or combine different types of genomic_data this software_suite provides a comprehensive tool to conveniently implement and compare various genomic meta analysis_pipelines many high_throughput have advanced dramatically in the past_decade microarray experiment is one example that has evolved into maturity with generally consensus experimental_protocols and data analysis strategies its extensive application in the biomedical_field has led to an explosion of gene_expression studies publicly_available meta_analysis methods for combining multiple microarray_studies have been widely_applied to increase_statistical and provide validated conclusions in this article we present the metaomics software_suite that contains three unified r packagesmetaqc metade and metapathfor systematic microarray meta analysis_pipeline the metaqc package provides a quantitative and objective tool for determining the inclusion_exclusion for meta_analysis metade contains many state of the art genomic meta_analysis methods to detect differentially_expressed finally the metapath package provides a unified meta_analysis framework and inference to detect enriched pathways associated with outcome
