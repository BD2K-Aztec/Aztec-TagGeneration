bioinformatics btr tex gene_expression lspr an integrated periodicity detection algorithm for unevenly sampled temporal microarray_data we propose a three step periodicity detection algorithm named lspr our method first preprocesses the raw time series by removing the linear trend and filtering noise in the second step lspr employs a lombscargle periodogram to estimate the periodicity in the time series finally harmonic regression is applied to model the cyclic components inferred periodic transcripts are selected by a false_discovery procedure we have applied lspr to unevenly sampled synthetic data and two arabidopsis diurnal expression datasets and compared its performance with the existing well established algorithms results show that lspr is capable of identifying periodic transcripts more accurately than existing algorithms most algorithms for analyzing cell_cycle or circadian_rhythm temporal expression data require that the input signals are equally sampled for irregularly sampled time series the lombscargle periodogram has been proposed to analyze time course gene_expression data a comparison study of periodicity detection methods for irregularly sampled data concluded that the lombscargle method performed better than most existing_methods however this method is subject to noise and is not powerful for short time series in this study we propose a new periodicity identification algorithm based on the lombscargle periodogram and harmonic regression_method for unevenly sampled time series our algorithm named lspr has a similar procedure to that of the arser algorithm which was proposed to analyze evenly sampled temporal expression_profiles the main difference is that lspr uses spectrum_analysis for unevenly sampled data introduced by lomb and additionally elaborated by scargle while arser employs autoregressive spectral estimation which can only analyze evenly sampled data for a given irregularly sampled time series lspr first estimates the period by the lombscargle periodogram in the frequency_domain and then models the periodic signals by the harmonic regression_method in the time domain such a joint strategy overcomes the limitations of the lombscargle periodogram and gives better descriptions of periodic patterns by applying lspr to the analysis of synthetic data and arabidopsis diurnal expression data we found our method was more powerful in detecting periodic transcripts compared with two well established periodicity detection_algorithms
