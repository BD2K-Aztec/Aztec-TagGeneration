syncsa r tool for analysis of metacommunities based on functional_traits and phylogeny of the community components syncsa is an r package for the analysis of metacommunities based on functional_traits and phylogeny of the community components it offers tools to calculate several matrix correlations that express trait convergence assembly patterns trait divergence assembly patterns and phylogenetic_signal in functional_traits at the species pool level and at the metacommunity level availability_and syncsa is a package for the r environment under a gpl open_source and freely_available on cran official web_server for r http cran r project org comprehending how biological communities are structured in both time and space is a major_challenge for ecologists it is well known that communities are not random_samples from the species pool niche theory predicts that in order to persist in a local_community each species has to have a particular set of traits that allow it to overcome environmental filtering and to coexist with other species nonetheless considering species traits in community_ecology studies may be complicated as traits are not independent among species in the last decades functional_traits and phylogeny information have been incorporated in ecological_models in order to determine the factors responsible for creating and maintaining community_structure currently information about traits and phylogeny are available for several groups of organisms see apg furthermore recent_developments made possible novel perspectives in functional and phylogenetic_analyses of ecological data syncsa is an r package r development core team http www r project org released under open_source and freely_available from cran http cran r project org that implements the methods described in pillar and duarte andfor the comparison of ecological_communities based on functional_traits and the phylogeny of the community to whom correspondence should be addressed components the detection of phylogenetic_signal at the species pool and metacommunity levels and the testing of phylogenetic niche conservatism syncsa allows the identification of optimal trait subsets expressing trait convergence assembly patterns or traitdivergence assembly patterns in metacommunities the functions are based on the abovementioned methods and are complementary to other functions available in r for the analysis of communities which take into account traits and phylogenetic_information syncsa for r implements the same methods available in recent versions of syncsa application written in c http ecoqua ecologia ufrgs br ecoqua syncsa which was developed by v pillar and evolved from methods described in pillar and orlci
