a hierarchical statistical modeling_approach to analyze proteomic isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation data motivation isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation itraq is a widely used method in quantitative_proteomics a robust data analysis strategy is required to determine protein quantification reliability i e changes due to biological regulation rather than technical variation so that proteins that are differentially_expressed can be identified methods samples were created by mixing and mg escherichia_coli cell_lysate with mg of cell_lysate from mouse corresponding to expected relative fold changes of one for mouse proteins and from to for e coli proteins relative quantification was carried_out using eight channel isobaric tagging with itraq reagent and proteins were identified using a tripletof mass_spectrometer technical variation inherent in this itraq dataset was systematically investigated results a hierarchical statistical_model was developed to use quantitative information at peptide level and protein level simultaneously to estimate variation present in each individual peptide and protein a novel data analysis strategy for itraq denoted in short as whatraq was subsequently proposed with its performance evaluated by the proportion of e coli proteins that are successfully identified as differentially_expressed compared with two benchmark data analysis strategies whatraq was able to identify at least more true_positive proteins that are differentially_expressed further validated using a biological itraq dataset including multiple biological repli cates from varied murine cell_lines whatraq performed consistently and identified more proteins as being differentially_expressed among different cell_lines than the other data analysis strategies over the past_decade mass_spectrometry ms has become the method of choice for large_scale proteomics research to identify and quantify proteins present in different biological_contexts several techniques including isotopic_labeling and label_free methods have been developed in association with ms to monitor quantitative changes in protein expression and post_translational states the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation itraq approach is particularly of interest among isotopic_labeling methods due to its ability to analyze in vivo samples and to compare up to eight samples simultaneously in general terms the goal of an itraq experiment is to identify differentially_expressed peptides proteins as a function of different biological conditions there is a requirement for sophisticated methodologies to define significance for the observed changes in relative quantification so that changes as a result of biological regulation can be distinguished from those as a result of technical issues value to the investigators comes from focusing on identifying differentially_expressed as we describe later in the text yet identifying differentially_expressed peptides is a much simpler process a fundamental assumption for all the discussion is that peptides have been identified and itraq reporter ion intensities are available for these peptides analysis of itraq data starts from the processing of raw ms signal to match spectra to peptides and extracting the areas under itraq reporter ion peaks followed by empirical or statistical_methods to identify differentially_expressed early efforts reported for itraq data analysis included applying ad_hoc thresholds to the observed quantitative changes and using analysis_of anova to identify significant changes after fitting the observed changes with a linear_model it was proposed more recently that significance of the observed changes can be defined based on the standard_deviation of technical variation which can be estimated using technical_replicates the most recent_advance in analyzing itraq data came from the observation that peptides with lower itraq reporter ion intensities tend to suffer from larger technical variation many approaches have been proposed to address the observed variance heterogeneity and as a result to achieve more accurate protein to whom correspondence should be addressed in this work a novel data analysis strategy denoted as whatraq was proposed for the analysis of itraq proteomics datasets allowing differentially_expressed to be identified the strategy was primarily based on a novel hierarchical statistical_model that was capable of estimating technical biological_variation inherent in relative quantification of any peptide protein the model benefited from making use of quantitative information at both peptide and protein levels and estimated not only random noise as other published models do but also bias present in peptides and proteins here bias refers to the non random effect from factors such as noise from coeluting peptides and nearly isobaric peptides it was also demonstrated that biological_variation can also be modeled as biases whatraq was shown to have superior_ability in identifying proteins that were differentially_expressed due to biological regulation from changes due to technical noise compared with other benchmark data analysis strategies such as stdp and isobar biological_replicates can be modeled using whatraq resulting in an estimation of a combination of technical variation and biological_variation however such analysis was carried_out based on an assumption that the biological_variation of all proteins within the sample belonged to one unique normal distribution though the assumption was valid for the majority of the proteins many proteins could exhibit extremely_large biological_variation the invalidation of the assumption resulted in an overestimation of bias on peptides and bias on proteins which in turn reduced the number of differentially_expressed being identified on the other hand proteins with large biological_variation can also be identified by mistake as being differentially_expressed because their biological_variation was underestimated by the model we would like to argue that including an modeling a combination of technical and biological_variation the figure showed the statistical_model of a combination of technical and biological_variation at protein level bias on peptides and bias on proteins dominated the total_variation comparison with the model built up on technical variation alone demonstrated that the values of instrument noise in the two models are close whereas bias on peptide proteins nearly doubled with the additional biological_variation asterisk instrument noise was calculated at itraq reporter ion intensity equals to additional pair of technical_replicates to estimate technical variation may be the best approach to accurately identify proteins being differently expressed because it allows biological_variation to be estimated for each individual protein in large_scale studies that include multiple subjects being analyzed in multiple itraq experiments it was especially useful to include a pair of common reference samples such as pooled_samples as technical_replicates this will allow comparison of protein expression_level across different experiments e g for the purpose of estimating intersubject variation whatraq is more likely to identify proteins with higher number of peptides as being differentially_expressed however sometimes researchers are particularly interested in proteins with low expression_level which typically exhibit low number of peptides in an itraq dataset in this case an additional analysis can be carried_out to search for differentially_expressed with only a limited number of peptides using the same procedure as standard analysis present in this study such an analysis will increase the global fdr to a limited extent but provides a unique chance for proteins with low expression_level to be identified as being differentially_expressed for example the analysis on proteins with three peptides or less allowed identification of an additional five tp proteins no fp from the e coli murine dataset some proteins were identified to be changing probably as a consequence of mutant idh expression compared with the control cells_expressing wild_type idh we also showed proteins potentially expressed as a consequence of retroviral mediated_gene with an empty vector thus it was demonstrated that the methodology is applicable directly to real experiments it has been proposed in earlier publications that an intensity cutoff should be applied to eliminate peptides with low itraq reporter ion intensities because these peptides usually associate with high technical variation and provide inaccurate quantitative information in this study we tested various cutoff_values ranging from to which were derived using the technical variation model at peptide level corresponding to the standard_deviation of technical variation to be and respectively we discovered that applying intensity cutoffs provided no benefit to whatraq probably because it has already taken the uncertainty from peptides with low itraq reporter ion intensities into account supplementary instead applying intensity cutoffs can decrease the fpr of data analysis strategies that do not have technical variation models at peptide level such as stdp it has been shown that itraq quantification often underestimates fold_change due to several factors underestimation is believed to primarily be a result of reporter ion mixing from multiple coeluting peptides or nearly isobaric peptides this background effect has been reduced but not removed by increased fractionation of samples reducing fraction complexity this however is at the expense of increased analysis time another approach to eliminate the quantitative inaccuracy of isobaric tagging techniques uses ms to add an additional fractionation step to target peptide signals this is only available on ms instrumentation capable of higher_order fragmentation events and so cannot be applied in many situations therefore a model that can differentiate between genuine changes and technical variation such as the one proposed here is important for the correct identification of low_level changes in the proteome in this work we proposed a novel data analysis strategy called whatraq for quantitative_proteomics experiments using itraq based on a hierarchical statistical_model the strategy is capable of estimating technical biological_variation for each individual peptide and protein and subsequently identifying proteins that were differentially_expressed we demonstrated that the strategy was able to identify significantly_larger number of proteins as being differentially_expressed compared with two other benchmark data analysis strategies stdp and isobar
