sequence_analysis combining evolutionary_information extracted from frequency profiles with sequence_based kernels for protein_remote motivation owing to its importance in both basic_research such as molecular_evolution and protein attribute prediction and practical_application such as timely modeling the d structures of proteins targeted for drug_development protein_remote has attracted a great_deal of interest it is intriguing to note that the profile based_approach is promising and holds high potential in this regard to further improve protein_remote a key_step is how to find an optimal means to extract the evolutionary_information into the profiles results here we propose a novel approach the so_called profile_based protein representation to extract the evolutionary_information via the frequency profiles the latter can be calculated from the multiple_sequence generated by psi_blast three top performing sequence_based kernels svm ngram svm pairwise and svm la were combined with the profile_based protein representation various tests were conducted on a scop benchmark_dataset that contains families and superfamilies the results showed that the new approach is promising and can obviously improve the performance of the three kernels furthermore our approach can also provide useful insights for studying the features of proteins in various families it has not escaped our notice that the current approach can be easily combined with the existing sequence_based so as to improve their performance as well availability_and for users convenience the source_code of generating the profile_based proteins and the multiple_kernel was also provided atby march experimentally_determined protein_structures were deposited in the protein_data however this number is only about one sixth of the number of protein_sequences held in the uniprotkb swissprot database to timely use such vast amount of structure unknown protein_sequences for basic_research and drug_development it is highly desired to determine their d structures and functions by means of homology approaches unfortunately protein_remote is still a challenging_problem in bioinformatics the early methods in dealing with this problem were based on the pairwise sequence comparison approaches such as blast and smithwaterman local_alignment algorithm however in many cases this kind of sequence alignment_method failed to detect remote homologies due to the low sequence_similarities later methods to challenge this problem were based on the generative_models to induce a probability_distribution over the protein_family and then to generate the unknown_proteins as new members of the family from the stochastic_model for example the hidden_markov hmm can be trained iteratively in a semi_supervised manner by using both positively labeled and unlabeled samples of a particular family to generate the positive set recently the discriminative methods such as support_vector svm were used to address this problem by focusing on the differences between protein_families the key of the svm methods is the kernel_function by which to compute the inner product between two samples in the feature_space the most straightforward approach to generate the kernels was based on the features extracted from protein_sequences svm ngram svm pairwise and svm la were three of the most successful sequencebased kernels svm ngram was based on the feature_space that contains all short subsequence of length n in svm pairwise a protein_sequence was represented as a vector of pairwise similarities to all protein to whom correspondence should be addressed sequences in the training_set and then inner product between these vector space representations was taken as the kernel svm la measured the similarity between a pair of proteins by taking all the optimal local_alignment scores with gaps between all possible subsequences into account besides these kernels several other sequence_based kernels were also proposed such as mismatch and svm balsa the profile_based kernels could further improve the performance by using the evolutional information extracted from the profiles for example top n grams extracted the profile_based patterns by considering the most frequent elements in the profiles profile kernel extracted the short substrings according to the profile_based ungapped alignment scores some profile based_methods improved the predictive_performance by developing more sensitive profiles hhsearch method sodingsoding was based on a novel profile using the hmm in compass numerical profiles were generated to construct optimal profileprofile alignments and to estimate the statistical_significance of the corresponding alignment scores in the meantime some other features and techniques have been applied to this field to further improve the predictive_performance for instance the kernel combination methodology vbkc used a single multiclass kernel machine to combine various kernels based on different feature spaces svm physicochemical distance transformation pdt combined the amino_acid physicochemical_properties and the profile features via pdt to incorporate the local sequence_order information of the entire protein_sequences also based on the similarities between protein_sequences and natural languages the natural_language techniques were applied to this field it was shown that the performance of building_block based_methods could be improved by using the latent semantic analysis lsa moreover p rot e mbed detected protein remote homology by embedding protein_sequences into a low_dimensional semantic space as we can see from the aforementioned introduction most of the top performing methods were developed based on the features extracted from profiles this is consistent with the fact that a profile is much richer than an individual sequence in encoding information also biology is a natural science with historic dimension all biological species have developed beginning from a limited number of ancestral species it is true for protein_sequence as well their evolution involves changes of single residues insertions_and of several residues gene doubling and gene_fusion with these changes accumulated for a long period many similarities between initial and resultant amino_acid are gradually eliminated but the corresponding proteins may still share many common features such as having basically the same biological_function folding topology subcellular_location and other attributes accordingly the key to improve the performance of these methods is to find a suitable approach to extract the evolutionary_information from the profiles in view of this the current study was initiated in an attempt to propose a profile_based protein representation by extracting the evolutionary_information from the frequency profiles of the proposed remote_homology methods for studying the d structure of nck adiscriminative methods based on svm are the most effective and accurate methods for protein_remote the performance of the svm based_methods depends on the kernel_function which measures the similarity between the samples in any pair varieties of kernels based on sequence_composition have been proposed however these methods often fail to accurately_predict the proteins_sharing low_sequence recently methods using the evolutionary_information extracted from profiles achieved great success such as profile sw pssm svm top ngram and svm acc a key_step to improve the performance of these methods is in how to find a suitable approach to incorporate the evolutionary_information extracted from the profiles for prediction in this article we proposed a method that can convert the frequency profile into a series of profile_based proteins three state of the art sequence_based kernels i e svm ngram svm pairwise and svm la were selected for demonstration on a well known benchmark it was shown that the methods based on the profile_based proteins p and p achieved the best performance outperforming the original three string kernels by and respectively according to the average roc and roc scores these results are fully consistent with our previous_findings that the top two most frequent amino_acids show stronger discriminative_power than the other low frequent amino_acids in the frequency profiles further confirming that the proposed profile_based protein representation is a promising approach in extracting the evolutionary_information from frequency profiles for protein_remote it has not escaped our notice that the current approach can be easily combined with sequence_based and hence with the development of the sequence_based kernels the currently proposed method can be further improved accordingly it is instructive to point out that since the concept of pseudo amino_acid or chous pseaac was introduced in it has been successfully used to predict various attributes of proteins e g accordingly the potential would be high to develop a powerful method for protein_remote by combing pseaac with profile_based protein representation in the original pseaac it only uses three indices including the hydrophobicity index hydrophilicity index and side chain mass index because protein_remote is a more difficult problem proteins in the dataset only share low_sequence only these three indices would not be enough to capture the different properties of various proteins therefore our further research will focus on incorporating new amino_acid indices into pseaac and applying it to protein_remote
