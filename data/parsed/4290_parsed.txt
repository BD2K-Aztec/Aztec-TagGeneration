databases_and sm mir a database of the experimentally_validated small molecules' effects on microrna expression the inappropriate expression of micrornas mirnas micrornas mirnas are endogenous single_stranded and non_coding which regulate their target_genes at the post_transcriptional level through inhibiting protein_translation or degrading mrna a mirna can regulate hundreds of genes and plays_key many physiological_and such as proliferation differentiation and apoptosis the inappropriate expression of mirnas is related to many kinds of critical_illness including cancer cardiovascular_disease metabolic disease inflammatory_disease and so on various evidences are overwhelming that the abnormal expression of mirnas is the hallmark of diseases for example confirmed that mir mir mir and mir were highly_expressed by qrt_pcr in pancreatic_tumor the expression of let was significantly_reduced in colon_cancer patients compared with that in adjacent non cancerous_tissue from the same patient in addition mirnas have several attractive features to be druggable such as the specific secondary_structures and the conserved_sequences recently many studies demonstrated that small_molecules can regulate mirna_expression which indicates that targeting mirnas with small_molecules is a new type of therapy for human_diseases for example the expression levels of mirnas were changed after fluorouracil treatment in human colon cell_line through qrt_pcr detected up regulated mirnas and down_regulated mirnas after the treatment of trichostatin a in human_breast by microarray to sum up specific mirna will be treatment target for majority of diseases therefore the study of how small_molecule influence the expression levels of mirnas is very significant hitherto diverse mirna related databases have been constructed for example mirbase is the central online repository of mirna sequences and annotations microcosm targets targetscan and tarbase provide the computationally predicted or the experimentally_validated target_genes for mirnas with the progression of research on the important roles of mirnas in human_diseases several manually_curated databases about the associations of mirnas and diseases were developed such as phenomir hmdd and mir disease however the databases about how bioactive_small influence the expression levels of mirnas are quite rare the relevant_information is scattered among the massive literatures which is inconvenient for researchers to explore the relationships between small_molecules and mirnas presented the mirenvironment database to describe the complex interactions between genetic_factors and environmental_factors where a few small_molecules appeared as environment factors thus this manuscript described a curated database sm mir which offered more comprehensive_information about the small_molecules effects on mirna_expression and filled the vacancy in this field to whom correspondence should be addressed more and more evidences have proved that mirna as a treatment target is meaningful and promising and many small_molecule can achieve this purpose the restoration of the mirna_expression may cure many kinds of critical_illness the mirna based therapy may work through different ways the small_molecules can not only structurally bind to the grooves and pockets of mirnas but also target the key enzymes and other cofactors of the process of mirna synthesis or the transcription_factors of mirnas thus drug targeted protein may influence mirna_expression however mirnas are important post_transcriptional regulatory_factors and can regulate downstream protein expression even if the changed mirna_expression is the result of protein targeted treatment the mirna may be a welcome addition to the current drug_targets to provide a valuable and comprehensive resource about the influences of small_molecules on mirna_expression we manually retrieved the relationships of small_molecules and mirnas from literatures and developed the sm mir database sm mir provides detailed information about small_molecules mirnas and evidences of their relationships the development and expansion of the sm mir will continues to progress in the future the next version will incorporate more comprehensive_information and become more powerful
