sequence_analysis presto a toolkit for processing high_throughput raw_reads of lymphocyte receptor repertoires driven by dramatic technological improvements large_scale characterization of lymphocyte receptor repertoires via high_throughput is now feasible although promising the high germline and somatic diversity especially of b cell immunoglobu lin repertoires presents challenges for analysis requiring the development of specialized computational_pipelines we developed the repertoire sequencing toolkit presto for processing reads from high_throughput lymphocyte receptor studies presto processes raw sequences to produce error corrected sorted and annotated sequence_sets along with a wealth of metrics at each step the toolkit supports multiplexed primer pools single or paired_end and emerging technologies that use single_molecule identifiers presto has been tested on data generated from roche and illumina platforms it has a built in capacity to parallelize the work between available processors and is able to efficiently process millions of sequences generated by typical high_throughput projects availability_and presto is freely_available for academic use the software_package and detailed tutorials may be down loaded from http clip high_throughput now enable large_scale characterization of lymphocyte receptor repertoires rep seq rep seq studies have used a variety of next_generation including roches and illuminas genome_analyzer researchers are now beginning to take advantage of newer platforms such as the miseq offered by illumina which can generate million paired_end automatic file segregation into their workflow for distributed_processing on cluster computing_resources a detailed_description of each presto tool is provided in the supplementary_material summarized in supplementary table s example datasets with step_by tutorials covering the workflows illustrated incan be found on the presto website
