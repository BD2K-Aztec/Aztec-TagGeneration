genome_analysis cruzdb software for annotation of genomic_intervals with ucsc_genome database motivation the biological_significance of genomic_features is often context dependent annotating a particular dataset with existing external data can provide insight into function results we present cruzdb a fast and intuitive programmatic interface to the university of california santa_cruz ucsc_genome that facilitates integrative analyses of diverse local and remotely hosted datasets we showcase the syntax of cruzdb using microrna binding_sites as examples and further demonstrate its utility with three biological discoveries first dna replication_timing is stratified in gene regionsexons tend to replicate early and introns late during s phase second several non coding variants associated with cognitive_functions map to lincrna transcripts of relevant function suggesting potential function of these regulatory_rnas in neuronal diseases third lamina associated genomic_regions are highly_enriched in olfaction related genes indicating a role of nuclear organization in their regulation availability cruzdb is available at https github com brentp cruzdb under the mit open_source biological_significance of many genomic and epigenomic features is context dependent recently large_scale integrative projects such as the encyclopedia of dna elements encode_project encode have systematically_analyzed the regions of active_transcription gene_regulation and chromatin patterns in the genome even though decades of research provided insights into many individual functional_elements integrative analyses have presented a systems level picture that could not be captured previously moreover these integrative projects have highlighted that biological_function of certain features can be appreciated in the context of other genomic and epigenomic features in the genomic neighborhood systematic presentation of large_scale datasets from the encode and other projects in the university of california santa_cruz ucsc_genome has enabled individual investigators to analyze their local data in the context of these already available features already we are beginning to see the utility of such a community_wide integration of diverse datasets and their role in uncovering new facets of basic biology and clinical research researchers routinely use publicly_available datatables from the encode_project and many other large_scale projects from the ucsc_genome which also allow programmatic_access to much of the information used on that site via its public mysql servers even so there exists no user_friendly computational framework that allows integration of multiple in house and publicly_available data tables and parallelized context dependent analyses of the integrated datasets today in the era of the genome the analysis we believe that such a computational framework can increase the speed and efficiency of integrative analyses in many areas of biomedical_research we present cruzdb a programmatic interface to the genome data resources from ucsc that offers a simple parallelizable and intuitive syntax to address common use cases including annotation and spatial querying we first describe the design_features of cruzdb flexibility of the user_interface and potential utilities we present example code from the library and then describe four diverse findings that we made using cruzdb we have showcased the programmatic interface of cruzdb using mirna_binding as motivation and further demonstrated its utility using three biological examples the biological examples and their cruzdb code demonstrate the simple syntax and the potential of this utility to facilitate hypothesis driven studies although the examples we have shown are in human version hg cruzdb can be used for any organism and version available in the ucsc database by using for example dm as the initializer although previous_studies higher_order organization of dna replication_timing patterns in the human_genome our observation that replication_timing patterns correlate with intronexon structures reveals a finer scale stratification of dna_replication patterns within gene regions lincrnas play major regulatory_roles in different biological_processes in neuronal and other tissue_types but their role in complex cognitive traits and diseases has not been systematically assessed yet we report several instances where disease associated variants overlap with lincrnas with relevant biological_functions our findings combined with the recent study showing a lower incidence of snps within lincrnas highlight the importance of examining gwas hits in this context finally integrating data on lads and protein_coding we find that olfactory_receptor genes are highly_enriched in the lads our findings are consistent with a recent report that nuclear clustering of olfactory_receptor genes governs their monogenic expression and that laminb receptor induced changes in nuclear architecture influence singular transcription pattern of the olfactory_receptor genes further work needs to be done to validate this work and to demonstrate the broader impact of our findings in each of these four biological cases in detail we aim to pursue them outside the scope of this method article nevertheless the four examples outline the broad utility of cruzdb and its applications in diverse areas of biomedical_research we have introduced cruzdb a parallelizable and intuitive programmatic interface with ucsc_genome that allows integrative context dependent analyses of diverse local and remotely hosted datasets as well as annotation and spatial querying some of the functions that make cruzdb a library of broad and general_utility are the feature_extraction fast queries and simple syntax using the library one can mirror the ucsc databases to a local sqlite or mysql_database perform location based queries and perform integrative analyses combining local and remotely hosted features we have shown how to create a local copy of selected tables is a single_line of code and how having that local copy improves the speed of later analyses
