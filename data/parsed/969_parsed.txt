databases_and chromohub a data hub for navigators of chromatin mediated signalling the rapidly increasing research activity focused on chromatin mediated regulation of epigenetic_mechanisms is generating waves of data on writers readers and erasers of the histone code such as protein methyltransferases bromodomains or histone_deacetylases to make these data easily_accessible to communities of research_scientists coming from diverse horizons we have created chromohub an online resource where users can map on phylogenetic_trees disease associations protein_structures chemical_inhibitors histone substrates chromosomal_aberrations and other types of data extracted from public_repositories and the published_literature the interface can be used to define the structural or chemical coverage of a protein_family highlight domain_architectures interrogate disease relevance or zoom in on specific genes for more detailed information this open_access resource should serve as a hub for cell biologists medicinal chemists structural biologists and other navigators that explore the biology of chromatin signalling availability http www thesgc org chromohub chromatin mediated control of gene_expression and cell_fate is regulated in part by distinct combinations of post_translational on histone_proteins predominantly methylation or acetylation of lysine or arginine side_chains at the n_terminal tails of histones alteration of this histone code can lead to diseases states and chemical inhibition of proteins that write read or erase histone_marks represents a promising_avenue to restore to normal level diseaseassociated gene_expression following the clinical validation of this strategy with histone_deacetylase hdac_inhibitors writers readers and erasers of histone_marks constitute emerging therapeutic_target classes for a variety of to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as disease conditions consequently a dramatic_increase in research activity has been observed in the field the rapidly_growing body of heterogeneous data generated by diverse communities of scientists is in part accessible through public_repositories or the published_literature but retrieving the data is time consuming at best for the non specialist will a cell biologist know where to find what small_molecule are available for his protein of interest and what their ic s are will a medicinal chemist easily retrieve all compounds co crystallized with her protein target will a biochemist know which somatic aberration buried in vast cancer_genomics databases is linked to the protein he is characterizing we have built a database that integrates such heterogeneous data types extracted from multiple repositories and the published_literature a simple yet powerful web_interface allows research_scientists coming from diverse horizons who are interested in writers readers and erasers of the histone code to interrogate this database through phylogenetic representations of each protein_family the interface is freely_available and should promote crosspollination between diverse communities of scientists interested in epigenetic signalling the online user_interface is based on phylogenetic representations of protein_families involved in writing reading and erasing histone_post users can choose between phylogenetic classification derived from multiple_alignments of fulllength sequences or sequences of the domain after which the family was named thumbnails of phylogenetic_trees for each protein_family can be clicked to display larger images once a tree is selected the sequence_alignment used to generate the tree can be downloaded checkboxes can be selected to map a diverse_array of data on the tree of interest information on the data source is provided in a window that pops up when hovering over aicon next to the checkbox once a checkbox is selected associated symbols are shown next to each protein for which data is available more information is then accessible by hovering over or clicking on the symbol of interest users can easily navigate the functional structural and chemical landscape of each protein_family they can display functional summaries for each gene on the trees list structures in the protein databank covering each gene and map them on linear representations of the protein where pfam domains are highlighted display small_molecule co crystallized with any protein or retrieve chemical_inhibitors reported in the published or patent literature they can see the number of entries in pubmed for each gene and inspect disease associations automatically inferred from pubmed records users can easily access chromosomal_aberrations linked to cancer tissue expression data sub cellular_location or histone substrates images can be saved on the desktop and embedded in presentations newcomers in the field can search for potential collaborators by looking for research_laboratories with active funding on their gene of interest the explosion of research activity on epigenetic signalling and recent technological breakthroughs in genome_scale biology are providing a wealth of data related to writers readers and erasers of histone_marks the open_access resource that we have developed should help research_scientists involved in chromatin biology rapidly find data that inform their research
