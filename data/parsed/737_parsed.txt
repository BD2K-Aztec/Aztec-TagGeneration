bioblend automating pipeline analyses within galaxy and cloudman we present bioblend a unified api in a high_level language python that wraps the functionality of galaxy and cloudman apis bioblend makes it easy for bioinformaticians to automate end_to large data analysis from scratch in a way that is highly accessible to collaborators by allowing them to both provide the required infrastructure and automate complex analyses over large_datasets within the familiar galaxy environment availability_and http bioblend readthedocs org with the continuous influx of high_throughput genomic sequencing_data automation of complex analyses has become essential to reduce repetitive effort by researchers genomics increasingly involves running computationally_intensive analyses each of which may take days over large_numbers of samples these analyses use a broad landscape of tools and usually require the skills of both biologists and bioinformaticians galaxy is a popular application for bioinformatics_analysis it provides a web_based interface that allows interactive analysis and visualization of large complex data while automatically tracking all the analysis steps it is thus an excellent tool for designing analyses recording provenance and facilitating collaboration between bioinformaticians and biologists however the graphical point and click interface is less than ideal for the execution of the resulting pipelines over large_numbers of samples or for handling complex sample dependent workflow logic to remedy this galaxy also offers a programmatic api this makes it possible to i use galaxy to design an analysis in a visual and integrated setting ii automate reuse of the created pipeline in a flexible scripted manner and iii retain all of the results in galaxys interactive environment in addition to a framework for composing pipelines there is a need for computational infrastructure capable of doing the processing and data storage in a scalable manner galaxy supports the notion of executing entirely within a cloud_computing environment via the cloudman platform the cloudman platform enables a complete deployment of galaxy including the galaxy application itself the underlying bioinformatics command_line and the reference data to be easily provisioned and managed on a cloud infrastructure cloudman works with amazon openstack opennebula and eucalyptus based clouds and can be used with applications other than galaxy cloudman also exposes an api through which it can be programmatically manipulated allowing provisioning and scaling of the compute platform for automated parallelized pipeline processing currently the galaxy and cloudman apis are available as http based rest interfaces which are arguably difficult for bioinformaticians to discover and interact with most bioinformaticians are comfortable writing automation scripts in a highlevel scripting language they are typically much less interested in writing direct http requests or using low_level constructs with that in mind we have developed a python_library for galaxy and cloudman called bioblend that provides a highlevel interface for interacting with the two applications this promotes faster interaction with those applications facilitates reuse and sharing of scripts and eases collaboration between bioinformaticians and biologists extensive api documentation is provided for the library while the source_code repository contains specific examples
