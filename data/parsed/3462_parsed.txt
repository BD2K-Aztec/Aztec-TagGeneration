systems_biology pathway processor a web_resource for pathway based analysis of high_throughput data pathway processor is a web_application designed to analyze high_throughput datasets including but not limited to micro array and next_generation using a pathway centric logic the advance of high_throughput methods particularly because of the advent_of ngs provides an unprecedented amount of data from a single experiment although analysis method handling such data has considerably improved comparing and especially integrating results between different platforms and analysis systems is still a challenge for these reasons there is a need for newer_methods able to handle this type of data effectively and in a robust manner in recent_years pathway based_approaches have emerged as a way to compare integrate and interpret results from different omics experiments in particular pathway based_approaches can be useful methods to investigate complex phenotypes the main advantage of these methods is a greater ease of interpretation and increased comparability among different experiments methodologies and platforms methods using pathways have evolved considerably as well starting from the classical fishers test over more complex systems such as gene_set and impact analysis in addition newer_methods have been proposed which target rna_seq specifically in addition to microarrays one of these is the gene_set variation analysis gsva which shifts the focus from gene_expression to pathway expression through the generation of enrichment_scores although methods like the fishers test are commonly available in bioinformatics software more advanced algorithms are often just part of customized software pipelines and as such are not potentially useful to biologists also a part of this software was developed with microarrays in mind and while most algorithms are platform agnostic often adapting them to newer_technologies requires a considerable effort here we describe pathway processor a substantial upgrade over the original pathway processor introduced in developed as a web_based software pathway processor aims at using pathway based_approaches on omics_data to extract meaningful and biologically sound information to support the biological hypothesis being tested to do so it offers well established statistical_methods in addition to a new method to calculate differential pathway expression between two user supplied phenotypes
