utopia documents linking scholarly literature with research data the typhoon of technological_advances witnessed during the last decade has left in its wake a flood of life_science data and an increasingly impenetrable mass of biomedical_literature describing and analysing those data importantly the modern frenzy to gather more and more information has left us without adequate tools either to mine the rapidly increasing data and literature collections efficiently or to extract useful knowledge from them to be usable information needs to be stored and organized in ways that allow us to access analyze and annotate it and ultimately to relate it to other information unfortunately however much of the data accumulating in databases and documents has not been stored and organized in rigorous principled ways consequently finding what we want and crucially pinpointing and understanding what we already know have become increasingly difficult and costly tasks a group of scientists for whom these problems have become especially troublesome are biocurators who must routinely inspect thousands of articles and hundreds of related entries in different databases in order to be able to attach sufficient information to a new database entry to make it meaningful with something like peer_reviewed publishing around million articles per year it is simply not possible for curators to keep abreast of developments to find all the relevant papers they need to locate the most relevant facts within them and simultaneously to keep to whom correspondence should be addressed pace with the inexorable data deluge from ongoing high_throughput biology projects i e from whole_genome for example to put this in context bairoch estimates that it has taken years to manually annotate about half of swiss prots entries a painfully small number relative to the size of its parent resource uniprotkb the uniprot which currently contains million entries hardly surprising then that he should opine it is quite depressive to think that we are spending millions in grants for people to perform experiments produce new knowledge hide this knowledge in a often badly written text and then spend some more millions trying to second guess what the authors really did and found the work of curators and indeed of all researchers would be far easier if articles could provide seamless access to their underlying research data it has been argued that the distinction between an online paper and a database is already diminishing however as is evident from the success_stories of recent initiatives to access and extract the knowledge embedded in the scholarly literature there is still work to be done some of these initiatives are outlined below the royal_society of chemistry rsc took pioneering steps towards enriching their published content with data from external resources creating computer readable chemistry with their prospect software they now offer some of their journal_articles in an enhanced html form annotated using prospect features that may be marked up include compound names bio and chemical ontology_terms etc marked up terms provide definitions from the various ontologies used by the system together with inchi iupac international chemical identifier codes lists of other rsc articles that reference these terms synonym lists links to structural formulae patent information and so on articles enriched in this way make navigation to additional information trivial and significantly increase the appeal to readers in a related project the chemspider journal of chemistry exploits the chemmantis system to mark up its articles http www chemmantis com with the chemspider database at its heart chemmantis identifies and extracts chemical names converting them to chemical_structures using name to structure conversion algorithms and dictionary look ups it also marks up chemical families groups and reaction types and provides links to wikipedia definitions where appropriate in an initiative more closely_related to the life_sciences febs letters ran a pilot_study with the curators of the mint interaction_database focusing on integration of published proteinprotein_interaction and posttranslational_modification data with information_stored in mint and uniprotkb key to the experiment was the structured digital
