assessing the local structural quality of transmembrane_protein models using statistical_potentials qmeanbrane motivation membrane_proteins are an important class of biological_macromolecules involved in many cellular key_processes including signalling and transport they account for one third of genes in the human_genome and of current drug_targets despite their importance experimental structural data are sparse resulting in high_expectations for computational modelling tools to help fill this gap however as many empirical methods have been trained on experimental structural data which is biased towards soluble globular_proteins their accuracy for transmembrane_proteins is often limited results we developed a local model quality estimation method for membrane_proteins qmeanbrane by combining statistical_potentials trained on membrane protein_structures with a per residue weighting_scheme the increasing number of available experimental membrane protein_structures allowed us to train membrane specific statistical_potentials that approach statistical saturation we show that reliable local quality estimation of membrane_protein models is possible thereby extending local quality estimation to these biologically_relevant molecules availability_and source_code and datasets are available on request protein modelling plays_a in exploring sequence structure relationships when experimental_data are missing modelling techniques using evolutionary_information in particular homology comparative modelling developed into standardized pipelines over recent_years an indispensable ingredient of such a pipeline is the accuracy estimation of a protein model directly providing the user with information regarding the range of its possible applications in this context global model_quality tools are important for selecting the best model among a set of alternatives whereas local model estimates assess the plausibility and likely accuracy of individual amino_acids various techniques have been developed to address_this with consensus methods and knowledge based_approaches showing best results in blind assessments consensus approaches require an ensemble of models with structural variety reflecting alternative conformations in contrast knowledge based_methods such as statistical_potentials can be applied to single models but are in general less accurate than consensus methods and exhibit strong dependency on the structural data they have been trained on the unique physicochemical_properties of biological_membranes give rise to interactions that are energetically discouraged in soluble_proteins and vice_versa however most scoring_functions using knowledge based_methods have been trained on soluble_proteins thus they perform poorly when applied to models of membrane_proteins this specific but highly_relevant important aspect of protein model_quality has received only little attention in recent_years with the growing amount of available high_resolution membrane protein_structures the template situation for homology_modelling procedures is improving quickly and even more important for this work it is gradually becoming possible to adapt knowledge based_methods to this class of models as a result of such efforts we present qmeanbrane a combination of statistical_potentials targeted at local quality estimation of membrane_protein models in their naturally_occurring oligomeric_state after identifying the transmembrane_region using an implicit solvation model specifically trained statistical_potentials get applied on the different regions of a protein model figs and to overcome statistical saturation problems a novel approach for deriving statistical_potentials from sparse training data has been devised we have benchmarked the performance of the approach on a large heterogeneous test_set of models and illustrate the result on the example of alignment errors in a transmembrane model investigating function and interactions in membrane_proteins is an active field of research with modelling techniques as an important tool to bridge the gap when structural data are missing comparative modelling_methods automatically profit from the increased number of available experimental membrane_structures which can be used to build models for membrane_proteins however most knowledge basedinsertions are marked black and deletions are marked white second bar shift of the insertion towards the n terminus in front of helix third bar shift of insertion towards the n terminus in between helices and fourth bar shift of the insertion towards the c terminus
