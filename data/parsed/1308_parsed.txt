delishus an efficient and exact algorithm for genome_wide detection of deletion polymorphism in autism motivation the understanding of the genetic_determinants of complex disease is undergoing a paradigm_shift genetic_heterogeneity of rare_mutations with deleterious_effects is more commonly being viewed as a major component of disease autism is an excellent example where research is active in identifying matches between the phenotypic and genomic heterogeneities a considerable portion of autism appears to be correlated with copy_number which is not directly probed by single_nucleotide snp_array or sequencing_technologies identifying the genetic_heterogeneity of small_deletions remains a major unresolved computational_problem partly due to the inability of algorithms to detect them results in this article we present an algorithmic framework which we term delishus that implements three exact algorithms for inferring regions of hemizygosity containing genomic deletions of all sizes and frequencies in snp_genotype we implement an efficient backtracking algorithmthat processes a billion entry genome_wide snp matrix in a few minutesto compute all inherited deletions in a dataset we further extend our model to give an efficient algorithm for detecting de_novo deletions finally given a set of called deletions we also give a polynomial time algorithm for computing the critical_regions of recurrent deletions delishus achieves significantly_lower false_positive and higher power than previously_published algorithms partly because it considers all individuals in the sample simultaneously delishus may be applied to snp_array or sequencing_data to identify the deletion spectrum for family_based studies using formulation delishus computes all inherited or de_novo deletions with maximal clique size above a user_defined threshold and then ranks them according to a number of different properties work in progress focuses on further validation_studies and the prioritization of small recurrent deletions with the most support for experimental wet_lab validation in dr morrows laboratory however researchers may want to find deletions that are large and rare instead of small and recurrent delishus is adaptable to this type of inference by essentially mimicking the behavior of thealgorithm by restricting edges to within trio only furthermore statistical rankings are also supported by this framework after potential deletions are called statistical and discrete quantities may be used to score and rank the deletions based on for example parent of origin effects which have been shown to be associated to autism other examples of quantities to use for scoring include linkage_disequilibrium allele_frequencies size of deletion and number of evidence sites while we have found formulation to be the most useful it only considers the case for which an error might convert a normal inheritance pattern to a however all potential conversions between deletion categories are possible formulation represents an alternative to formulation which models deletions and genotyping_errors without the usage of a threshold regardless of the formulation there may still be other types of errors in snp data such as technical_artifacts producing completely erroneous snps these are usually filtered in a preprocessing qc step but it is often advantageous to allow delishus to process the pre qc data for example a small snp deletion that is associated to the phenotype of interest could mimic the behavior of a technical artifact and should not be removed prior to running delishus as sequencing becomes cheaper and the sequencing of thousands of individuals becomes feasible delishus may prove to be a reliable source for calling small_deletions genome_wide at a higher_resolution than array data for example the genomes_project is currently sequencing the genomes of hapmap individuals some of the hapmap individuals sequenced belong to parentchild trios and pairs when this full sequence_data becomes available delishus can be used on the snp call data to validate previous calls in the hapmap data
