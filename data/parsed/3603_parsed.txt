pon sol prediction of effects of amino_acid on protein solubility motivation solubility is one of the fundamental protein properties it is of great interest because of its relevance to protein expression reduced solubility and protein_aggregation are also associated with many diseases results we collected from literature the largest experimentally_verified solubility affecting amino_acid aas dataset and used it to train a predictor called pon sol the predictor can distinguish both solubility decreasing and increasing variants from those not affecting solubility pon sol has normalized correct prediction ratio of on cross_validation and for independent test_set the performance of the method was compared both to solubility and aggregation predictors and found to be superior pon sol can be used for the prediction of effects of disease related substitutions effects on heterologous recombinant_protein expression and enhanced crystallizability one application is to investigate effects of all possible aass in a protein to aid protein_engineering availability_and pon sol is freely_available structure bmc lu se pon sol the training and test data are available atnumerous experimental methods are used to investigate variations affecting protein_function structure and properties in addition computational_approaches are increasingly utilized for predicting effects and mechanisms of variations solubility has been of great interest because of its relevance to protein over expression reduced solubility and protein_aggregation are associated with many human_diseases solubility is very important also for protein structural studies solubility and aggregation are related but different physical concepts solubility means concentration in saturated solution where the soluble_protein is in equilibrium with solid_phase protein in solid_phase may be made soluble by dilution in case of aggregation protein is in solid_phase but this process is typically accompanied by changes to protein_structure integrity and or modification aggregation is an irreversible process occurring for example in alzheimers_disease and systemic amyloidoses during the last decade computational_methods have been developed to predict protein solubility especially for heterologous protein overexpression these methods utilize different approaches typically in the field of machine_learning much less effort has been put on predicting the effects of variations to protein solubility it is well known that amino_acid aass can have profound effects on solubility and lead to diseases including severe complex v deficiency and cataract until now two tools have been released for such predictions optsolmut and camsol we designed a layer rf predictor called pon sol that classifies the variants into three classes in the first step it predicts whether the variants lead to increased solubility or not then the variants that do not increase solubility are classified into those that decrease or have no effect on solubility five features were informative for increase no increase classifier and eight for decrease no effect classifier supplementary the normalized cpr of pon sol is and in fold_cross cv and blind_test respectively supplementary tables s and s note that the result for a random predictor would be as there are three classes we tested the performance of two previously_published camsol correctly_predicted variations out of with normalized cpr optsolmut requires d protein_structure variations in our cv dataset which were not used to train optsolmut could be mapped to protein d structures variations were correctly_predicted by optsolmut with normalized cpr supplementary we tested also some general solubility and aggregation predictors whether they could predict the protein solubility effects due to the substitutions we compared the predicted solubility scores for the normal and variant sequences supplementary these results are similar to the dedicated tools optsolmut and camsol and clearly worse than for pon sol in the blind_test pon sol also has the best performance among the tested methods supplementary
