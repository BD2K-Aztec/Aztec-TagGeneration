generation of sequence_based data for pedigree segregating mendelian or complex_traits motivation there is great interest in analyzing next generation sequence_data that has been generated for pedigrees however unlike for population_based data there are only a limited number of rare_variant methods to analyze pedigree data one limitation is the ability to evaluate type i and ii errors for family based_methods due to lack of software that can simulate realistic sequence_data for pedigrees summary we developed rarepedsim rare_variant pedigree based simulator a program to simulate region gene level genotype and phenotype data for complex and mendelian traits for any given pedigree structure using a genetic model sequence variant data can be generated either conditionally or unconditionally on pedigree members qualitative or quantitative phenotypes additionally qualitative or quantitative_traits can be generated conditional on variant data sequence_data can either be simulated using realistic population demographic models or obtained from sequence_based studies variant sites can be annotated with positions allele_frequencies and functionality for rare_variants rarepedsim is the only program that can efficiently generate both genotypes and phenotypes regardless of pedigree structure data generated by rarepedsim are in standard linkage file ped and variant call vcf formats ready to be used for a variety of purposes including evaluation of type_i and power for association methods including mixed models and linkage_analysis methods currently there is great interest in analyzing next generation sequence ngs_data generated for pedigrees for mendelian traits gene identification is far from complete and performing linkage_analysis can greatly_increase the ability to identify causal_variants for complex_traits pedigree based studies differ from population_based design i e better control of population_stratification and potentially more powerful to detect associations particularly for rare_variants due to causal allele enrichment however only a limited number of methods have been developed to analyze pedigree sequence_data e g extended fbat multimarker test rv tdt seqlinkage one bottleneck is the lack of available software to realistically generate rare_variant pedigree data to evaluate type_i to compare statistical_power of association and linkage methods and aid in the design of studies through the evaluation of sample_size for sufficient power although there are a number of programs that simulate common_variants for pedigrees they are not useful for ngs association and can simulate sequence_based genotype and phenotype data for rare_variants however their focus is on generating data for unrelated_individuals although seqsimla can also generate sequence_data for pedigrees it is strictly limited to complex_traits and a three generational family_structure with a fixed number of individuals per generation rarepedsim was developed to simulate region gene level genotype data and phenotypes for complex and mendelian pedigrees regardless of structure to evaluate type_i variant data can be generated using mendelian segregation independent of the phenotype data for evaluating power where the trait is linked associated with causal_variant s variant data are generated conditional on the phenotypes for mendelian traits mode of inheritance penetrance and phenocopies are incorporated in the model for complex_traits an odds_ratio model is implemented while for quantitative_traits a linear_model is used phenotype data for mendelian complex and quantitative_traits can also be generated conditional on the simulated variant data rarepedsim output_files are in standard linkage and vcf formats rarepedsim can generate data with allelic and locus heterogeneity as well as with errors and missing genotypes rarepedsim is written in python and c and provides a userfriendly command_line the program provides key functionalities to generate region gene based genotype pedigree data conditional or unconditional on phenotypes the generated data are ready to be used for evaluating type i and ii errors for both familybased association methods including mixed models and parametric and nonparametric linkage methods rarepedsim can be used by researchers to efficiently generate pedigree variant data without having to develop special software ultimately rarepedsim will facilitate the development of novel methods to analyze rare_variant generation of sequence_data for pedigreespedigree data for a variety of genetic etiologies and aid in the design of studies
