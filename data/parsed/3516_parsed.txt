pgp parallel prokaryotic proteogenomics pipeline for mpi clusters high_throughput batch clusters and multicore workstations we present the first public release of our proteogenomic annotation_pipeline we have previously used our original unreleased implementation to improve the annotation of diverse prokaryotic_genomes by discovering novel genes post_translational and correcting the erroneous annotations by analyzing proteomic mass_spectrometry data this public version has been redesigned to run in a wide_range of parallel linux computing environments and provided with the automated configuration build and testing facilities for easy deployment and portability availability_and source_code is freely_available from https bitbucket org andreyto proteogenomics under gpl license it is implemented in python and c it bundles the makeflow engine to execute the workflows our pipeline is a tool for improving the existing genomic_annotations from available proteomics mass_spectrometry data as most genome annotation_pipelines consist of automated gene_finding they lack experimental_validation of primary structure having to rely on dna centric sources of data such as sequence_homology transcriptome mapping codon frequency etc by incorporating the orthogonal set of data proteogenomics is able to discover novel genes post_translational and correct the erroneous primary sequence annotations the protocol and the large_scale application of our original pipeline to taxonomically diverse genomes were reported in the implementation was tightly_coupled with the internal computation services framework vics at the j craig venter institute jcvi vics has never been deployed outside of the jcvi and the pipeline itself required manual configuration and building by the developers it could only use sun_grid sge batch queuing system configured for high_throughput computing htc mode in which large_numbers of serial jobs could be efficiently scheduled on a compute cluster for these reasons the original pipeline has not been made public to create the first open_source release presented here we have redesigned the pipeline to run in a wide_range of parallel linux computing environments high_performance hpc clusters which are set up to efficiently schedule only large s of cores parallel message_passing mpi jobs under a control of batch queuing system such as sun_grid sge and its clones simple linux utility for resource management slurm or portable batch system pbs torque our primary targets for this use case were compute clusters of xsede https www xsede org the federation of supercomputers supported by the us national_science xsede allocates its resources to outside researchers through a peer_reviewed proposal system the biologists will be able to use our software on this major computational resource high_throughput computing htc clusters widely used as local bioinformatics computing_resources these clusters are configured to efficiently schedule large_numbers of serial jobs under a control of batch queuing system a single multi core workstation without a batch queuing system including an extreme case of single core machine the volume of computations in proteogenomics is relatively high with cpu hours for a typical bacterial_genome our pipeline performs such annotation in h of wall clock time on htc cluster we have now designed a fully_automated installation procedure preconfigured for several types of specific target systems and easily_adaptable to others through editing of a few configuration files although several other proteogenomic packages have been developed in recent_years they were designed for execution on a single workstation none of the other publications matched the breadth of application reported for our pipeline in the output_files from that study are available at http omics pnl gov pgp overview php the contributed refseq updates can be seen in the genbank flat files gbk of the corresponding genomes at the ncbi wherever the proteomics_data are listed to whom correspondence should be addressed
