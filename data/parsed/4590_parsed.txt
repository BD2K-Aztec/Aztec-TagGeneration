the discordant method a novel approach for differential correlation motivation current differential correlation methods are designed to determine molecular_feature that have the largest magnitude of difference between correlation_coefficients these methods do not easily capture molecular_feature that experience no correlation in one group but correlation in another which may reflect certain types of biological_interactions we have developed a tool the discordant method which categorizes the correlation types for each group to make this possible results we compare the discordant method to existing_approaches using simulations and two biological_datasets with different types of omics_data in contrast to other methods discordant identifies phenotype related features at a similar or higher rate while maintaining reasonable computational tractability and usability availability_and r code and sample data are available at https github com siskac many strategies exist for analyzing high_throughput omics_data in order to explore the complexity that differentiates biological groups the most common analysis is differential_expression which is defined by molecular_features that experience large changes in expression or abundance between groups in addition to differential variance i e groups may not have different mean levels but dissimilar variance another analysis that may be relevant is differential correlation or coexpression dc which is the change of association of molecular_feature between groups e g healthy and disease these differential associations may indicate molecular_interactions that characterize or reflect biological or disease_state examples of dc can be found in both low and high_throughput studies for instance one study using chromatin_immunoprecipitation determined the effect of mutant p on wild_type p in the cell mutated p reduces the binding of wild_type p to the p response_element of p mdm and pig causing dc of p and these targets between samples with wild_type p and mutant p another study using elisa and a lymphoproliferation assay determined that patients with treated paracoccidioidomycosis had correlation between interleukins and tumor_necrosis but there was no correlation in untreated patients larger_scale have identified dc to study how transcription_factors can influence the expression of a transcript in a myeloma study transcription_factor coexpression with genes in pathways was found to be different between the two major_subtypes of myeloma another transcriptomic study that examined expression differences between lean and obese siblings found that negr is a central hub in obesity related dc networks dc has been investigated with a myriad of approaches these methods have been reviewed recently the classical method by fisher transforms the correlation_coefficients into z scores and then determines the statistical dissimilarity between the two groups linear_models have been shown to be effective however there are deficiencies when there is large differences in variability between groups which may be relevant when examining omics_data from different types of platforms and or data from humans or non experimental model systems it has been shown that large_variability results in incorrect slope estimates furthermore slope estimates can be different depending on what feature is considered the dependent or independent variable in the linear_model alternative_methods use bayesian_models for example bradley et_al uses pathway_information as a prior which can be beneficial for identification but pathway_knowledge can also be incomplete very few pathway_databases combine interactions between multiple types of molecular_features except for kegg kanehisa dawson et_al implemented ebcoexpress which uses empirical_bayes estimation and returns a posterior_probability of differential_coexpression for each pair of molecular_features another statistical_method to determine dc is the expected conditional f statistic which modifies the f statistic from analysis_of for multiple groups the f statistic was adapted to determine molecular_feature that share the least variance instead of single features that share dissimilar mean across groups other methods use partial correlations hierarchical_clustering principal_component and other models to determine dc modules rather than individual pairs although these types of analyses are informative they only describe the average behavior of molecular_features instead of specific pairs missing from all of these methods is categorizing the different types of dc scenarios commonly referred to as binning where each pair is categorized into all possible paired correlation scenarios the following are different examples i group group ii group group iii group group example is an extreme version of dc where the correlation is in opposite_directions between groups example also illustrates dc except that in group the correlation is zero finally example is where there is no dc because the correlation is in the same direction for both groups most methods are well suited to detect molecular_feature with a pattern similar to example i e cross but are less likely to identify dc molecular_feature with a pattern similar to example i e disrupted molecular_feature in example could be biologically_relevant since they indicate an interaction in one group that is disrupted in the other group in this work we develop a method that uses binning to not only improve the identification of molecular_feature that exhibit more significant cross dc as in example but also disrupted dc as in example our method is based on a mixture_model originally developed to assess whether microarray_experiments could be combined we have altered the application of this method to determine dc of molecular_feature between groups and have named it the discordant method using the em_algorithm the discordant method estimates a posterior_probability for each possible paired correlation scenario to achieve binning binning increases power since it identifies all possible dc pairs rather than the most extreme other advantages of the discordant method are computational tractability and ease in choosing initial parameters we compare our method to fishers method linear interaction models and ebcoexpress with simulations to assess specificity and sensitivity for all three methods we also use the cancer_genome tcga glioblastoma mirna and transcriptomic_data and chronic_obstructive copd metabolomic and transcriptomic_data as a biological_validation of the methods we applied dc analysis to simulations and biological data to identify the ability for each method to determine true_positives defined by the simulations and identify pairs that have been previously validated in the respective phenotype p values and posterior_probabilities are not directly comparable therefore molecular_feature were ranked by statistical_significance for comparison by the respective value depending on the method and ranked lists i e in order of increasing p values and decreasing posterior_probabilities we have presented the discordant method for identifying dc pairs discordant categorizes the paired coexpression scenarios by binning enabling it to determine more dc pairs than the other methods and improves power of detecting disrupted interactions binning not only improves_performance for the discordant method but also facilitates biological_interpretation of results as seen in discordant identifies more disrupted dc pairs than ebcoexpress and fisher a trend also found in the simulations supplementary discordant also identifies more significant phenotype related feature pairs in general for both gbm and copd the gbm dataset produced more significant dc results for phenotype related features than the copd dataset the gbm validation_set is well curated because there are experimentally_validated mirnas involved in gbm whereas for copd there is less known about the molecular_pathways the sphingolipid related genes and metabolites were determined by annotation for being in sphingolipid pathways because there is limited experimental_data for specific genes and metabolites despite the challenges of the copd dataset we did observe that sphingolipid metabolite gene_pairs were identified earlier in discordant than ebcoexpress and fisher and that there were more sphingolipid metabolite gene_pairs in the top pairs in discordant than ebcoexpress and fisher both gbm and copd have promising results of known and novel targets from discordant this confirms discordants ability to identify phenotype related biological_processes and indicates the potential that discordant can produce further testable_hypotheses a similar method is to apply linear_models with interaction_terms one of the benefits of linear_models is that it assumes conditional normality instead of joint normality meaning that the dependent_variable can be non normal linear_models identified gbm related mirna pairs in earlier ranks than discordant in the gbm data but linear_models can be difficult to use since it is unclear what should be the dependent and independent variable we explored this by switching mirna and transcript as the dependent and independent variable and we found it changed the results we also found that the ranks of unique gbm related mirna pairs were different between the two analyses it is highly suggested to only use linear_models if it is known what is the independent and dependent_variable such as mirna and transcript respectively in terms of run time fisher is notably faster than the rest of the methods ebcoexpress is the slowest and linear and discordant only differ slightly supplementary the big o notation for fisher is linear o n where n is the number of feature pairs for the linear interaction model and discordant it is polynomial o n and o n n the big o notation for ebcoexpress is not as simple to identify since there are nested em algorithms ebcoexpress runs about fold longer than discordant in the gbm and copd datasets and it also requires a grid approach to determine hyperparameters although discordant does not run faster than fisher and its run time is comparable to linear interaction models it still performs either equally or better with consistent results there are some limitations to discordant we assume independence between pairs which is not true since features show up in multiple pairs this assumption is critical to reducing computational_complexity and has been made by others appropriate sample_size is necessary for discordant or any other dc method to work effectively to accurately estimate r between two features finally the model assumes there are three gaussian components in the mixture_model to explore the gaussian assumption we suggest that users apply the r package mixtools or lcmix which can assess alternative or non parametric densities assuming the gaussian case we then recommend users to first run a mixture model_fitting method such as mclust on each group to check that there is more than one mixture component k by comparing the bayesian information content bic for different values of k for the simulations and gbm we found evidence of k while for copd there was less evidence data not shown which is not unexpected considering the more challenging nature of that dataset future_directions for the discordant method is to add more classes and that would contain correlation_coefficients that were highly negative and highly positive to identify cases where there is a stronger linear_association in one group versus the other a challenge with adding these extra classes is that increasing the number of classes and parameters also increases complexity which means longer run time we also want to investigate using discrete data such as counts from rna_seq experiments overall when investigating dc pairs discordant performs well with respect to usability and accuracy ebcoexpress the most analogous method to discordant was not originally developed to investigate large omics_datasets so it is possible that it could be optimized for that purpose the fisher method has short run time but does not perform as well as similar methods linear interactions terms are effective but should only be used when the dependent and independent variable are known when used to integrate different types of omics_data the discordant method fills in the drawbacks to all of these methods in addition to providing a binning of results for easier interpretation
