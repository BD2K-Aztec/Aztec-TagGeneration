bam matcher a tool for rapid ngs sample matching the standard method used by high_throughput genome_sequencing facilities for detecting misla belled samples is to use independently generated high_density data to determine sample identity however as it has now become commonplace to have multiple samples sequenced from the same source such as for analysis of somatic variants using matched tumour and normal samples we can directly use the genotype_information inherent in the sequence_data to match samples and thus bypass the need for additional laboratory_testing here we present bam matcher a tool that can rapidly determine_whether two bam_files represent samples from the same biological source by comparing their genotypes bam matcher is designed to be simple to use provides easily inter pretable results and is suitable for deployment at early_stages of data_processing pipelines availability_and bam matcher is licensed under the creative commons by attribution license and is available from https bitbucket org sacgf bam matcher sample mislabelling or mix up is a common problem particularly in projects and facilities that have high sample_throughput with several recent_studies placing the error_rate at around when working with next_generation ngs_data a mislabelled sample can lead to incorrect data_processing and analysis resulting in conflicting_results or false conclusions even if the error is identified valuable data resources have typically been wasted delaying analysis or diagnosis a common practice in major genome centres is to use custom high_density panels to generate a snp profile for each sample and snp panels specifically_designed for sample identification have recently become available commercially the principle behind these panels is to provide an independently generated snp profile of each sample that can be used for sample matching comparison of binary sequence_alignment bam_files http samtools github io hts specs by comparing the sample genotypes at pre determined genomic_locations bam matcher has the following features first it is easy to use and can be deployed at early_stages of processing pipelines second bam matcher is very fast by limiting genotype_calling to predetermined positions a comparison between two samples can be made in min using the provided default set of variants intel_xeon e ghz as bam matcher caches sample genotype data subsequent comparisons involving previously calculated samples can be much faster s thus significantly_reducing overall processing time for large cohorts third bammatcher is flexible it can compare different types of ngs_data including whole_genome wgs whole_exome wes and rna_sequencing rna_seq if an appropriate genome reference and suitable list of snps are provided bammatcher can also be used for non human_genomes
