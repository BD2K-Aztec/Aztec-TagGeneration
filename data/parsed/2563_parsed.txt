systems_biology ipeap integrating_multiple omics and genetic data for pathway_enrichment a challenge in biodata analysis is to understand the underlying phenomena among many interactions in signaling_pathways such study is formulated as the pathway_enrichment which identifies relevant pathways functional enriched in high_throughput data the question faced here is how to analyze different data types in a unified and integrative way by characterizing pathways that these data simultaneously reveal to this end we developed integrative pathway_enrichment platform ipeap which handles transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics and gwas data under a unified aggregation schema ipeap emphasizes on the ability to aggregate various pathway enrichment results generated in different high_throughput experiments as well as the quantitative_measurements of different ranking results thus providing the first benchmark platform for integration comparison and evaluation of multiple types of data and enrichment_methods availability_and ipeap is freely_available atas the advent of post genomic era omics science and highthroughput technology have generated massive data quantitative methods are developed to better relate the underline pattern of the data to biologic concepts like gene_ontology biological_functions or pathways and so forth among them biochemical_pathways are the primary_focus and they are extensively used to interpret biological data in a network viewpoint in particular pathway overrepresentation and enrichment_analyses have become important approaches for the interpretation of data from various high_throughput experiments which aim at projecting a set of genes proteins or metabolites onto predefined groups calculating significance of correlation for each group and then ranking them according to the statistic correlation statistics can be defined in many ways and various pathway_enrichment algorithms were proposed like overrepresentation analysis gene_set network_topology based_approaches spia deap and so forth with rapid accumulation of massive and various types of omic and genetic data the major_challenge for pathway analysis now becomes how to analyze different types of data for a given experiment in a unified way and interactively mining the underline functions under these data simultaneously for a given set of samples multiple types of high_throughput data such as the transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics and genome_wide gwas data can be generated at the same time these data describe the samples from different perspectives and each of them can be complementary to each other to obtain the unbiased enrichment pathway list there are a few works existed on the integrative pathway analysis like integrative gwas and gene_expression analysis in prostate_cancer impala mape and so forth but traditionally only one pathway enrichment algorithm or one specific integration method was provided to the best of our knowledge integrative benchmark platforms allowing multiple enrichment and integration algorithms to handle multiple omic and genetic data together with easy to use user_interface are absent to tackle the multiple data_integration problem we presented a software ipeap namely integrative pathway_enrichment platform to perform integrative pathway_enrichment it is a java_based user_friendly graphical tool with the aim of integrating transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics and gwas data for pathway level analysis furthermore various state of art pathway_enrichment algorithms for the single data type as well as the quantitative evaluation measurements and tools for pathway ranking were incorporated into ipeap which are useful for the access evaluation and comparison of different approaches in one platform
