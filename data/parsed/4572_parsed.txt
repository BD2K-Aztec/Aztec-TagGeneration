genetics_and the bayesian_lasso for genome_wide despite their success in identifying genes that affect complex disease or traits current genome_wide gwass based on a single snp analysis are too simple to elucidate a comprehensive picture of the genetic_architecture of phenotypes a simultaneous analysis of a large number of snps although statistically challenging especially with a small number of samples is crucial for genetic modeling method we propose a two stage procedure for multi snp modeling and analysis in gwass by first producing a preconditioned response variable using a supervised principle_component and then formulating bayesian_lasso to select a subset of significant snps the bayesian_lasso is implemented with a hierarchical_model in which scale mixtures of normal are used as prior distributions for the genetic effects and exponential priors are considered for their variances and then solved by using the markov_chain mcmc_algorithm our approach obviates the choice of the lasso parameter by imposing a diffuse hyperprior on it and estimating it along with other parameters and is particularly powerful for selecting the most relevant snps for gwass where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations results the new approach was examined through a simulation_study by using the approach to analyze a real_dataset from the framingham_heart we detected several significant genes that are associated with body_mass bmi our findings support the previous results about bmi related snps and meanwhile gain new insights into the genetic control of this trait recent genotyping technologies allow the fast and accurate collection of genotype data throughout the entire_genome for many subjects by genome_wide gwass the genetic_variants associated with a complex disease or trait their chromosomal distribution and individual effects can be identified gwass are based on either casecontrol cohorts to test the to whom correspondence should be addressed associations between snps and diseases or population cohorts to estimate genetic effects of snps on traits in both cases there are hundreds of thousands of snps genotyped on samples involving thousands of subjects this typical problem having the number of predictors far exceeding the number of observations makes it impossible to analyze the data using traditional multivariate_regression in current gwass simple univariate linear_regression that analyzes one snp at a time is usually used and by adjusting for multiple_comparisons the significance_levels of the detected genes are then calculated these single snp based gwass have been instrumental for reproducibly detecting significants genes for various complex_diseases or traits however such strategies have three major disadvantages limiting the future applications of gwas first because most complex_traits are polygenic a single snp analysis can only detect a very small portion of genetic_variation and also may not be powerful for identifying weaker associations second different genes may interact with each other to form a complex network of genetic_interactions which cannot be characterized from a single snp analysis third many gwass analyze genetic_associations separately for different environments such as males_and and then make an acrossenvironment comparison in genetic effects this analysis is neither powerful nor precise for the identification of geneenvironment interactions because of these limitations many authors have developed various approaches for simultaneously analyzing multiple_snps for gwass although most approaches focus on casecontrol cohorts there is a daunting need on the development of a variable_selection model to identify snps with significant effects on quantitative_traits in population cohorts and estimate all selected predictors simultaneously traditionally a subset of predictors in a regression_model is obtained by forward selection backward elimination and stepwise selection but these approaches are computationally_expensive and unstable even when the number of predictors is not large recently alternative_approaches have been developed including ridge_regression bridge regression least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso elastic_net and the smoothly clipped absolute deviation scad penalty for the number of variables much larger than that of subjects as commonly seen in gwass proposed a two stage procedure for variable_selection by first suppressing the high_dimensionality of response into its low_dimensional representation and then finding a subset of predictors that can predict the suppressed response a similar two stage approach was also developed by page when the number of predictors p is much larger than the number of observations n highly regularized approaches such as penalized regression_models are needed to identify non zero coefficients enhance model predictability and avoid over fitting the l penalized_regression or lasso is such one of the most popular techniques in this article we presented a bayesian_hierarchical with lasso penalties to simultaneously fit and estimate all possible genetic effects associated with all snps in a gwas adjusting for both discrete and continuous covariates lasso penalties are imposed on the additive and dominant effects and implemented by assigning double exponential priors to their regression_coefficients it shrinks small effects toward zero and produces sparse solutions in this framework snps with significant genetic effects can be identified more accurately we fit the model in a fully bayesian_approach employing the mcmc_algorithm to generate posterior samples from the joint posterior_distribution which can be used to make various posterior inferences although computationally_intensive it is easy to implement and provides not only point_estimates but also interval estimates of all parameters the bayesian_lasso treats tuning parameters as unknown hyperparameters and generates their posterior samples when estimating other parameters this technique avoids the choice of tuning parameters and automatically accounts for the uncertainty in its selection that affects the estimation of the final model in contrast standard lasso algorithms usually select tuning parameters by k fold_cross which involves partitioning the whole dataset and refitting the model many times this process may result in unstable tuning parameter_estimates in order to improve the performance of lasso when p is greater than n preconditioning is considered before variable_selection preconditioning encourages the principal_components of a reduced design matrix to be highly_correlated with the response and thus in most cases only the first or first few components tend to be useful for prediction it denoises the response variable so that variable_selection becomes more efficient our simulation demonstrated that when p greatly exceeds n preconditioned bayesian_lasso could successfully_identify almost all the snps with true genetic effects by analyzing real_data our approach is shown to produce biologically_relevant results for example the approach detected a significant snp ss at position of chromosome associated with bmi it is interesting to note that this snp is within kb of the foxa forkhead_box a gene an important genetic_variant that regulates obesity one simulation example ofimplies that in the context of gwass snps that are marginally independent of the phenotype could be screened out by preconditioning but can be identified by standard variable_selection techniques such as lasso or bayesian_lasso in theory if snps are correlated with the phenotype through marginal correlations we believe the preconditioning step is worthwhile to identify more important snps however in reality since different snps may display interactions this approach may not work perfectly in any case this two step variable_selection procedure should always be advantageous over a single snp analysis because we are always testing the marginal correlation between the predictor and response when one snp is analyzed at a time motivated by park anddeveloped the bayesian_lasso and demonstrated the diabetes data with p and n we applied the bayesian_lasso to the high_dimensional regression_problem and improved it by preconditioning we have concentrated on the preconditioned bayesian_lasso method for continuous trait in gwass the proposed preconditioning procedure and mcmc_algorithm can be readily extended to survival data analysis and lasso penalized logistic_regression in casecontrol disease gene_mapping also we may look for genegene_interaction effects after identifying main effects as suggested by the model with a capacity to identify epistatic_interactions will enables geneticists to decipher a detailed picture of the genetic_architecture of a complex_trait funding nsf nih mathematical biology
