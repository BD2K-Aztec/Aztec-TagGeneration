search and clustering orders_of than blast motivation biological sequence_data is accumulating rapidly motivating the development of improved high_throughput methods for sequence classification results ublast and usearch are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence_databases at exceptionally_high speeds they are often orders_of than blast in practical_applications though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower uclust is a new clustering method that exploits usearch to assign sequences to clusters uclust offers several advantages over the widely used program cd_hit including higher speed lower memory use improved_sensitivity clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets availability binaries are available at no charge for non commercial use atbiological sequence_data is accumulating more quickly than the growth in computing efficiency predicted by moores law which motivates the development of improved highthroughput methods computational sequence_analysis often begins by classifying sequences by reference to a database or by de_novo classification clustering which is used to predict homology and function reduce redundancy generate subsets that are tractable for more computationally_expensive methods compare data from different environments and quantify ecosystem diversity central to most such classification methods is a sequence_search algorithm such as blast which has been widely_adopted for its high_speed and sensitivity i compared ublast and usearch to ncbi_blast v using pfam a v and rfam v two large sequence family databases containing m protein_domains and k rnas respectively in each case sequences were extracted at random to use as a query and the remainder used as a search database and supplementary as a simple model of a classification task only the top hit was considered which was designated as a true false_positive if it belonged to the same different family as the query though sequences in different families may in fact be homologous on this test ublast was faster than megablast with significantly_higher sensitivity faster than blastn with similar sensitivity and faster than blastp with comparable sensitivity above the protein twilight zone id to illustrate typical improvements achieved by uclust compared to the widely used program cd_hit the most efficient previous clustering method a set of pyrosequencing reads of length nt was taken from a recent microbial_ecology study and clustered at representative identities uclust produced higher quality clusters enabled clustering at lower identities usedthreshold size average cluster_size bigger is considered better sim average identity between a cluster member and its representative sequence higher is considered better time cpu time mem maximum amount of ram used by the program experiments were performed on a commodity laptop computer with gb ram default options were used for both programs except to specify the identity threshold and the amount of available memory cluster_size is divided by for set b to allow direct comparison with a the size and similarity are comparable showing that cluster quality is only slightly degraded when processing the huge number of sequences in set b ublast and usearch introduce a new search paradigm that seeks one or a few good hits rather than all hits in order to improve throughput this approach is well suited to next generation sequence classification where search is often a critical bottleneck in analysis low ranking hits are rarely needed and may even be undesirable due to increased overhead the user can tune the trade_off between speed and sensitivity by adjusting parameters that control how many candidate hits are examined before the search is terminated speed and sensitivity are thus strongly_dependent the data and program options in typical applications usearch typically achieves good sensitivity at around identity and above for amino_acids and for nucleotides ublast is sensitive to more distant relationships with useful sensitivity extending into the twilight zone for proteins blastp has significantly better sensitivity at lower identities which is partly due to refinements of the blast algorithm not yet implemented in ublast and also the problem that some distantly_related proteins have no perfectly conserved words of the required length ublast and usearch require memory that is roughly the size of the database which is sometimes more than blast but in most cases is readily accommodated by currently available commodity computer hardware uclust is definitively superior to cd_hit it is usually significantly_faster uses significantly less memory can cluster at lower identities and is more sensitive while cd_hit often fails to identify the closest cluster or overlooks that a match is possible false_negative uclust rarely misses a match and in most cases finds the best possible match uclust also enables rapid clustering of much larger numbers of sequences ublast usearch and uclust can dramatically reduce the resources_required for classification of large sequence_sets and will therefore be of value to biologists in a wide_range
