databases_and lncanet pan cancer co expression network for human lncrna and cancer_genes thousands of human long_non lncrnas have been identified in cancers and played_important in a wide_range of tumorigenesis however the functions of vast_majority of human lncrnas are still elusive emerging studies revealed that the expression_level of majority lncrnas shows discordant expression pattern with their protein_coding neighbors in various model_organisms therefore it may be useful to infer lncrnas potential biological_function in cancer development by more comprehensive functional views of co expressed cancer_genes beyond mere physical proximity of genes to this aim we performed thorough searches and analyses of the interactions between lncrna and non neighboring cancer_genes and provide a comprehensive co expression data resource lncanet in current version lncanet contains the pre_computed significant co expression pairs of lncrnas and well classified cancer_genes in matched tcga samples in detail we integrated cancer gene_lists from public database and calculate the co expression with all the lncrnas in tcga cancer_types separately based on the resulted co expression networks we identified common regulatory pairs related to extracellular_space shared in cancers we expect lncanet will enable researcher to explore lncrna expression pattern their affected cancer_genes and pathways biological_significance in the context of specific cancer_types and other useful annotation related to particular kind of lncrna cancer gene interaction availability_and http long_non lncrna refers as non coding transcripts longer than bases and are abundant in various normal and cancer tissues rather than being regarded as transcriptional noise there is emerging evidence that lncrnas play_important in regulation of gene_expression through influencing chromatin_modification transcriptional complexes targeting mrna_splicing protein_translation however most lncrnas are poorly_annotated and their functions including their roles in complex_diseases have not been widely studies as shown_inand b a typical cancer gene entry contains seven categories information by clicking the label general information expression lncrna regulation mutation homolog and interaction on the top for the pre_computed co expression pattern between cancer_genes and lncrnas user can obtain the correlation_coefficients and the corrected statistical p values in addition the expression plots of the corresponding lncrnas were also integrated from mitranscriptome database all the co expression networks are available to browse and download separately for advanced integrative study based on the pre_computed results of co expression pairs in cancers we found thousands of co expression pairs are shared in cancers for example pairs associated with lncrnas and cancer_genes are common in all cancers the gene cd has been co expressed with lncrnas across cancers based on the functional analysis we found cancer_genes are mainly located extracellular_space related to cell_adhesion corrected enrichment p supplementary table s and of them are clusters of differentiation cds which deserve the further experimental_validation on the relationship of cd molecules and lncrna
