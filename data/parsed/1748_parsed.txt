genetics_and fast and accurate imputation of summary_statistics enhances evidence of functional enrichment motivation imputation using external reference_panels e g genomes is a widely used approach for increasing power in genome_wide and meta_analysis existing hidden_markov hmm_based imputation approaches require individual_level genotypes here we develop a new method for gaussian imputation from summary association_statistics a type of data that is becoming widely available results in simulations using genomes g data this method recovers of the effective_sample for common and low_frequency variants increasing to when summary linkage_disequilibrium information is available from target samples versus the gold_standard of for hmm_based imputation which cannot be applied to summary_statistics our approach accounts for the limited sample_size of the reference_panel a crucial step to eliminate false_positive associations and it is computationally very fast as an empirical demonstration we apply our method to seven casecontrol phenotypes from the wellcome_trust wtccc data and a study of height in the british_birth bc gaussian imputation from summary_statistics recovers of the effective_sample as quantified by the ratio of association_statistics compared with hmm_based imputation from individual_level genotypes at the published single_nucleotide snps in the wtccc bc height data in addition for publicly_available summary_statistics from large meta_analyses of four lipid traits we publicly release imputed summary_statistics at g snps which could not have been obtained using previously_published and demonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the data we show that g imputation using our approach increases the magnitude and statistical_evidence of enrichment at genic versus non genic loci for these traits as compared with an analysis without g imputation thus imputation of summary_statistics will be a valuable_tool in future functional enrichment_analyses genome_wide gwas are the prevailing approach for finding disease risk_loci having successfully identified thousands of variants associated to complex phenotypes an important component of the gwas analysis toolkit is genotype_imputation an approach that leverages publicly_available data e g genomes g to estimate genotypes at markers untyped in the study to increase power for finding new risk_loci in addition to gwas genotype_imputation is a key_component in meta_analysis of studies that use different genotyping_platforms where single_nucleotide snps that were genotyped in one study can be imputed in the other studies thus increasing the association power many approaches for genotype_imputation have been proposed with methods based on hidden_markov hmm showing the highest_accuracy in simulations and empirical data however privacy and logistic constraints often prohibit access to individual_level genotype data thus precluding hmm_based imputation whereas summary association_statistics are becoming widely available for example summary_statistics are required to be publicly released for any gwas published in nature genetics and have been to whom correspondence should be addressed publicly released for many traits in this work we propose methods for testing association at snps untyped in the study when only summary association_statistics are available at the typed snps unlike hmm_based imputation from individual_level genotypes our proposed approach_requires only the association_statistics at typed variants as input to accomplish this we approximate the distribution of association_statistics at a given locus using a multivariate gaussian previous_studies that a gaussian approximation of linkage_disequilibrium ld leads to accurate inference across a wide_range of problems in particular highlighted the potential utility of gaussian imputation_methods for individual_level and pooled data but that study did not provide methods or software for imputation from summary association_statistics see section through extensive simulations based on g data we show that our approach is almost as powerful as the gold_standard of hmm_based imputation from individual_level genotypes and is able to avoid an increase in false_positive associations by accounting for the limited size of the reference_panel our approach recovers of the effective_sample for common and low_frequency variants versus for hmm_based imputation with a reduction in running time of several orders_of when summary information on the pairwise ld_structure among typed variants in gwas samples is made available as is also recommended in other contexts our method recovers of the effective_sample again with no increase in false_positive associations we validate our approach using real gwas data from wellcome_trust wtccc across seven phenotypes as well as a height gwas from the birth_cohort bc where we show that gaussian imputation from summary_statistics recovers the same signal as hmm_based imputation from individual_level genotypes with no increase in false_positive for example we attain an average association statistic of as compared with for hmm_based imputation at the published snps in the wtccc data and versus for hmm_based imputation at the published snps in the bc height data for publicly_available summary_statistics from large metaanalyses of four lipid traits triglycerides tg total_cholesterol tc high_density hdl and low_density ldl we publicly release imputed summary_statistics at g snps which could not have been obtained using previously_published we validate the accuracy of the imputed statistics across the four studies using a masking approach and show that we attain a correlation of to masked summary_statistics for common low_frequency variants consistent with simulations finally we explore the utility of imputed association_statistics to functional_enrichment for the four lipid traits we find that imputed data increase the magnitude and statistical_evidence of enrichment at genic versus non genic loci as compared with an analysis without g imputation
