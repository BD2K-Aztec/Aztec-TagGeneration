varsim a high_fidelity and validation framework for high_throughput genome_sequencing with cancer applications varsim is a framework for assessing alignment and variant_calling accuracy in high_throughput genome_sequencing through simulation or real_data in contrast to simulating a random mutation spectrum it synthesizes diploid genomes with germline and somatic_mutations based on a realistic model this model leverages information such as previously_reported mutations to make the synthetic genomes biologically_relevant varsim simulates and validates a wide_range of variants including single_nucleotide small_indels and large structural_variants it is an automated comprehensive compute framework supporting parallel computation and multiple read simulators furthermore we developed a novel map data_structure to validate read_alignments a strategy to compare variants binned in size ranges and a lightweight interactive graphical report to visualize validation results with detailed statistics thus far it is the most comprehensive validation tool for secondary analysis in next_generation availability_and code in java and python along with instructions to download the reads and variants is atdue to the lack of ground_truth for real_data simulation is a common approach for the evaluation of high_throughput sequencings secondary analysis ranging from alignment to variant_calling an early attempt to perform validation without simulation is given in however their attempt involved extensive biological_experiments and does not cover the full spectrum of variants we present the first integrated pipeline that provides complete validation of secondary analysis through simulation as well as analysis with real_data most tools simulate variants but no single tool simulates the full spectrum of variants from small variants to all types of structural_variations svs rsvsim we demonstrated varsims completeness in both simulation and validation by simulating na s personal genome with small variants from genome in a bottle giab high_confidence regions and with svs from genomes and dgv reads were generated at coverage the accuracy on the simulated reads was similar to the accuracy from the illumina platinum genome reads of na see supplementary methods and b present some benchmarking results on snvs and small_deletions for all variant_calling comparisons we used the alignments from bwamem after realignment and recalibration with gatk unless otherwise specified novoaligns alignments were used directly as input to haplotype caller without realignment and recalibration as recommended by the authors in this case novoalign performed slightly worse in comparison to bwa mem for small_deletions haplotype caller performed the best when compared to both unified genotyper and freebayes especially for larger deletions the results on sv deletions from several popular sv calling tools are shown in the three tools represented three different methods for sv callingsplit read read_depth and paired_end all tools performed well for moderatesized deletion svs only breakdancer paired_end was able to recover larger sv deletions however it was not able to recover exact breakpoints all tools failed to adequately recover deletion svs in the smaller range when comparing somatic analysis tools mutect was superior to the other tools especially when the tumor allele_frequency was low additional analysis of secondary and somatic analysis tools based on the simulated na genome are provided in the supplementary_material
