genome_analysis pathgroups a dynamic data_structure for genome reconstruction problems motivation ancestral gene_order reconstruction problems including the median problem quartet construction small phylogeny guided genome halving and genome aliquoting are np_hard available heuristics dedicated to each of these problems are computationally_costly for even small instances results we present a data_structure enabling rapid heuristic solution to all these ancestral_genome reconstruction problems a generic greedy_algorithm with look ahead based on an automatically generated priority system suffices for all the problems using this data_structure the efficiency of the algorithm is due to fast updating of the structure during run time and to the simplicity of the priority scheme we illustrate with the first rapid algorithm for quartet construction and apply this to a set of yeast genomes to corroborate a recent gene sequence_based phylogeny many comparative_genomic problems require the reconstruction of unknown genomes more specifically their gene orders starting from knowledge of one or more given contemporary genomes these include the inference of ancestral_genomes as part of the small phylogeny problem and its archetypical cases the median and quartet problems based on three or four given genomes respectively these also include the genome halving el and genome aliquoting problems based on a single_genome where every gene is duplicated or in a gene_family of size m the idea being to infer the immediate pre polyploid ancestor there are various hybrid problems such as guided genome halving ggh which combines genome halving with phylogenetic_inference or small phylogeny on unequal genomes which integrates missing_data considerations in addition there are also problems where one or more current rather than ancestral genomes lacking full gene_order gene orientation or affected by paralogy or high levels of gene_order error are to be completed or corrected based on comparative evidence we do not study this latter group of problems here having previously shown how to leverage the minimization inherent in rearrangement distance definitions in order to optimally complete or correct the genomes the computational status of most of the ancestral reconstruction problems have been reviewed inand in a recent textbook with few exceptions such as genome halving or multichromosomal breakpoint median they are np_hard problems especially the more realistic versions nevertheless with high_demand from the phylogenetics community a great variety of exact and heuristic_algorithms have been developed some of which are in wide use at the heart of many of these methods especially those that find or at least seek a most economical solution in terms of genomic distances is the strategy of maximizing the number of cycles in the breakpoint graph or its dual the adjacency graph while reconstructing the unknown genome in this article we propose a data_structure that is designed entirely for this type of strategy pathgroups is a compact and flexible way of storing partially completed cycles so that genome_wide greedy searches allowing look ahead strategies and problem specific constraints are rapidly executed and the database rapidly updated pathgroups is readily adapted to virtually all the gene_order reconstruction problems and indeed its virtues can be appreciated by studying the basic steps in such procedures as diverse as genome halving el and the median problem the procedure handles constraints on the reconstructed genomes e g exact tetraploidy in genome halving problems efficiently a key_advantage of the method is that its running time depends only on genome_size and not the rearrangement distances among the input genomes while run time of other reconstruction methods are highly dependent on the distance in this article after formalizing a number of ancestral reconstruction tasks we present the basic_structure of pathgroups and show how it is adapted to all of the problems in particular we use it in a new heuristic to efficiently search for a solution to the quartet problem as applied to a number of yeast gene orders we show that gene_order data confirm the phylogeny previously_obtained from gene sequence_data page
