gene_expression transcriptome_assembly and isoform expression_level estimation from biased rna_seq motivation rna_seq uses the high_throughput to identify and quantify transcriptome at an unprecedented high_resolution and low_cost however rna_seq are usually not uniformly_distributed and biases in rna_seq post great challenges in many applications including transcriptome_assembly and the expression_level estimation of genes or isoforms much effort has been made in the literature to calibrate the expression_level estimation from biased rna_seq but the effect of biases on tran scriptome assembly remains_largely results here we propose a statistical_framework for both transcrip tome assembly and isoform expression_level estimation from biased rna_seq using a quasi multinomial distribution model our method is able to capture various types of rna_seq biases including positional sequencing and mappability biases our experimental_results on simulated and real rna_seq exhibit interesting effects of rna_seq biases on both transcriptome_assembly and isoform expression_level estimation the advantage of our method is clearly shown in the experimental analysis by its high_sensitivity and precision in transcriptome_assembly and the high concordance of its estimated expression levels with quantitative_reverse data availability cem is freely_available atrna seq or deep_sequencing of rnas takes the advantage of recent high_throughput methods to detect and quantify transcriptomes the rna_seq technology is becoming a standard and fundamental protocol in transcriptomic research and has successfully been applied to study different organisms diseases and cancers various bioinformatics algorithms and tools have been developed for rna_seq including read_mapping and junction discovery the expression_level estimation of genes isoforms and differential_expression transcriptome_assembly from mapped_reads e g or de_novo e g etc despite the success of these rna_seq applications many challenges remain in the analysis of rna_seq one of which comes from the understanding and handling of biases in rna_seq the term bias refers to the non random non uniform_distribution of the sequenced fragments or reads across the involved isoforms or messenger_rna mrna_transcripts in an rna_seq experiment both positional and sequencing biases are routinely observed in rna_seq experiments positional bias is the non uniform_distribution of reads over different positions of a transcript while sequencing bias refers to the distribution of reads related to the sequence content and priming method since many next_generation applications including rna_seq require the mapping of reads to the reference_genome the mappability bias is also an important source of biases in rna_seq and chip_seq the mappability bias arises when read_counts are biased due to read_mapping for example some reads may not be mapped due to sequencing_errors and some applications discard reads_mapped to the repeat regions of the reference_genome the numbers of reads are thus under counted for these regions also incorrect read_mapping leads to incorrect read_counts for regions where the involved reads are mapped to biases in rna_seq may cause inaccurate expression_level estimation of genes or isoforms where most bias correction methods try to overcome for example positional biases are handled by learning non uniform read distributions from given rna_seq or modeling the rna degradation in srivastava and chen a generalized poisson gp model is used to calculate the expression levels of genes affected mainly by sequencing biases other approaches include checking the repeat regions of the reference_genome to handle mappability biases modeling the dependency between neighboring positions to correct sequencing biases or a combination of several strategies however some methods can handle only one specific type of biases e g or correct biases only at the gene level other more general methods use sophisticated probabilistic generative_models that require the learning of a large number of parameters and thus have to to whom correspondence should be addressed make some simplifying assumptions to make the computation tractable besides expression_level estimation the rna_seq biases also have significant effects on transcriptome_assembly for example rna_seq biases may generate gap regions on the reference_genome where no mapped_reads are observed because of these gaps two broken transcripts may be assembled instead of one complete transcript also incorrectly mapped_reads may lead to incorrect transcript assemblies as far as we know most work in the literature concerning rna_seq biases deal with correcting gene or isoform expression_level estimation and the effects of biases on the transcriptome_assembly remain_largely in this article we propose a statistical_framework based on the quasi multinomial distribution model to capture the above_mentioned rna_seq biases including positional sequencing and mappability biases the framework allows us to develop an expectation_maximization em_algorithm for both transcriptome_assembly and isoform abundance level estimation from biased rna_seq compared with other algorithms in the literature that use sophisticated probabilistic generative_models to handle biases our em_algorithm uses a single_parameter to capture the property of rna_seq biases of different types utilizing the isoform enumeration algorithm of isolasso the em_algorithm assembles isoforms and estimates their abundance levels at the same time moreover both principles of prediction_accuracy and interpretation or sparsity considered inare achieved in the assembly the statistical_framework and the em_algorithm are introduced in sections and we demonstrate the superior_performance of our em_algorithm compared with other algorithms in the literature through simulated and real rna_seq experiments and analyze the effects of rna_seq biases on both transcriptome_assembly and isoform abundance level estimation due to the page limit we defer some figures and technical derivations to the supplementary_materials in this section we test the algorithm on both simulated and real rna_seq and compare its performance with two state of the art algorithms for transcriptome_assembly and isoform abundance level estimation that do not consider rna_seq biases i e isolasso and cufflinks and a recent extension of cufflinks that takes biases into account for convenience we will refer to the last algorithm simply as cufflinks bias to our best knowledge cufflinks bias is the only algorithm in the literature that considers rna_seq biases and is capable of assembling transcriptome note that although slide was published after isolasso and cufflinks we do not compare with it here because it was only tested on drosophila_melanogaster transcriptome in during the comparison study the parameters of all programs are tuned empirically to achieve their best performance
