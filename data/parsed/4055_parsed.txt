gene_expression robust biclustering by sparse singular_value incorporating stability_selection motivation over the past_decade several biclustering approaches have been published in the field of gene_expression despite of huge diversity regarding the mathematical concepts of the different biclustering methods many of them can be related to the singular_value svd recently a sparse svd approach ssvd has been proposed to reveal biclusters in gene_expression data in this article we propose to incorporate stability_selection to improve this method stability_selection is a subsampling based variable_selection that allows to control type_i the here proposed s vd algorithm incorporates this subsampling approach to find stable biclusters and to estimate the selection probabilities of genes and samples to belong to the biclusters results so_far the s vd method is the first biclustering approach that takes the cluster stability regarding perturbations of the data into account application of the s vd algorithm to a lung_cancer microarray_dataset revealed biclusters that correspond to coregulated genes associated with cancer_subtypes marker_genes for different lung cancer_subtypes showed high selection probabilities to belong to the corresponding biclusters moreover the genes associated with the biclusters belong to significantly_enriched cancer related gene_ontology categories in a simulation_study the s vd algorithm outperformed the ssvd algorithm and two other svd related biclustering methods in recovering artificial biclusters and in being robust to noisy_data availability r code of the s vd algorithm as well as a documentation can be found at http s vd r forge r project org contact m sill dkfz declustering methods belong to the most commonly used statistical_tools in the analysis of high_dimensional if additional information about the sample class_labels is lacking other types of analysis like supervised_classification methods or testing for differentially_expressed cannot be performed in this case unsupervised_clustering allows to reveal unknown structures that are to whom correspondence should be addressed possibly hidden in the gene_expression data matrix these structures may be characterized by groups of genes that are coregulated by a common transcription_factor and thus belong to the same pathway or samples that share a similar gene_expression pattern one disadvantage of commonly used clustering_algorithms like hierarchical_clustering or k_means is that the cluster assignment of objects are based on the complete feature_space e g in case of clustering the samples the resulting clusters are derived with respect to all genes but groups of genes may only be coregulated within a subset of the samples and samples may share a common gene_expression pattern only for a subset of genes such clusters that exist only in a subspace of the feature_space can hardly be detected by these classical one way clustering_algorithms to find such clusters other clustering concepts are needed in the past_decade the concept of biclustering has emerged in the field of gene_expression analysis biclustering which is also known as coclustering or two way clustering describes the simultaneous clustering of the rows and the columns of a data matrix the first biclustering algorithm the so_called block clustering has been developed by cheng andproposed the first biclustering algorithm for the analysis of high_dimensional gene_expression data since then many different biclustering_algorithms have been developed currently there exists a diverse spectrum of biclustering tools that follow different strategies and algorithmic concepts among others popular algorithms are the coupled two way clustering ctwc by order preserving sub matrix opsm algorithm by the iterative signature algorithm isa by the plaid model byand the improved plaid model samba by biclustering by non smooth non_negative by the bi correlation clustering_algorithm bcca by bhattacharya and de and factor_analysis for bicluster acquisition fabia developed a fast divide_and algorithm bimax and conducted a systematic_comparison of different biclustering_algorithms published an article on validation indices for the evaluation of biclustering results and the comparison for biclustering_algorithms comprehensive reviews about the concept of biclustering and the different biclustering approaches have been written byand van in a more theoretical review emphasized the mathematical concepts behind several biclustering_algorithms and pointed_out that the svd represents a capable tool for finding biclusters furthermore most existing biclustering_algorithms use the svd directly or have a strong association with it to keep track of the huge diversity regarding the mathematical properties of the existing biclustering_algorithms suggest to relate new and existing biclustering_algorithms to the svd a major_drawback of many biclustering methods is that they rely on random starting seeds and thus are inconsistent and results may vary even when the algorithm is applied to the same dataset as often in unsupervised_clustering it is difficult to judge the biclustering results regarding their stability for one way clustering several resampling approaches to validate the stability of the clustering_results are known e g multiscale bootstrap hierarchical_clustering and consensus clustering in case of biclustering similar methods that take the stability of the results into account are not yet available recently proposed a sparse svd ssvd method to find biclusters in gene_expression data singular vectors of an svd are interpreted as regression_coefficients of a linear_regression the ssvd algorithm alternately fits penalized regression_models to the singular vector pair to obtain a sparse matrix decomposition the sparseness of the resulting singular vectors strongly depends on the choice of the penalization parameter in this article we propose to choose the penalization parameters by stability_selection which is a subsampling procedure that can be applied to penalized regression_models to select stable variables in addition stability_selection offers the possibility to control type_i e g the per family error_rate pfer or the per comparison wise error_rate pcer applying the new combined algorithm the sparse svd algorithm with nested stability_selection s vd to a lung_cancer gene_expression dataset reveals biclusters that represent lung cancer_subtypes characterized by relevant sets of coregulated genes in a simulation_study we compare the s vd with the ssvd algorithm as well as the improved plaid model and the isa in order to demonstrate that the here proposed s vd algorithm is able to find biologically_relevant biclusters we applied it to a knownthat the heatmap shows only those genes that have been selected in at least one bicluster the rectangles indicate the genes and samples that correspond to the three biclusters the rectangle on the left side corresponds to bicluster the two rectangles in the middle correspond to bicluster and the two rectangles on the right side to bicluster lung_cancer gene_expression dataset furthermore to examine the influence of increasing levels of noise regarding the performance of the s vd algorithm we performed a simulation_study the s vd algorithm was compared with the ssvd method the improved plaid model and the isa the isa and the plaid model are known to be closely_related to the svd
