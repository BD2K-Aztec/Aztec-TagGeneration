proteins without d structure definition detection and beyond motivation predictions and experiments to a lesser extent following the decoding of the human_genome showed that a significant fraction of gene_products do not have well defined d structures while the presence of structured domains traditionally suggested function it was not clear what the absence of structure implied these and many other findings initiated the extensive theoretical and experimental research into these types of proteins commonly known as intrinsically_disordered idps crucial to understanding idps is the evaluation of structural predictors based on different principles and trained on various datasets which is currently the subject of active research the view is emerging that structural_disorder can be considered as a separate structural category and not simply as absence of secondary and or tertiary_structure idps perform essential functions and their improper functioning is responsible for human_diseases such as neurodegenerative_disorders
