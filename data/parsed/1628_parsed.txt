estimating genome_wide ibd_sharing from snp data via an efficient hidden_markov of ld with application to gene_mapping motivation association analysis is the method of choice for studying complex multifactorial_diseases the premise of this method is that affected persons contain some common genomic_regions with similar snp alleles and such areas will be found in this analysis an important disadvantage of gwa studies is that it does not distinguish between genomic areas that are inherited from a common_ancestor identical by descent ibd and areas that are identical merely by state identical by state ibs clearly areas that can be marked with higher probability as ibd and have the same correlation with the disease status of identical areas that are more probably only ibs are better candidates to be causative and yet this distinction is not encoded in standard association analysis results we develop a factorial hidden_markov based algorithm for computing genome_wide ibd_sharing the algorithm accepts as input snp data of measured individuals and estimates the probability of ibd at each locus for every pair of individuals for two g degree relatives when g the computation yields a precision of ibd tagging of over higher than previous methods for recall our algorithm uses a first order markovian model for the linkage_disequilibrium process and employs a reduction of the state_space of the inheritance vector from being exponential in g to quadratic the higher accuracy along with the reduced time complexity marks our method as a feasible means for ibd mapping in practical scenarios availability a software implementation called ibdmap is freely_available atassociation analysis is the method of choice for studying complex multifactorial_diseases with low penetrance the basic idea is to compute a correlation between each measured snp and the affection status and then further study areas that contain snps with high scores the premise of this method is that affected persons contain some common genomic_regions with similar snp alleles and such areas will be found in this analysis the large number of tests requires correction_for to capture the fact that dense snps are not independent one can use various blocks of linked snps and find correlation to the blocks rather than to individual snps greenspan to whom correspondence should be addressed and the main advantage of association analysis is that it can potentially identify small suspect areas provided that sufficiently many individuals are sampled an important disadvantage of this method is that it does not distinguish between genomic areas that are inherited from a common_ancestor clearly areas that can be marked with higher probability as ibd and have the same correlation with the disease status of identical areas that are more probably only ibs are better candidates to be causative and yet this distinction is not encoded in standard association analysis the popular plink program for association analysis among its many functions provides a method that challenges this common practice plink accepts snp data of affected and healthy_individuals then infers the ibd areas for each pair and consequently uses a score equation to evaluate the extent to which a snp is suspected to predispose or cause a disease the input of this formula relies on inferring the ibd status of the snp for each pair of input individuals the inference is done via an hidden_markov hmm with a small hidden state_space that encodes the ibd status at the current locus using three states the power of this mapping method highly depends on the precision of the ibd inference our work herein replaces the part of inferring ibd with an improved method using a more accurate hmm_model with a state_space that grows quadratically with the number of generations g that distinguish two individuals we develop a factorial hmm_based algorithm for computing genome_wide ibd_sharing the algorithm accepts as input snp data of measured individuals and estimates the probability of ibd at each locus for every pair of individuals to estimate performance we measure precision which is the number of correctly_identified ibd positions divided by the total number of position inferred as ibd and recall which is the number of correctly_identified ibd positions divided by the number of ibd positions for two g degree relatives when g the computation yields a precision of ibd tagging of over higher than previous methods for recall our algorithm uses a reduction of the state_space of the inheritance vector used in merlin from being exponential in g to quadratic and combines it with a first order markovian model for the linkage_disequilibrium ld process in essence we apply sophisticated techniques from linkage_analysis to genetic_studies without pedigree input the application of our method to gene_mapping shows a noticeable improvement the rest of this article is organized as follows section defines hmms and explains the inferences done with them section measurements of ld in recent_years become more accurate as data of haplotypes accumulate yet even with current public data the knowledge of ld already upgrades the performance of various methods for gene_mapping such as linkage_analysis mapping by admixture linkage_disequilibrium mald and association studies in this article we incorporated a first order markov_model of ld within models of family inheritance and showed how this improves the analysis of shared ibd areas the proposed model becomes computationally_efficient because we have devised a suitable partition of the state_space which satisfies conditions i and ii and as a result reduces an exponential complexity to a quadratic one the fundamental difficulty in estimating ibd status is that recombination_events erase the trace of inheritance after a few dozens of generations leaving small ibd areas that compete against random areas that are equal only by state the errors produced by
