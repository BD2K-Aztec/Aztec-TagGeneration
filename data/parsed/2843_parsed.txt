bioinformatics_discovery sequence_analysis mechanistic_insights into mutually_exclusive in dynamin mutually_exclusive is a strictly_regulated pattern of alternative_splicing a specific group of mutually_exclusive splicing_events has been shown to be regulated by the formation of specific rna_secondary this type of regulation has been shown to exist only in arthropods the present study involved a detailed sequence_analysis of human gene structures that undergo mutually_exclusive which showed that this type of regulation may also occur in dynamin in mammals a phylogenetic_analysis revealed that the dynamin orthologs in invertebrates did not share the same sequence_features which suggests that the regulatory_mechanism has independently evolved in the mammalian lineage therefore the emergence of this elaborate mechanism for mutually_exclusive may be attributable to mechanistic convergence the alternative_splicing of pre_mrna is regulated in a spatiotemporal manner and is essential for generating proteomic diversity mutually_exclusive is an alternative_splicing pattern where only a single_exon is precisely selected from a cluster of candidate exons several different mechanisms have been proposed for mutually_exclusive for example an elegant model that involves specific rna_secondary in introns was first proposed for the exon cluster of dscam in drosophila species in this model the formation of rna_secondary between a docking site and selector sequences in premrna allows a single_exon to be selected although other cases that can be explained using this model were not observed for several years a recent study byexpanded the applicability of this model to other genes in insects such as and myosin_heavy in dscam it appeared that clusters of mutually_exclusive exons other than exon could also be explained using the docking site selector sequence interaction model they not only predicted the intronic elements responsible for mutually_exclusive but also experimentally demonstrated that the elements were directly involved with the precise selection of the exon at present this mechanism is only known to exist in arthropods and it is uncertain whether it applies to genes in other clades including mammals in this report a genome_wide analysis of cases of mutually_exclusive was performed by scanning the structures of human transcripts to gain mechanistic_insights into the regulation of mutually_exclusive the rna base_pairing potential for pre mrna_sequences that underwent mutually_exclusive was calculated and a characteristic sequence pattern that fitted well with the docking site selector sequence pairing model was observed in the sequence of dynamin dnm the applicability of this model was supported by evidence such as the conservation of sequence_patterns in other mammalian_species the discovery that the pre_mrna sequence of dnm in humans has sequence_features similar to that of the alternative_splicing patterns observed in insects greatly expands the applicability of the docking site selector sequence pairing model to bilaterian animals
