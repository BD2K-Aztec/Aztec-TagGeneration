rck accurate and efficient inference of sequence and structure based protein rna_binding models from rnacompete data motivation proteinrna interactions which play vital roles in many processes are mediated through both rna_sequence and structure clip based_methods which measure proteinrna binding in vivo suffer from experimental_noise and systematic_biases whereas in vitro experiments capture a clearer signal of protein rna_binding among them rnacompete provides binding_affinities of a specific protein to more than unstructured rna probes in one experiment the computational challenge is to infer rna_structure and sequence_based binding models from these data the state of the art in sequence models deepbind does not model structural preferences rnacontext models both sequence and structure preferences but is outperformed by graphprot unfortunately graphprot cannot detect structural preferences from rnacompete data due to the unstructured nature of the data as noted by its developers nor can it be tractably run on the full rnacompete dataset results we develop rck an efficient scalable algorithm that infers both sequence and structure preferences based on a new k_mer based model remarkably even though rnacompete data is designed to be unstructured rck can still learn structural preferences from it rck significantly_outperforms both rnacontext and deepbind in in vitro binding prediction for rnacompete experiments moreover rck is also faster and uses less memory which enables scalability while currently on par with existing_methods in in vivo binding prediction on a small_scale test we demonstrate that rck will increasingly benefit from experimentally_measured rna_structure profiles as compared to computationally predicted ones by running rck on the entire rnacompete dataset we generate and provide as a resource a set of proteinrna structure based models on an unprecedented scale availability_and software and models are freely_available rck proteinrna interactions play vital roles in many processes in the living_cell these include modulation and effect of a wide_variety of cellular_processes including rna_replication repair recombination and post_transcriptional more than genes in the human_genome are thought to code for rna_binding rbps making this family one of the largest families in the human_proteome most rbps bind rna through both sequence and structure thus better characterization of rbp sequence and structure specific binding_preferences can improve our understanding of post_transcriptional rna_structure is commonly_considered at the level of secondary_structure rna_secondary is represented by base_pairing of nucleotides and can be efficiently predicted from its sequence when only tree like structures are allowed a single rna_molecule may fold into different conformations termed its ensemble of structures where the most likely one is the minimum_free these ensembles can be represented as either different combinatorial structures v c the author published_by
