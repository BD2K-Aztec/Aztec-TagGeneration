metacca summary_statistics based multivariate meta_analysis of genome_wide using canonical_correlation downloaded from motivation a dominant approach to genetic_association is to perform univariate tests between genotype phenotype pairs however analyzing related traits together increases statistical_power and certain complex associations become detectable only when several variants are tested jointly currently modest sample_sizes of individual cohorts and restricted availability of individual_level genotype phenotype data across the cohorts limit conducting multivariate tests results we introduce metacca a computational framework for summary_statistics based analysis of a single or multiple studies that allows multivariate representation of both genotype and phenotype it extends the statistical technique of canonical_correlation to the setting where original individual_level records are not available and employs a covariance shrinkage algorithm to achieve robustness multivariate meta_analysis of two finnish studies of nuclear_magnetic metabolomics by metacca using standard univariate output from the program snptest shows an excellent_agreement with the pooled individual_level analysis of original data motivated by strong multivari ate signals in the lipid genes tested we envision that multivariate association testing using metacca has a great_potential to provide novel insights from already published summary_statistics from high_throughput phenotyping technologies availability_and code is available at https most human_diseases and traits have a strong genetic_component genome_wide gwas have proven_effective in identifying genetic_variation contributing to common complex_disorders including type_diabetes cardiovascular_disease schizophrenia schizophrenia working group of the psychiatric genomics and quantitative_traits such as lipid_levels global lipids and metabolomics a dominant approach to gwas is to test one single_nucleotide snp at a time against one quantitative phenotype measure or a binary disease indicator this univariate approach is unlikely to be optimal when millions of snps and a growing number of phenotypes including serum metabolomic_profiles three_dimensional images and gene_expression data become available simultaneously indeed a recent comparison demonstrated that utilizing multivariate phenotype representation increases statistical_power and leads to richer findings in the association tests compared to the univariate_analysis moreover some complex genotype_phenotype can be detected only when testing several genetic_variants simultaneously and multi genotype tests are common practice in rare_variant studies where statistical_power any single_variant is very small unfortunately restricted availability of complete multivariate individual_level records across the cohorts currently limits multivariate_analyses often only the univariate gwas summary_statistics i e univariate regression_coefficients with their standard_errors from individual cohorts are publicly_available hence a major question is how we can use these univariate association results to carry out a multivariate meta_analysis of gwas which is crucial to increase the power to identify novel genetic_associations recently two kinds of multivariate testing approaches operating on univariate summary_statistics have been introduced i one snp against multiple_traits and ii multiple_snps against one trait we propose a new framework metacca that unifies both of the existing_approaches by allowing canonical_correlation cca of multiple_snps against multiple_traits based on univariate summary_statistics and publicly_available databases cca is a well established statistical technique for identifying linear relationships between two sets of variables and has been successfully_applied to gwas our metacca method extends cca to the setting where original individual_level measurements are not available instead metacca works with three pieces of the full data covariance_matrix and applies a covariance shrinkage algorithm to achieve robustness we demonstrate the performance of metacca using snp and metabolite data from three finnish cohorts in summary this paper makes the following contributions bullet to our knowledge we provide the first computational framework for association testing between multivariate genotype and multivariate phenotype based on univariate summary_statistics from single or multiple gwas our implementation is freely_available bullet we demonstrate how to accurately estimate correlation structures of phenotypic and genotypic variables without an access to the individual_level data bullet we avoid false_positive associations by a covariance shrinkage algorithm based on stabilization of the leading canonical correlation bullet our approach metacca is a general framework to conduct cca when full data are not available and therefore it is widely_applicable also outside gwas a detailed discussion on the relationship between metacca and previously_published multivariate association methods can be found in supplementary data the advantage of multivariate testing of genetic_association is well reported in the literature and also demonstrated in our results e g cetp in supplementary table s that has multivariate p value orders_of smaller than any of the univariate p values optimal use of correlated_traits is becoming increasingly important as high_throughput phenotyping technologies are being more widely_applied to individual study cohorts and large biobanks we introduced metacca a computational_approach for the multivariate meta_analysis of gwas by using univariate summary_statistics and a reference_database of genetic data thus our framework circumvents the need for complete multivariate individuallevel records and tackles the problem of low sample_sizes in individual cohorts by a built in meta_analysis approach to our knowledge metacca is the first summary_statistics based framework that allows multivariate representation of both genotypic_and variables in large meta_analytic efforts the ability to work with summary_statistics is beneficial even when there is an access to the individuallevel data for example with a study_design of the global lipids genetics_consortium we estimate that the reduction in the size of input_data between metacca and standard cca could be over fold supplementary apoe for cetp for gckr for pcsk and for nod the values are summarized with details in supplementary table s the number of tests in each gene is for multi snp g for single snpmulti trait and g for single snpsingle trait tests where g is the number of snps in that gene
