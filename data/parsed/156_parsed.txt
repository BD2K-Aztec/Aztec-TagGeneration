a gene based test of association using canonical_correlation motivation canonical_correlation cca measures the association between two sets of multidimensional variables we reasoned that cca could provide an efficient and powerful approach for both univariate_and gene based tests of association without the need for permutation_testing results compared with a commonly used permutation based_approach cca i is faster ii has appropriate type_i for normally distributed quantitative_traits iii provides comparable power for small_to genes kb iv provides greater_power when the causal_variants are uncommon v provides considerably less power for larger genes kb when the causal_variants have a broad minor_allele maf spectrum application to a gwas of leukocyte levels identified safb and a histone gene_cluster as novel putative loci harboring multiple independent variants regulating lymphocyte and neutrophil_counts over the past_few genome_wide gwass have been successful in uncovering common_genetic underlying complex_traits or diseases considerable efforts have been made to replicate the most associated marker in a given gwas locus but there is growing evidence that some loci harbor additional independently associated variants this phenomenon which may be widespread can be explored through gene based association methods to facilitate the identification of genes with multiple risk_variants with weak effects current gene based_methods typically require permutation or simulation testing to account for the correlation between snps as well as gene size among which vegas and plink set based tests are most frequently employed both tests combine results from single snp analyses but differ in how an appropriate null_distribution is obtained vegas relies on simulations of linkage_disequilibrium ld_structure from to whom correspondence should be addressed a reference dataset such as the hapmap whereas plink setbased tests resort to permutation_testing in general these are flexible approaches that can accommodate many different analytical strategies but can be computationally_intensive with increasing number of snps tested and when the level of significance is high previously ferreira and purcell proposed a multivariate test of association based on canonical_correlation cca to simultaneously test the association between a single snp and multiple_phenotypes cca first described by harold measures the association between two sets of multidimensional variables by maximizing the correlation between their linear_combinations we reasoned that cca could also provide an efficient and powerful approach for a gene based test of association by intrinsically taking_into the correlation_structure between snps without the need for permutation_testing therefore in the present study we extended the cca approach to test multiple_snps for association with a single or multiple_phenotypes measured in unrelated_individuals and compared its performance with permutation_based tests of association we performed a series of simulations to test whether cca could provide a convenient robust and powerful statistical_framework for a gene based test of association when analyzing a quantitative_trait measured in unrelated_individuals our results suggest that when compared with a commonly used permutation based_approach that considers all genetic_variation assayed in a gene a cca genebased test i can be orders_of particularly for larger highly_significant genes ii has appropriate type_i when analyzing a single normally distributed quantitative_trait iii provides comparable power for small_to genes kb iv provides greater_power when the causal_variants are uncommon irrespectively of gene size on the other hand the cca test was considerably less powerful for larger genes kb when the causal_variants have a broad maf spectrum or are relatively common maf of note of the genes tested in the wbcs study were larger than kb which included a kb buffer we further show that including in the cca gene based test all genetic_variation assayed in a given gene can be counterproductive when the specific aim of the analysis is to identify genes that harbor exclusively uncommon or common causal_variants but not both based on these intuitive results we suggest that cca may provide a particularly useful gene based_approach for the separate analysis of either uncommon or common_variants gene based association p values are often used as input for pathway based association_analyses in this case cca may not be the most appropriate test to use because of the large impact of gene size on power gene based_methods that have a more comparable_performance across different gene lengths e g all snp or gwis tests may provide a better alternative to ensure that an association with pathways composed of large genes can be as readily detected as with those composed of smaller genes our results suggest that cca also provides a valid test for the analysis of a single disease trait or multiple quantitative_traits in this case however cca provided little if any gain in power when compared to the all snp permutation based_approach the cca gene based test nonetheless provides a computationally_efficient alternative when analyzing such traits in the multivariate scenario a significant result can be followed by i an examination of the weights attributed by the cca to each phenotype and or ii inspection of the univariate gene based results in this way the individual traits underlying the multivariate association can be identified as proof_of we applied the cca gene based test to the analysis of six wbc traits measured in up to unrelated healthy_individuals univariate gene based analyses of both common and uncommon snps identified two notable regions of association one for lymphocyte_counts on chromosome that included the two paralog genes safb and safb and another for neutrophil_counts including several genes in the histone cluster on chromosome safb is involved in the transcription repression of immune regulatory_genes including hla and cytokine_genes furthermore safb knockout_mice show defects in the development of the hematopoietic system increased wbc_counts hypoplasia of the thymus and increased signs of infections thus together with these data our results suggest that safb and or safb represent novel putative genes with multiple independent qtl regulating variation in lymphocyte_counts in humans our analyses identified two specific uncommon variants rs and rs in this region that could be the focus of subsequent follow_up studies the second notable region was the histone gene_cluster on chromosome which was associated with neutrophil_counts histones are increasingly_recognized to have an important role in cellular_signaling and innate_immunity in addition to their role in the regulation of chromatin_structure interestingly mice challenged with a sublethal_dose of histones develop a prominent accumulation of neutrophils in the lung furthermore the histone gene_cluster contains the greatest enrichment of safb target binding_sites these results thus raise the possibility that genetic_variants in this region may affect the binding of safb which in turn may regulate the transcription of key histone genes involved in neutrophil production migration or apoptosis candidate snps that may explain this effect include rs rs and rs further studies that attempt to replicate our observed association between these and neutrophil_counts are warranted in conclusion we show that cca provides a useful framework for a gene based test of association which in some situations may outperform commonly used permutation based_approaches our
