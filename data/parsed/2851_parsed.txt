sequence_analysis mega_cc computing core of molecular evolutionary_genetics analysis program for automated and iterative data analysis there is a growing need in the research_community to apply the molecular evolutionary_genetics analysis mega software_tool for batch processing a large number of datasets and to integrate it into analysis workflows therefore we now make available the computing core of the mega software as a stand alone executable mega_cc along with an analysis prototyper mega proto mega_cc provides users with access to all the computational_analyses available through megas graphical_user version this includes methods for multiple_sequence substitution model_selection evolutionary distance estimation phylogeny inference substitution_rate and pattern estimation tests of natural_selection and ancestral sequence inference additionally we have upgraded the source_code for phylo genetic_analysis using the maximum_likelihood methods for parallel execution on multiple processors and cores here we describe mega_cc and outline the steps for using mega_cc in tandem with mega proto for iterative and automated data analysis the molecular evolutionary_genetics analysis mega software is an integrated suite of tools for statistics based comparative_analysis of molecular sequence_data based on evolutionary principles mega is being used by biologists in a large number of laboratories for reconstructing the evolutionary_histories of species and inferring the extent and nature of selective forces shaping the evolution of genes and species see www megasoftware net additionally mega is used in many classrooms as a tool for teaching the methods used in evolutionary bioinformatics one of megas key features is its graphical_user gui which facilitates detailed visualization and interactive_exploration of sequence_data phylogenetic_trees and analysis results however over time the needs of mega users have expanded due to increasing availability of multi gene and genome_scale which necessitate iterative high_throughput analysis in order to address this need we have re engineered the mega source_code so that the computational core which implements the computation algorithms for all analyses in mega can be used as a stand alone application and executed through command_line other applications or scripting languages we now make available mega_cc computing core that implements all the computational_analyses available in the latest guibased edition for a list of analysis seein tamura et_al mega_cc comes with mega proto which provides an easy way to generate a configuration file specifying analysis options for the desired analysis the use of mega proto ensures that the analysis selections are fully validated and that they mirror those in the gui based edition of mega this leads to a consistent usage experience across different releases of mega and enables the user to test drive their analysis in the gui based edition of mega it also makes it possible for the programming team to more easily keep all versions of mega completely synchronized we illustrate the use of mega_cc and mega proto together in an example case where one wishes to infer maximum_likelihood ml phylogenetic_trees for many genes in series and the user has obtained multiple_sequence comprised of coding sequence_data for each gene using the mega proto application the user first generates an analysis options file that specifies the chosen settings for the substitution model genetic_code table gaps missing_data treatment distribution of rates topology search approach source for the initial tree size of the execution thread pool and to whom correspondence should be addressed optionally the number of replications for carrying out the bootstrap test of phylogeny once the analysis options file has been saved to disk the user is now ready to execute mega_cc to generate an ml phylogeny for each sequence_alignment in this scenario the user has multiple options for processing the alignment files the simplest method is to use the file iterator system in mega_cc which will search in a user specified directory for all input data_files that are compatible with the active analysis and process them iteratively in our example mega_cc would process all fasta and mega formatted sequence data_files found in the specified directory alternatively the file iterator system can operate from a list of files that the user provides in a text_file to use this feature the user can launch the mega_cc executable from a command prompt along with the appropriate parameter flag and pass it a directory name or the name of a text_file which lists all target input_files alternatively the user can generate their own script that iterates over the names of the alignment files and launches the mega_cc executable for each file supported input data_files for mega_cc are fasta and mega files for sequence_data newick files for phylogenies and mega files for distance_matrices during execution the progress of the analysis is displayed in the shell window and upon completion the results files are written to the specified path the format of the output_files depends on the analysis done for example in the case of ml phylogeny reconstruction the resulting phylogeny is written to a newick formatted text_file additionally an optional analysis summary file which includes information regarding the analysis such as log_likelihood and estimated parameter_values is saved alongside the newick file in addition to batch processing of single analyses mega_cc gives users the ability to construct automated workflows that chain together multiple analyses for instance starting with a fasta file of dna sequence_data a multiple_sequence can be generated using either megas native implementation of clustalw or the integrated muscle alignment program next this alignment can serve as input_data for a number of phylogenetic_inference methods e g ml maximum_parsimony and neighbor_joining all of which can be statistically tested by the bootstrap method using the sequence_alignment and phylogenetic_tree that have been created a user may perform further analyses such as inference of ancestral sequences tests of natural_selection molecular_clock test and estimation of evolutionary_rates alternatively mega_cc can be easily integrated into pipelines constructed with other bioinformatics applications as virtually all programming_languages facilitate execution of external processes we have also re programmed ml analyses to efficiently utilize multiple processors and cores on the same machine for increased performance which will greatly reduce the run time for computationally_demanding ml inferences for example mega_cc reduces the time taken to complete ml tree search by almost half when using two threads speed up for an alignment containing sequences each having base_pairs addition of the third thread reduces the time further speed up a similar performance was achieved by raxml version for two and three threads more detailed comparison of algorithms and speed ups will be published elsewhere because virtually all new desktop workstations are equipped with at least a few cores or processors many will see significant performance increases when opting to use multiple threads and cores in summary mega_cc will address the needs of biologists interested in iterative and automated analyses currently mega_cc and mega proto are available for the windows bit computing platform we plan to release the bit version of mega_cc in the near future that will be natively compiled for all major operating_systems and come with a web_based version of mega proto
