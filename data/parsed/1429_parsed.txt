dissect an assignment free bayesian discovery method for species_delimitation under the multispecies coalescent motivation the multispecies coalescent model provides a formal framework for the assignment of individual_organisms to species where the species are modeled as the branches of the sp tree none of the available approaches so_far have simultaneously co estimated all the relevant_parameters in the model without restricting the parameter_space by requiring a guide_tree and or prior assignment of individuals to clusters or species results we present dissect which explores the full space of possible clusterings of individuals and species tree_topologies in a bayesian_framework it uses an approximation to avoid the need for reversible_jump in the form of a prior that is a modification of the birthdeath prior for the species_tree it incorporates a spike near zero in the density for node heights the model has two extra parameters one controls the degree of approximation and the second controls the prior_distribution on the numbers of species it is implemented as part of beast and requires only a few changes from a standard beast analysis the method is evaluated on simulated_data and demonstrated on an empirical dataset the method is shown to be insensitive to the degree of approximation but quite sensitive to the second parameter suggesting that large_numbers of sequences are needed to draw firm conclusions availability_and despite its alleged status as a fundamental concept in biology the species category has lacked a definition allowing explicit testing of particular species limits e g in recent_years however several methods have been proposed for the task of delimiting species based on molecular data see fujita et_al and miralles and vencesfor reviews multispecies coalescent species_delimitation mscsd methods make use of multi_locus sequence_data to make inferences in the presence of incomplete_lineage all current mscsd methods are either heuristic e g o dependent on a guide_tree e g note however that a paper by yang and rannalaappeared during the revision of this article where the requirement of a user supplied guide_tree is eliminated or are validation methods which require prior assignment of individuals to clusters or species devised parametric and non parametric heuristic methods to simultaneously find an optimal assignment of individuals to species and their tree relationships yang and developed the idea in a bayesian_framework in which the gene_trees are co estimated with a constrained species_tree in the simplest option species are inferred by setting a threshold on the posterior node heights of the species_tree with small heights interpreted as evidence for collapsing a node this is similar to using beast with each individual in its own species in the xml file and estimating the actual species afterwards the dimensionality of the parameter_space does not change and there is no special prior involved here we take a bayesian_approach which has the advantage that nuisance parameters can be integrated out and also that prior taxonomic knowledge can be taken to account our approach does not require prior assignments of individuals to putative species and may be viewed as species tree_inference while taking uncertainties in mscsd into account we present division of individuals into species using sequences and epsilon collapsed trees dissect for species_delimitation which requires no prior assignment of individuals to clusters or species but instead explores the full space of possible clusterings and tree_topologies it is along the lines of the method of yang and rannala which employs a user supplied guide_tree in which some nodes may be collapsed i e all descendants of these nodes assigned to one species in the most recent version of bp p there is no need for the user to supply a guide_tree instead the guide_tree space is explored using nearest_neighbor interchange moves the two operations of collapsing a node and of setting its height to zero have the same effect on the likelihood since the multispecies coalescent density is the same for a single population and a population which has just split at time when a node is collapsed the dimensionality of the parameter_space changes so a reversible_jump rjmcmc algorithm is needed to sample the species_trees the basic idea behind dissect is to sample trees in which each tip represents a single individual or a cluster of individuals which definitely belong in one species but replace the usual prior density on node heights with one which includes a spike near zero the dimensionality of the parameter_space is fixed but nodes whose heights have a high posterior_probability of being within the spike can be interpreted as probably collapsed results for the first set sim x are shown in in general increasing the number of genes from to increases accuracy and it is almost perfect for nine genes in the easy cases where the shortest branches of the species_trees are five coalescent units c in however with genes accuracy goes down at least for the easy case checking the trace files and effective sample_sizes esss revealed poor convergence of these runs the effect of varying the prior for x shows no obvious effect on accuracy except possibly a small increase in the posterior_probability with increasing k see supplementary data results for the second set sim are shown in the point_estimates were always correct except in one replicate with nine genes medium amount of lineage sorting and eight individuals there were no false splits with high posterior_probabilities the posterior_probability of the correct clustering increases with g but shows no clear effect with varying number of individuals i however when running the same analyses with x beta n meaning that the prior probability of one species is accuracy increases with the number of individuals supplementary data the boxplots show the values of the error metric over replicates as the number of genes g or the amount of lineage sorting shortest branches of species_tree a b c coalescent units and prior on x b beta hyperprior k or vary epsilon is and mcmc generations for each replicate with first discarded as burn in the boxplots show the values of the error metric over replicates as the number of genes g and the number of individuals i vary when there is only one species there is a x beta hyperprior epsilon is and mcmc generations for each replicate with first discarded as burn ingiven the intrinsic theoretical and empirical difficulties of the problem any success would be surprising o we believe that dissect is a useful step_forward on the theoretical and computational side the multispecies coalescent model has assumptions that are likely to be violated and it remains to be seen how important these are for empirical data we have not formally evaluated the accuracy of the species_trees produced by dissect however apart from the approximation involving e and the slightly different prior on the tree root height the dissect model when conditioned on a particular clustering z is equivalent to beast using z to assign individuals to species this means that dissect can be used as in a regular beast analysis taking uncertainties in species_delimitation into account the new version of bp p which appeared as advance access late in the review process of this article has similar properties and the accuracy of the two approaches may now be compared
