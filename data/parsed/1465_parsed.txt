structural_bioinformatics dooss a tool for visual_analysis of data overlaid on secondary_structures motivation dooss data overlaid on secondary_structures is a tool for visualizing annotated secondary_structures of large single_stranded nucleotide_sequences such as full_length virus_genomes the purpose of this tool is to assist investigators in evaluating the biological_relevance of secondary_structures within particular sequences availability_and dooss is written in java and is available from http dooss large single_stranded nucleotide_sequences such as cellular rna_molecules and single_stranded and rna virus_genomes apparently form complex secondary_structures through watsoncrick base_pairing between bases on the same dna rna strand identified using either computational folding or experimental_techniques only a few of these structures have any known functional_importance although techniques used to identify secondary_structures typically give little or no information regarding the biological_significance of identified structures comparative structural and evolutionary_analyses of related sequences can be illuminating in this regard specifically the evolutionary_processes operating both to conserve these structures and to maintain the coding potential of the nucleic_acid from which they are composed could potentially be used to identify structures with likely biological_relevance dooss data overlaid on secondary_structures permits visualization of individual secondary_structures simultaneously annotated with large_amounts of relevant data including for example gene locations codon_usage statistics computational or biochemically determined nucleotide pairing probabilities apparently co evolving nucleotide pairs and the degrees to which individual nucleotides codons or base_pairings are evolutionarily_conserved the intended purpose of such visualizations is ultimately to assist researchers in focusing the attention of their wet_lab and computational research onto the computationally predicted or experimentally demonstrated nucleic_acid secondary_structures that are most likely to have some unknown biological_relevance
