xper introducing e taxonomy motivation computer_aided identification systems provide users with the resources to relate morpho anatomic observations with taxa names and to subsequently access other knowledge about the organisms they have the ability to manage descriptive_data and make identifications through interactive keys they are essential for both authors and users of biodiversity information xper version is one of the most user_friendly tools in its category and provides a complete environment dedicated to taxonomic management availability xper software can be freely downloaded atlinnaeus wrote that naming is the first stage of knowledge indeed names of taxa are the main access keys to biological_information they link the real_world of living_organisms and the conceptual world proposed by systematists through the description and characterization of taxa identifying life_forms is crucial for all activities related to biology and their taxonomic descriptions are more than necessary in the study of biodiversity systematists inventory study and structure biological_diversity as precisely as possible all this information may be summarized into knowledge bases to perform identification of specimens for new inventories and monitoring surveys phylogenetic_analyses as well as biogeographic and ecological_studies a significant increase of this kind of digitized information should be expected in a near future the deep social and scientific impact of web stimulates sharing of digital data and proposals of cybertaxonomy projects to study global biodiversity and climate changes the generalization and the integration of knowledge_base management systems into current taxonomic work may be the next revolution in taxonomy international projects are already opening the way of this new delocalized taxonomy many international projects such as gbif edit biota catalogue of life encyclopedia of life key nature etc have a common purpose sharing knowledge and providing free web access to biodiversity information
