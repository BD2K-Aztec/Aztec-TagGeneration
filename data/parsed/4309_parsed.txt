snpdryad predicting deleterious non synonymous human snps using only orthologous protein_sequences motivation the recent_advances in genome_sequencing have revealed an abundance of non synonymous polymorphisms among human individuals subsequently it is of immense interest and importance to predict whether such substitutions are functional neutral or have deleterious_effects the accuracy of such prediction_algorithms depends on the quality of the multiple_sequence which is used to infer how an amino_acid is tolerated at a given position because of the scarcity of orthologous protein_sequences in the past the existing prediction_algorithms all include sequences of protein paralogs in the alignment which can dilute the conservation signal and affect prediction_accuracy however we believe that with the sequencing of a large number of mammalian_genomes it is now feasible to include only protein orthologs in the alignment and improve the prediction_performance results we have developed a novel prediction algorithm named snpdryad which only includes protein orthologs in building a multiple_sequence among many other innovations snpdryad uses different conservation scoring_schemes and uses random_forest as a classifier we have tested snpdryad on several datasets we found that snpdryad consistently outperformed other methods in several performance_metrics which is attributed to the exclusion of paralo gous sequence we have run snpdryad on the complete human_proteome generating prediction scores for all the possible amino_acid availability_and the algorithm and the prediction results can be accessed from the web sitesingle nucleotide polymorphisms snps are single_nucleotide between different individuals of the same species they account for the majority of the genetic_variations among human individuals as it is estimated that a single snp is present in every nt between any two individuals depending on how the amino_acid is affected by the polymorphism the snps in the protein_coding can be classified into synonymous snp those that do not change amino_acid non synonymous snp nssnp those change the amino_acid and nonsense_mutations where a snp results in a stop_codon based on the data from the genomes_project it is estimated that on an average a human individual possesses non synonymous_substitutions compared with the reference human_genome a number of databases had been developed to curate and store these human snp data which include dbsnp omim snpdbe and dbnsfp in addition to snps found in the protein_coding recent genome_wide association and expression_quantitative eqtl studies and the large_scale encode_project also revealed many snps located outside of the protein_coding called regulatory snps or rsnps that are also implicated in human_diseases however these rsnps are not discussed here as we only focus on the effect of snps found in the protein_coding synonymous snps are usually assumed to be functional neutral because they do not change the protein_sequence but in rare cases they can affect protein_folding disrupt rna_secondary or disrupt mirna_binding although many nssnps are probably selectively neutral i e having little functional effects a substantial fraction of these nssnps are indeed predicted to be deleterious because they can potentially disrupt functional sites on a protein or affect their correct folding many nssnps are also linked to human_disorders many of these disease associated snps are documented in databases such as omim pharmgkb and hgmd because of the potential functional consequences of nssnps several computational_methods had been developed to in silico predict whether an nssnp is deleterious some of these methods include sift polyphen polyphen snps d snap and mutationtaster these methods usually work by estimating the likelihood that a mutation nssnp is tolerated based on whether the to whom correspondence should be addressed amino_acid is observed in other evolutionarily_related orthologous or paralogous protein_sequences or sequence_fragments and whether the mutation is tolerated based on protein_structure and the physiochemical_properties of the amino_acids the major differences among these methods are how these evolutionary and structural_features are extracted and what algorithm classifier is used in combining these features to make a decision there also exist ensemble methods such as condel and logit which use naive_bayes and logistic_regression respectively to combine individual prediction_methods gonzalez as described above an accurate and unbiased multiple_sequence of a protein of interest with its orthologous and paralogous sequences is essential to derive a conservation profile of the protein which can be used to estimate how a mutation is tolerated ideally only orthologous sequences should be used in this step because these orthologs are expected to perform similar function in related organisms and the corresponding amino_acid position is expected to have the same evolutionary biophysical and structural constraint however to the best of our knowledge all the current nssnp analysis algorithms include paralogous sequences in the multiple_sequence msa step which perhaps was a necessity a few years_ago because of the scarcity of the fully_sequenced proteome sequences however inclusion of paralogous sequences can potentially introduce noises in generating protein sequence_conservation profiles because when compared with orthologs protein paralogs are more likely to diverge in sequence and in cellular_functions on an average the amino_acid between paralogous protein pairs is only the recent breakthroughs in sequencing_technology have generated fully sequenced_genomes and proteomes for a large number of vertebrates which potentially can eliminate the need for including paralogous protein_sequences in building multiple_sequence in this article we show that by including only orthologous protein_sequences we achieved better performance in predicting deleterious nssnps other innovations in our method include the choice of using random_forest in classification which had been previously shown to be effective in high_dimension data classification we benchmarked our prediction method termed snpdryad against other methods and showed that snpdryad consistently achieved better sensitivity_and on the datasets tested summarizes the overall design of snpdryad the input of snpdryad is a non synonymous human snp and the sequence of the human protein that the snp is on the output is the predicted deleterious score for the input nssnp the higher the score the more deleterious the input nssnp is predicted to be in this article we described snpdryad a novel computational_method that can predict deleterious_effect of amino_acid occurred in human proteins as elaborated in this article snpdryad outperforms other leading algorithms in accurately predicting deleterious nssnps we demonstrated that this is primarily because snpdryad only includes orthologous sequences in building the multiple_sequence as opposed to other contemporary methods which include paralogous sequences as well such an innovation allows construction of a more accurate protein sequence_conservation profile allowing a more precise estimate on whether a substitution is tolerated at a specific position this would not have been possible until now when a large number of mammalian or vertebrate genome_sequences have been completely_sequenced thanks to the drastically decreasing cost of genomic_sequencing the next_generation has generated a deluge of genomic_sequences and subsequently a wealth of genetic_variation data such as nonsynonymous polymorphisms we envision that an intelligent algorithm such as snpdryad can take advantage of this large amount of data and further improve the accuracy of predicting deleterious nssnps
