genome_analysis eqtl epistasis detecting epistatic_effects and inferring hierarchical relationships of genes in biological_pathways motivation epistasis is the interactions among multiple genetic_variants it has emerged to explain the missing_heritability that a marginal genetic effect does not account for by genome_wide and also to understand the hierarchical relationships between genes in the genetic_pathways the fishers geometric model is common in detecting the epistatic_effects however despite the substantial successes of many studies with the model it often fails to discover the functional_dependence between genes in an epistasis study which is an important role in inferring hierarchical relationships of genes in the biological_pathway results we justify the imperfectness of fishers model in the simulation_study and its application to the biological data then we propose a novel generic epistasis model that provides a flexible solution for various biological putative epistatic models in practice the proposed method enables one to efficiently characterize the functional_dependence between genes moreover we suggest a statistical strategy for determining a recessive or dominant link among epistatic expression quantitative_trait to enable the ability to infer the hierarchical relationships the proposed method is assessed by simulation_experiments of various settings and is applied to human_brain data regarding schizophrenia availability_and the matlab source codes are publicly_available at http biome cis uta edu epistasis epistasis the interaction effect among unlinked loci or between genes makes a considerable contribution to phenotypic_variation in the polygenic mechanism of complex human_diseases such as psychiatric_disorder diabetes and cancer nonetheless many studies that identify the genetic susceptible factors tend to ignore the interaction effects between loci it is not surprising at all that the investigations of the genetic_variability of individual genes by genome_wide give the explanation only up to in psychiatric_disorder this fact implies that there should indeed be a missing_heritability the missing_heritability may include the interaction between multiple genes and environmental_factors although epistasis studies traditionally take into account qualitative categories of phenotypes the recent rapid development of highthroughput technologies such as gene_microarray enables one to characterize the quantitative interaction e g gene_expression gene_expression is an intermediate molecular phenotype between genotype and the higher_level phenotypes such as human_diseases for the quantitative analysis the expression_quantitative eqtl_mapping studies have prevailed to identify susceptible genetic_loci and capture the insight of the genetic_architecture of gene_expression furthermore the importance of detecting the quantitative epistasis_analysis is recently being emphasized in many studies when william bateson created the terminology epistasis it described the non independent prediction of segregation ratios by the action of individual gene however epistasis has been interpreted in various ways to describe different phenomena for the last years the uses of the term epistasis were viewed with three different perspectives compositional epistasis statistical epistasis and functional epistasis to be short compositional epistasis represents the biological_phenomena that one allelic effect masks an allele at another locus which describes the traditional meaning of epistasis the presence of the compositional epistasis can be interpreted in the biological hierarchy between genes statistical epistasis takes_into fishers model and its deviations which describe the combinatory genetic effect within a population the functional epistasis which is also called proteinprotein_interaction is not dealt with in this article since the functional epistasis considers the molecular_interactions between protein without genetic description compositional epistasis emphasizes the functional_dependence between genes it aims to infer gene_regulatory or signaling_pathways epistasis occurs when one allelic effect is modified or blocked by an allele at another locus or when the combined multiple genetic_variants produce non mendelian segregation ratios against the individual genetic effect since genes must be interacting with others at least on the same pathway the interactive effect to phenotype is clear when a genetic_mutation has the stopping or standing above effect to another mutation the mutation is said to be epistatic and can be interpreted as the gene is downstream of the other the epistatic relationship between the melanocortin_receptor mc r and agouti on the coat_color genetic pathway of a mouse is a good example to show the epistatic relationship as shown in the genotype contingency_table in the body colors of the offspring were investigated with all the combinations of knockout mutations of the genes mc r seems to regulate the functionality of the genetic effect of agouti that is mc r is the downstream_gene of agouti in the melanocyte pathway the melanocyte pathway can elucidate the epistatic relationship between the genes in the quantitative epistasis_analysis eqtl epistasis holds significant promise in inferring the hierarchical relationships between genes in biological_pathways and its enrichment as well as the qualitative epistasis study the hierarchical interpretation of the epistatic gene_pairs enables one to construct or enrich the biological_pathways a number of regression based_methods have been suggested for inferring the gene_regulatory and their hierarchical relationships as the classical quantitative epistasis_analysis the regression based_approaches investigated the data that include reciprocal effects on the triplet combination of deletion_mutant of a gene the studies have succeeded in inferring the hierarchical pathways of the genes as well as a rule between the interaction for example activating or repressing the downstream_gene however the experiments were required tremendously expensive experiments for gene_deletions which is unfeasible to measure the effects of all possible gene_deletions in practice most epistasis studies have been performed by using the statistical_approach of fishers recently the limitations of the statistical epistasis have been argued and the development of a new approach has consistently been demanded in this article we develop a novel method to solve two problems i detecting the compositional epistasis and ii identifying the genetic hierarchical relationship between genes based using a regression_model we first present the biologically putative epistasis models and fishers model in sections and then a generic epistasis model gem is suggested to represent the biological_models in section the optimal solutions for the parameter_estimation of gem are derived in section for the second problem we propose a statistical_approach to determine the hierarchical relationships when an epistasis occurs in the multiple genes in section in the simulation_studies in section we show the performance of gem comparing fishers model on the various designed settings we also apply gem to the human_brain data of schizophrenia where the epistasis findings are described and a gene hierarchy on schizophrenia is inferred in this article we proposed a novel gem to detect the quantitatively compositional epistasis as well as the statistical epistasis fishers model has been commonly used to detect epistasis as a tool for the statistical epistasis in many studies however many argue for the limited usage of fishers model due to the lack of the biological_interpretation the proposed method is designed to provide a flexible tool that detects epistasis on various biological_models the individual genetic effect_size on the interactive effect of the gem enables one to infer the hierarchical relationships between the genes the optimal solutions for best fitted parameters to the data and the statistical_approach for identifying the hierarchical relationship are provided to justify the lack of fishers model and to assess the proposed model we conducted simulation_studies designed with the various epistatic settings in the simulation_studies we showed the epistatic situations that fishers model lacks the ability to detect and the outstanding performance of the proposed model comparing fishers model furthermore we applied the model to human_brain data on schizophrenia the assessment with the real_biological is not easy due to the lack of a well known grounded truth however the clear epistatic evidences are shown by the significance_test the expansion of the proposed method to the epistasis study with more than two genes can be easily achieved in terms of a theory by adding more terms to the model however the genetic_interaction effects with more than two would make the epistasis very complicated and would need more biological putative scenarios furthermore the interpretation of the hierarchical relationship would be challenging intensive future_research is necessary for this issue this exhaustive_search approach is extremely expensive on a whole large_scale genome study however it gives descriptional information of the epistatic model on multiple genes when certain designed targeting genes are given in this article the total scanning of the human_brain data of schizophrenia between snps and genes only susceptible genes in the schizophrenia human_brain data experiment was completed in several minutes with the program implemented by matlab on a personal computer for the whole large_scale genome study the total search_space will be number of snps number of snps number of genes i e snp snp gene which is intractable to investigate whole eqtl epistasis interactions the improvements of its performance can be possible with parallel_computing and distributed systems as well as extending it to a semiexhaustive approach for future_research conflict of interest none declared
