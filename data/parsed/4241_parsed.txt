databases_and signaling gateway molecule pages a data model perspective the signaling gateway molecule pages sgmp database provides highly_structured data on proteins which exist in different functional_states participating in signal_transduction a molecule page starts with a state of a native protein without any modification and or interactions new states are formed with every post_translational or interaction with one or more proteins small_molecules or class molecules and with each change in cellular_location state_transitions are caused by a combination of one or more modifications interactions and translocations which then might be associated with one or more biological_processes in a characterized biological state a molecule can function as one of several entities or their combinations including channel receptor enzyme transcription_factor and transporter we have also exported sgmp data to the biological_pathway exchange biopax and systems_biology sbml as well as in our custom xml availability sgmp is available at www signaling gateway org molecule
