gene_expression gene_selection in microarray survival studies under possibly non proportional_hazards motivation univariate_cox cox is often used to select genes possibly linked to survival with non proportional_hazards nph cox could lead to under or over estimation of effects the effect_size measure c p t t i e the probability that a person randomly_chosen from group g dies earlier than a person from g is independent of the proportional_hazards ph assumption here we consider its generalization to continuous data c and investigate the suitability of c for gene_selection results under ph c is most efficiently estimated by cox under nph c can be obtained by weighted cox_regression whe or a novel method concordance regression con the least biased and most stable estimates were obtained by con we propose to use c as summary measure of effect_size to rank genes irrespective of different types of nph and censoring patterns in recent_years many studies aimed at finding prediction_models which link high_dimensional gene_expression data to a survival_outcome e g a comparative_analysis of methods used in this context can be found in a paper by all these methods are extensions of the basic cox_proportional cox this semi_parametric model assumes that the hazard_rate i tx i of subject i at time t given a row vector x i of log gene_expression is of the formwhere t is an unspecified baseline hazard_function thus the elements of are log hazard_ratios hr associated with a unit increase in log gene_expression or a doubling of gene_expression cox assumes proportional_hazards ph which means that we consider a constant effect of gene_expression on survival over the whole period of follow_up in a typical microarray study comprising a large_number the assumption of ph cannot be verified for each gene though it is unlikely that ph hold for each gene to whom correspondence should be addressed consequently ignoring the ph assumption and applying cox based_methods could lead to under or over estimation for a considerable number of genes meaning that some genes may be falsely declared important for predicting_survival while at the same time relevant_genes are missed if some genes exhibit non proportional_hazards nph then their hrs estimated while ignoring time dependency are not comparable to those of genes with ph or of genes_exhibiting different patterns of nph nonetheless very few theoretical_studies have considered the possibility of nph and its consequences on gene_selection or prediction and to our knowledge its occurrence has never been addressed in applied studies by contrast in classical applications a large body of literature_exists which deals with cox under nph and the importance to cope with the possibility of nph was often emphasized with gene_expression as predictor this has been a neglected area of research and supplementaryshow examples of genes with phs converging hazards ch and diverging hazards dh from the study of for the gene with ph left column the correlation of scaled schoenfeld residuals with the rank of time is close to for the other genes the correlation is considerably larger indicating violation of the ph assumption the middle column ofshows a gene with ch where the effect fades away with time whereas the gene depicted in the right column exhibits dh i e an effect increasing with time in the bhattacharjee study genes with dh are found more often than genes with ch nph may arise from time dependent effects of genes on survival but could also result from model_misspecification e g from omitting a strong clinical covariate or another gene this may particularly happen in univariate_analyses we evaluated cox whe and con by simulating trials assessing the association of gene_expression with survival the first series of simulations aimed at comparing the methods in univariate models considering expression of only one gene the same time univariate evaluation these simulations should reveal differences of the methods in estimating the generalized concordance probability c under ph and various types of nph a second series simulated typical gene_expression studies where we considered a large_number with partly correlated expressions competing for selection in the same study multivariate evaluation we have introduced c a semi_parametric generalization of the well known concordance probability for continuous predictors and page assume that s j t f j t and j t denote the survivor function the density and the hazard_function in group j j at time t under ph we assume that the hazard_ratio is constant over time
