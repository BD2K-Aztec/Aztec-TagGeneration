systems_biology galant a cytoscape_plugin for visualizing data as functional landscapes projected onto biological_networks the network modeling of biological_systems has been demonstrated to be a formidable tool to decipher the collective behavior of various biological_processes however the construction of a biological_network per se is not sufficient to accomplish this task to better understand the biological_systems and their responses it is necessary to extend and complement these networks with data collected from different sources such as gene or protein expression_profiles moreover owing to the human natural strengths in rapid visual pattern_recognition the visualization of these data through maps overlaid on interaction networks would be an efficient way to extract information that could be missed by a purely statistical or numerical approach virtually all existing_tools capable to map data to biological_networks perform this task by coloring the nodes according to data values for a review see although these tools have proven to be useful these colored networks specially the large and dense networksare often noisy and therefore the visual identification of patterns in the data mapped to these networks are difficult to facilitate this task these large colored networks could be transformed in smoothed data maps to the best of our knowledge only the viacomplex an open_source implemented in fortran is currently able to generate smoothed data maps by projecting data as functional landscapes onto biological_networks to expand the collection of tools providing this functionality we developed in this work a cytoscape_plugin version of viacomplex the graph landscape visualization galant although galant provides the same essential functionality found in the original viacomplex its main advantage over viacomplex is the well known versatile network_visualization and data_integration environment provided by cytoscape
