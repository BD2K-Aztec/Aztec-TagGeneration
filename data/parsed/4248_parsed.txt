structural_bioinformatics simicon a web_tool for protein ligand model comparison through calculation of equivalent atomic contacts simicon is a web_server designed for an automated identification of equivalent proteinligand atomic contacts in different conformational models of a complex the contacts are computed with internal coordinate mechanics icm software with respect to molecular symmetry and the results are shown in the browser as text tables and interactive d graphics the web_server can be executed remotely without a browser to allow users to automate multiple calculations docking and virtual ligand screening with crystal_structures or homology_models play_important in the understanding of receptorligand interactions with numerous applications in drug_discovery a critical requirement for any useful application of docking algorithms is their ability to find accurate poses of the ligand and its contacts with the receptor atoms the validation of the geometry of a complex or pose prediction is based on the ability to reproduce the binding_mode of a ligand observed in the cognate reference x_ray or nmr_structure the precision of the models is usually checked with the root_mean deviation rmsd a popular measure that accounts for the distances of the ligand atoms of the model from the ligand atoms in the reference structure to provide an example in small_molecule docking context a heavy atom rmsd with respect to the reference pose is widely_accepted as good rmsd however has shortcomings that can lead to misclassification of both correct and incorrect poses for instance although a low rmsd value is indicative of a strong similarity it does not show how well the critical interactions are conserved in this regard literature contains numerous examples where hydrogen_bond interaction_patterns differ between reference and model despite having low rmsd values conversely a high rmsd might come from differences in a flexible region of the ligand not important for the overall binding_mode or from a nearly correct pose of a
