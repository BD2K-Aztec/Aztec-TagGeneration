genome_analysis site identification in high_throughput rna protein interaction data motivation post_transcriptional and co transcriptional_regulation is a crucial link between genotype and phenotype the central players are the rna_binding and experimental_technologies such as cross_linking with immunoprecipitation clip and rip_seq for probing their activities have advanced rapidly over the course of the past_decade statistically_robust flexible computational_methods for binding_site identification from high_throughput immunoprecipitation assays are largely lacking however results we introduce a method for site identification which provides four key_advantages over previous methods i it can be applied on all variations of clip and rip_seq technologies ii it accurately models the underlying read_count distributions iii it allows external covari ates such as transcript_abundance which we demonstrate is highly_correlated with read_count to inform the site identification process and iv it allows for direct comparison of site usage across cell_types or conditions availability_and we have implemented our method in a software_tool called piranha originally_thought simply to be a vehicle for the transport of genetic_information rna has come to be seen as a crucial nexus for eukaryotic diversity and control of expression the mechanisms which govern this are diverse and include splicing localization polyadenylation and the control of both transcript stability and abundance rna_binding rbps which associate with rna through specialized protein_domains called rna binding_domains drive these processes the activities of these proteins can be complex and involve not only other proteins but also other rna species the functions of some rbps are so essential that perturbation of their activity can lead to remarkable phenotypic changes chenard understanding the functions and mechanisms of the many rbps is one of the key_challenges currently facing cellular_biology despite tremendous recent_progress there are still many unanswered_questions perhaps the most direct approach to profiling these interactions is the immunoprecipitation of the rbp of interest through a process similar in principle to chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip modern high_throughput immunoprecipitation assays for proteinrna interaction can trace their lineage back to rip_chip an array based assay cross_linking with immunoprecipitation clip extended upon the success of rip_chip by introducing ultraviolet cross_linking of the protein to the rna and more stringent washing to increase specificity though potentially at the cost of reduced sensitivity more recently clip has been coupled with high_throughput hits_clip to enable a much greater range and depth of coverage further improvements to allow single_nucleotide have been achieved by iclip and photoactivatable ribonucleoside enhance clip par_clip variants there are substantial challenges to be overcome in terms of the effective analysis of clip_seq data however in this article our focus is on site identification or peak_calling which is the crucial step that follows mapping of reads to a reference and deals with identifying those genomic_locations that are true protein interaction sites for simplicity we refer to this step as site identification regardless of the resolution that is to say the process may be as coarse_grained as calling target_transcripts or as fine_grained as identifying sites at a single nucleotide level we begin by outlining three key_challenges in rbp site identification the first is intrinsic to the peak_calling process many sites to which reads map only receive a very small number of reads and are likely noise the levels of noise may be far from negligible and have multiple causes the sequenced sample may contain rna that has not been cross_linked to a protein or alternatively that was cross_linked to some different protein but pulled down through antibody cross_reactivity in addition to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com reads can map to non target_transcripts due to sequencing_errors or mapping problems effective use of the data requires separating these noise sites or false_positives from functional sites most studies explicitly or implicitly assume read_counts at individual sites follow a particular distribution and use this distribution to determine the probability of seeing a given number of reads at a site by chance however there has been no large_scale analysis of clip and rip_seq data to determine the most appropriate choice of distribution to model these counts the second challenge is somewhat more esoteric the proportion of total reads falling in a given transcript does not give the probability of that transcript being a target but rather informs the probability that a bound rna is of that transcript no knowledge of the number of unbound copies is available and hence the rbps preference for that transcript is not directly discernible this is true at higher resolutions also reads accumulate in transcripts in proportion not only to the rbps preference for that transcript but also the transcript_abundance this is in contrast to chip where there is in general no variation in multiplicity between different parts of the genome the final challenge we consider is that of incorporating external_information into the peak_calling process there are a number of types of external_information but here we consider what is essentially control data we give details of other external_information in supplementary_material previous_studies involving clip_seq data have applied a range of different approaches to site identification because of the high_fidelity of the clip assay it is possible to side step the problem and retain all sites this does not allow for the filtering of noise interactions another simple approach is to take the top n sites under some scoring such as normalized read_count this requires selecting a threshold usually arbitrarily and clearly prevents comparing the number of sites between rbps or conditions more sophisticated methods_employ a simulation of the clip_seq experiment assuming no site_specific preference and use this to arrive at a false_discovery for any given peak_height although this allows for consideration of transcript_abundance there is no mechanism to explicitly adjust for other sequencing biases and the approach is not applicable to situations where a second condition or control is available e g rip_seq finally some site identification methods intrinsically consider information specific to a particular immunoprecipitation assay although these have been highly_successful they cannot be applied in the more general setting several databases of clip_seq data also exist for example clipz starbase and dorina the latter two focuses on microrna mirna rbp interactions clipz and starbase group reads into clusters but do not perform any further site identification in contrast dorina uses a site identification strategy for par_clip that relies upon t to c conversions at the cross_link site but is unable to automatically score or rank sites from rip_seq or other clip_seq variants we present a method for site identification that is applicable across the three commonly used clip_seq variants and in addition can be applied to rip_seq data for which to our knowledge no peak_calling tools currently exist our method addresses each of the three challenges outlined earlier effectively modeling the underlying distribution utilizing transcript_abundance information and flexibly allowing the incorporation of external data further we demonstrate how such a tool can be applied to answer more advanced biological_questions regarding rbp binding_sites that vary in usage between different cell_types conditions or stages of development hits coupled with immunoprecipitation assays have provided an unprecedented level of accuracy in identifying the targets and binding_sites for rbps despite this the data collected from such experiments require some considerable care to extract the most meaningful_information from it within this article we have highlighted three challenges that are presented when attempting to identify proteinrna interactions sites in high_throughput immunoprecipitation sequencing_data selecting the correct distribution for modeling reads dealing with the transcript_abundance bias and incorporating additional external_information into the peak_calling process we introduced piranha a peak_calling tool based on the zero truncated negative_binomial regression_model that is able to incorporate external_information to guide the site identification process we demonstrated that transcript_abundance influences the read_counts at sites in ip datasets that piranha can successfully incorporate rna_seq control data to ameliorate this bias and that by considering this additional information more accurate peak calls are arrived at we also showed that our method can be applied across all of the currently existing clip_seq technologies and also handles the more complex case of rip_seq data finally we also demonstrated piranhas application to more complex biological_questions involving multiple cell_types conditions stages of development or species
