dissco direct imputation of summary_statistics allowing covariates downloaded from background imputation of individual_level genotypes at untyped markers using an external reference_panel of genotyped or sequenced individuals has become standard practice in genetic_association direct imputation of summary_statistics can also be valuable for example in meta_analyses where individual_level genotype data are not available two methods dist and impg summary ld that assume a multivariate_gaussian for the association summary_statistics have been proposed for imputing association summary_statistics however both methods assume that the correlations between association summary_statistics are the same as the correlations between the corresponding genotypes this assumption can be violated in the presence of confounding covariates methods we analytically show that in the absence of covariates correlation among association summary_statistics is indeed the same as that among the corresponding genotypes thus serving as a theoretical justification for the recently_proposed methods we continue to prove that in the presence of covariates correlation among association summary_statistics becomes the partial_correlation of the corresponding genotypes controlling for covariates we therefore develop direct im putation of summary_statistics allowing covariates dissco results we consider two real_life scenarios where the correlation and partial_correlation likely make practical difference i association studies in admixed_populations ii association studies in presence of other confounding covariate s application of dissco to real_datasets under both scenarios shows at least comparable if not better performance compared with existing correlation based_methods particularly for lower frequency variants for example dissco can reduce the absolute deviation from the truth by for variants with minor_allele recent large international efforts including the international_hapmap and the genomes_project have provided comprehensive catalogs of genetic_variants and linkage_disequilibrium ld patterns in various populations around the world using these publicly_available data as reference_panels imputation of individual genotypes at untyped variants has facilitated recent genome_wide gwas and meta_analysis therefore when individual_level genotype data are available in study samples it has become a standard practice to perform genotype_imputation unfortunately individual_level genotype data are not always available particularly in multisite meta_analysis gwass that can include many individual study gwass the process of gathering proper institutional human subjects research approval including formal data_sharing agreements can be very time consuming association summary_statistics on the other hand are routinely available and are not subject to the same human subjects research bottlenecks two methods have been proposed recently to directly impute association summary_statistics at untyped markers in the absence of individual_level genotypes both methods assume the summary_statistics across typed and untyped markers follow a multivariate_gaussian gaussian models have been routinely used in other related genetic applications for both imputation_methods using association summary_statistics the correlation_structure between the summary_statistics is estimated based on the ld_structure between the corresponding markers in an external reference_panel s both methods assume that the correlations between the association summary_statistics are the same as the correlations between the genotypes at the corresponding markers in this study we provide a general analytical proof that in the absence of confounding covariates estimating the covariance_structure between summary_statistics using marker ld_information between the corresponding markers is reasonable however in practice confounding covariates are often present in particular we consider two scenarios association studies including genetically admixed individuals scenario i and association studies in the presence of general confounders scenario ii in scenario i the underlying ld between markers among participants in the usually cosmopolitan reference_panel obtained from the public_domain likely differs from the corresponding ld among subjects in the study sample in scenario ii we consider the presence of general confounder covariates or mediators such as socialeconomic factors environmental_factors etc which are inevitable in real association studies for example the adjustment of body_mass bmi for association with risk with diabetes smoking with lung_cancer duffy dose for white_blood wbc just to name a few for scenario i we propose to use the top principal_components pcs to adjust the correlation estimates for scenario ii we develop a unified_framework for dissco to deal with general confounders and mediators two recent_studies have proposed methods for direct imputation of summary_statistics that approach the quality of gold_standard genotype based imputation at reduced computational costs these methods are valuable particularly for meta_analysis studies when individual_level genotypes are not readily available both methods assume summary association_statistics follow multivariate gaussian_distributions with the correlations between the summary_statistics being the same as the correlations between the corresponding marker genotypes that are estimated from publicly_available reference_panels in this study we show analytically that in the presence of confounders the correlation_matrix among the summary_statistics is the partial correlation_matrix among the corresponding markers conditional on the confounders with this theoretical underpinning we propose dissco for direct imputation of summary_statistics accommodating confounding covariates we consider two scenarios where covariate_adjustment can be helpful if not necessary in the study of admixed samples and in the presence of other known risk_factors and mediators the first scenario presents the challenge of estimating the correlation_matrix appropriate for admixed samples using cosmopolitan reference_panels commonly available in the public_domain rather than a single wellmatched reference dataset our solution of using pcs can be interpreted as sample adjusted weighting of the reference individuals for the estimation of the correlation_structure our pc based solution in this scenario of admixed samples also effectively transforms the issue into the need of controlling for the special covariates pcs thus enabling the unified dissco framework under both scenarios for practical usage scenario i entails the estimation of pcs for the reference individuals which can be achieved either by performing pc analysis on the study and reference samples together which is commonly conducted in studies involving admixed samples or when pca is performed on study samples only one could choose to project the top pcs in the same manner as general covariates results presented in supplementary_material s dissco leads to more noticeable gains for lower frequency variants we believe this is largely due to the smaller number of ld tags variants in high_ld for lower frequency variants compared with that for more common_variants for example based on the genomes phase datasets we found on average ld tags at ld r threshold of for low_frequency variants maf and ld tags on average for common_variants maf among individuals with european asian african_ancestry since not every marker is affected by confounding covariates when estimating partial correlations with more ld tags a common_variant is less susceptible to the inaccurate estimation of clhns dataset accommodating general covariates scatter plots comparing true z statistics to the corresponding imputed z statistics from dissco and three competing_methods for markers passing post imputation quality filteringbest performing methods are highlighted as bold the estimated accuracy of association summary_statistics is compared across different methods using three metrics d d and r smaller d smaller d and larger r reflect better estimation the values in parentheses are the relative improvements of dissco over dist impg summary impg summaryld partial_correlation for a subset of its ld tags than is a low_frequency variant in supplementary_material s we use simulations to illustrate that the performance of methods based on either the partial or marginal correlation increases with the number of ld tags and more importantly that additional information from covariates leads to relatively more gains when the number of ld tags is smaller computationally following impg summary ld dissco also divides each chromosome into non overlapping blocks with predetermined length mb by default assume there are p p t p ut markers including p t typed and p ut untyped markers n study individuals in the study sample n refer individuals in reference_sample and s covariates after obtaining z t z statistics at typed markers imputation of summary_statistics involves some of the following steps i calculation of the reference correlation_matrix r unadj ii calculation of the sample correlation_matrix between typed markers iii generation of reference_sample pseudo covariates iv calculation of reference_sample partial correlations and v actual imputation via the following formula where the subscript differs across methods as detailed in section and vi the normalization of imputed values all methods need step v dist also needs i impg summary also needs i and vi impg summaryld also needs i ii and iv and dissco also needs i iii and iv computational_complexity of i vi is respectively detailed in supplementary_material s we report inthe computing time for each of the steps in the real_data on a ghz intel r xeon r processor real_time using actual software implementation is also reported the dist software takes the longest mainly for two reasons i it re calculates the reference correlation_matrix within a window of markers for every untyped marker and ii it uses numerical integration to calculate p values from z scores in contrast impgsummary has an efficient implementation at the cost heavy i o burden thousands of small intermediate files written to and read from hard_disk memory_consumption was comparable across the different software with gb maximum ram for all the real_data experiments there are multiple other factors that affect performance among them the important ones are i window_size ii regularization and iii normalization specifically a larger window_size tends to improve performance by providing more information however a larger window_size also means increased computational_cost including a larger number of typed markers does not guarantee better results because the larger number of markers is more likely to make the correlation_matrix singular as noted by the impgsummary ld development team regularization alleviates this issue by adjusting for statistical noise in the estimation of the covariance_matrix in the reference_sample following their work dissco also uses mb as default window_size with regularization the normalization procedure in impg summary ld improves_performance in small samples since our focus in this article is on the improvement of using partial correlations instead of marginal correlations we compare our method to existing_methods using the default parameter_values we have primarily focused our performance_comparisons between dissco and existing_methods by comparing accuracies of summary z statistics to their true_values since dissco directly imputes association_statistics it is also critical to establish its validity following we generated real_data based null datasets and found that dissco maintains the desired type_i across a range of nominal values with our default level of regularization k supplementary_materials s and tables s ad the corresponding method software row reports the actual time by directly using dist v impg summary v and dissco v software implementation na in the impgsummaryld column is because it does not allow missing_values in the sample genotypes unlike imputation for individual genotypes the selection of a reference_panel matching the study sample is much more crucial for the accurate imputation of association summary_statistics because the correlation_structure from the reference_sample as a whole instead of individual haplotypes are used in the calculations although when the reference and study samples are similar these methods for direct imputation of association_statistics tend to work well prudency is warranted as discussed in as an illustration our simulation_studies using a mismatched reference_panel the eur haplotypes from the genomes_project for the clhns dataset resulted in inflated type_i when using our default level of regularization supplementary finally a key_step in dissco is the projection of covariates into the reference based on genotypes of typed markers as top pcs capture a large amount the variation in these genotypes it is conceptually natural to anticipate that projection based on the top pcs thus completely bypassing the need of individual_level genotypes might achieve_similar performance gains we indeed have observed comparable_performance gains using the top pcs as compared with using general covariates in the admixed dataset additional analysis in the clhns dataset using only the top five pcs also showed near identical results as in identical up to the third digit after the decimal point using all three measures i e d d and r although a certain degree of information_loss is possible due to discarding information not captured by the top pcs we recommend using the top pcs as a convenient substitute for actual covariate projection when individual_level genotypes are not available in summary we provide analytical justifications for two methods recently_proposed for the imputation of association summary_statistics in the absence of confounding covariates we further extend the analytical work in the presence of confounders and propose a method accordingly to accommodate confounding covariates our proof_of simulations and applications to two real_datasets demonstrate the value of our method dissco particularly for lowfrequency variants our method is implemented_in and freely_available
