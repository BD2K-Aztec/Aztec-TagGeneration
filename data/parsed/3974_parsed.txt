genome_analysis repfdr a tool for replicability analysis for genome_wide identification of single_nucleotide that are associated with a phenotype in more than one study is of great scientific interest in the genome_wide gwas research the empirical_bayes approach for discovering whether results have been replicated across studies was shown to be a reliable method and close to optimal in terms of power results the r package repfdr provides a flexible implementation of the empirical_bayes approach for replicability analysis and meta_analysis to be used when several studies examine the same set of null_hypotheses the usefulness of the package for the gwas community is discussed availability_and the r package repfdr can be downloaded from cran contact replicating findings in genome_wide gwas research is important for two main reasons first gwas are observational_studies and therefore there is always a danger that bias may explain away the discoveries if a finding is replicated in more than one study it is more convincingly not due to bias second finding the associations that are common in more than one population is scientifically interesting a replicability analysis is primarily useful in the situation where a gwas meta_analysis is used at a primary or discovery stage to suggest single_nucleotide snps to test in additional follow_up studies the snps that exhibit a strong evidence for replicated associations across the studies in the primary stage need not be followed up as the replicability of association has already been established for example in the associations of snps in gene tcf l with type_diabetes in the studies considered in the primary stage produced a strong evidence of replicability even when faced with the many snps examined at this stage and therefore there was no need to follow_up on this gene the meta_analysis in the primary stage may identify snps that have not been discovered in the replicability analysis of the primary stage studies this does not imply the absence of true replicated association as it could be the result of small effect_size and or limited sample_size i e lack of statistical_power on the other hand it could also be because of the effect not being replicated as a discovered association in a meta_analysis may be entirely driven by a single study if a p value is close to zero in one study the association will be significant in a metaanalysis even if there is no association in all the other studies using a follow_up study or replication stage the replicability of association may be verified seefor methods to establish replicability from follow_up studies heller and yekutieli present an empirical_bayes approach to replicability analysis they estimate the probability that the association was replicated in the same direction in at least two studies and declare as having replicated associations the snps with estimated probability small enough so that the estimated bayes fdr is at most q e g q for each snp the null state is that the association is replicated in the same direction in at most one study more generally heller andshow how to test different null states according to the interest of the user where meta_analysis corresponds to the null state of no association in all the studies they verify the optimality and fdr control of this approach in extensive simulations and demonstrate its usefulness and power in detecting snps that are associated with type_diabetes in several studies here we present the r package repfdr that provides a flexible and efficient implementation of the method in heller and yekutieli
