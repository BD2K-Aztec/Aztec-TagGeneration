genome_analysis trowel a fast and accurate error_correction module for illumina sequencing_reads motivation the ability to accurately read the order of nucleotides in dna and rna is fundamental for modern biology errors in next_generation can lead to many artifacts from erroneous genome_assemblies to mistaken inferences about rna_editing uneven coverage in datasets also contributes to false corrections result we introduce trowel a massively parallelized and highly_efficient error_correction module for illumina read data trowel both corrects erroneous base calls and boosts base qualities based on the k_mer spectrum with high_quality k_mers and relevant base information trowel achieves high_accuracy for different short_read sequen_cing applications the latency in the data path has been significantly_reduced because of efficient data access and data_structures in performance_evaluations trowel was highly_competitive with other tools regardless of coverage genome_size read_length and fragment_size availability_and trowel is written in c and is provided under the general_public v gplv it is available at http trowelreads produced by current next_generation typically suffer from relatively high base error_rates to improve downstream_analyses it is desirable to correct sequencing_errors directly after base_calling the most widely_applied error_correction methods rely on k_mer spectrum based_algorithms following the spectral alignment sa approach a k_mer occurring more often than a given threshold is called solid or trusted and a less frequent k_mer is named weak the goal of the sa approach is to maximize the number of solid calls quake a widely used error_correction module applies a mixed model of the distributions of solid and weak calls incorporating quality values it identifies the set of corrections that maximizes the number of k_mers using a maximum_likelihood approach another k merbased method musket uses two stage corrections with similarity to trowels two methods musket corrects bases depending on frequencies of k_mers and does not use base qualities coral salmela and schr oder collects similar reads into groups and performs multiple_alignments on them it can correct indels by using the needleman wunsch algorithm owing to the alignment complexity this method is not favorable for large_datasets yet another approach is to build a suffix_array or trie for example hybrid shrec can correct indels by detecting and replacing low weight nodes the weight of a node indicates the number of cohort edges in a suffix trie here we introduce a new k merbased error_correction module trowel suitable for illumina datasets the key difference to other tools is that instead of relying on the uniformity of sequencing_coverage which fluctuates stochastically or inherently trowel trusts in sequences with continuously high_quality values we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of trowel with several datasets and compare it with other available read correction tools we performed our evaluations on paired_end arabidopsis_thaliana reads generated in house and on illumina datasets referenced in for escherichia_coli staphylococcus_aureus saccharomyces_cerevisiae and drosophila_melanogaster supplementary we assessed runtime and accuracy in several applications and summarized all local ranks of each metric in a sum ofrank table trowel was scored consistently as one of the top two tools and was among the two most accurate tools for high coverage datasets supplementary section s trowel has a better performance than the other tools with genome_assemblies on high coverage datasets while on low coverage datasets the alignment based tool coral outperformed all other k merbased methods including trowel when the coverage is highly_variable i e for transcriptomes the dataset is particularly hard to correct because low coverage sequences cannot be equated with higher likelihood of errors in transcriptome mapping evaluation for a human dataset seecer achieved the best performance supplementary section s aside from this specialized tool trowel obtained the best read accuracy but was slightly worse in base accuracy than coral only trowel improved transcriptome quantification for the other tools including seecer the performance was worse than the uncorrected cases for snp_calling evaluations trowel showed the highest concordance with high coverage datasets in three of four cases supplementary section s finally trowel was the only tool that consistently generated expected results with simulated_datasets for an erroneous basenext to repeats problem supplementary section s concerning runtime trowel outperformed all other tools for all datasets being up to times_faster detailed results are provided in supplementary data
