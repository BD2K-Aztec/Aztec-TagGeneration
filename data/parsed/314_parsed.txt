an efficient hierarchical generalized linear_mixed for pathway analysis of genome_wide in genome_wide gwas of complex_diseases genetic_variants having real but weak associations often fail to be detected at the stringent genome_wide significance_level pathway analysis which tests disease association with combined association_signals from a group of variants in the same pathway has become increasingly popular however because of the complexities in genetic data and the large_sample in typical gwas pathway analysis remains to be challenging we propose a new statistical_model for pathway analysis of gwas this model includes a fixed_effects component that models mean disease association for a group of genes and a random_effects component that models how each genes association with disease varies about the gene group mean thus belongs to the class of mixed_effects results the proposed model is computationally_efficient and uses only summary_statistics in addition it corrects for the presence of overlapping genes and linkage_disequilibrium ld via simulated and real gwas data we showed our model improved power over currently available pathway analysis methods while preserving type_i furthermore using the wtccc type_diabetes t d dataset we demonstrated mixed model analysis identified meaningful biological_processes that agreed well with previous_reports on t d therefore the proposed methodology provides an efficient statistical_modeling framework for systems analysis of gwas availability the software code for mixed models analysis is freely_available biostat mc vanderbilt edu lilywang genome_wide gwas have become a main approach for identifying disease genes these studies examine large_numbers of genetic_polymorphisms across the genome in hundreds_or of samples at a time so_far gwas have to whom correspondence should be addressed identified many genetic_variants statistically associated with diseases or traits however for complex_diseases typically individual genetic_variants only have weak marginal_effects on disease risk even for real associations therefore after multiple comparison adjustment for the large number of tests performed in gwas real but weak associations are likely to be missed by the conventional strategy of considering only the most significant hits to help increase power and to better understand the disease mechanisms_underlying complex_diseases several recent_studies considered gwas pathway analysis gwaspa these approaches test for effects of groups of genetic_variants that belong to the same biological_pathway such as those defined in kyoto_encyclopedia kegg or gene_ontology databases the underlying assumption is that complex_diseases are likely to be caused by changes in activities in biological_pathways where a number of mutations in different genes each contributes a modest amount to disease_predisposition but works together to cause major disruption in normal biological_processes higher power in pathway based analysis is achieved by combining weak signals from a number of individual genetic_variants in the pathway recently a number of gwaspa approaches such as the modified gene_set gsea algorithm have been proposed typically to preserve correlation patterns between genes p values are estimated by permuting sample labels however for a typical gwas the recalculation of test_statistics for half a million or more single_nucleotide snps with hundreds or even thousands of samples for each permutation is extremely computationally_intensive in addition a recent review comments the permutation studies that are currently being conducted require raw genotype data which are not always available an important methodological improvement would make the p values alone and not raw_data the basis of analysis in gwaspa when raw genotype data are not available a simple and popular_approach for pathway analysis is an over representation analysis based on fishers_exact this method condenses test statisticspage
