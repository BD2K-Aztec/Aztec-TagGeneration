supervised de_novo reconstruction of metabolic_pathways from metabolome scale compound sets motivation the metabolic_pathway is an important biochemical reaction_network involving enzymatic_reactions among chemical_compounds however it is assumed that a large number of metabolic_pathways remain_unknown and many reactions are still missing even in known pathways therefore the most important challenge in metabolomics is the automated de_novo reconstruction of metabolic_pathways which includes the elucidation of previously_unknown reactions to bridge the metabolic gaps results in this article we develop a novel method to reconstruct metabolic_pathways from a large compound set in the reaction filling framework we define feature_vectors representing the chemical transformation patterns of compoundcompound pairs in enzymatic_reactions using chemical fingerprints we apply a sparsity induced classifier to learn what we refer to as enzymatic_reaction likeness i e whether compound pairs are possibly converted to each other by enzymatic_reactions the originality of our method lies in the search for potential reactions among many compounds at a time in the extraction of reaction related chemical transformation patterns and in the large_scale applicability owing to the computational_efficiency in the results we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method on the de_novo reconstruction of metabolic_pathways in kyoto_encyclopedia kegg our comprehensively predicted reaction_networks of compounds enable us to suggest many potential pathways and to increase research productivity in metabolomics availability softwares are available on request supplementary_material are available atthe importance of metabolomics research is growing fast in recent_years metabolomics can provide sensitive and thorough metabolic signatures as effective biomarkers for the diagnosis of diseases such as cancer the knowledge about metabolism e g reaction_networks fluxes drug_metabolism has proven useful for performing rational_drug some metabolites of plants and fungi have long been of vital use to drug leads in the pharmaceutical_industry in addition systematic simulation_studies on metabolic_pathways rely on accurately predefined reaction_network models however a large number of metabolic_pathways remain_unknown and many reaction_steps are still missing even in known pathways for example detailed analysis of human metabolome implies that even wellinvestigated species like human have many unknown metabolic_pathways as the experimental_verification of reaction_networks remains daunting there is a strong need to develop in silico methods to infer unknown but possible metabolic_pathways a variety of computational_methods for reconstructing metabolic_pathways have been developed thus far which can be categorized into the three frameworks as shown in the most traditional one is reference based framework in this framework many known pathways are collected from literatures to construct a combined pathway named reference pathway which only considers chemical_transformations without distinguishing the difference of organisms left for an organism of interest enzyme genes are assigned to appropriate positions in predefined reference pathways based on orthologous information and some other evidences if available about genes across different species right however such reference pathway_information is available only for a limited set of genes enzymes and metabolites and it is inherently incomplete owing to the lack of experimentally_identified compounds and homology_information these missing reaction_steps may cause misleading interpretations in practice therefore the most important challenge in metabolomics research is de_novo reconstruction of metabolic_pathways which includes the elucidation of previously_unknown reactions to bridge the metabolic gaps the previous_studies on the de_novo reconstruction can be classified based on different aspects i e whether it automatically hypothesizes the compounds that are not identified yet whether it relies on pre defined chemical transformation patterns and whether the target and or source compound s has have to be specified as shown in one framework is compoundfilling framework which predicts pathways by hypothesizing intermediate compounds necessary between the source and target_compounds many of the prediction systems based on this framework are not freely_available but there are some free to whom correspondence should be addressed we presented a novel de_novo metabolic_pathway method in the reaction filling framework the proposed method does not require manually predefined rules i e it automatically learns a statistical_model to predict enzymatic_reaction likeness for any compound pairs based on all possible existing knowledge this method can deal with any compounds even if they are not found in kegg as long as they are represented in chemical fingerprints an advantage of our method lies in finding potential reactions among many compounds at a time the previous study used graph isomorphism which contributed to the accuracy of the method but took much more calculation time the current study used fingerprints instead of graph isomorphism to improve calculation time and deal with vast amount of compounds for more accurate prediction we are going to develop the two step prediction where fingerprints are applied to filter out vast amount of negative pairs in the first step and graph isomorphism is applied to refine the predicted pairs in the second step in principle our method i e reaction filling framework is insufficient to correctly predict a multi_step pathway which can be better dealt with the other framework i e compoundfilling framework this does not imply which framework is superior these two frameworks can complement each other for more successful de_novo metabolic_pathway we assume the proposed study is an important preliminary step toward the hybrid framework further improvement of the de_novo metabolic_pathway method would enable the on demand integration of reaction_network and gene or protein networks derived from metabolome and other omics e g genome transcriptome and proteome
