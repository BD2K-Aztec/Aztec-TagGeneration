sequence_analysis a statistical_framework for snp_calling mutation discovery association_mapping and population genetical parameter_estimation from sequencing_data most existing_methods for dna sequence_analysis rely on accurate sequences or genotypes however in applications of the next_generation ngs accurate genotypes may not be easily_obtained e g multi sample low_coverage or somatic_mutation discovery these applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence_data with uncertainty results we present a statistical_framework for calling snps discovering somatic_mutations inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing_data without explicit genotyping or linkage based imputation on real_data we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative_methods for estimating site allele count for inferring allele frequency_spectrum and for association_mapping we also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic_mutations and confirm that for discovering rare_events mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors availability the genomes_project genomes sets an excellent example on how to design a sequencing project to get the maximum output pertinent to human populations an important lesson from this project is to sequence many human samples at relatively low coverage instead of a few samples at high coverage we adopt this strategy because with higher_coverage we will mostly reconfirm information from other reads but with more samples we will be able to reduce the sampling fluctuations gain power on variants present in multiple samples and get access to many more rare_variants on the other hand sequencing_errors counteract the power in variant_calling which necessitates a minimum coverage the optimal balancing point is broadly regarded to be in the fold range per sample depending on the sequencing_error level of linkage_disequilibrium ld and the purpose of the project a major_concern with this design is that at fold coverage per sample non reference alleles may not always be covered by sequence_reads especially at heterozygous loci calling variants from each individual and then combining the calls usually yield poor results the preferred strategy is to enhance the power of variant discovery by jointly considering all samples this strategy largely solves the variant discovery problem but acquiring accurate genotypes for each individual remains unsolved without accurate genotypes most of the previous methods e g testing hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe and association_mapping would not work to reuse the rich methods developed for genotyping_data the genomes_project proposes to impute genotypes utilizing ld across loci suppose at a site a one sample has a low coverage if some samples at a have high coverage and there exists a site b that is linked with a and has sufficient sequence support we can transfer information across sites and between individuals and thus make a reliable inference for the low coverage sample at a the overall genotype accuracy can be greatly_improved however imputation is not without potential concerns first imputation cannot be used to infer the regional allele frequency_spectrum afs because imputation as of now can only be applied to candidate variant sites while we need to consider non variants to infer afs second the effectiveness of imputation depends on the pattern of ld which may lead to potential_bias in population genetical inferences third the current imputation algorithms are slow for a thousand samples the fastest algorithm may be slower than read_mapping algorithms which is frequently the bottleneck of analyzing ngs_data h m kang personal communication considering more samples and using more accurate algorithms will make imputation even slower these potential concerns make us reconsider if imputation is always preferred we notice that we perform imputation mainly to reuse the methods developed for genotyping_data but would it be possible to derive new methods to solve classical medical and population genetical problems without precise genotypes another application of ngs that requires genotype data is to discover somatic_mutations or germline_mutations between a few related samples for such an application samples are often sequenced to high coverage although it is not hard to achieve an error_rate one per bases mutations occur at a much lower rate typically of the order of or even naively calling genotypes and then comparing samples frequently would not work well because subtle uncertaintypage
