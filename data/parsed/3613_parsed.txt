sequence_analysis pore an r package for the visualization and analysis of nanopore sequencing_data the oxford nanopore minion device represents a unique sequencing_technology as a mobile sequencing device powered by the usb port of a laptop the minion has huge potential applications to enable these applications the bioinformatics community will need to design and build a suite of tools specifically for minion data results here we present pore a package for r that enables users to manipulate organize summarize and visualize minion nanopore sequ encing data as a package for r pore has been tested on windows linux and macosx crucially the windows version allows users to analyse minion data on the windows laptop attached to the device availability_and pore is released as a package for r at http sourceforge net_projects rpore a tutorial and further information are available at https sourceforge relative to first and second_generation single_molecule sequencing is a new science with only helicos pacific_biosciences and oxford nanopore ont being widely available even within the field of single_molecule sequencing onts nanopore sequencing_technology represents a new paradigm while both helicos and pacific_biosciences sequencing_technologies measure incorporation events into a second strand onts minion and gridion systems measure a single_molecule of dna as it passes through a protein nanopore in addition the minion is the worlds first mobile dna_sequencer it is powered by a laptops usb port and measures inches in length recently ont opened up the minion access programme enabling researchers to use the device for the first time the ultra low_cost and mobile nature of the minion device opens up a huge number of applications however users of the device are faced with a number of informatics challenges users of the minion must buy a high specification windows laptop and thus there is a need for windows based software to handle the data the minion outputs binary files in the hdf format http www hdfgroup org hdf these contain raw_data from the sequencer which are then processed by a cloud_based base caller called metrichor the subsequent called sequence files are also in hdf format with the extension fast it is not uncommon for users to be presented with hdf files fast with no software with which to access the data furthermore data from all runs are stored in a single directory with no subdirectories and users find themselves needing to manipulate thousands of files manually which takes time and is error_prone we have developed pore a package for the statistical package r http www r project org r core which enables users to manipulate minion fast files into run folders extract fastq gather statistics on each run and plot a number of key graphs such as read_length histograms and yield over time crucially as a package for r pore is crossplatform and has been tested on windows linux and macosx the windows version enables users to run pore on the minion laptop itself rather than copying the data to a linux server to process with perl or python this key feature brings users closer to true mobile dna_sequencing we have written pore an r package that enables users to more easily manipulate summarize and visualize minion nanopore sequencing_data as a package for r pore is available for both windows and linux and crucially the windows version will allow data analysis on the mandatory windows laptop on which the minion depends in addition r is now a popular statistical package among biologists who may feel comfortable using pore through the r user_interface pore is one of the first bioinformatics packages to offer this necessary functionality poretools a toolkit written in python offers similar functionality although each software has a different set of overlapping functions a table comparing feature_sets is available in the supplementary_information the cross_platform nature of pore its ease of installation and pores ability to organize folders of fast files make pore an important tool for users of the minion device an example output from the plot squiggle function plotted are the events data extracted from a single_read the y axis is the mean electronic signal reported for the pore and the x axis is time in seconds
