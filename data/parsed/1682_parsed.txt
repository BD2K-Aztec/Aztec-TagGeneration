exome based analysis for rna epigenome sequencing_data fragmented rna immunoprecipitation combined with rna_sequencing enabled the unbiased study of rna epigenome at a near single_base however unique features of this new type of data call for novel computational_techniques result through examining the connections of rna epigenome sequencing_data with two well studied data types chip_seq we unveiled the salient characteristics of this new data type the computational strategies were discussed accordingly and a novel data_processing pipeline was proposed that combines several existing_tools with a newly_developed exome based_approach exomepeak for detecting representing and visualizing the post tran scriptional rna modification_sites on the transcriptome availability the matlab_package exomepeak and additional details are available atdespite the unprecedented prosperity in epigenetics studies of dna and histone_modifications with next_generation data the rna epigenetics remains a largely uncharted territory and has not benefitted as much from the advancement in sequencing_technology until lately two recent_studies of transcriptomewide mrna m a methylation proposed a new powerful protocol differently named as m a seq and merip_seq where mrna is fragmented before the immunoprecipitation with anti m a antibody and the immunoprecipitated and input control fragments are then sequenced for reconstructing transcriptome_wide m a methylation_sites this protocol in theory enabled the transcriptome_wide unbiased study of a repertoire of known post_transcriptional rna modifications at a near single_base provided the corresponding antibody is available to unify the nomenclatures we call this protocol frip seq which stands for fragmented rna immunoprecipitation sequencing frip seq is different from rip_seq where full_length rna is subjected to immunoprecipitation for detection of proteinrna interaction in contrast the immunoprecipitation of fragmented rna in frip seq enables the precise prediction of rna modification_sites on the transcriptome from a technological perspective frip seq can be considered a marriage of two relatively well studied techniques chip_seq this new technique brings a host of new computational challenges yet to be adequately_addressed next we discuss briefly the best practice for frip seq data analysis estimating the background from the neighborhood genomic_regions frip seq peak_calling does require a paired input control sample of preferably fragmented rnas before immunoprecipitation as supposed to an immunoglobulin g control sample peak annotation gene and isoform transcripts the association between detected rna modification_sites and the specific mrna_transcripts can be highly problematic recent study shows that with an average of isoforms per gene most genes tend to express multiple_isoforms simultaneously since the sequencing read_length is mostly bp isoform quantification can be difficult not to mention calling peaks for each individual isoform transcript nevertheless an mrna methylation site may be uniquely associated with a transcript when the site spans across the nearest exon s that uniquely belong to that transcript our pipeline was applied to the data from and found at least one rna m a site on genes in hek t cells at a significance_level of p value see the supplementary_material for more details we then retainedfor the protein_coding with at least one m a site at least kb exons and only one refseq transcript of m a sites fall within kb distance to its stop_codon on mrna only the protein_coding with coding length at least kb_long and single refseq isoform and then calculated the geometric distances between each detected m a sites and four transcript landmarks of the respective gene including the start_codon stop_codon transcription starting site and transcription ending site result shows that the m a sites are enriched within kb distance around the stop_codons consistent_with funding the william and ella medical_research foundation grant to mkr national_institutes nih nci p ca to yc national_science ccf to yh qatar national research fund to yc and yh we thank computational support provided by the utsa computational_systems core facility nih rcmi grant g rr conflict of interest none declared
