d tailor automated analysis and design of dna_sequences motivation current_advances in dna_synthesis cloning and sequen_cing technologies afford high_throughput implementation of artificial sequences into living_cells however flexible computational_tools for multi objective sequence design are lacking limiting the potential of these technologies results we developed dna tailor d tailor a fully extendable software framework for property based design of synthetic dna_sequences d tailor permits the seamless_integration of multiple sequence_analysis into a generic monte_carlo that evolves sequences toward any combination of rationally defined properties as proof_of we show that d tailor is capable of designing sequence libraries comprising all possible combinations among three different sequence properties influencing translation efficiency in escherichia_coli the capacity to design artificial sequences that systematically sample any given parameter_space should support the implementation of more rigorous experimental_designs availability source_code is available for download at https source forge net_projects dtailor the accumulation of genomic_data has fueled the development of numerous computational_tools that infer functional behavior from biological_sequences these algorithms essentially capture our understanding of how functional information is encoded in nucleic_acid and protein_sequences as a result molecular_biologists can now access a plethora of sequence_analysis to help them predict functional behaviors from plain sequences common tasks comprise the identification of sequence_motifs from nucleic_acid dna rna or protein_sequences e g promoter or termination activity recombination or splicing sites as well as the computation of sequence properties that are mechanistically linked to particular phenotypes e g codon_usage or propensity to form transmembrane protein_domains such sequence_analysis are usually used to inform biological discovery in natural genomic_sequences however considering recent_advances in dna technologies and the concomitant rise of synthetic_biology applications these same tools may also be leveraged to guide the design of artificial sequences satisfying predefined functions of interest ideally elementary biological_functions should be contained within well defined sequence parts that could be re used with acceptable reliability in different contexts e g however it is becoming increasingly clear that many molecular behaviors result from the combined influence of several sequence determinants that cannot be neatly encapsulated within the physical boundaries of a single part but rather emerge at the interface between the different parts in this context the multidimensional examination of dna_sequences becomes necessary to better capture the inherent complexity of biological_behavior and further enable predictive design of synthetic sequence functions and activities e g rhodius and mutalik valuable sequence design_tools implementing heuristic searches have been successfully developed for multi_objective within specific applications e g protein_synthesis optimization however application of such optimization procedures requires an objective function_relating computed sequence properties to an expected performance score unfortunately the data and models required to describe these relationships are generally not sufficient to support truly reliable functional design interestingly sequence design_tools can also be used upstream of the optimization_process to produce libraries of sequences that are more suited for the development of predictive_models although large_scale studies have mostly used random approaches to introduce variability in the synthetic sequences

commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup comdoe is a general framework that fully integrates planning and analysis phases and comprises three major_steps the first one consists in identifying the factors of interest and defining the range of values for each factor in the case of molecular sequences factors are properties of the primary sequence itself and can be typically identified by reanalysing available functional genomic_data and published mechanistic_studies the second step consists in implementing a particular experimental_design wherein multiple combinations of factor levels are selected to create an experimental dataset providing maximal information to relate the design factors to the response variable s for example one of the most informative doe is the full factorial_design where all possible combinations of factor levels across the different factors are performed the resulting dataset not only permits to estimate the contribution of each factor to the measured response variable but also robustly captures the interactions between the different factors last the third step includes the collection of experimental_data and definition of a model relating the multiple factors to the response variable s of note this can be an iterative process wherein models derived from the third phase can inform the design of a new set of experiments although implementation of experimental_designs systematically varying easily manipulated factors can be straightforward e g growth_medium ph temperature or oxygen_levels the ability to design artificial sequences whose intrinsic_properties can be systematically_varied is not necessarily trivial e g binding_site affinity or the strength of an rna_secondary here we present d tailor an extendable framework supporting integration of multiple sequence_analysis to mine and design biological_sequences d tailor uses a heuristic_search algorithm to enable flexible design of synthetic sequences varying multiple properties of interest so as to satisfy complex doe we have validated our tool by successfully designing artificial sequence libraries conforming to full factorial designs which represent the upper_bound of experimental_design complexity more specifically we have designed libraries systematically varying multiple sequence properties known to impact translation efficiency in e coli to further demonstrate the versatility of the algorithm we also used d tailor to design artificial bacterial promoter_sequences varying multiple cis regulatory_properties see_supplementary
