cssscl a python_package that uses combined sequence similarity_scores for accurate taxonomic_classification of long and short_sequence sequence comparison of genetic_material between known and unknown organisms plays_a in genomics metagenomics and phylogenetic_analysis the emerging long_read sequencing_technologies can now produce reads of tens of kilobases in length that promise a more accurate assessment of their origin to facilitate the classification of long and short dna_sequences we have developed a python_package that implements a new sequence classification model that we have demonstrated to improve the classification_accuracy when compared with other state of the art classification methods for the purpose of validation and to demonstrate its usefulness we test the combined sequence similarity_score classifier cssscl using three different datasets including a metagenomic_dataset composed of short_reads availability_and packages source_code and test datasets are available under the gplv_license at https github com oicr ibc cssscl one important problem in computational molecular_biology is the correct classification of unknown dna_sequences given a database of sequences of known origin next_generation have dramatically accelerated the study of microbial and viral_genomes with the promise of uncovering thousands of previously_unknown species these high_throughput studies have however produced mostly short_read i e reads between and bp in length that present a great challenge for phylogenetic classification and other related metagenomic_analysis or automated genome_assemblies emerging long_read sequencing_technologies such as pacbio rs and oxford nanopore minion can already generate sequences over tens of kb in length that for the first time allow highly_accurate automated assemblies of finished bacterial_genomes in this article we introduce the cssscl package for taxonomic_classification of dna_sequences that implements the classification model presented in our recent paper we describe its features and show its effectiveness at classifying sequences using three different datasets we use three different datasets one viral and two bacterial to demonstrate the ability of the cssscl program to accurately classify dna_sequences the first dataset consists of viral nucleotide_sequences that due to their considerable variability are expected to pose a greater challenge to most phylogenic classification algorithms the entire set of viral_genomes was downloaded from the ncbi refseq database from a total of viral_genomes we selected different genera with at least three different sequence entries per taxon label producing a total of different complete viral_sequences this set of sequences was then split into two using the training and test splits we also required that the training_set contains at least two entries per taxon label at the genus level the training and test_sets produced in this way contained respectively and viral_sequences the second dataset consists of bacterial nucleotide_sequences bacterial dataset i the entire set of bacterial sequences was downloaded from the ncbi refseq database containing refseq complete_genomes from the entire set we selected different genera with at least three different sequence entries per taxon label producing a total of different microbial sequences these sequences were then split into the training and test_sets as explained above containing respectively and bacterial sequences to demonstrate that our program can also classify short_reads we use the metagenomic_dataset bacterial dataset ii miseq introduced in kraken consisting of reads with an average read_length of bp the training_set for this dataset is composed of the entire set of bacterial sequences mentioned above in we compare the performance of cssscl to two other classifiers namely nbc and kraken using the identical training and test_sets we chose nbc for its high_accuracy and for being the most sensitive metagenomics classifier according to bazinet and cummings and kraken for being currently the fastest metagenomics classifier according to wood and salzberg the results presented inshow that cssscl achieves higher_precision and recall or sensitivity than either nbc or kraken when classifying viral_genomes and higher recall or sensitivity when classifying bacterial_genomes for short_reads cssscl outperforms in recall sensitivity both nbc kraken and kraken gb sensitivity as presented in and achieves identical high_precision as kraken but a slightly_lower precision than kraken gb precision as presented in wood and that uses a much larger database we propose a new python_package called cssscl to facilitate the accurate taxonomic_classification of long and short dna_sequences by using three new datasets we confirm the results of our previous_findings and show that the implementation of our model presented inis correct and capable of classifying both viral and bacterial sequences with high_precision and recall and within a reasonable time frame future work will include assessing the performance of additional similarity_measures that could be added to the cssscl package
