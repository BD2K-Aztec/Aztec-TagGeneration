structural_bioinformatics gr align fast and flexible alignment of protein d structures using graphlet_degree similarity motivation protein_structure is key for transferring information from well studied proteins to less studied ones structural_alignment identifies the most precise mapping of equivalent residues as structures are more conserved during evolution than sequences among the methods for aligning protein_structures maximum contact_map overlap cmo has received sustained_attention during the past_decade yet known algorithms exhibit modest performance and are not applicable for large_scale comparison results graphlets are small induced subgraphs that are used to design sensitive topological similarity_measures between nodes and networks by generalizing graphlets to ordered graphs we introduce gr align a cmo heuristic that is suited for database_searches on the proteus set protein domain pairs gr align is several orders_of than the state of the art cmo solvers apurva msvns and aleigen and its similarity_score is in better agreement with the structural_classification of proteins on a large_scale experiment on the gold_standard benchmark_dataset protein domain pairs gr align is several orders_of than the state of the art protein_structure comparison tools tm_align dalilite matt and yakusa while achieving similar classification performances finally we illustrate the difference between gr aligns flexible alignments and the traditional ones by querying a flexible protein in the astral database protein_domains in this experiment gr aligns top scoring alignments are not only in better agreement with structural_classification of proteins but also that they allow transferring more information across proteins
