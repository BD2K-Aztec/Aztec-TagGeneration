detection and characterization of novel sequence insertions using paired_end next_generation motivation in the past_few human_genome structural_variation discovery has enjoyed increased attention from the genomics research_community many studies were published to characterize short insertions deletions duplications and inversions and associate copy_number cnvs with disease detection of new sequence insertions requires sequence_data however the detectable sequence_length with read_pair analysis is limited by the insert_size thus longer sequence insertions that contribute to our genetic_makeup are not extensively researched results we present novelseq a computational framework to discover the content and location of long novel sequence insertions using paired_end sequencing_data generated by the next_generation our framework can be built as part of a general sequence analysis_pipeline to discover multiple types of genetic_variation snps structural_variation etc thus it requires significantly less computational_resources than de_novo sequence_assembly we apply our methods to detect novel sequence insertions in the genome of an anonymous donor and validate our results by comparing with the insertions discovered in the same genome using various sources of sequence_data it is estimated that mb of human genomic_sequence is missing from the human_genome reference assembly although the human_genome hgp revolutionized the field of genomics human sequences that are not represented in the reference_genome leads to incomplete genome analyses the missing sequences can even harbor undiscovered exons or other types of sequences of functional_importance there is a need to discover the loci and content of so_called novel sequence insertions to build a more comprehensive human_reference to better analyze the genomes of individuals from many different populations to date one of the more promising methods to characterize longer dna_segments that are not represented in the human_reference has been building sequence assemblies from unmapped fosmid clone ends sequenced with the traditional sanger based capillary sequencing and then sequencing the entire fosmid clone however the higher cost of the capillary sequencing is prohibitive to characterize genomes of thousands of individuals next_generation ngs_technologies make sequencing of thousands of genomes possible and for the first time they give us the opportunity to discover novel sequences across many human populations in order to build better genome_assemblies or pan genomes various computational_methods were developed in the recent_years to characterize structural_variation including deletions insertions inversions and duplications among human individuals using ngs_platforms characterization of longer novel sequences remained_elusive due to the shorter insert_size and sequence_length associated with the ngs methods for example applying the end sequence profiling approach one cannot discover insertions bp when bp insert_size is used with the illumina_platform currently the only method applicable for the discovery of long novel insertions using ngs_technologies is de_novo sequence_assembly however this approach_requires large computational_resources and requires further processing to anchor the sequences to the reference_genome here we present a computational framework to discover the content of novel sequence insertions using the ngs_platforms we test our methods with the high coverage short insert sequence library generated from the genome of a yoruba african individual na sequenced using the illumina_platform we validate the content of the predicted novel sequence insertions by comparing with sequences generated from fosmid end sequence_assembly full fosmid sequencing and de_novo sequence_assembly of the same illumina whole_genome shotgun wgs library we show that our methods are reliable and together with the cost optimizations introduced by the ngs_platforms they can be a we start by mapping the paired_end to the reference_genome and then classify the paired_end as oea and orphan reads b we then assemble the orphan paired_end using available de_novo algorithms and screen the contigs for possible contamination c we cluster the oea reads into groups and find the insertion locus supported by each oea cluster d we assemble the unmapped end read in each oea cluster the oea reads with different orientation of mapping should be assembled independently e finally we merge the orphan and oea contigs to anchor the orphan contigs to the reference_genome efficiently used to characterize the dna_sequences missing from the reference assembly to obtain a more complete picture of human_genome diversity a novel sequence insertion refers to an insertion of a sequence into the donor genome where no subsequence with high similarity to the inserted sequence exists in the reference_genome we aim to identify novel sequence insertions in a high coverage sequenced donor genome through our computational_pipeline novelseq note that the insertions of repeat sequences such as sines and lines and segmental_duplications do not constitute as novel sequence insertions since paralogs of the same repeat_sequence exists elsewhere in the reference genome_assembly therefore the algorithms presented here will not be able to predict such repeat_sequence insertions unless the inserted sequence is highly_divergent from other existing copies for algorithms specifically_designed for repeat_sequence or more formally transposon_insertion detection see the recent paper by in section we will present the general approach of the novelseq pipeline divided_into five different phases in section we will give the details of our algorithms and finally in section we will discuss the results of the novelseq pipeline
