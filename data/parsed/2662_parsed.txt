genome_analysis large_scale analysis of conserved rare_codon suggests an involvement in co translational molecular recognition_events motivation an increasing amount of evidence from experimental and computational_analysis suggests that rare_codon are functionally_important for protein activity most of the studies on rare_codon were performed on a limited number of proteins or protein_families in the present study we present the sherlocc program and how it can be used for large_scale protein_family analysis of evolutionarily_conserved rare_codon and their relation to protein_function and structure this large_scale analysis was performed using the whole pfam_database covering over of the known protein_sequence universe our program sherlocc detects statistically_relevant conserved rare_codon and produces a user_friendly html output results statistically_significant rare_codon were detected in a multitude of pfam protein_families the most statistically_significant rare_codon were predominantly identified in n_terminal pfam families many of the longest rare_codon are found in membrane related proteins which are required to interact with other proteins as part of their function for example in targeting or insertion we identified some cases where rare_codon can play a regulating role in the folding of catalytically_important domains our results support the existence of a widespread functional role for rare_codon across species finally we developed an online filter_based search interface that provides access to sherlocc results for all pfam families availability the sherlocc program and search interface are open_access and are available at http bcb recent_studies beyond the amino_acid lies an additional layer of information hidden within the codon sequence able to mediate local kinetics of translation in fact synonymous codons that are used with low_frequency tend to have a depleted concentration of trnas thus causing ribosomes to pause at rare codons until the scarce activated trna brings the next amino_acid to the growing polypeptide to whom correspondence should be addressed the observation that rare codons are not randomly_distributed but rather organized in large_clusters across species support the existence of a selective evolutionary_pressure many roles have been proposed to explain the heterogeneity of translational kinetics for example protein_folding is a cotranslational process during which the nascent_polypeptide is in dynamic_interaction with components of the cellular milieu such as the ribosome structure chaperone proteins solvent_molecules and also with its own residues the speed at which the polypeptide_chain grows dictates the time scale within which the translated residues that have already exited the ribosomal channel undergo local folding events helices are somehow an exception as they tend to start forming inside the tunnel in this context while not altering the sequence of the nascent protein synonymous codon changes can lead to distinct folding pathways several studies focused on identifying rare codons in protein_sequences and replacing them with frequent synonymous ones the results were diverse decrease of a proteins specific activity a change in substrate_specificity and a decrease in protein solubility and activation of a gene designed to detect misfolded_proteins for these three studies the results were suggested to be due to alterations in the folding_pathway of the protein it was also observed that slowly translated regions tend to preferentially code for strands and coils whereas faster translated regions tend to code for helices recent work showed that translation speed decreases at the start of secondary_structures in escherichia_coli the ribosomal pauses caused by rare codons can in principle regulate specific folding events but could also be involved in other mechanisms involving the nascent_polypeptide such as protein targeting or co translational molecular recognition_events a study that examined genes of emericella nidulans observed a correlation between the position of hydrophobic stretches predicted to span across a membrane or to be a cleavable signal_sequence and rare_codon suggesting a potential control over membrane_protein targeting or membrane_insertion it was observed that signal_sequences of exported proteins of e coli and salmonella_typhimurium were enriched with rare codons one study suggested that rare codons favored the proper structural arrangement of an helix signal_sequence which ensured that the protein correctly followed its secretion pathway moreover a correlation between the position of rare_codon in mrna
