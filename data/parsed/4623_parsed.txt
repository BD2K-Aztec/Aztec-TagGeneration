the pervasiveness and plasticity of circadian_oscillations the coupled circadian oscillators framework downloaded from motivation circadian_oscillations have been observed in animals plants fungi and cyanobacteria and play a fundamental role in coordinating the homeostasis and behavior of biological_systems genetically_encoded molecular clocks found in nearly every cell based on negative transcription translation feedback_loops and involving only a dozen genes play_a in maintaining these oscillations however high_throughput gene_expression experiments reveal that in a typical tissue a much larger fraction of all transcripts oscillate with the daynight cycle and the oscillating species vary with tissue type suggesting that perhaps a much larger fraction of all transcripts and perhaps also other molecular_species may bear the potential for circadian_oscillations results to better quantify the pervasiveness and plasticity of circadian_oscillations we conduct the first large_scale analysis aggregating the results of circadian transcriptomic studies and circadian metabolomic_studies conducted in mice using different tissues and under different conditions we find that over half of protein_coding in the cell can produce transcripts that are circadian in at least one set of conditions and similarly for measured metabolites genetic or environmental_perturbations can disrupt existing oscillations by changing their amplitudes and phases suppressing them or giving rise to novel circadian_oscillations the oscillating species and their oscillations provide a characteristic signature of the physiological_state of the corresponding cell tissue molecular_networks comprise many oscillator loops that have been sculpted by evolution over two trillion daynight cycles to have intrinsic circadian frequency these oscillating loops are coupled by shared nodes in a large network of coupled circadian oscillators where the clock_genes form a major hub cells can program and reprogram their circadian repertoire through epigenetic and other mechanisms availability_and high_resolution and tissue condition specific circadian data and networks available at http circadiomics circadian_rhythms are pervasive and play_a in ensuring homeostatic balance with the environment and coordinating many aspects of physiology including the sleep_wake eating hormone and neurotransmitter secretion and even memory and cognitive_function eckel disruption of circadian_rhythms has been directly linked to health_problems ranging from cancer to insulin_resistance to diabetes to obesity and to premature ageing research has shown that these circadian_rhythms are genetically_encoded by a molecular_clock found in nearly every cell with a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic_nucleus scn of the hypothalamus coordinating and interacting with peripheral clocks throughout the body central to the cellular clock and the rhythmicity of scn neurons as well as other cells are transcription_factors that drive the expression of their own negative_regulators this results in a negative transcriptional and translational feedback_loop highly_conserved across species that perpetuates oscillations in gene_expression that occur every h in mammals two bhlh transcription_factors clock and bmal heterodimerize and bind to conserved e box sequences in target gene_promoters thus driving the rhythmic expression of mammalian period per per and per and cryptochrome cry and cry genes per and cry proteins form a complex that inhibits subsequent clock bmal mediated gene_expression in short the core of the clock is driven by only a dozen genes in contrast gene_expression experiments reveal that a much larger fraction on the order of of all transcripts in the cell are oscillating in a circadian manner and that the oscillating transcripts differ by cell or tissue type thus the number of oscillating transcripts typically extends beyond the core_clock however the precise extent of this phenomenon or its applicability to other molecular_species such as metabolites has not been investigated_systematically while researchers have looked at the common_denominator the master clock_genes and its interactors little has been done to systematically understand the unique and possibly novel oscillations observed in a specific tissue or under a specific set of perturbations in a recent study where we contrasted the circadian profiles of both transcripts and metabolites in the liver of mice_fed normal_chow and high_fat we noticed considerable_differences associated with a massive reprogramming occurring within the cell by analyzing not only the transcripts and metabolites that lost their circadian_oscillations as a result of the high_fat but also the transcripts and metabolites that gained novel circadian_oscillations as a result of the perturbation we were able to discover compensatory oscillations in important molecular_species like srebp a transcription_factor responsible for lipid_synthesis in combination these results raise several fundamental_questions exactly how pervasive are circadian_oscillations at the molecular level i e how far do they extend beyond the core_clock what is the overlap in circadian_oscillations across different tissues and conditions how flexible and programmable are these oscillations and what are the underlying_mechanisms controlling rhythmicity to begin to address these questions we conduct a large_scale aggregated analysis of multiple circadian transcriptome and metabolome datasets previous gene_expression studies conducted with single conditions have already revealed that a significant fraction of the transcriptome can oscillated in a circadian fashion in simple organisms a third of the transcriptome in the plant arabidopsis_thaliana of the transcriptome in the cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus and almost the entire transcriptome in the marine unicellular alga ostreococcus tauri in a recent independent study conducted in mouse organs of all protein_coding showed circadian_rhythms in transcription somewhere in the body here we have extended these studies by aggregating and analyzing both high_throughput transcriptomic and metabolomic_data in a mammalian system over multiple tissues and conditions revealing that a large fraction of the molecular_species in a mouse cell tissue is capable of circadian_oscillations under at least some set of conditions furthermore while the experiments used here were conducted using tissue_preparations it is reasonable to infer that even more diversity in oscillations would be observed if one were to aggregate experiments done at the level of single cells both within tissues and across tissues as well as many other conditions thus our results provide only lower bounds on the total number of transcripts or metabolites that could be found to oscillate in a circadian manner under at least one set of conditions by the same methods additional non transcriptional circadian_oscillations for instance in the levels of post_translationally proteins arein the clock can drive the oscillations of enzymes and corresponding metabolites in circadiomics users can select an experiment and a specific gene or metabolite and visualize the molecular_network in the vicinity of the corresponding node as well as the time series of the corresponding concentrations each box represents a molecular_species with when available a plot of the time series of its concentration throughout the daynight cycle in the control blue and perturbed condition red the pervasiveness and plasticity of circadian oscillationsalso known to exist o leading us to conjecture that almost any molecular_species in the cell is potentially capable of circadian_oscillations to better interpret these puzzling results we briefly develop a coupled circadian oscillators framework logically articulated around four questions i what are the oscillators ii what are their periods iii how are they coupled and iv what is the role of the clock at the behavioral level circadian_rhythms are paradoxically both relentless and flexible relentless because they turn us into robots executing the same routine every hours flexible because this routine is elastic and let us accommodate for instance an occasional early meal or a late bedtime without suffering major consequences remarkably these paradoxical features of pervasiveness and plasticity are found at multiple levels of biological_organization including tissues cells and molecular_networks as shown in this work two trillion night and day cycles during the course of evolution have deeply sculpted the molecular_networks of the cell and made h oscillations pervasive aggregation of high_throughput transcriptomic and metabolomic experiments across tissue_types and conditions indeed reveal that a large fraction of the molecular_network of a cell is primed for and potentially capable of oscillating in a circadian manner in a given environment taken in its broadest sense to include for instance genetic_modifications or inter cell inter organ communications through epigenetic and other modifications a cell or tissue selects which fraction of molecular_species out of its entire repertoire exhibit circadian_oscillations including entirely novel oscillations with respect to the corresponding control case ongoing and future work should provide the data to better model and understand networks of coupled circadian oscillators predict how they respond to perturbations and use these responses to explain biology and direct therapeutic_intervention
