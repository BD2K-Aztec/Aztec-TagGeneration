computational_modeling of the expansion of human_cord cd hematopoietic_stem with different cytokine combinations downloaded from motivation many important problems in cell_biology require dense non linear interactions between functional_modules to be considered the importance of computer simulation in understanding cellular_processes is now widely_accepted and a variety of simulation algorithms useful for studying certain subsystems have been designed expansion of hematopoietic_stem hsc hpc in ex_vivo culture with cytokines and small_molecules is a method to increase the restricted numbers of stem_cells found in umbilical_cord cb while also enhancing the content of early engrafting neutrophil and platelet precursors the efficacy of the expanded product depends on the composition of the cocktail of cytokines and small_molecules used for culture testing the influence of a cytokine or small_molecule on the expansion of hsc hpc is a laborious and expensive process we therefore developed a computational_model based on cellular_signaling interactions that predict the influence of a cytokine on the survival duplication and differentiation of the cd hsc hpc subset from human umbilical cb results we have used results from in vitro expansion cultures with different combinations of one or more cytokines to develop an ordinary_differential that includes the effect of cytokines on survival duplication and differentiation of the cd hsc hpc comparing the results of in vitro and in silico experiments we show that the model can predict the effect of a cyto kine on the fold expansion and differentiation of cb cd hsc hpc after day culture on a d scaffold availability_and the model is available visiting the following url http www francescopappalardo net bioinformatics cd model contact hematopoietic_stem is a potentially curative_therapy for severe hematological_malignancies and other severe disorders of the blood and bone_marrow umbilical_cord cb is used as an alternative for bone_marrow or mobilized_peripheral grafts particularly when no hla_matched related or unrelated_donor can be found however single cb grafts have a limited number of hematopoietic_stem hsc hpc and when compared with mobilized_peripheral grafts show significantly_delayed early neutrophil and platelet engraftment this leads to significant morbidity_and in myeloablated recipients in the cb transplant setting recent_studies cb units contain fold fewer early engrafting neutrophil and platelet progenitor_cells than mobilized_peripheral and that the frequency of these progenitors in individual cb grafts is independently variable and correlates with the clonogenic cfu_gm and cfu_mk content respectively indeed cb grafts with a higher content of cfu and viable cd cells cd cells transplanted per kilogram of the recipients body_weight demonstrate improved median time to and probability of neutrophil and platelet engraftment the latter as well as longer_term hematological reconstitution of cb cd cd hsc hpc post_transplant can be measured in the peripheral_blood in surrogate nsg mouse_models although neutrophil recovery is over fold lower in peripheral_blood than bone_marrow in nsg recipients however longer_term and serial transplantation in nsg mice and especially transplantation into non_human more closely_resembles the human in vivo transplant setting recent_studies that half of the mobilized_peripheral cd hsc hpc contribute to year long_term and half to short_term repopulation while of clones or of cd cells have durable lympho myeloid reconstitution in nonhuman_primates the limited number of hscs in a single cb unit often restricts these grafts to children and small adults although double cb units can be transplanted into adults to enhance stem_cell content this does not significantly improve early neutrophil and platelet recovery post_transplant and only one of the transplanted cb units generally engrafts long_term the numbers of hsc hpcs in a cb graft can be increased by culturing human cb cd or cd hsc hpc ex_vivo in the presence of cytokines and small_molecules prior to transplantation notably the cd fraction of human cb has been shown to contain all repopulating cells at least in surrogate models of hematopoiesis clinical_trials have shown that ex_vivo cb hsc hpc expansion can improve the outcome of cb transplantation in terms of time to neutrophil_engraftment however experimentally ex_vivo culture can also deplete expand or maintain the long_term engrafting hscs in a cb graft the protocol for expanding cb cells should therefore not only focus on the highest fold expansion of the early engrafting neutrophil and platelet progenitor_cells but also on maintaining and amplifying the durable long_term repopulating hsc the rationale behind the use of cytokines and small_molecules to expand such cells is based on knowledge of the cues that signal to hsc hpc cells from their microenvironmental niches in the bone_marrow the efficiency of the ex_vivo expansion of hsc hpc subsets thus depends on the cytokine and small_molecule combinations used and can be further modulated with d scaffolds or by controlling the supply of nutrients and depletion of inhibitory molecules in the cultures in most clinical_protocols a minimum basic combination of stem_cell scf thrombopoietin tpo and flt ligand flt l is used addition of other cytokines such as interleukin il hyper il interleukin g csf insulin_growth binding_protein igfbp notch ligands and angiopoietin like angptl can improve the fold expansion of the human cd and or cd hsc hpc more recently with the ability to segregate human hsc hpc into phenotypically enriched cell_subsets and to correlate this with their transplantability into surrogate models other factors e g the aryl_hydrocarbon antagonist sr hdac and apoptotic inhibitors pyrimidazoindole derivatives histone demethylases dmpge nicotinamide have been added to basic cytokine cocktails e g scf tpo flt l other factors to enhance the content of short_or repopulating hsc hpc for clinical_application gmp grade expansion of cd or cd hsc hpc is required but is a costly procedure and addition of multiple_cytokines increases the cost of an expanded product therefore it is vital to use a basic cytokine combination that provides the best expansion without increasing the cost of the procedure while preserving stemness characteristics in this study we have analyzed the influence of different combinations of the cytokines scf tpo flt l igfbp angptl il fibroblast_growth fgf and oncostatin_m osm on the fold expansion of human cb cd cd cells which contain hscs and their multipotent mmp lmpp mlp and gmp progeny we present a computational_approach to elicit the effect of different cytokines by modeling the signaling_cascades of the cytokines and thereby their effect on the proliferation differentiation and survival of these cells in ex_vivo culture we retrieved signaling_pathways of the specified cytokines from specialized literature and by database mining then we extracted in a rational way all the prevalent effects of signals merging them into an integrated graph see supplementary that we used to model by means of ordinary_differential odes the biological microenvironment the model is intrinsically multiscale i e it takes_into events at the molecular level biochemical signaling_pathways and at the cellular_level differentiation survival and duplication of target cd cd cells and the dynamics of cytokines used in the cocktail the model was tuned by reference to in vitro experiments and then used as a virtual lab the virtual lab was then applied to search for cytokine cocktails that maximize the duplication of and minimize the loss of cd and cd cells using a trial and error procedure the best in silico protocol was then confirmed by in vitro experiments this study provides evidence that in vitro data relating to the proliferation of human hsc hpc can be theoretically modeled with a computational_approach in future applications this model could be extended to computational_modeling of the expansion of human cbstudy whether other cytokines and or small_molecules can improve the survival proliferation and or differentiation of defined hsc hpc subsets or other stem_cells e g mesenchymal_stem that are used in cellular therapy or inhibit the proliferation of cancer initiating or stem like cells
