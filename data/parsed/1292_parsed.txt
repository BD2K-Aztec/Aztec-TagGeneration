genome_analysis deconvolving tumor_purity by integrating copy_number and loss_of motivation next_generation ngs has revolutionized the study of cancer_genomes however the reads obtained from ngs of tumor_samples often consist of a mixture of normal and tumor_cells which themselves can be of multiple clonal types a prominent problem in the analysis of cancer_genome data is deconvolving the mixture to identify the reads associated with tumor_cells or a particular subclone of tumor_cells solving the problem is however challenging because of the so_called identifiability problem where different combinations of tumor_purity often explain the sequencing_data equally well results we propose a new model to resolve the identifiability problem by integrating two types of sequencing informationsomatic copy_number and loss of heterozygositywithin a unified probabilistic_framework we derive algorithms to solve our model and implement them in a software_package called pyloh we benchmark the performance of pyloh using both simulated_data and breast_cancer sequencing_datasets and show that pyloh outperforms_existing in disambiguating the identifiability problem and estimating tumor_purity availability_and the pyloh package is written in python and is publicly_available at https github com uci cbcl pyloh the advent_of ngs and launch of comprehensive cancer genome_sequencing have yielded an unprecedented view on the complex landscape of cancer_genomes leading to the discovery of new cancer causing genes and pathways and novel therapeutic_targets for treating cancers analyzing the data from cancer_genome remains however computationally_challenging because of the shear size of the sequencing_data and the complexity of the tumor_genomes and samples cancer_genomes are often characterized by wide_spread somatic copy_number cnas where genomic_segments are deleted or duplicated one or more times identifying somatic cnas associated with specific tumor_genomes is of longstanding interest in the study of cancer_genomes and is one of the focal points of the cancer genome_analysis many computational_methods have been proposed to discover copy_number changes directly from dna_microarrays or sequencing_data however most of these methods aim at identifying the relative copy_numbers of segments of the same tumor genome discovering copy_numbers in an absolute scale is biologically more relevant but more challenging this is because of the fact that the absolute_copy changes can be affected by two confounding_factors i tumor_purity the fraction of all cancerous_cells within a heterogeneous tumor sample and ii tumor ploidy the baseline copy_number of genomic_segments or entire chromosomes both of which are unknown and themselves need to be estimated to infer absolute_copy changes it is possible to estimate tumor_purity using experimental_techniques such as quantitative_image and single_cell however these techniques are still too expensive or time consuming to support large_scale studies hence it is of great interest to use computational_approaches to estimate tumor_purity and consequently absolute_copy changes directly from the ngs_data tumor_purity affect not only copy_number changes in different segments of genomes but also the distribution of allele_frequencies in these segments in the ngs_data these two types of information can be summarized in terms of the total number of reads_mapped to each segment total read_count and the frequencies of reads matching b alleles b allele_frequencies at different sites computational_methods have been proposed to estimate tumor_purity alone or jointly with tumor ploidy based on these two types of information extracted from ngs_data depending on how copy_number changes and b allele_frequency information are used the existing_methods can be roughly grouped into two categories one category of methods use b allele_frequencies bafs at somatic mutation_sites to estimate tumor_purity including purityest and purbayes these methods leverage the fact that the bafs at somatic mutation_sites are expected to be if the tumor_purity is and any addition of normal cells will lead to a reduction in the observed bafs at these sites the second category of methods relies on copy_number changes to whom correspondence should be addressed to estimate tumor_purity and or ploidy including cnanorm theta and absolute it has been shown that the methods in the second category are often more accurate and robust than those in the first category because of the fact that i the total read_counts are large in ngs_data and thus methods relying on copy_number changes are statistically more stable than methods relying on bafs at somatic mutation_sites the number of which is often small and ii the determination of somatic_mutations is not perfect and the inclusion of false_positive can significantly bias the estimation however the utility of the methods relying on copy_number changes to estimate tumor_purity is severely hindered by the so_called identifiability problem where different combinations of tumor_purity can explain the observed data equally well this is because tumor_purity are often intertwinedchanges in one can be offset by compensations from the other allowing the same copy_number to be explained by multiple combinations of tumor_purity for example a homozygous_deletion combined with tumor_purity can also be explained as a heterozygous_deletion combined with tumor_purity resolving this ambiguity is key to accurate estimation of tumor_purity existing_methods try to solve this identifiability problem by using heuristics e g favoring solutions that have the smallest deviations from diploid e g cnanorm seeking additional experiential data e g absolute or simply outputting all possible solutions e g here we provide a more principled way to solve the identifiability problem by combining the information revealed from copy_number changes and b allele_frequencies instead of using ballele frequencies extracted from somatic mutation_sites as in the previous cases we use b allele_frequencies calculated at sites that are heterozygous with respect to the normal genomes and most of which are common single_nucleotide snps these heterozygous sites are much more abundant and easier to identify leading to more statistically stable results copy_number changes in the cancer genome often result in loss_of loh at these heterozygous sites and the extent of loh is closely_related to absolute instead of relative copy_number changes we will use bafs to gauge the extent of loh and provide information on the absolute_copy changes by examining the patterns of bafs at the heterozygous sites within the same genomic segment for example although a homozygous_deletion with tumor_purity results in the same copy_number as a heterozygous_deletion with tumor_purity in a tumor sample b allele_frequencies at heterozygous sites of the tumor sample cluster at different values in the two combinations and therefore are able to distinguish these two cases based on this insight we propose a full probabilistic_model implemented as a software_package called pyloh to integrate the information gathered from cnas and loh estimations of tumor_purity and absolute copy_numbers are then formulated as an optimization_problem in which we choose those values that maximally explain both total read_counts and b allele_frequency information our method is similar in spirit to some of the earlier methods proposed for snp_array analysis where both the signal_intensity and baf of each snp are used in estimating copy_number changes the combination of these two signals has been shown to improve the estimation accuracy of tumor ploidy or both tumor_purity recently some of these methods have been extended to sequencing_data including oncosnp seq by yau and patchwork by however the oncosnp seq algorithm uses only the reads_mapped to the snp sites although our algorithm uses all reads and thus should be able to yield a more accurate estimation of copy_number changes similar to our work the patchwork algorithm also uses all reads but it requires manual interpretation through data visualization to determine the initial copy_numbers of clusters of genomic_segments which could be useful when the tumor genome is too complex for the algorithms to resolve different solutions by themselves here we seek an alterative approach that is based on a generative_model and requires no manual intervention in addition the patchwork algorithm requires the existence of copy_neutral within the tumor genome to run the algorithm whereas our algorithm has no such constraints the outline of this article is as follows in section we describe the full probabilistic_model of pyloh in section we first present cluster patterns of bafs in ngs_data of paired_tumor samples then introduce a visualization_tool called baf heat map to characterize such patterns finally we compare tumor_purity estimates of pyloh and other methods on both simulated_datasets and breast_cancer sequencing_datasets our results show that explicitly incorporating both cnas and loh information can resolve the identifiability problem and significantly improve the accuracy of tumor_purity estimation finally we discuss the limitations of pyloh and propose future_directions in section next we demonstrate the utility of combining loss_of with cnas to infer tumor_purity for this purpose we first present a clustering pattern of b allele_frequencies derived from ngs_data in paired_tumor samples then we show that this clustering pattern can be used to resolve the ambiguous combinations of tumor_purity and copy_number changes using both a toy example and real_data afterward we apply our method pyloh developed to infer tumor_purity and absolute copy_numbers by integrating the information from total read_counts and b allele_frequencies to simulated_data and compare its performance with exiting state of the art methods cnanorm theta and purbayes finally we test the performance of our methods and other methods on real_data consisting of whole_genome sequencing_datasets from breast_cancer samples in this article we examined the problem of estimating tumor_purity and absolute_copy changes from ngs_data the tumor_purity estimates of the first three simulated_datasets given by theta cnanorm purbayes and pyloh the x axis is the estimated tumor_purity and the y axis is the ground_truth tumor purityand here we only show the solutions with the smallest deviation from the diploid b for tumor purities reported by theta with multiple solutions we used the average of the solutions with the smallest deviation from the diploid to calculate the mae and in particular focused on solving the identifiability problem that has not been properly solved by the existing_methods we demonstrated that the distribution of b allele_frequencies at sites that are heterozygous with respect to the normal genome provides key but under used information to solve the identifiability problem we further developed a full probabilistic_model to integrate the copy_number change and baf information and derived a principled way to estimate tumor_purity and absolute cnas we benchmarked the performance of our method pyloh on both simulated_data and real whole_genome sequencing_data showing that our method outperforms_existing in both cases pyloh requires a segmentation of the genome into segments with different cnas as input many algorithms have been developed to segment genomes based on copy_number changes and bafs of snp_array with varying levels of accuracy a few of these array based_methods have recently been translated to the sequencing domain a future direction of pyloh would be to integrate these existing methodologies and combine them with the probabilistic_model of pyloh to carry out both genome segmentation and absolute_copy estimation another important future direction is to use our model to study tumor_heterogeneity so_far we have focused on separating genetic changes from a mixture of normal and tumor_cells it is well known that multiple tumor clonal types may coexist in the tumor sample each with an associated mutation landscape to further model intra_tumor on top of the current probabilistic_framework we can assume there are multiple_populations of tumor_cells thus the model likelihood given by equation can be extended to account for subclonal tumor populations details in supplementary_material we plan to further extend pyloh in this direction to tackle the more challenging_problem of deconvolving tumor_heterogeneity by combining copy_number change and allele_frequency information
