a strategy for building neuroanatomy ontologies motivation advancing our understanding of how nervous_systems work will require the ability to store and annotate d anatomical datasets recording morphology partonomy and connectivity at multiple levels of granularity from subcellular to gross_anatomy it will also require the ability to integrate this data with other data types including functional genetic and electrophysiological_data the web_ontology owl provides the means to solve many of these problems using it one can rigorously define and relate classes of anatomical_structure using multiple_criteria the resulting classes can be used to annotate datasets recording for example gene_expression or electrophysiology reasoning software can be used to automate classification and error checking and to construct and answer sophisticated combinatorial queries but for such queries to give consistent and biologically_meaningful it is important that both classes and the terms relations used to relate them are carefully defined results we formally define a set of relations for recording the spatial and connectivity relationships of neuron classes and brain_regions in a broad range of species from vertebrates to arthropods we illustrate the utility of our approach via its application in the ontology that drives the virtual fly brain web_resource availability_and the relations we define are available fromthe neuroanatomical literature is old and diverse large_amounts of knowledge in this field are trapped in a literature that uses various sometimes conflicting nomenclatures large new datasets are being generated using neuron tracing image_registration and segmentation to whom correspondence should be addressed
