rnf a general framework to evaluate ngs read_mappers motivation read simulators combined with alignment evaluation_tools provide the most straightforward way to evaluate and compare mappers simulation of reads is accompanied by information about their positions in the source genome this information is then used to evaluate alignments produced by the mapper finally reports containing statistics of successful read_alignments are created in default of standards for encoding read origins every evaluation_tool has to be made explicitly compatible with the simulator used to generate reads results to solve this obstacle we have created a generic format read naming format rnf for assigning read names with encoded information about original positions futhermore we have developed an associated software_package rnftools containing two principal_components mishmash applies one of popular read simulating tools among dwgsim art mason curesim etc and transforms the generated_reads into rnf format lavender evaluates then a given read_mapper using simulated reads in rnf format a special_attention is payed to mapping qualities that serve for parametrization of roc_curves and to evaluation of the effect of read sample contamination availability_and rnftools http karel brinda github io rnftools spec of rnf the number of next_generation ngs read_mappers has been rapidly_growing during the last years then there is an increasing demand of methods for evaluation and comparison of mappers to select the most appropriate one for a specific task the basic approach to compare mappers is based on simulating ngs_reads aligning them to the reference_genome and assessing read_mapping accuracy using a tool evaluating if each individual read has been aligned correctly there exist many read simulators art curesim dnemulator dwgsim http github com nh dwgsim fastqsim flowsim gemsim mason pbsim pirs sinc wgsim http github com lh wgsim xs as well as many evaluation_tools curesimeval dwgsim eval rabema seg suite http cbrc cbrc jp martin seg suite wgsim however each read simulator encodes information about the origin of reads in its own manner this makes combining tools complicated and makes writing ad_hoc conversion scripts inevitable here we propose a standard for naming simulated ngs_reads called read naming format rnf that makes evaluation_tools for read_mappers independent of the tool used for read simulation furthermore we introduce rnftools an easily configurable v c the author published_by we designed rnf format and propose it as a general standard for naming simulated ngs_reads we developed rnftools consisting of mishmash a pipeline for read simulation and lavender an evaluation_tool for mappers both following the rnf convention thus inter compatible currently mishmash has a built in interface with the following existing read simulators art curesim dwgsim mason and wgsim we expect that authors of existing read simulators will adopt rnf naming convention as it is technically simple and would allow them to extend the usability of their software we also expect authors of evaluation_tools to use rnf to make their tools independent of the used read simulator
