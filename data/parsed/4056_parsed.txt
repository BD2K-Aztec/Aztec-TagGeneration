robust clinical outcome_prediction based on bayesian_analysis of transcriptional_profiles and prior causal networks motivation understanding and predicting an individuals response in a clinical_trial is the key to better treatments and cost_effective medicine over the coming_years more and more large_scale omics data_sets will become available to characterize patients with complex and heterogeneous_diseases at a molecular level unfortunately genetic phenotypical and environmental_variation is much higher in a human trial population than currently modeled or measured in most animal_studies in our experience this high variability can lead to failure of trained predictors in independent studies and undermines the credibility and utility of promising high_dimensional methods we propose a method that utilizes patient level genome_wide expression data in conjunction with causal networks based on prior_knowledge our approach determines a differential expression_profile for each patient and uses a bayesian_approach to infer corresponding upstream_regulators these regulators and their corresponding posterior_probabilities of activity are used in a regularized regression_framework to predict response results we validated our approach using two clinically_relevant phenotypes namely acute_rejection in kidney_transplantation and response to infliximab in ulcerative_colitis to demonstrate pitfalls in translating trained predictors across independent trials we analyze performance characteristics of our approach as well as alternative feature_sets in the regression on two independent datasets for each phenotype we show that the proposed approach is able to successfully incorporate causal prior_knowledge to give robust performance_estimates with our increasing understanding of the etiology and heterogeneity of complex_diseases comes the realization that therapeutic_drugs might need to be tailored to specific_subpopulations of patients our current inability to predict such subpopulations has contributed to the rising cost of drug_development and overall health_care one aspect of this problem is the identification of patient populations that respond to an experimental drug in a clinical_trial it currently becomes feasible to generate multi omics e g transcriptomics genetics and metabolomics datasets for all patients in a clinical_trial of hundreds of people for a cost that is only a small percentage of the overall cost of the trial research on precision_medicine has been particularly strong in oncology as many cancers have a strong genetic_basis to leverage for this purpose for instance the national cancer institutes of health nci in the usa recently outlined their criteria for the use of omics based predictors in nci funded clinical_trials they point out the pitfalls of defining omics based predictors that do not translate well to patient population outside the initial trial i e the problem of overfitting the available data as a striking example of the care that has to be taken when defining signatures compare published gene_expression for breast_cancer the sobering result is that the majority of signatures do not perform better than any randomly picked set of genes of similar size in our experience the aspect of replicability in independent datasets has not received enough attention in the current_literature on novel methods it is relatively easy to demonstrate the benefits of a method within one well controlled study but much harder to show translatability to independent studies this problem is especially pronounced in human populations in which genetic and environmental diversity is much higher than in animal_studies as this problem has impacted method adoption for our internal research in several cases we tried to explicitly validate findings in at least two independent cohorts in each response prediction scenario in this article we focus on human clinical_trials with patientlevel genome_wide gene_expression data responders to therapy are identified at the end of the study using disease specific measures the question of interest is whether the baseline or early treatment gene_expression data can predict response to treatment there has been substantial prior work on establishing predictive gene_expression based on data_driven methods alone as well as by leveraging other types of biological_information for instance proposed the use of regularization techniques to improve gene_selection for predictive signatures early on since then many authors have proposed approaches using different machine_learning including regularized_regression svms and random_forests cun and fr ohlich give a recent review one recent example that utilizes prior_knowledge is the paradigm approach which uses probabilistic_models to integrate genetics epigenetics and transcriptional data with curated pathway_information to determine active pathways in cancer patients but does not directly attempt a prediction of response and non response status in trial data this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non

regularization to overcome the problem of many variables but few samples furthermore methods vary in the amount of prior_knowledge they employfrom no prior_knowledge at all to a mixture of different omics_technologies as in the case of paradigm however most novel methods have not been developed in the setting of human data with high intrinsic levels of phenotypic and genetic_heterogeneity and are not evaluated in a truly independent dataset e g a trial conducted at a different clinic but exclusively rely on cross_validation approaches in contrast we present a method that attempts to define biologically interpretable yet predictive signatures of diseases progression or response to drug treatment that translate well to new studies in conjunction with a well accepted learning algorithm l regularized logistic_regression we base our method on a large collection of causal_relationships manually_curated from the literature the causal graph consists of causal_relationships of which are unique between entities representing full_text indexed by pubmed each causal_relationship describes an experimentally_observed perturbation experiment leading to a defined transcriptional change we previously_published a bayesian inference_method on this causal graph that given a set_of is able to identify potential upstream_regulators and their biological_context the method is called bayesian causal reasoning engine bayes cre and will serve as a building_block in this work we briefly outline it in section a prerequisite for the method to work is that relevant biology is captured in the underlying knowledgebase of causal_relationships we found that bayes cre is able to capture the relevant upstream_regulators in numerous test cases indicating that the collection of pairwise causal_relations in our network has sufficient level of complexity to be useful more large_scale dataset with more complex notion of causality can also be incorporated into our methodology as they become available in the future the search for suitable experimental_datasets has been surprisingly difficult our criteria for inclusion were i a dataset of at least human subjects with a defined clinical binary outcome i e responders_and ii at least some detectable_difference in gene_expression at baseline between the two groups and iii the availability of a similar but entirely independent trial for testing purposes for the purposes of this work we settled on two appropriate datasets the studies ofon acute_rejection in kidney_transplantation and the work ofon infliximab_treatment in ulcerative_colitis in the following we will define the details of our proposed method compare its performance against alternative feature_sets and demonstrate that its application can lead to biologically interpretable predictors that are robust to resampling and most crucially seem to translate well to independent patient populations we applied our pipeline using all feature_sets to two relevant phenotypes acute_rejection in kidney_transplantation andresponse to infliximab therapy in ulcerative_colitis each containing two independent datasets patient populations exhibit high genetic environmental and phenotypic heterogeneity this makes the search for robust predictors in clinical_trials a difficult endeavor if we rely on classical low_dimensional biomarkers prediction_performance might not be sufficient using high_dimensional e g transcriptomics datasets can easily lead to predictors that have stellar performance in the training trial but poor_performance in an independent study this seems to be the case even when all proper considerations of cross_validation or a test training split within one clinical_trial are observedat least given current sample_sizes many methods have been developed to avoid_overfitting of the data but as we demonstrate in this work even a well accepted regularized classifier will not always be able to pick out the biologically robust features based on expression data alone we found that any of the defined feature_sets is able to predict with high_accuracy under a certain set of circumstances for instance the z_score profiles perform best when trained on gse but very poorly in all other cases in contrast picking the top genes does not work at all when training on gse but well in the other cases the bayes cre feature_set retained performance across all scenarios tested and was among the top predictors in independent test_sets it should be noted that the performance of this method is strongly_dependent the prior_knowledge encoded in the underlying knowledgebase if no relevant upstream_regulators are available in the knowledgebase that can aggregate the downstream transcriptional signal performance will be poor as no useful features can be generated at the same time the number of generated features can easily be checked if there are a number of differentially_expressed present in a dataset but regulator nodes receive only weak posterior_probabilities the knowledgebase is likely to contain no relevant biology and other approaches should be pursued as demonstrated by our results generalization to independent datasets in the presence of high levels of confounding_factors such as clinical site exact composition of trial population etc is very difficult and research should be invested to not only find better mathematical approaches to exploit the dataset at hand but incorporate other prior_knowledge in an optimal way the knowledgebase that we utilize in this work may contain noise as well however this noise should be independent of a particular trial population as it tries to describe general biological facts another potential criticism of the bayes cre method is the focus on ifng lps and tnf as key_regulators in the assessed datasets clearly these nodes are well known regulators of immune system and inflammatory_processes and would have been picked as relevant by experts in the fields we evaluated the performance of only using ifng downstream_genes as defined by our knowledgebase the results are slightly inferior to bayes cre features but roughly comparable supplementary in contrast to the manual trial and error approach of defining potential downstream_genes based on expert_opinion per dataset the bayes cre approaches provides a comprehensive assessment of relevance of all encoded knowledge in the knowledgebase in our cases it correctly_identified many relevant potential_regulators of involved processes facilitating acceptance of the derived classifiers this points to a need for public readily available repositories of causal biological_knowledge to derive better classifiers and interpret biological_datasets more quickly proteinprotein interaction_databases like intact are in the process of adopting their curation process to include causal_relationships s orchard personal communication the use of other non causal prior_knowledge sources is certainly promising as well however we feel that the causal_relationships used in this study are well suited to summarize downstream transcriptional_activity into fewer features that are biologically_relevant this might be harder to achieve based on proteinprotein_interaction data as no directionality exists in the network and the relationships are not directly related to transcriptional_activity in future work we plan to add large_scale datasets with more complex notion of causality into our methodology as they become available it was surprisingly hard to collect public data for this study as we required trials of at least human subjects with a definedclinical binary outcome i e i responders_and ii at least some detectable_difference in gene_expression at baseline between the two groups and iii the availability of a similar but entirely independent trial for testing purposes we expect this situation to change over the coming_years as more and more trials generate relevant molecular data and are made available for public research however the size of the trials will remain_limited as the generation of molecular data is only a small fraction of the cost and overall costs of large clinical_trials remain astronomical this situation will make approaches using prior_knowledge even more relevant in future work we plan to test the methods on more datasets as they become available extend the method to allow for continuous phenotypes and take placebo_response for drug_trials into account the latter should be possible by integrating placebo arms of clinical_trials into the regularized regression_framework however we were not able to find suitable publicly_available datasets to test such extensions at this point this will be important to distinguish diagnostic signatures that are predictive of disease_progression from signatures that are predictive of drug response itself in summary we have presented a method for prediction of clinical_phenotypes based on genome_wide expression data that makes use of a large collection of causal_relationships defined from the literature features selected by the l regularized regression_method correspond to upstream molecular_entities that can readily be interpreted biologically and subsume sets of transcriptional changes in a useful manner the method_performs in the analyzed datasets and importantly gives stable performance_estimates across cross_validation as well as independent test_set runs given that more and more clinical_trials involving heterogeneous populations will become available methods such as the one presented here can help to make the vision of precision_medicine a reality
