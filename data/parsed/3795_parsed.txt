genome_analysis purbayes estimating tumor cellularity and subclonality in next_generation data we have developed a novel bayesian_method purbayes to estimate tumor_purity and detect intratumor_heterogeneity based on next_generation data of paired_tumor tissue_samples which uses finite_mixture modeling_methods we demonstrate our approach using simulated_data and discuss its performance under varying conditions availability purbayes is implemented as an r package and source_code is available for download through cran at http cran r project org packagepurbayes with advances in high_throughput next_generation ngs_technologies sequencing of tumor normal_tissue pairs is becoming commonplace in cancer studies often the sampled tumor_tissue is contaminated with stromal_cells resulting in a mixture of tumor and normal sequence_data in the tumor sample there has been a recent interest in accurate estimation of tumor_purity levels in tumor data analysis including methods specific to ngs_data such as purityest however a subset of the observed somatic_mutations may be subclonal because of intratumor_heterogeneity unlike clonal mutations which are observed tumor wide subclonal mutations will be observed at cellularities less than the tumor_purity level and subsequently bias purity estimates under an assumption of tumor_tissue homogeneity by modeling this heterogeneity it may also be possible to make inferences about tumor evolution and founder events to date there are no methods that aim to both quantify tumor_purity and detect intratumor_heterogeneity using ngs_data in this article we present a bayesian mixture modeling_approach purbayes toward estimating tumor_purity and subclonality using ngs_data resulting in posterior distributions of tumor cellularities from which credible_intervals ci can be derived to illustrate its implementation we conduct a simulation_study under a variety of conditions and discuss the performance of purbayes on synthetic data
