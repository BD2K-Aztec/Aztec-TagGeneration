time course network_analysis reveals tnf can promote g s transition of cell_cycle in vascular_endothelial motivation tumor_necrosis tnf a major inflammatory_cytokine is closely_related to several cardiovascular pathological_processes however its effects on the cell_cycle of vascular_endothelial vecs have been the subject of some controversy to investigate the molecular_mechanism this process we constructed time course proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks of tnf_induced regulation of cell_cycle in vecs using microarray_datasets and genome_wide ppi datasets then we analyzed the topological_properties of the responsive ppi_networks and calculated the node degree and node betweenness centralization of each gene in the networks we found that p p and cyclind key_genes of the g s checkpoint are in the center of responsive ppi_networks and their roles in ppi_networks are significantly altered with induction of tnf according to the following biological_experiments we proved that tnf can promote g s transition of cell_cycle in vecs and facilitate the cell_cycle activation induced by vascular_endothelial contact tumor_necrosis tnf a major inflammatory_cytokine plays_a in cardiovascular_disease and induces multiple changes in vascular_endothelial vecs which affect several pathological_processes including tumor_angiogenesis in addition to its well characterized properties such as altered cell_adhesion and increased apoptosis tnf also modulates the cell_cycle in vecs however its effects on the cell_cycle processes of vecs have been the subject of some controversy previous_studies indicate that tnf induces_cell and blocks proliferation of vecs inhibition of tnf accelerates endothelial recovery after angioplasty found that tnf can enhance vecs proliferation and enhance angiogenesis in rabbit_cornea assays revealed that low doses of tnf can increase dna_synthesis and decrease the proportion of g phase cells moreover our recent_studies showed that tnf_induced cell_cycle may be regulated by dynamic pathway interactions in vecs and that there is a complex gene network behind tnf_induced cell_cycle processes in vecs we also demonstrate the advantages of proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks in studies of disease mechanisms and drug_actions in this study we constructed time course ppi_networks of tnf_induced regulation of cell_cycle in vecs and analyzed their topological_properties to reveal the molecular_mechanisms tnf_induced cell_cycle processes quiescent vecs can rapidly reverse in response to signaling from the microenvironment however tight regulation of the cell_cycle is necessary for vecs for one of the most important properties of vecs is to separate blood from underlying tissues in the present study vegf treatment alone doubled the number of cells in s phase after h ecm vegf an h pulse of tnf followed by removal of tnf tnf ecm nearly tripled the amount of cells in s phase and strikingly an h pulse of tnf followed by treatment with vegf alone tnf vegf caused the highest amount of s phase induction conversely continuous treatment with tnf for h tnf tnf or addition of vegf after h to cells continuously treated with tnf tnf vegf tnf caused fewer cells to enter s phase than the h tnf pulse the pulse of tnf facilitated the cells for entry_into but continuous tnf treatment also acted to repress entry_into in the absence of vegf induction these results suggest that tnf has a double role in regulation of the cell_cycle in vecs and that the cell_cycle of vecs is controlled by multiple_cytokines in a balanced way in this study time course microarray_datasets and functional_relationships of ppis were used to construct responsive ppi_networks ppi_networks are a type of scale_free network in which node degree and node betweenness_centrality can be used to determine the network center compared a metabolic_network with the kegg kyoto_encyclopedia database and found that enzyme phylogenetic profile correlated best with betweenness_centrality and also quite closely with degree based on these studies time course microarray_datasets and the functional relationship of ppis were used to construct responsive ppi_networks in the present study by employing node degree and node betweenness_centrality we quantified the role of genes in the time course ppi_network which made it easier to identify the key_genes in the network combined with laboratory experiments we found that tnf could affect the g s cell_cycle in vecs these results show that timecourse ppi network_analysis could also be a useful way to study other time course biological_processes in summary combined with computational and experimental_studies we found that tnf can promote g s transition of cell_cycle in vecs and facilitate the cell_cycle activation induced by vegf all these results suggest that tnf can break the resting cell_cycle and wake up quiescent vecs
