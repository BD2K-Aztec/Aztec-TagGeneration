metamapr pathway independent metabolomic network_analysis incorporating unknowns metabolic_network mapping is a widely used approach for integration of metabolomic experimental_results with biological domain_knowledge however current approaches can be limited by biochemical domain or pathway_knowledge which results in sparse disconnected graphs for real_world metabolomic experiments metamapr integrates enzymatic transformations with metabolite structural_similarity mass_spectral similarity and empirical associations to generate richly connected metabolic_networks this open_source web_based or desktop software written in the r programming_language leverages kegg and pubchem databases to derive associations between metabolites even in cases where biochemical domain or molecular annotations are unknown network calculation is enhanced through an interface to the chemical translation system which allows metabolite identifier translation between common biochemical databases analysis results are presented as interactive_visualizations or can be exported as high_quality graphics and numerical tables which can be imported into common network_analysis and visualiza tion tools availability_and freely_available dgrapov github io metamapr requires r and a modern web_browser installation_instructions tutorials and application examples are available at http dgrapov github io metamapr metabolomic experiments contain both high_dimensional and complex biological chemical and analytical information mass_spectrometry based analyses can generate measurements for many hundreds to thousands of small_molecules in addition to compounds with identified biological_roles many measurements may only contain mass_spectral or empirical information analysis of metabolomic_data in the context of biological domain_knowledge e g enzymatic precursor to product relationships is a wellestablished approach for metabolic_network generation however real_world metabolomic experiments can measure a wide_range of biochemical domains for example for which direct biochemical intermediates may be absent or unknown leading to sparse disconnected biochemical representations inclusion of non measured metabolites in the reconstructed metabolic_networks using tools like metscape can help overcome this issue but requires calculation of minimum spanning trees which can still fail to associate metabolites lacking biochemical domain_knowledge e g complex lipids recently showed in their tool metamapp that structural_similarity information can be used to enhance enzymatic transformation networks and fill in the gaps between missing biochemical intermediates or domains however neither metamapp nor metscape directly calculate structural_similarity mass_spectral similarity nor empirical relationships and lack standalone interactive network_visualization and threshold tuning interfaces featured in metamapr in addition to biochemical transformations and structural_similarity metamapr also incorporates mass_spectral
