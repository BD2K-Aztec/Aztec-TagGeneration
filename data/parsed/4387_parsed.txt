systems_biology spsens a software_package for stochastic parameter_sensitivity of biochemical_reaction spsens is a software_package for the efficient computation of stochastic parameter sensitivities of biochemical_reaction parameter_sensitivity is a valuable_tool that can be used to study robustness properties for drug_targeting and many other purposes however its application to stochastic models has been limited when monte_carlo methods are required due to extremely_high computational costs spsens provides efficient state of the art sensitivity analysis algorithms in a single software_package so that sensitivity analysis can be easily_performed on stochastic models of biochemical_reaction spsens implements the algorithms in c and estimates sensitivities with respect to both infinitesimal and finite perturbations to system parameters in many cases reducing variance by orders_of compared to basic methods included among the features of spsens are serial and parallel command_line versions an interface with matlab and several example problems availability spsens is distributed freely under gpl version and can be downloaded from http sourceforge net_projects spsens the software can be run on linux mac os x and windows platforms stochastic models are used now more than ever to study to analyse and to predict the complex dynamics occurring in biology chemistry and ecology when the discrete and random nature of the system is not accurately captured by deterministic or stochastic differential_equation models stochastic reaction_networks are often modeled in the framework of stochastic chemical kinetics a stochastic chemical kinetic_model cannot be solved exactly except in the simplest cases and precludes the use of simulation and analysis methods commonly available for deterministic or stochastic differential_equation models one such analysis tool that is of particular importance is parameter_sensitivity which quantifies how system output variables are affected by perturbations in model_parameters the stochastic_model depends upon a set of reaction rate parameters and it is of great interest to assess the dependence of system behaviour on these models via parameter_sensitivity such knowledge has wide_applications but the computation of the stochastic sensitivity coefficients is burdensome in particular monte_carlo mc methods are used but are very often computationally_demanding because they require large_numbers of simulations to be performed in order to generate accurate statistics although software_packages have been developed for sensitivity analysis using the linear noise approximation and fisher_information such an approach is not appropriate for systems with particularly large fluctuations in molecular populations such as those exhibiting bistability several mc methods for efficiently estimating stochastic parameter sensitivities of biochemical_reaction have been reported recently existing software_packages have been developed to increase efficiency of stochastic_simulations however such packages do not include methods for sensitivity analysis to perform sensitivity analysis one must either write custom code or make significant modifications to existing code spsens addresses this problem by including efficient state of the art parameter_sensitivity methods in a single software_package the capabilities implementation and features are described in what follows spsens is a freely_available and easy to use software_package that implements efficient methods for parameter_sensitivity of discrete stochastic biochemical_reaction spsens allows users to quickly and easily switch between algorithms to find the most efficient method for their particular problem in general it is impossible to say which algorithm is best for a given problem as the performance of each method depends on a number of factors however there are some general_guidelines that can be followed in practice glr is the only unbiased method but it is often very inefficient and requires significant computational effort to produce accurate results the fd methods with irn and crn are significantly less efficient than the cfd and crp methods in most situations and are provided mainly for demonstration purposes the rpd method is extremely efficient for a wide_variety of problems when applicable but requires judicious choice of the regularization_parameter for efficient performance which of the three highly_efficient methods rpd cfd and crp is most efficient will depend on the
