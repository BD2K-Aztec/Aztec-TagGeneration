databases_and introducing dautobase a first step towards the global scale geoepidemiology of autoimmune syndromes and diseases motivation an autoimmune_disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys its own healthy body_tissues the initiation of a geoepidemiological database for recording autoim mune incidents with a focus to clinical_manifestations demographic_parameters and geographic background is crucial to detect correlations results the dautobase collects an ever increasing number of pub licationscurrently counting on autoimmune_diseases frequencies in various populations and ethnic_groups the respective data have been hosted by a web_application developed for the task it uses three data visualization_tools the pivotviewer the disease treemap and the disease world map to assist the effective data querying availability_and the dautobase version www biodata gr dautobase needs no registration for querying but data entry and modification is reserved for registered users curators administrators the autoimmune_diseases result from a dysfunction of the immune system due to which elements of the organism cells tissues or whole organs are subjected to immune attack by agents of its own immune system the immune_response is complicated and entails numerous different and complex mechanisms of control and regulation still its core discriminative_power stems from the specificity of the antigenantibody interaction most of the classified autoimmune_diseases target nervous_tissue but the cumulative prevalence lies with endocrine system which is implicated in more high prevalence autoimmune syndromes autoimmune_disorders are mostly of unknown_etiology as they constitute a heterogeneous group as far as demographic profile and primary clinical_manifestations are considered but with a common_denominator the effector of tissue and organ_injury is an erroneous immune_response to self antigens cases of comorbidity might link more than one results to a single cause which is in stark_contrast to the usual approach of multifactorial_diseases whence a number of causes play a contributory_role towards one given result syndrome this clustering allowed the notion of autoimmune_disease class where syndromes of similar pathogenesis but different anatomic manifestation or epidemiology are grouped together considerable evidence_supports a role for genetic environmental and other factors in inducing autoimmune_disorders the epidemiological indices for the same disease vary between patients from different geographical regionsup to and in many cases variations are observed within the same country as happens with psoriasis in australia were the native aborigines population is much less affected than recent immigrants from europe geoepidemiology aims at analyzing the spatial distribution of disease incidents to identify risk populations and possible causal_factors the first requirement from epidemiological_surveys is to estimate disease_incidence in order to focus the investigation on high incidence areas and subsequently to determine spatial risk_factors such as uv and natural radioactivity exposure inhalation of iodine ambient_temperature and locally available foodstuff although different geographic_distribution is a well substantiated fact in many cases such as the almost complete lack of psoriasis in the natives of the andes mountains compared with the high incidence in europe amongst native europeans rate variation across the map may also reflect differences in the quality of data e g in the diagnosis classification or reporting of the incidents as exemplified by rather than true differences in incidence_rates additionally people and communities tend to cluster in space in systematic ways that may be highly_predictive of disease risk such spatially organized socioeconomic patterns may have important influence on the rates of diseases observed in small areas the dautobase is the first attempt to register a great number of epidemiological_studies on autoimmune_diseases to combine them with geographical and statistical parameters and to visualize the results in order to mine valuable data that is relations between specific autoimmune_diseases and regions populations society mechanics such correlations may greatly assist decisions on public_health encourage sensible research prioritization and form the basis for a temporal versus spatial population database of the evolution of such diseases from an epidemiological point_of recent_advances in data availability and analytic_methods have created new opportunities for investigators to improve on the traditional reporting of disease at national or regional_scale they also present new challenges because as the scale of the investigation becomes broader local_variations in data_quality are likely to be shadowed in the greater picture whereas at the small_area scale these variations could lead to serious biases if not reported by employing data_mining a great number of epidemiological_studies were screened with initial emphasis on autoimmune_diseases data_mining was performed on specific indices incidence prevalence mortality age at onset etc similar attempts for the compilation and development of epidemiological databases are numerous and proven but the emphasis of such endeavours rests mostly on infectious_diseases to date there are several data_repositories that fall under the banner of autoimmune_diseases databases such as the autoimmune_disease database and the arrc research database register the autoimmune resource research_centre research database register available at http www autoimmune org au arrc research participant database aspx however these databases which are mostly literature derived focus on the documentation of autoimmune_diseases and their causative background mainly genetic or and the clinical_manifestations they provide no epidemiological aspect as to population_distribution much less to geographical_distribution national regional or global to this end we are currently experimenting with various visualization_techniques in an effort to promote a novel and promising approach in the study of autoimmune_diseases called geoepidemiological databases the aim of such databases is the study of the descriptive_epidemiology of autoimmune_diseases and the risk_assessment as to their comorbidity in both individual and population levels in this work we present the development of interactive webbased data visualization and querying tools for dautobase http www biodata gr dautobase these tools allow users to compare the epidemiological indices of the documented in dautobase autoimmune_diseases among different populations and thus identify hidden relationships between individual pieces of information more specifically we have built an elegant webbased multimedia frontend which is based on a software_tool launched by microsoft namely the pivotviewer microsoft times while the animations and natural transitions provide context and prevent users from feeling overwhelmed by large_quantities of information the dautobase pivotviewer application enables users to interact with thousands of objects at once and categorize and browse data in multiple_ways revealing hidden associations and discovering tracks and trends the dautobase queries can also be performed utilizing the flare visualization toolkit an open_source library because it includes a wide_variety of features ranging from basic charts to complex interactive graphs it supports data management visual encoding animation and interaction techniques in dautobase flare implements an alternative representation of the underlying data_collection the disease treemap an easy way of analyzing large_amounts of data in a small space treemap treemapavailable at http www cs umd edu hcil treemap finally dautobase queries output can also be visualized by using an alternative interface based on the jqvmap which enables the change of the look and feel of the maps by adding colours events and interactivity we have utilized the jqvmap technology to implement the disease world map the databases are important tools for the huge load of data gathered around the globe in various fields of medical and biomedical interest genomics proteomics structural_biology epidemiology feature prominently among so many others the geoepidemiological aspect of autoimmune_diseases entails the dynamic to assist in both the elucidation of pathogenetic_mechanisms and the emergence of population ethological and other community derived patterns recording incidents meticulously and with an epidemiological focus might help unravel the complex interactions between the various genetic contributors and environmental or social_factors that alleviate or bolster such hereditary background moreover better population scale planning of healthcare_services could be achieved dautobase will be further expanded to become a dynamic tool for all the researchers who deal with autoimmunity the thorough and systematic study of the epidemiology of autoimmune_diseases can pave the way to new perspectives in terms of medical_care utilization and patient quality_of in this work we present the integration of novel visualization_tools within the dautobase version in an attempt to provide a state of the art data and querying visualization environment for the epidemiological_study of autoimmune_diseases the net utility of the dautobase lies in three discrete applications the audience of which might diverge i the solid recording and compilation of published autoimmune epidemiological_data in a single_platform and the compilation of the source references so as to be reviewed compared and downloaded by the user such an application which is the most basic is helpful in identifying gaps in epidemiological_research and vigilance and the design of further research_projects by healthcare policymakers epidemiologists and population biologists population geneticists ii the second application is the classification and organization of epidemiological_data on a geographical basis were population groups and nationalities are secondary parameters in sorting this way a world map of autoimmunity is morphing for the first time through this map commercial and public interests can prioritize the offering of products and services research and healthcare the latter in both preventive and therapeutic contexts in different areas the third application iii is entwined with the very design and the tools provided by the database the different visualization_tools allow access to different levels of compiled data in an intuitive manner and facilitate combination and or correlation of different databits and bytes in order to form hypotheses draw_conclusions or simply detect tendencies in autoimmune_diseases aetiology and patterns such as co morbidity patterns and geography based incidence biases except their potential to increase our basic_knowledge by observation and extrapolation such data initiate new fields and contexts for researchers of autoimmune physiology genetics and therapeutics as much as physicians health_professionals and policymakers the current version of the dautobase complies to no standards of granulation for ethnicity and other population groups nor with standardized terminology and systematic reference it is devoted in recording data published in pubmed indexed papers as a measure of quality_control at present the dautobase offers a solid and massive recording of epidemiological indices of autoimmune syndromes sorted by natural and political geography priority is given to incidence and prevalence with four fields each general incidence prevalence incidence prevalence for men_and separately year of incidence date of prevalence but other indices such as mortality morbidity age at onset are also included as mentioned earlier although by themselves general incidence and prevalence_rates provide a rather poor context of geoepidemiology they are adequate for initial applications and drawing of rough conclusions as the database is scalable and additional data types can be imported within a short time upon decision other indices to be added as more data become available and recordable are to further the usefulness of the database to more elegant and specific issues meticulously kept epidemiological records easily_accessible to all interested parties will allow an alert function whenever a study produces significantly different indices than the ones recorded in the dautobase in such cases the publication might be subject in a quality_control step and if found valid scientists and authorities should scrutinize the reason for such deviations further still records will allow comparative_studies where comorbidity tendencies and wide scale biases might be detected faster and in more intuitive and direct ways than with traditional tools of course the granulation will never suffice for establishing comorbidity traits within families or even less for substantiating a siblings concordance and other family bias as in myasthenia_gravis population wide traits though as the northsouth gradient which is instrumental for the hygiene theory will be easily detectable if the number of studies in developing_countries offers an argumentum ex silentio meaning that no publications on autoimmune_diseases means no such incidents and rather than failure to report them the issue of comorbidity is just the tip of the iceberg significant_deviations in similar but geographically distant populations would point to significant environmental or ethological biases and causative_agents whereas similarities in colocated mixed_population groups would advocate against significant genetic_contribution in syndrome aetiology on the contrary similarity in indices observed in ethnically relative populations located in distant regions or in a dispersed pattern would point towards an increased genetic_contribution to the disease_phenotypes such are crohns_disease and ipex immunodysregulatory polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy x linked last but not least such retrospective whole population queries might provide insight in long_term low incidence effects of different environmental or technological factors in generating disease_phenotypes which in many an autoimmune_syndrome are due to acquired deregulation dysregulation without serious genetic_background of course as the database is a recording and sorting tool rather than an exploratory method its usefulness depends on the input achieved and this is subject to funding and policy issues especially among the developing_countries however the emergence of the dautobase enables prompt use of high volume and high_quality data as they become published and available for compiling larger and more coherent pictures on the issue of autoimmune_diseases the integration of the current visualization_tools leaves enough to be desired as the tools stem from different technologies a fact synonymous to hardship in seamless_integration however the preparation of a user_manual to guide users through the functionalities of the visualization_tools is now in progress furthermore in the near future we are planning to experiment on more querying options and alternative visualization types and techniques capable of manipulating multidimensional data in order to create a global visualization framework which is to allow the conduct of multifaceted comparative_studies of the querying results by the users the administration environment of dautobase is another aspect which we consider of great_importance the system supports multiple user profiles permitting scaled access to the information with users divided_into three main groups according to their privileges namely the administrators the curators and the simple users data entry and modification in dautobase is possible only for registered users that is administrator and curators the data entered into the system by curators are incorporated into the dautobase collection only after their successful approval by the administrator who is responsible for their validity querying needs no registration this way researchers worldwide could concurrently contribute the epidemiological_data of their country of origin and thus dautobase can become the first worldwide up to date and comprehensive geoepidemiological data repository an external user can become a curator so that he she can upload data in the dautobase collection by contacting the administrator via the website_http www bio data gr dautobase after approval by the administrator he she can acquire data entry and modification rights only for those data entered by him her and under no circumstances can alter data entered by others data_mining to further enhance and automate the discovery of valuable information are also due for incorporation and the dautobase dataset is going to be exposed through web_services based on the open data protocol open data protocol available at http www odata org giving the ability to the research_community to freely exploit our data
