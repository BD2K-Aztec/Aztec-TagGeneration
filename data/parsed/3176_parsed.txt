multi view methods for protein_structure comparison using latent_dirichlet motivation with rapidly_expanding protein_structure databases efficiently retrieving structures similar to a given protein is an important problem it involves two major_issues i effective protein_structure representation that captures inherent relationship between fragments and facilitates efficient comparison between the structures and ii effective framework to address different retrieval requirements recently researchers proposed vector space model of proteins using bag of fragments representation fragbag which corresponds to the basic information_retrieval model results in this article we propose an improved representation of protein_structures using latent_dirichlet topic model another important requirement is to retrieve proteins whether they are either close or remote_homologs in order to meet diverse objectives we propose multi viewpoint based framework that combines multiple representations and retrieval techniques we compare the proposed representation and retrieval framework on the benchmark_dataset developed by kolodny and co workers the results indicate that the proposed techniques outperform state of the art methods following huge efforts from the structural_genomics research_community protein_structure databases are ever expanding whenever a new protein_structure is determined an important step is to identify its structural neighbors which can provide_important about its function and evolutionary linkages since the protein_structure is relatively more robust than sequence during evolution structure comparison methods can discover remote homologous_proteins for a given protein they also play_a in understanding the diversity of structure space by analyzing the existing structure databases in order to derive interesting scientific insights from the vast structure databases available now highly_efficient methods for comparing protein_structures are required the success of structure comparison methods can be measured based on their effectiveness in detecting closely and remotely homologous_proteins the closely homologous_proteins have similar structures with relatively lesser number of insertions_and on the other hand remote_homologs to whom the correspondence should be addressed the work was done when the author was an intern at department of cse iit madras possess significantly different structures the similarity in these cases can be inferred based on the similarity of structural_fragments fragment level protein_structure comparison works well in practice as demonstrated by several methods budowski the first fragment based comparison method was proposed by remington and mathews which performs rigid_body superposition of fixed_length backbone fragments from individual proteins the rigid_body superposition was later used by zuker and somorjai to define the distance between backbone fragments while comparing them using dynamic_programming the fragment based structure comparison was also used in identification and ranking of local_features for further details the readers are referred to an excellent review paper by recently researchers proposed an interesting vector space representation of protein_structures using fragments as the bases the method fragbag appears to perform the task of retrieving similar structures efficiently and is the state of the art method in fragment based structure comparison fragbag represents each structure as a bag of fragments which is the most basic model of retrieval proposed in text literature the success of fragbag opens up many interesting avenues where advanced language modeling techniques proposed in information_retrieval ir statistical natural_language nlp can be adopted for representing protein_structures such approaches are expected to achieve better performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy of identifying structural homologs the article focuses on two important problems in this context i effective protein_structure representation that captures inherent relationship between fragments and facilitates efficient comparison between the structures and ii effective framework to address different retrieval requirements we propose a new representation for protein_structures based on latent_dirichlet lda lda models a collection of discrete objects as a mixture of latent topics and has been shown to work remarkably well in text and image_retrieval domain the success of lda in text domain is attributed to effective capturing of relationship between words drawing a parallel here we demonstrate that lda indeed models relationships between fragments in protein_structures effectively and achieves a competitive_performance with state of the art structural methods at a fraction of the computation costs another important contribution of this work is that we propose multi viewpoint homology detection framework to effectively find close as well as remote homologous_proteins for a query protein_structure this is the first attempt to adopt advanced models from ir and statistical nlp for addressing protein_structure comparison problem we proposed a novel framework for representation and comparison of protein_structures we demonstrated that our method outperforms most of the existing filter and match methods our results are very competitive even with the state of the art structure comparison methods operating at the level of complete d representation moreover our method is much faster than these methods kolodnythe proposed approaches are shown in bold multiview model i is a combination of tf and lda multiview model ii is a combination of tf idf and lda and multiview model iii is a combination of boolean vector and lda the speed is given as average cpu minutes per query if the processing time after preprocessing of protein_structure for a query is s then it is mentioned as fast
