gene_expression applying stability_selection to consistently estimate sparse principal_components in high_dimensional molecular data motivation principal_component pca is a basic tool often used in bioinformatics for visualization and dimension_reduction however it is known that pca may not consistently estimate the true direction of maximal variability in high_dimensional low sample_size settings which are typical for molecular data assuming that the underlying signal is sparse i e that only a fraction of features contribute to a principal component pc this estimation consistency can be retained most existing sparse pca methods use l penalization i e the lasso to perform feature_selection but the lasso is known to lack variable_selection consistency in high_dimensions and therefore a subsequent interpretation of selected_features can give misleading_results results we present s vdpca a sparse pca method that incorporates a subsampling approach namely stability_selection s vdpca can consistently select the truly relevant_variables contributing to a sparse pc while also consistently estimate the direction of maximal variability the performance of the s vdpca is assessed in a simulation_study and compared to other pca approaches as well as to a hypothetical oracle pca that knows the truly relevant_features in advance and thus finds optimal unbiased sparse pcs s vdpca is computationally_efficient and performs best in simulations regarding parameter_estimation consistency and feature_selection consistency furthermore s vdpca is applied to a publicly_available gene_expression data_set of medulloblastoma brain_tumors features contributing to the first two estimated sparse pcs represent genes significantly over represented in pathways typically deregulated between molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma availability_and software is available at https github com mwsill s vdpca contactprincipal component analysis pca is the most popular method for dimension_reduction and visualization that is widely used for the analysis of high_dimensional molecular data in bioinformatics typical applications range from outlier_detection as part of quality_control to exploratory_data for revealing new molecular subgroups as well as pathway and network_analysis common biological_data for such applications are continuous molecular data typically generated by high_throughput profiling techniques e g gene_expression copy_number methylation and micro_rna expression data in general pca aims to project a high_dimensional matrix into a lower dimensional_space by seeking linear_combinations of the original variables called principal_components pcs by construction these pcs capture maximal variance and are orthogonal v c the author published_by the results of the simulation_study comparing the s vdpca to rspca using different penalization functions conventional pca and oracle pca are shown_inand displays the median angles between the estimated and the true loadings vectors on a heat color scale simulation scenario were defined by all possible combinations of the spike index a and the sparsity index b themedian was calculated over simulation runs furthermore the and median angles are indicated by contour lines in addition true_positive rates tpr and simulation_results for other tuning parameters are shown in the supplementary_material i e rspca using the adaptive lasso with c and c and s vdpca with weakness parameter j and j as already shown in theory by jung and marron conventional pca is strongly inconsistent as long as the strength of the underlying signal is weak i e for spike indices a with increasing a the pca estimates get closer to the true eigenvector thereby achieving marginal consistency for a z as indicated by the degree contour line and consistency for a z the behaviour of the consistency is independent of the sparsity of the underlying signal e g the sparsity index b however if the underlying signal is sparse and b a all considered sparse pca methods can consistently estimate the first loadings vector and become marginally consistent for b a e the oracle pca which knows the true non zero coefficients gives unbiased_estimates of the non zero coefficients and therefore the best possible sparse solutions that are closest to the underlying first eigenvector of the population covariance_matrix the sparse loadings vectors estimated by the s vdpca are in all situations slightly closer to the unbiased oracle estimates than rspca estimates using any considered penalty function for b the degree contour line of the s vdpca is always closest to the marginal consistency boundary b a furthermore the degree contour line lies in most situations further to the left_hand side of the marginal consistency boundary if the true eigenvector is very sparse and the signal is weak i e b and a both the rspca and the s vdpca become marginally inconsistent in estimating the true eigenvector even if a b displays the median fdr for the different rspca methods c and d and the s vdpca the median fdr was calculated over simulation runs and for all combinations of a and b as described in the simulation design above the fdr is shown on a heat color scale and median levels of and are indicated by contour lines for relatively weak signals starting at a the rspca methods and s vdpca tend to falsely select coefficients resulting in fdrs around especially in situations where the true signal is less sparse b when a and b the fdr increases dramatically to in situations where sparse pca methods are expected to consistently estimate the direction of the true eigenvector i e a b and b the fdr for the rspca with the lasso is around this expected behaviour reflects the known variables selection inconsistency of the lasso in high_dimensions in these simulation_settings the unbiased coefficients are relatively large a b so that the penalization chosen by the gic is not sufficient to screen out irrelevant variables that are correlated with truly relevant_variables both the adaptive lasso and scad penalty are known to possess the oracle property and are thus expected to select only truly relevant_variables and achieve approximately unbiased_estimates nevertheless the simulation_results show that both penalties tend to select additional irrelevant variables in simulation_settings where the signal_intensity a and sparsity b are nearly equal depicted by the orange tail along the diagonal in c and d i e around the marginal consistency boundary b a this behaviour is more pronounced for the scad penalty compared to the adaptive lasso in contrast in almost all simulation_settings where a b the s vdpca identifies the true non zero coefficients without adding any irrelevant features therefore we can conclude that particularly in the challenging settings where b a the selection probabilities estimated by the s vdpca can successfully be used to filter the truly relevant_features withouth selecting as many false positves as the rspca methods to demonstrate practicability to find sparse and interpretable pcs in high_dimensional molecular data_sets the proposed s vdpca method was applied to a gene_expression data_set of medulloblastoma brain_tumors medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric_brain and comprises four distinct_molecular variants these subgroups are known as wnt shh group c and group d wnt tumours show activated wnt_signaling and carry a favourable_prognosis shh medulloblastoma show hedgehog signaling_pathway activation and are known to have an intermediate to good prognosis while both wnt and ssh variants are molecularly already well characterized the genetic programs driving the pathogenesis of group c and group d medulloblastoma remain_largely here we applied the proposed s vdpca method to gene_expression data of group c group d shh and wnt tumors gene_expression has been measured by the x k agilent whole human_genome oligo microarray after normalization and quality_control the data_set comprised gene_expression values of annotated_genes the data_set is publicly_available at the national_center ncbi gene_expression geo database accession no gse the first two sparse pcs have been extracted by applying the s vdpca and the results are visualized as biplot representation in the loadings vector of the first sparse pc comprises non zero coefficients and the second pc involves non zero coefficients the biplot displays the projection of the tumor_samples onto the two sparse pcs while also visualizing the covariance_structure of the selected genes within this rank two approximation by grey arrows each arrow represents a gene and the length of the arrow reflects the size of the corresponding coefficient in the two loadings vectors arrows that point in similar directions represent positive correlated genes arrows parallel to a pc axis are genes with a non zero loadings coefficient only in one of the two loadings vectors of the two pcs the four molecular subgroups can clearly be separated by projecting the samples in the space spanned by the first two sparse pcs while most wnt and shh medulloblastomas form_clusters far away from samples of other subgroups group d and group c tumors are closer to each other a set of genes is still too large for a reasonable interpretation but the most dominating genes i e those showing the highest absolute coefficients can be highlighted in prominent oncogenes with a high absolute coefficient have been highlighted including sfrp and its transcription_factor gli both arrows point away from the wnt samples into the direction of shh medulloblastoma this means that the sfrp expression is up regulated in shh tumors and down_regulated in wnt sample and matches the current knowledge that sfrp is a tumor_suppressor responsible for hedgehog_signaling mediated regulation of the wnt_signaling moreover the arrows of dkk and wif which are known target_genes of the wnt_signaling both point in direction of the wnt medulloblastoma fstl a known marker for poor_prognosis in non wnt non shh medulloblastoma points into a direction of group c and group d tumors since the loadings coefficient of fstl is zero in the second pc the arrow for fstl is parallel to the first pc however individual interpretation of all non zero coefficients is still too complex an alternative way to try to understand the importance of the genes selected by sparse pca methods is to perform a pathway analysis here we performed hypergeometric testing of the genes selected in the first and second pc to evaluate whether these genes are overrepresented in kegg_pathways kyoto_encyclopedia to perform this analysis the r bioconductor_package htsanalyzer was used the top six pathways most significantly_overrepresented by genes selected in the first and second pc are shown as graphs above and to the right of the biplot each node or circle of the graph represents a pathway and the size of each node is proportional to the number of genes assigned to that pathway pathways are connected by edges and the width of each edge is proportional to the number of genes shared by two pathways the white red coloring of the nodes corresponds to fdr adjusted p values that are also shown in the supplementary_material among the top six pathways overrepresented by genes selected in the first sparse pc are the wnt_signaling and neuroactive ligandreceptor interaction even though these pathways include a wide_range of genes both pathways are expected to be deregulated in medulloblastoma interestingly genes selected in the second sparse pc are also significantly_overrepresented in the wnt_signaling and the hedgehog signaling_pathway this result directly reflects the known interaction between these two pathways and is in agreement with the biplot where the largest distances between wnt and shh samples are along the axis of the second pc similar results calculated by applying conventional pca the rspca with lasso rspca adaptive lasso and the rspca with scad penalty are shown in the supplementary_material
