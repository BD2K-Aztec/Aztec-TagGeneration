structural_bioinformatics pydockweb a web_server for rigid_body protein protein_docking using electrostatics and desolvation scoring pydockweb is a web_server for the rigid_body docking prediction of proteinprotein_complex structures using a new version of the pydock scoring algorithm we use here a new custom parallel ftdock implementation with adjusted grid size for optimal fft calculations and a new version of pydock which dramatically speeds up calculations while keeping the same predictive_accuracy given the d coordinates of two interacting_proteins pydockweb returns the best docking orientations as scored mainly by electrostatics and desolva tion energy availability_and the server does not require registration by the user and is freely_accessible for academics at http life bsc es servlet pydockproteinprotein interactions mediate most cellular_functions thus a detailed_description of the association process at molecular level is essential to comprehend the fundamental processes that sustain life in such line proteinprotein_docking tools aim to identify the native binding_mode between two proteins such predictions are required to complement experimental_techniques that cannot provide structural_information at a proteomics scale given their current technical_limitations pydock is a rigid_body docking method in which sampling is performed by means of ftdock and scoring implements an efficient empirical potential composed of electrostatics and desolvation terms with a limited contribution from van_der energy the method has been successfully tested in capri here we present pydockweb server a new fast implementation that allows easy access to non expert users to state of the art docking predictions
