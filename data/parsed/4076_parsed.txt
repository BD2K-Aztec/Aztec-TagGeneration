sequence_analysis rrbsmap a fast accurate and user_friendly alignment_tool for reduced_representation reduced_representation rrbs is a powerful yet cost efficient method for studying dna_methylation on a genomic_scale rrbs involves restriction_enzyme bisulfite_conversion and size_selection resulting in dna sequencing_data that require special bioinformatic handling here we describe rrbsmap a short_read alignment_tool that is designed for handling rrbs data in a user_friendly and scalable way rrbsmap uses wildcard alignment and avoids the need for any preprocessing or post processing_steps we benchmarked rrbsmap against a well validated maq based pipeline for rrbs read_alignment and observed similar accuracy but much improved runtime performance easier handling and better scaling to large sample_sets in summary rrbsmap removes bioinformatic hurdles and reduces the computational_burden of large_scale epigenome association studies performed with rrbs availability http rrbsmap computational epigenetics org dna_methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic_regulation in development and disease many methods for dna_methylation have been developed but only bisulfite_sequencing gives rise to comprehensive dna_methylation maps at single_base bisulfite_treatment converts unmethylated_cytosines cs into uracils which gives rise to c to t polymorphisms after subsequent polymerase_chain while leaving methylated_cytosines unchanged by aligning and comparing bisulfite sequencing_reads to the genomic dna_sequence it is thus possible to infer base_pair resolution dna_methylation bisulfite_converted can be subjected to whole_genome resequencing giving rise to comprehensive methylomes however this procedure requires deep_sequencing of entire genomes rendering it expensive in terms of sequencing cost as well as the required amount of input dna reduced_representation rrbs addresses these limitations and provides a complementary technology to whole_genome in rrbs dna is first digested with a restriction_enzyme that includes a cpg in its recognition_site and cuts dna independent of the methylation status of this cpg subsequently small dna_fragments are size selected to enrich for cpg rich genomic_regions which are often associated with epigenetic_regulation and subjected to high_throughput bisulfite_sequencing by concentrating on a small but informative portion of the genome rrbs provides high sequencing_depth at affordable cost making rrbs well suited for detecting subtle differences in large patient_cohorts furthermore rrbs is readily_applicable to small amounts of dna and formal fixed paraffin_embedded samples rrbs is actively used by a number of groups to our knowledge no alignment tools have been published that are tailored to rrbs data although some existing_tools for bisulfite sequencing_data can also be applied to rrbs doing so requires custom pre_and processing thus limiting the accessibility of rrbs for researchers with limited bioinformatic support here we describe rrbsmap a short_read alignment_tool that is specifically tailored to rrbs we show that rrbsmap provides a major advance in terms of runtime performance and usability compared to a well validated maq based pipeline while maintaining high mapping accuracy we compare rrbsmap with a maq based pipeline that has been extensively used in our previous_studies this pipeline involves five steps i in silico digestion of the target_genome and indexing of size selected restriction_fragments ii conversion of bam_files into bfa files iii alignment using the bisulfite alignment mode of maq http maq sourceforge net iv conversion of the map files into bam_files and v coordinate mapping of the aligned_reads to remove the effects of in silico digestion this custom pipeline provides high_accuracy and we used it successfully in a number of publications however it is neither user_friendly nor easily portable and currently not publicly_available the comparison was performed on a total of nine rrbs libraries that were prepared from human_embryonic dna and sequenced on illumina gaiix supplementary for pairs of biological_replicates sequenced with bp single ended reads rows in supplementary we observed equal consistency between replicates and equal bisulfite conversion_rates but slightly_higher aligned read numbers and cpg coverage for rrbsmap than for maq the central_processing cpu time was fold lower and the actual wall clock time on a multicore processor node was fold lower for rrbsmap than for maq the memory_consumption of rrbsmap was fold lower than for maq we also tested rrbsmap and maq on technical_replicates sequenced with bp paired_end rows in supplementary which is a rarely used configuration for rrbs that we had not previously_tested with the maq based pipeline compared to bp single_end rrbsmap almost doubles the cpg coverage that is achievable with rrbs while not sacrificing accuracy or performance in contrast the maq based pipeline does not work well for bp paired_end resulting in substantially lower alignment rates while maintaining high_accuracy and consistency between replicates in summary rrbsmap performs at least as well as an extensively validated maq based pipeline on the key performance_metrics of bisulfite_sequencing and it significantly_outperforms the maqbased pipeline in terms of runtime performance and in terms of genomic coverage for bp paired_end the performance of rrbsmap is sufficient to process thousands of rrbs libraries a situation that is become increasingly realistic as dna_methylation follows genome_wide and tackles large samples cohorts
