data_and assimilator a new tool to inform selection of associated genetic_variants for functional studies motivation fine_mapping experiments from genome_wide gwas are underway for many complex_diseases these are likely to identify a number of putative causal_variants which cannot be separated further in terms of strength of genetic_association due to linkage_disequilibrium the challenge will be selecting which variant to prioritize for subsequent expensive functional studies a wealth of functional information generated from wet_lab now exists but cannot be easily interrogated by the user here we describe a program designed to quickly assimilate this data called assimilator and validate the method by interrogating two regions to show its effectiveness genome_wide gwas have been enormously successful in identifying regions associated with a variety of complex_traits and diseases fine_mapping studies are underway for many of these disorders and are likely to identify a number of putative causal_variants the challenge then will be to prioritize which variants to select for the expensive functional studies required to fully translate how these variants affect risk in many cases it is expected that the likely causal_variants will be single_nucleotide snp markers that are in complete linkage_disequilibrium and which cannot be prioritized further based on genetic evidence alone snps within genes which affect the resulting protein or lie in a regulatory_region would be obvious candidates for functional studies but in many complex_diseases the causal_snps identified to date map to intergenic non coding_regions and it is more challenging to prioritize these based on likely function there is now a wealth of information available from the encyclopaedia of dna elements encode international_consortium hosted by the university of california santa_cruz ucsc through their genome_browser these data have been generated from wet_lab including to whom correspondence should be addressed chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq dnase hypersensitivity and histone_modification studies and thus may provide better evidence of putative_function compared with predictive algorithms used previously to infer function at a locus an enormous amount of data is available including studies in different cell_lines and different cell_compartments but currently these sites cannot be easily interrogated by the user simultaneously other potential resources for prioritizing snps for functional studies are now becoming more widely available and include eqtl studies and programs which predict likely effects of non synonymous polymorphisms here we describe a program designed to quickly assimilate all available data for snps or locations entered by the user called assimilator importantly the ability to enter snps using base_pair position will allow the interrogation of novel variants identified for example by the genomes_project http www genomes org even if an rs number has not yet been assigned we also validate the method by interrogating snps in two regions one associated with colorectal_cancer and one with type_ii t d we show that based on the information drawn together by assimilator we would have prioritized the subsequently confirmed causal_snps for functional investigation from both previous_studies to verify the usefulness of assimilator we used information from a published study by pomerantz et_al who found that an intergenic snp rs associated with colorectal_cancer showed functional evidence for interaction with the myc gene we used the snp annotation and proxy search snap tool to generate a list of snps highly_correlated with rs r this generated a list of snps that were subsequently used as the input to assimilator the results are shown inclearly indicating that rs has the strongest a priori evidence of function not only is it in an active region of the genome but also it is one of only two snps to lie in a tfbs additionally assimilator correctly_identified the same tfbs as the published_data similarly a recent study bylooking at open chromatin across the genome identified a snp associated with t d in an open region as a further proof_of supplying assimilator with the same snp revealed three lines of evidence showing bioinformatically that the snp was in a region of open chromatin this selection was achieved quickly and easily using our programme
