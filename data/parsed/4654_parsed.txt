the variant_call and vcftools the variant_call vcf is a generic format for storing dna polymorphism data such as snps insertions deletions and structural_variants together with rich annotations vcf is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data_retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference_genome the format was developed for the genomes_project and has also been adopted by other projects such as uk k dbsnp and the nhlbi exome project vcftools is a software_suite that implements various utilities for processing vcf files including validation merging comparing and also provides a general perl api availability one of the main uses of next_generation is to discover variation among large populations of related samples recently a format for storing next generation read_alignments has been standardized by the sam bam file_format specification this has significantly_improved the interoperability of nextgeneration tools for alignment visualization and variant_calling we propose the variant_call vcf as a standardized format for storing the most prevalent types of sequence_variation including snps indels and larger structural_variants together with rich annotations the format was developed with the primary intention to represent human genetic_variation but its use is not restricted to diploid genomes and can be used in different contexts as well its flexibility and user extensibility allows representation of a wide_variety of genomic_variation with respect to a single reference_sequence although generic feature format gff has recently been extended to standardize storage of variant information in genome variant format gvf this is not tailored for storing information across many samples we have designed the vcf format to be scalable so as to encompass millions of sites with genotype data and annotations from thousands of samples we have adopted a textual encoding with complementary indexing to allow easy generation of the files while maintaining fast data access in this article we present an overview of the vcf and briefly introduce the companion vcftools software_package a detailed format specification and the complete documentation of vcftools are available at the vcftools web_site
