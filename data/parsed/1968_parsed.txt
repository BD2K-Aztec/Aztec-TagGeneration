systems_biology genenet toolbox for matlab a flexible platform for the analysis of gene connectivity in biological_networks we present genenet toolbox for matlab also available as a set of standalone applications for linux the toolbox available as command_line or with a graphical_user enables biologists to assess connectivity among a set of genes of interest seed genes within a biological_network of their choosing two methods are implemented for calculating the significance of connectivity among seed genes seed randomization and network permutation options include restricting analyses to a specified subnetwork of the primary biological_network and calculating connectivity from the seed genes to a second set of interesting genes pre analysis tools help the user choose the best connectivity_analysis algorithm for their network the toolbox also enables visualization of the connections among seed genes genenet toolbox functions execute in reasonable time for very large_networks million edges on a desktop computer availability_and genenet toolbox is open_source and freely_available from http avigailtaylor github io gntat in search of the genetic causes of diseases high_throughput experiments such as genome_wide association and gene_expression studies are often used to find putatively causative genetic_variants such experiments implicate many genes seed genes to gain insights into the biological_mechanisms through which these genes variants exert their effects we often explore the hypothesis that the seed genes participate in a shared biological_pathway or process to this end within a given biological_network say a proteinprotein_interaction ppi or gene_co we can count the direct connections between the seedgenes seed genes and direct connections between them comprise the direct network see supplementary and determine if this direct seed connectivity is more than expected by chance broadly speaking there are two ways to assess direct seed connectivity within a network of interest in seed randomization sr we keep the network the same randomly select gene_sets equal in size to the set of seed genes and obtain an empirical p value by comparing the direct seed connectivity to the connectivity of the random gene_sets see supplementary conversely in network permutation np we keep seed genes the same permute the edges of the network many times while preserving node degree and network clustering structure and obtain an empirical p value by comparing the direct seed connectivity in the real versus permuted networks see supplementaryand supplementary_information for algorithmic details sometimes experimental biases influence seed gene_selection for example when using rna_sequencing to call differentially_expressed there is a length bias towards longer transcripts in such cases gene attributes affected by these biases must be accounted for when assessing direct seed connectivity in sr we can do this by matching gene attributes of randomized gene_sets to the real set of seed genes see supplementary note this approach will not work if seed genes have unique attributes in other scenarios the biological_network used to determine direct seed connectivity may be subject to an ascertainment_bias for example genegene connections reported in ppis are biased by the number of studies pertaining to processes in which gene_products participate with sr we can account for an ascertainment_bias by matching randomized genes to real seed genes by degree however if such a bias is the primary_concern then np should be used to better account for node degree on condition that the network in question can be sufficiently permuted while preserving its clustering structure see additional features np can also be used to evaluate three further properties of the seedgene network proposed in but renamed here seed direct degrees mean seed indirect degrees mean and common connectors degrees mean the latter two properties use the indirect network among seed genes see supplementary supplementary figures s s explain these properties last np can help identify which seedgenes if any might be hubs in the direct network see supplementary
