systems_biology a unifying kinetic framework for modeling oxidoreductase catalyzed_reactions motivation oxidoreductases are a fundamental class of enzymes responsible for the catalysis of oxidationreduction reactions crucial in most bioenergetic metabolic_pathways from their common root in the ancient prebiotic environment oxidoreductases have evolved into diverse and elaborate protein_structures with specific kinetic_properties and mechanisms adapted to their individual functional_roles and environmental_conditions while accurate kinetic_modeling of oxidor eductases is thus important current models suffer from limitations to the steady_state domain lack empirical validation or are too specialized to a single system or set of conditions results to address these limitations we introduce a novel unifying modeling framework for kinetic descriptions of oxidoreductases the framework is based on a set of seven elementary reactions that i form the basis for pairs of enzyme state_transitions for encoding various specific microscopic intra enzyme reaction_networks micro models and ii lead to various specific macroscopic steady_state kinetic equations macro models via thermodynamic assumptions thus a syner gistic bridge between the micro and macro kinetics can be achieved enabling us to extract unitary rate_constants simulate reaction variance and validate the micro models using steady_state empirical data to help facilitate the application of this framework we make available redoxmech a mathematica tm software_package that automates the generation and customization of micro models availability the mathematica tm source_code for redoxmech the documentation and the experimental_datasets are all available from oxidoreductase the first enzyme class in the enzyme commission nomenclature ec x x x henceforth referred to as ec consists of enzymes responsible for the catalytic transfer of electrons from an electron_donor molecule to an electron_acceptor molecule the universal presence of oxidoreductases in the energy producing pathways of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes suggests that these proteins arose earlier during the process of biogenesis and are thus essential for life in the ec oxidoreductases are classified according to the types of donor and acceptor molecules in the particular oxidationreduction redox_reaction that they participate in http www brendaenzymes org although the kinetics and regulatory behaviors of enzymes in the same classification may differ significantly across different organisms or even across different tissues in the same organism to understand the functional role an oxidoreductase has within a pathway and to characterize its differences from other oxidoreductases it is necessary to be able to predict accurately its dynamics over a range of conditions however a full realization of the dynamics of an oxidoreductase is currently hindered by i the lack of detailed_structural and mechanistic_information on most of the oxidoreductases e g complex inadh dehydrogenase ii the technological limitations in obtaining the specific elementary kinetic rate_constants and iii the computational limitations associated with molecular_dynamics and other physical simulations over large spatial_and to bypass these limitations simplified models are used which typically follow either the macroscopic modeling_approach of deducing a steady_state velocity equation to represent the rate of the reaction or the microscopic kinetic approach of defining a system of intra enzyme processes to represent the detailed kinetic mechanisms of the enzyme a macroscopic steady_state velocity equation is a mathematical relationship between reactant concentrations and empirically_derived kinetic_parameters that provides a steady_state deterministic solution to the flux of the reactants through the enzyme the relationship can be a simple hyperbolic function such as the michaelismenten kinetic equation or a more complex function derived from a macroscopic approximation of many elementary reactions at steady_state kinetic_models based on steady_state velocity equations are widely used and published because steady_state kinetic_parameters are relatively easy to acquire via available measurement techniques and the steady_state snap shots of their dynamics can readily be compared for example in our previous work a two substrate and two product bi bi steady_state velocity equation termed the chemiosmotic rate law was derived for the chemiosmotic oxidoreductase complexes in the mitochondria and corresponding enzyme_assay protocols were developed and implemented to estimate the values of the kinetic_parameters in the rate law and enable comparison across various cell_lines however steady_state velocity equations are based on many approximations and steady_state assumptions that severely limit to whom correspondence should be addressed their range of applicability furthermore although deterministic solutions can satisfactorily describe the average behavior of the enzyme over many ensembles that are consistent with in vitro experimental_conditions they might not accurately capture in vivo conditions within a cell or a cells organelle where the significantly_lower volume and thus fewer copies of the enzyme and its reactants and stochastic_fluctuations may become important thus many kinetic features of the enzyme could be over estimated e g the parameter_values under estimated e g stochastic variability of the velocity or altogether lost e g transient phase of the reaction microscopic kinetic_models avoid the various steady_state approximations by explicitly accounting for the intra enzyme_reactions and solving the corresponding system of ordinary_differential odes kinetic_models based on intra enzyme_reactions not only can produce a more complete deterministic description of the enzyme_kinetics but can also be used in conjunction with monte_carlo methods such as gillespies stochastic_simulation ssa to produce stochastic time series which can capture the intrinsic variability of the catalyzed_reaction however in contrast to the velocity equations the rate_constants of the intra enzyme_reactions are not only harder to obtain experimentally but also less useful in comparison between models owing to the lack of standards between the various possible enzyme mechanisms here we present a novel framework for modeling oxidoreductase catalyzed_reactions that uses a synergistic combination of both macroscopic_and kinetic_model descriptions of the reaction system henceforth referred to as macro model and micro model respectively to obviate the aforementioned modeling limitations at the core of this unifying framework is a basis of seven elementary reactions this basis can be used to express various mechanisms of oxidoreductase by i defining the specific micro model out of the pairs of feasible enzyme microstate transitions spanned from the seven elementary reactions and ii inferring the corresponding specific macro model through temporal separation and non equilibrium thermodynamic assumptions we show that by sharing the same abstraction the unitary rate_constants of the micro model can be estimated from the experimentally determinable steady_state parameters of the macro model to produce the same steady_state output in contrast the intrinsic stochasticity of the enzyme captured by the micro model_simulations can be superimposed onto the macro model time series additionally we show how wellknown mechanisms can be encoded by the micro model how these mechanisms differ in their transient and steady_state domains and how they can be combined to simulate a cascade or a supercomplex the application of this framework is facilitated by a mathematica tm software_package redoxmech which generates customizable micro models through simple xcellerator like arrow notations for chemical_reactions we have introduced a general microscopic framework for the kinetic_modeling of bi bi oxidoreductases by decomposing their redox capabilities into seven elementary reactions by using different combinations of enzyme state_transitions this approach_enables and subsumes more specialized models for specific members of the family or specific conditions furthermore in the steady_state regime the approach leads to macroscopic rate_equations consistent with previous derivations and with experimental_data unifying both microscopic and macroscopic approaches for modeling enzymatic_reaction of ec because the microscopic models are composable the generality of the approach can also be used to model ec supercomplexes as cascades of individual complexes in addition the microscopic framework allows incorporation of elementary binding reactions of specific inhibitory reactants to enable modeling of regulatory_control mechanisms as well as alternative electron_transfer to enable modeling of slippage mechanisms_involved in reactive_oxygen production altogether this framework provides a way to flexibly and programmatically describe the core enzymes of cellular energetics for possible integration into future comprehensive models of metabolism that will further our understanding of the central role bioenergetics play not only in the maintenance of life but also in disease and aging
