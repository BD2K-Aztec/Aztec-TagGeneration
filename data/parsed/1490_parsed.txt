drug_susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs using kernelized bayesian multitask_learning motivation human_immunodeficiency hiv and cancer require personalized therapies owing to their inherent heterogeneous nature for both diseases large_scale pharmacogenomic screens of molecularly_characterized samples have been generated with the hope of identifying genetic predictors of drug_susceptibility thus computational algorithms capable of inferring robust predictors of drug_responses from genomic_information are of great practical importance most of the existing computational studies that consider drug_susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs formulate a separate learning_problem for each drug which cannot make use of commonalities between subsets of drugs results in this study we propose to solve the problem of drug_susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs in a multitask_learning framework by formulating a novel bayesian algorithm that combines kernel_based non linear dimensionality_reduction and binary_classification or regression the main novelty of our method is the joint bayesian formulation of projecting data_points into a shared subspace and learning predictive_models for all drugs in this subspace which helps us to eliminate off target effects and drug specific experimental_noise another novelty of our method is the ability of handling missing phenotype values owing to experimental_conditions and quality_control reasons we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm via cross_validation experiments on two benchmark drug_susceptibility datasets of hiv and cancer our method obtains statistically_significantly better predictive_performance on most of the drugs compared with baseline single task algorithms that learn drug specific models these results show that predicting drug_susceptibility against a panel of drugs simultaneously within a multitask_learning framework improves overall predictive_performance over single task learning approaches availability_and our matlab implementations for binary_classification and regression are available at https github com human_immunodeficiency hiv and cancer which are two major human diseases_causing millions of deaths yearly require personalized therapies owing to their inherent heterogenous nature for both diseases large_scale pharmacogenomic screens have been performed with the hope of discovering associations between genetic subtypes of each disease and drug_susceptibility hiv is usually treated with antiretroviral therapies which have demonstrated high efficacy however the high mutation_rate of hiv helps the virus adapt fast leading to drug_resistant viral_strains thus selecting the optimal therapeutic_regimen for a given hiv strain requires the ability to predict drug_resistance based on its genomic_sequence to enable this type of discovery characterize the susceptibility of genomically sequenced hiv_strains to subsets of multiple hiv therapeutic_agents cancer is a collection of genetically diverse_diseases and many modern cancer_therapeutics have demonstrated selective efficacy in specific matched genetic subtypes thus patient selection_strategies for personalized cancer_therapeutics require the ability to predict drug_sensitivity based on molecular information about a patients tumor for this purpose characterize the sensitivity of molecularly profiled cancer_cell to and anticancer compounds respectively for both hiv and cancer researchers have developed genomic predictors of drug_susceptibility using modern machine_learning for high_dimensional classification or regression for example use machine_learning such as decision_trees artificial_neural support_vector least_squares regression and least angle regression to predict drug_resistance in hiv_type hiv using the sequence of the viral reverse_transcriptase use a regularized regression_method elastic_net to predict drug sensitivities based on cancer cell_line molecular_profiles andformulate a bayesian extension of this approach in a recent study combine genomic_features of cell_lines and chemical_features of drugs for sensitivity prediction using a neural_network approach compare the performance of various machine_learning applied to the cancer cell_line datasets one potential limitation of these approaches is the formulation of a separate learning_task for each drug in particular because each pharmacogenomic screen profiles multiple drugs with similar mechanisms of action leveraging information across multiple related drugs may yield improved model robustness by reducing the impact of off target effects and drug specific experimental_noise moreover methods that jointly_model sensitivity_profiles across multiple drugs may yield insights into groups of drugs effecting similar biological_processes or infer mechanisms of action for uncharacterized compounds for

and infer a predictive_model for each cluster formulate predicting drug_resistance against a panel of hiv drugs as a multilabel learning_problem which aims to use all available information by learning models for all drugs simultaneously they show that this joint modeling_approach is better than independent modeling in terms of predictive_performance however their algorithm has some limitations i it is based on the classifier chains formulation i e training separate predictors for all drugs successively linked along a chain which is not sufficient to capture more complex dependencies between drugs ii it assumes that each data point have the corresponding drug_resistance score for all of the drugs considered i e no missing output which limits the applicability of the proposed method because in large_scale pharmacogenomic assays there may be many missing_values owing to experimental_conditions quality_control reasons etc for predicting drug_susceptibility against a panel of drugs we propose a novel bayesian formulation that combines kernelbased non linear dimensionality_reduction sch olkopf and and binary_classification or regression in a multitask_learning framework which tries to solve distinct but related_tasks jointly to improve overall generalization performance our proposed method called kernelized bayesian multitask_learning kbmtl has two key_properties i it maps all data_points into a shared subspace and learns predictive_models for all drugs simultaneously in this subspace to capture commonalities between the drugs joint modeling of drugs enables us to eliminate off target effects and drug specific experimental_noise leading to a better predictive_performance ii it can handle missing_values of drug_susceptibility measurements which enables us not to discard data_points with missing outputs leading to larger data collections as a result the obtained predictions become more robust especially for drugs with a large number of missing phenotype values to show the performance_gain of our method over standard modeling_approaches we perform cross_validation experiments on two benchmark drug_susceptibility datasets of hiv and cancer in this study we consider the problem of drug_susceptibility prediction based on pharmacogenomic screens against a panel of drugs in contrast to earlier_studies we choose to solve this problem with a multitask_learning formulation by considering each drug as a distinct task and learning a unified_model forthe scatterplots give the auroc values of the best baseline algorithm and kbmtl for replications on the x and y axes respectively for comparison blue kbmtl is better red kbmtl is worse i drug_susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs all tasks conjointly for this purpose we propose a novel bayesian multitask_learning algorithm that combines kernelbased non linear dimensionality_reduction and binary_classification to classify data_points as resistant or susceptible we formulate a deterministic variational approximation inference scheme which is more efficient than using a gibbs sampling_approach in terms of computation time we then extend our algorithm to regression to predict real valued outputs such as half_maximal and auc the main novelty of our approach comes from the joint bayesian formulation of projecting data_points into a shared subspace and learning predictive_models for all drugs in this subspace which enables us to capture commonalities between subsets of drugs to improve predictive_performance the increased performance is due to elimination of off target effects and drug specific experimental_noise that may be present in drug_susceptibility values another novelty of our approach comes from the ability to handle missing drug_susceptibility values owing to experimental_conditions and quality_control reasons which increases the effective_sample leading to more robust predictions especially for drugs with a large number of missing phenotype values to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm called kbmtl we perform cross_validation experiments on drug_susceptibility datasets of two major human_diseases namely hiv and cancer for the hiv dataset we classify viral reverse_transcriptase sequences as resistant or susceptible against eight nucleoside_analogs using mutation profiles extracted from sequence_information of the viral genotype our multitask_learning method obtains statistically_significantly better results on seven of eight drugs compared with two baseline single task learning methods that consider each drug separately for the cancer dataset we predict auc within the range of experimental screening concentrations for each cell_line against anticancer_drugs using gene_expression our method with the linear or gaussian_kernel obtains statistically_significantly better results on or of drugs respectively compared to a singletask learning method with the same kernel_function these results show that predicting drug_susceptibility against a panel of drugs simultaneously within a multitask_learning framework improves overall predictive_performance over single task learning approaches that learn drug specific models we implement both single task and multitask_learning methods using efficient variational approximation schemes where covariance calculations are the most time consuming steps because of matrix inversions brvm has on complexity per iteration but we need to train a separate model for each drug leading to otn overall complexity kbmtl learns a unified_model for all drugs conjointly and has orn nr tr complexity per iteration which shows that our algorithm has comparable computational_complexity with single task learning methods up to moderate values of r we envision several possible extensions of our work in future pharmacogenomic applications based on an analysis over kbmtl model_parameters we are able to identify groups of compounds with similar mechanisms of action as functional screens are being performed on increasingly large_numbers of compounds or genetic_perturbations often with poorly_characterized mechanisms or strong off target effects jointly modeling performance comparison between a brvm with the linear kernel b brvm with the gaussian_kernel c kbmtl with the linear kernel and d kbmtl with the gaussian_kernel in terms of nrmse values on cancer drug_sensitivity dataset the per drug and average performance results compare the algorithms using mean nrmse values_calculated over replications and mean nrmse values_calculated over drugs respectively the box and whisker and scatterplots compare the nrmse values of brvm on the x axis of the scatterplots and kbmtl on the y axis of the scatterplots with the same kernel for comparison blue kbmtl is better red kbmtl is worsenote the numbers in each comparison give statistically_significant wins according to the paired_t with p and wins according
