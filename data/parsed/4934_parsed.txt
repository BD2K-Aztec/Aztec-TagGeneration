xheinz an algorithm for mining cross_species network modules under a flexible conservation model motivation integrative network_analysis methods provide robust interpretations of differential high_throughput molecular_profile measurements they are often used in a biomedical contextto generate novel hypotheses about the underlying cellular_processes or to derive biomarkers for classification and subtyping the underlying molecular_profiles are frequently measured and validated on animal or cellular_models therefore the results are not immediately transferable to human in particular this is also the case in a study of the recently_discovered interleukin producing helper t cells th which are fundamental for anti_microbial immunity but also known to contribute to autoimmune_diseases results we propose a mathematical_model for finding active subnetwork modules that are conserved between two species these are sets of genes one for each species which i induce a connected subnetwork in a species specific interaction_network ii show overall differential behavior and iii contain a large number of orthologous_genes we propose a flexible notion of conservation which turns out to be crucial for the quality of the resulting modules in terms of biological interpretability we propose an algorithm that finds provably optimal or near optimal conserved_active in our model we apply our algorithm to understand the mechanisms_underlying th t cell_differentiation in both mouse and human as a main biological result we find that the key regulation of th differentiation is conserved between human and mouse availability_and xheinz an implementation of our algorithm as well as all input_data and results are available at http software cwi nl xheinz and as a galaxy service at http services cbib u bordeaux fr galaxy in cbib tools many computational_methods have been proposed for the analysis of molecular_profiles under different conditions studies_employing these methods aim to better understand the molecular changes in the underlying cellular_processes or to discover biomarkers as to classify between different conditions traditionally analysis methods have been gene centric that is they consider genes in isolation to establish differential_patterns by simple statistical_methods based on univariate statistical_tests for example one of the first studies used gene_expression to differentiate between two leukemia classes with the availability of increasingly reliable biological_network data for human and model_organisms gene centric approaches have been increasingly complemented by integrative network_analysis methods these methods yield active modules that is sets of genes that are connected in the network and show overall differential behavior by taking the network_topology into account integrative_analysis methods allow for a more robust interpretation of the measurements and result in more meaningful mechanistic_insights frequently for ethical or practical reasons molecular_profiles are measured and validated on animal or cellular_models and the results are therefore not immediately transferable to human in fact the low phase_ii survival_rate of of potential drug_compounds is largely attributed to the lack of transferability between model systems and human this is also an issue in the recently_discovered interleukin producing helper t cells th these cells form a separate subset of helper t cells with a differentiation pathway distinct from those of the established th and th cells th cells are known to contribute to pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune_diseases such as asthma rheumatoid_arthritis psoriasis and multiple_sclerosis and play also a role in cancer immunology understanding the pathways and regulatory_mechanisms that mediate the decision_making processes resulting in the formation of th is a critical step in the development of novel therapeutics unfortunately the vast_majority of data collected so_far originates from studies performed on mice and most importantly a comprehensive comparison of the th differentiation process in model_organisms and in human is missing several studies indicate that the differentiation and phenotype of human and mouse th cells are similar both subsets serve similar pro_inflammatory functions and produce the same hallmark cytokines and similar receptors furthermore most of the already identified regulator genes show high sequence_conservation other studies however show stimulus requirements for effective differentiation of human cells that differ from those required for mice a characterization of the similarities and differences will not only increase our understanding of this fundamental_process but is also essential for sound translational_research to do so we suggest finding conserved_active whose comprising genes show overall differential behavior induce a connected subnetwork and are largely conserved across the species well conserved modules make it possible to perform the experimental work and data analysis on the model_organism at the same time the results are likely to be transferable to human in addition conserved modules carry a stronger signal than individual species modules because they integrate the signal of the individual data_sources finding conserved_active however is a difficult_task separately computing species specific active modules generally results in modules that are not conserved which partially explains why experimental_results are so often not transferable conversely the largest conserved modules as established for example with methods for network_alignment are not necessarily active a computational_model for finding conserved_active requires thus a notion of both activity and conservation see several authors already identified the benefits of combining and comparing cross_species experiments at the single gene level vanhave demonstrated that conserved co expression is a strong co evolutionary signal more recent_studies suggested to identify_conserved biological_processes analyzed transcriptomics profiles of human and mouse macrophages_and to derive common response genes involved in innate_immunity proposed a method for the analysis of gene_expression data that takes the homology structure between the different species into account found that murine and human responses to lupus_nephritis involves similar gene_networks they first derived species specific networks of significantly_differentially and then determined common subnetworks using a graph_matching algorithm presented a multi species integrative_method to heuristically identify_conserved biclusters in their setting a conserved bicluster is a subset of orthologous_genes and a subset of conditions that achieve a high score with respect to co expression motif co occurrence and network density dede and og ul introduced a method that finds triclusters consisting of genes that are coexpressed across a subset of samples and a subset of species suggested the nexus algorithm for finding conserved active subnetworks the authors use average fold a b c conserved_active given two species specific protein networks and for each species two sets of expression_profiles of many different samples measured under two different conditions a we can annotate the nodes in the networks with activity scores b and identify modules that are at the same time highly differentially_expressed and well conserved c cross species_conservation is indicated by dotted lines note that the best active module is not necessarily the best conserved active module change of genes in a module as a measure for activity to deal with conservation they collapse paralogous genes within a cluster of orthologous_genes cog into single nodes in the respective networks they find modules using a seed and extend greedy heuristic that starts from a pair of orthologous seed nodes and then tries to simultaneously grow the two subnetworks by including pairs of neighboring orthologous_genes this strategy enforces a very stringent conservation policy only modules whose genes are fully conserved are found in addition the locality of the greedy search_strategy impairs the ability to find larger conserved modules and extending the search_space around the seed genes drastically increases the runtime in recent work introduce moduleblast a method that similarly to nexus represents groups of orthologous_proteins as single nodes in a combined network and tries to find connected subnetworks that are differentially_expressed the novelty of the method is the classification of the found modules according to the sign of the log_fold expression values by doing so the authors are able to assess whether conserved_active show consistent or inconsistent expression_patterns like nexus moduleblast requires strict conservation of module genes here we propose a mathematical_model for identifying conserved_active for two species it builds upon a model for single species modules described in and inherits its notions for modularity and activity a set of genes forms a module if it induces a connected subnetwork the activity of a module is the sum of the activities of its genes which are determined using a beta uniform mixture_model on the distribution of p values that characterize the differential behavior instead of enforcing a stringent conservation policy our model allows to specify the fraction of nodes in the solution that must be conserved we cast our model as an integer_linear formulation and present xheinz a branch and cut algorithm that given enough time solves this model to provable optimality or if stopped before reports a solution with a quality guarantee xheinz is the first method that flexibly deals with conservation we apply xheinz to understand the mechanisms_underlying th t cell_differentiation in both mouse and human as a main biological result we find that the key regulation factors of th differentiation are conserved between human and mouse and demonstrate that all aspects of our model are needed to obtain this insight we further demonstrate the robustness of our approach by comparing samples of the differentiation process obtained at different time points in which we search for optimal conserved_active under a wide_range of conservation ratios using a permutation_test we show that our results are statistically_significant finally we discuss the main differences between our results and the results obtained by the nexus tool on the same data_set we introduce a mathematical_model for the problem of finding active subnetwork modules that are conserved between two species and thus contribute to formalizing the notion of conserved_active a key feature of our model is a flexible notion of conservation which is controlled by a parameter a we require that at least a fraction a of the nodes are conserved between the speciesspecific modules of a solution note that in case of more distantlyrelated species a smaller a value may be more appropriate we have translated our model into an integer_linear formulation and have devised and implemented an exact branch and cut algorithm that computes provably optimal or near optimal conserved_active in our model our computational_experiments for understanding_the th t cell_differentiation in both mouse and human demonstrate that the flexibility in the definition of conservation is crucial for the computation of meaningful conserved_active we have found two conserved th modules at time points h a and h a that thoroughly encompass the biphasic th differentiation process this result can not be revealed by requiring full conservation a or by independent modules without requiring conservation a likewise nexus an alternative approach based on a stringent conservation model is not able to capture the key regulatory program of the differentiation process a key_characteristics of our model is its flexibility this allows its extension to multiple species and time points which we will address in future work in this case however realistic instances will be harder to compute to optimality and will require the development of powerful algorithm engineering techniques
