genome_analysis hibrowse multi purpose statistical_analysis of genome_wide chromatin d organization recently_developed that couple next_generation with chromosome_conformation based techniques such as hi c and chia_pet allow for characterization of genome_wide chromatin d structure understanding the organization of chromatin in three dimensions is a crucial next step in the unraveling of global gene_regulation and methods for analyzing such data are needed we have developed hibrowse a user_friendly web_tool consisting of a range of hypothesis based and descriptive_statistics using realistic assumptions in null_models availability_and hibrowse is supported by all major browsers and is freely_available hyperbrowser uio no d software is implemented in python and source_code is available for download by following instructions on the main site methods for detection of genome_wide chromatin d conformation such as hi c and chiapet are drastically expanding our understanding of genome biology however statistical and computational_methods to analyze chromatin conformation capturebased data are needed many of the available methods focus on data visualization or are not suited for genome_wide statistical investigations the structure of chromatin makes statistical_analysis complicated due to correlations between the interaction frequencies caused by both sequence_dependent and topological_constraints a few statistical_tests have been proposed with varying possibilities to account for structural dependencies two useful command_line are the hiclib package and the homer software suit which both allow for noise removal outlier_detection and compartment identification the homer software additionally allows for identification of significant interactions in a given dataset assuming a binomial_distribution and a background model taking_into sequence_based and compartmental biases the global nature of these data allow for other types of statistical investigations beyond detecting significance of individual interactions a common type of analysis is to analyze a set of genomic_elements genes regulatory_elements transcription_factors etc and ask how this subset or query track is spatially arranged in d space as represented by a hi c dataset for example here we present hibrowse a web_based analysis server for performing statistical_analysis of d genomes in a range of different settings the available statistics provide a flexible and expandable catalog of tools based on state of the art statistical_methods utilizing monte_carlo mc and analytic_methods as suited in addition to a range of tools for visualization and hypothesis generating investigations for such biases using the method of furthermore a specialized tool has been developed to allow users to upload their own hi c data or similar into the history even if the dataset itself does not conform to well known formats see supplementaryfor a list of already installed and pre processed hi c datasets
