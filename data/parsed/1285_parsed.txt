decod fast and accurate discriminative dna motif_finding motivation motif_discovery is now routinely used in high_throughput studies including large_scale sequencing and proteomics these datasets present new challenges the first is speed many motif_discovery methods do not scale well to large_datasets another issue is identifying discriminative rather than generative motifs such discriminative motifs are important for identifying co factors and for explaining changes in behavior between different conditions results to address_these we developed a method for deconvolved discriminative motif_discovery decod decod uses a k_mer count table and so its running time is independent of the size of the input_set by deconvolving the k_mers decod considers context information without using the sequences directly decod outperforms previous methods both in speed and in accuracy when using simulated and real_biological benchmark data we performed new binding_experiments for p mutants and used decod to identify p co factors suggesting new mechanisms for p activation availability the source_code for decod are available atdna motif_discovery has been a central problem in computational_biology for almost two decades many methods based on word enumeration or probabilistic_models including position_weight pwms and hidden_markov hmms have been developed for this task word enumerationbased methods are usually only able to find short motifs and tend to fail when the motif includes weak positions most probabilistic methods involve iteratively scanning the input_sequences to identify potential motifs and then updating the motifs to improve the likelihood of the model until convergence in such methods motifs are usually defined as subsequences which are present at a much higher rate than expected when compared with a background model d the use of motif_discovery methods has dramatically_increased over the last few years due to the rise in sequencing capacity and the advancement of other high_throughput methods these methods are routinely used to identify and predict transcription_factor protein phosphorylation_sites micrornas targets and alternative_splicing locations however these high_throughput methods have also led to new requirements from motif search algorithms the first is speed many studies now routinely search for motifs in very large sets of input_sequences for example several chip_seq identify thousands of targets for specific mammalian transcription_factors the second requirement is for identifying discriminative motifs unlike traditional motif searches that are performed against a general background model in discriminative motif search one looks for motifs that are present at a high rate in a positive set compared to a negative set these sets can be genes that are up or downregulated at a specific time point or condition proteins that are initially co localized but later diverge genes that are bound in one condition by a tf but not in another etc these and other studies including cross_species analysis and methods for modeling gene_regulation require discriminative motif_discovery methods that can scale to large_datasets several discriminative motif_finding methods have been developed so_far dips uses a probabilistic score to quantify the difference in the number of occurrences of a pwm between two sets of sequences and uses heuristic hill climbing to search the sequences for motifs that maximizes this score alse uses a target function based on the hypergeometric_distribution this function searches for a pwm using an em like heuristic and then evaluates the likelihood that the pwm it identified represents a real motif deme performs a combination of global and local_search to find a pwm that maximizes the conditional log_likelihood of the sequence labels given the sequences and models parameters seeder is a word based enumerative method it first generates seeds by finding significantly_enriched words in the positive set based on a word specific background probability_distribution and then iteratively extends these seeds to form a new pwm and updates the seeds until convergence cmf is also a word based method that starts by finding enriched words in the positive set based on a z_score and thenpage we presented decod a novel method for discriminative motif_finding in dna_sequences decod uses a deconvolution method which allows it to have a run time independent of the input_data size while still taking_into context information
