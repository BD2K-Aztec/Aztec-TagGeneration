genome_analysis sim db and leaff utilities for fast batch spliced alignment and sequence indexing the large number of genomes that will be sequenced will need to be annotated with genes and other functional features aligning gene sequences from a related species to the target_genome is an economical and highly_reliable method to identify genes unfortunately existing_tools have been lacking in sensitivity and speed a program we reported sim cc was shown to be highly_accurate but is limited to comparing one cdna with one genomic_sequence we present here an optimization of the tool implemented in the packages sim db and leaff the new tool performs batch alignments of cdna and genomic_sequences in a fraction of the time required by its predecessor and thus is very well suited for genome_wide analyses availability sim db and leaff are written in c c and perl for linux and other unix platforms source_code is distributed free of charge from http sourceforge net_projects kmer the number and variety of sequenced_genomes will continue to grow spectacularly the genomes_project g kcos alone will catalog and sequence more than species from across the spectrum of verterbate evolution and there are numerous ongoing projects to sequence plants and animals of agricultural importance or of more specialized scientific interest plant and animal genome conference http www intl pag org as sequencing becomes increasingly accessible one can expect many more groups and even individual investigators to sequence the genome of their studied organism these genomes will need to be annotated with genes and other functional features a key resource of gene information are the cdna mrna est_sequences already in the databases which can be readily aligned to a target_genome to produce gene models to further facilitate this comparative annotation approach an increasing number of projects are producing mixed collections of resources from several related species which are then used to analyze each of those genomes the fagaceae genomics project http www fagaceae org the genome_database for rosaceae http www rosaceae org sim db can be used to align a small or a very large number of pairs of sequences sequentially option pairwise or as prescribed by a script or to perform an all against all comparison while the genomic_sequences can be chromosomes a time saving strategy for genome wide_applications is to use sim db to refine alignments in regions detected by a less accurate but fast high_throughput mapper such as gmap or blat shows a typical user scenario where zebrafinch genbank ests were aligned to the recently assembled gb turkey genome turkey genome first sequences were mapped to the genome using gmap in cross_species mode x option then sim db realigned each cdna to its matching region extended on both sides by kb supplementary_material s asillustrates adding sim db produces longer alignments and leads to more mapped sequences for any coverage cutoff than using gmap alone overall sim db extends gmaps alignments by more than on average a significant gain in sensitivity a more detailed analysis of accuracy and comparison to other tools is included in supplementary_material s we also compared the run time of sim db versus a standard pipelined invocation of multiple sim ccs for this purpose pairings in the script were sorted by genomic_sequence index to minimize computationally_expensive accesses to the genome file thus each genomic_sequence was read the first time its index was encountered and then reused on subsequent calls involving that index two tests were performed in the first test a perl script read_pairs of sequences directly from the multi fasta files invoking sim cc for each pair in the second test the leaff utility waswe described a utility sim db for performing batch spliced alignment of cdna and genomic_sequences from the same or related species the tool has the high_accuracy of its predecessors sim and sim cc but is two orders_of owing to its multithreaded design and fast sequence indexing sim db can be invoked from the command_line or can be combined with a fast sequence search_engine for automated use compact fast and accurate and delivering provenly more accurate alignments than existing_tools we believe sim db is a much needed addition to every genome annotators repertoire of tools
