a new method for designing degenerate_primers and its use in the identification of sequences in brachiaria showing similarity to apomixis associated genes motivation we developed a technique and a tool for degenerate primer_design based on multiple local_alignments employing the meme algorithm supported with electronic pcr the objective is to find adequate primers starting from sequences with poor global similarity we show an example of its application in our laboratory to find sequences in brachiaria with similarity to ests related to apomixis classical_methods for degenerate primer_design include software applications such as codehop or primaclade these methods usually rely on the identification of clear blocks of conserved_regions in multiple global alignments therefore alignment_quality should be very high however in many cases primer_design using multiple global alignments is unsuccessful due to poor conservation among the sequences under study to overcome this problem we propose a new method to design primers which could be used for sequences with poor global similarity or without well conserved blocks in multiple global alignments instead the technique is based on multiple local_alignments using the multiple expectation_maximization for motif elicitation meme algorithm in order to search for conserved_regions long enough to serve as primers the results of meme are then verified by electronic pcr e pcr and standard primer_design programs we employed this technique to design degenerate_primers for sequences related to apomixis in the tropical forage grass brachiaria we demonstrate that the amplification of sequences with similarity to genes reported in other species possibly homologues is possible even when the species in question is poorly_characterized at the molecular level to whom correspondence should be addressed in conclusion we were able to develop a new bioinformatics method and a corresponding tool to amplify genes associated with a very poorly_characterized phenomenon at the molecular level such as apomixis this method could help to obtain amplifications in other poorly_understood biological_events in which there are few related sequences in general terms the technique can be used for sequences that have very few known homologues or to confirm them and to design degenerate_primers when the classical_methods do not work the method however needs to be improved for instance trying to automatize the time consuming steps and avoiding sequences with low similarity patterns our results will allow the analysis of all those proposed candidate_genes for apomixis in a unique plant_species
