finding metabolic_pathways using atom tracking motivation finding novel or non standard metabolic_pathways possibly spanning multiple species has important_applications in fields such as metabolic_engineering metabolic network_analysis and metabolic network_reconstruction traditionally this has been a manual process but the large_volume of metabolic data now available has created a need for computational_tools to automatically identify biologically_relevant pathways results we present new algorithms for finding metabolic_pathways given a desired start and target_compound that conserve a given number of atoms by tracking the movement of atoms through metabolic_networks containing thousands of compounds and reactions first we describe an algorithm that identifies linear pathways we then present a new algorithm for finding branched metabolic_pathways comparisons to known metabolic_pathways demonstrate that atom tracking enables our algorithms to avoid many unrealistic connections often found in previous_approaches and return biologically_meaningful pathways our results also demonstrate the potential of the algorithms to find novel or non standard pathways that may span multiple_organisms over the last few decades experimental_studies on metabolic_networks coupled with computational_methods have generated increasingly large_amounts of data in turn many specialized databases have been created to store and organize information about metabolic_networks these networks are usually presented as many small subpathways that are manually divided based on function however it is often difficult to navigate these subpathways to find connections between compounds especially for novel or non standard routes used in applications such as metabolic_engineering furthermore as more information is accumulated from metagenome work on multispecies communities it is of interest to find pathways that are a composition of the metabolic_pathways from multiple_organisms combining parts of pathways existing in different organisms can lead to new ways of considering how metabolism works in complex to whom correspondence should be addressed communities and provide novel routes to form important and useful compounds consequently computational_identification of biologically_relevant pathways in large metabolic_networks is required for applications such as metabolic_engineering metabolic network_analysis and metabolic network_reconstruction the main contribution of this article is a pair of algorithms that find metabolic_pathways by using atom mapping data to track the movement of atoms through metabolic_networks one algorithm finds linear pathways and the other algorithm finds branched pathways they both take as input atom mapping data a start compound a target_compound a minimum number of atoms to conserve and a maximum number of pathways to return a set of metabolic_pathways which conserve at least given number of atoms from the start compound to the target_compound are returned atom tracking is a crucial feature in finding meaningful metabolic_pathways because it essentially eliminates spurious connections and reactions that do not correspond to useful or real biochemical_pathways or reactions which are present in earlier work furthermore we are able to harness atom tracking in order to find branched pathways while atom tracking does increase the complexity of finding pathways we demonstrate that our algorithms can efficiently identify both linear and branched metabolic_pathways in which a certain threshold of atoms are conserved the resulting metabolic_pathways are validated on known functional pathways and reveal the potential of our algorithms to find novel or alternative_pathways that may span multiple_organisms in this section we first provide a brief evaluation of our approach on linear pathways we then present three biologically_motivated examples of branched pathways found by our algorithms that cannot be found using pathfinding methods available in the literature the atom mapping graph used in all of the experiments contained compound nodes and mapping nodes built from kegg rpair data from the kegg reaction database we obtain reactions from over organisms which have corresponding kegg rpair entries the kegg data was acquired in july for the purposes of the results in this article only carbon_atoms were tracked but the methods described can be used to track atoms of interest as long as proper atom mapping data is provided the resulting pathways presented are ranked first by the number of carbon_atoms they conserve and then by the number of reactions they contain the implementation was done in java using the chemical development kit and the java universal network graph framework http jung sourceforge net all result figures are drawn using graphviz http www research att com sw tools graphviz all experiments were run on a single core from a ghz intel_xeon e with access to gb of ram for the branched pathways the input k for eppsteins k shortest_paths algorithm was set to one million and the seed pathways were chosen as all paths without cycles containing less mapping nodes than the shortest_path plus four
