gene_expression estimates of allele_specific in drosophila with a single genome_sequence and rna_seq motivation genetic_variation in cis_regulatory is an important cause of variation in gene_expression cis_regulatory variation can be detected by using high_throughput rna_seq to identify differences in the expression of the two alleles of a gene this requires that reads from the two alleles are equally likely to map to a reference_genome s and that single_nucleotide snps are accurately called so that reads derived from the different alleles can be identified both of these prerequisites can be achieved by sequencing the genomes of the parents of the individual being studied but this is often prohibitively costly results in drosophila we demonstrate that biases during read_mapping can be avoided by mapping reads to two alternative genomes that incorporate snps called from the rna_seq the snps can be reliably called from the rna_seq itself provided any variants not found in high_quality snp databases are filtered out finally we suggest a way of measuring allele_specific ase by crossing the line of interest to a reference line with a high_quality genome_sequence combined with our bioinformatic_methods this approach minimizes mapping biases allows poor_quality data to be identified and removed and aides in the biological_interpretation of the data as the parent of origin of each allele is known in conclusion our results suggest that accurate estimates of ase do not require the parental genomes of the individual being studied to be sequenced availability_and scripts used to perform our analysis are available at https github com d quinn bio quinn recently high_throughput rna_seq in which a library of millions of short cdna_fragments are sequenced in parallel has emerged as the preferred method for genome_wide studies of gene_expression gene_expression polymorphism is the result of differences in either cis_or regulatory_elements as transregulatory changes affect the expression of both alleles equally the role of cis_regulatory variation can be determined by examining differences in expression between alleles termed allelespecific expression ase detection of ase from rna_seq involves mapping sequence_reads to their region of origin and assigning them to separate alleles both of these steps are non trivial and in need of further development reads can be mapped to a single reference_genome however this method is inherently biased reads representing reference alleles are more likely to map correctly than those representing non reference alleles because they contain fewer mismatches yielding estimates of ase that favor the reference illustrated this problem by generating a simulated human rna_seq dataset that contained an equal number of reference and non reference reads the authors found that reads carrying the single_nucleotide snp allele found in the reference_genome were significantly more likely to be mapped increasing the error_rate in the sequence_reads increases the bias by introducing additional mismatches to the reference_genome in both humans and drosophila the degree of bias is unequal across genes with loci containing clusters of snps showing a strong bias toward the reference_sequence therefore even if the average bias across all genes toward mapping reads matching the reference_genome is just a few percent individual_loci may have far greater biases the importance of clusters of snps also means that the problem is expected to be greater in species like drosophila_melanogaster that have a far greater density of snps than humans one way in which researchers have attempted to overcome the bias is by aligning_reads separately to maternal and paternal genomes or to transcriptomes these methods are effective but are not useful in cases in which parental genotypes cannot be readily or cost effectively obtained another strategy involves aligning_reads to a reference_genome supplemented with all possible haplotypes within one read_length again this technique has been shown to reduce the reference bias however it is impractical for use in systems that contain many polymorphisms as the number of haplotypes increases exponentially with the number of polymorphic_sites this problem can be reduced by phasing the data using population_genetic data provided that genotypes are available from multiple_individuals a third solution has been proposed by in which analysis of ase is restricted to genomic_regions with fewer differentiating to whom correspondence should be addressed sites than the number of mismatches allowed this solution is not ideal however as it requires one to discard useful data ultimately decreasing statistical_power finally altering the alignment parameters can reduce the bias but does not eliminate it while a comparison of different alignment software_packages revealed little difference among them once reads have been mapped to the reference_sequence they are assigned to separate alleles and counted this can be accomplished by identifying snps between alleles unfortunately snp calls from rna_seq are not reliable because of the fact that there is no a priori expectation regarding read frequencies for each snp allele as there is when sequencing genomic_dna from a diploid individual therefore it is unclear whether unequal frequencies of reads from the two alleles are because of strong ase or an incorrect snp call furthermore rna_editing can alter the sequence of rna after transcription and these changes can be mistaken for snps accurate snp calls are important for obtaining reliable estimates of ase because errors in snp_calling like mapping errors will introduce bias toward one allele thus snps are typically called from genomic_data although this method is generally effective there are situations in which one would want to determine ase without the extra time and cost associated with acquiring genomic_sequences here we present a protocol for obtaining accurate ase estimates in d melanogaster which involves creating an alternate reference_sequence featuring snps called directly from an rna_seq dataset after filtering out snps not observed in a high_quality snp database our methodology is advantageous in that it only requires a single reference_sequence can be used in systems that contain many polymorphisms and does not involve discarding data based on the number of mismatches in a region we have developed a protocol for obtaining accurate per snp and per gene estimates of ase from rna_seq the main advantage of this protocol is that it does not require parental genomic_sequences snps used to get allele counts are called directly from the rna_seq this can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with measuring ase unexpectedly it does not appear that phased data are required for getting unbiased per snp measures of ase using our datasets we found that our estimates were nearly the same with and without phasing however phased data are required for combining snps to obtain per gene measures of ase and this also allows us to remove unreliable reads and snps we show that the data can be phased if genotype of interest is crossed to the homozygous strain used to generate the reference_genome although this will only be possible in drosophila and other model_organisms the main_drawback to our method is that it requires knowledge of variation in the population of the organism of study as this allows filtering to remove snp_calling errors in drosophila this data is readily available as new sequencing_technologies mean that comprehensive snp databases are available from increasing numbers of species this approach will become viable in even more species especially those with short generations
