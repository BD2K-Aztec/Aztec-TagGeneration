statistical_model based testing to evaluate the recurrence of genomic_aberrations motivation in cancer_genomes chromosomal_regions harboring cancer_genes are often subjected to genomic_aberrations like copy_number and loss_of given this finding recurrent genomic_aberrations is considered an apt approach for screening cancer_genes although several permutation_based tests have been proposed for this purpose none of them are designed to find recurrent aberrations from the genomic dataset without paired_normal sample controls their application to unpaired genomic_data may lead to false_discoveries because they retrieve pseudo aberrations that exist in normal genomes as polymorphisms results we develop a new parametric method_named parametric aberration recurrence test part to test for the recurrence of genomic_aberrations the introduction of poisson binomial statistics allow us to compute small p values more efficiently and precisely than the previously_proposed permutation based_approach moreover we extended part to cover unpaired data part up so that there is a statistical basis for analyzing unpaired genomic_data part up uses information from unpaired normal sample controls to remove pseudo aberrations in unpaired genomic_data using part up we successfully predict recurrent genomic_aberrations in cancer cell_line samples whose paired_normal sample controls are unavailable this article thus proposes a powerful statistical_framework for the identification of driver aberrations which would be applicable to ever increasing amounts of cancer genomic_data seen in the era of next_generation availability our implementations of part and part up are available fromcancer genomes often exhibit chromosomal_aberrations like copy_number and loss_of loh a chromosomal aberration potentially leads to the functional alteration of cancer_genes and could be a driver for oncogenesis for example if the copy_number of some locus is amplified residing oncogenes would be functionally activated conversely the presence of tumor_suppressor are associated with chromosomal deletion and loh however most aberrations are so_called passengers which accompany driver aberrations by chance and do not have any causal_relationship with oncogenesis therefore it is important problem to discriminate the driver aberrations from the passenger ones given that driver aberrations recurrently occur around driver cancer_genes whereas to whom correspondence should be addressed passenger aberrations randomly exist across chromosomes finding recurrent chromosomal_aberrations is deemed a powerful approach for discovering driver aberrations and associated driver_genes in the past_decade microarray_technology has enabled genomewide profiling of copy_number and homozygosity the application of microarrays to cancer_genomes has revealed prevalent aberrations in cancer_cells and produced a large amount of genomic_data which are rich resources for the identification of potential driver loci by examining the presence of aberrations across all chromosomal positions in multiple samples we have a binary aberration profile matrix whose rows and columns correspond to chromosomal positions and samples respectively we wish to find chromosomal positions where a significantly large fraction of samples are subjected to aberration there are a number of computational_methods to statistically screen for recurrent genomic_aberrations most of which are based on permutation_tests for example gistic calculates the value of statistic scoring recurrence for each genomic_position while the null_distribution of the statistic is obtained using null aberration profile matrices which are generated by permuting positions of the binary aberration profile matrix for each sample finally gistic reports the significance of recurrence at each position and predicts driver loci by detecting the peaks of the significance plot although the permutation approach is successful in finding driver aberrations it is computationally_intensive especially when we need to calculate small p values precisely usually aberration profiling of a cancer genome is performed by comparing a tumor sample with the paired_normal sample for example loh is called for a position whose genotype changes from a heterozygous_state in a normal genome to a homozygous state in the paired tumor genome when the paired_normal sample is not available aberration profiling is also possible loh could be called for a chromosomal segment that has successive homozygous state in the tumor genome however it has been reported that we would confront false_positive calls in such unpaired experimental_designs an obtained loh might be only a polymorphic homozygous segment that exists in the paired_normal genome to find recurrent aberrations we developed a novel parametric test parametric aberration recurrence test part using poissonbinomial statistics part can be used for efficient and precise calculation of small p values as compared with the permutation approach moreover we extend part to cover unpaired data part up to find recurrent aberrations in unpaired experimental_designs part up computes the significance of aberration recurrence by taking_into the false_positive which is calculated from the unpaired normal sample data by applying part up to simulated_and we demonstrate thatcopyedited by trj manuscript category in this study we presented a novel statistical_method part to test the recurrence of genomic aberration although a a bnumber of methods have been developed for similar purposes most of them take permutation approaches to assess_statistical conversely our method_takes a novel parametric approach by employing poisson binomial statistics there are pros_and between the two approaches our parametric approach needs less computational time and can calculate small p values more accurately than the permutation approach this property is important for genomic analysis because we usually need to calculate small p values to correct large_scale multiple_hypothesis conversely although our approach must take the count of aberrant samples as a test_statistic the permutation approach is flexible for the type of statistic and can enable more biologically_plausible tests for example the gistic statistic takes into consideration aberration strength in addition to recurrence however in spite of these differences we found that part and gistic produce consistent results on the copy_number data see supplementary note the most notable advantage of our parametric approach is highlighted by the extension of part to part up although it is preferable that genomic aberration profilings are performed in paired experimental_designs it is not always possible to obtain paired_normal samples however part up is applicable only if data are accompanied with unpaired normal samples from the same cohort which are generally easier to obtain although previously_proposed methods are not able to deal with such unpaired data the introduction of poisson binomial statistics enables us to test recurrent aberrations in unpaired data while considering the rate of pseudo aberrations that originate from normal genomes although a method has been proposed to call aberrations in individual tumor_samples using the pooled unpaired normal sample as a reference testing for the recurrence of aberrations in a group of unpaired tumor_samples is a novel approach it is expected that combining these complementary approaches will reduce false_positives and lead to higher performance
