integrative gene_set of multi_platform data with sample_heterogeneity motivation gene_set is a popular method for large_scale genomic studies because genes that have common biological_features are analyzed jointly gene_set often achieves better power and generates more biologically informative results with the advancement of technologies genomic studies with multi_platform data have become increasingly common several strategies have been proposed that integrate genomic_data from multiple_platforms to perform gene_set to evaluate the performances of existing integrative gene_set methods under various scenarios we conduct a comparative simulation analysis based on the cancer_genome breast_cancer dataset results we find that existing_methods for gene_set are less effective when sample_heterogeneity exists to address_this we develop three methods for multi_platform genomic_data with hetero geneity two non parametric methods multi_platform mannwhitney statistics and multi_platform outlier robust t statistics and a paramet ric method multi_platform likelihood_ratio statistics using simulations we show that the proposed multi_platform mannwhitney statistics method has higher power for heterogeneous_samples and comparable_performance for homogeneous samples when compared with the existing_methods our real_data applications to two datasets of the cancer_genome also suggest that the proposed methods are able to identify novel pathways that are missed by other strategies availability_and http www stat ncsu edu jytzeng software multiplatform gene_set high_throughput genome_wide assays such as microarray and next_generation have become more reliable and affordable with the ever increasing throughput and the scale of omics studies more and more projects choose to measure multiple genomic_features e g gene_expression methylation gene_mutation copy_number promoter_binding and protein expression on the same samples evaluating multiple genome features can lead to a better examination of functional_responses and provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying_biological in recent_years well known large_scale projects such as the cancer_genome tcga the cancer_cell and the encyclopedia of dna elements have generated genomic_profiles across multiple_platforms in addition more and more recent projects in the gene_expression contain multi_platform data with diverse data types from different platforms it becomes challenging to properly integrate analyze and interpret the results to obtain biological_insights gene_set is a powerful strategy developed to analyze large_scale profiling data instead of studying one gene at a time gene_set focuses on a set of related genes such as genes in one kyoto_encyclopedia pathway or those related to the same gene_ontology term joint analysis of genes in a set often improves power especially when the signals of individual genes are moderate because the set itself often has biological meanings gene_set also facilitates the interpretation of experiment results and helps to identify important biological findings many methods have been developed to perform gene_set in a single_platform for example gene_set gsea gsa and globaltest several review_articles have been published that discuss the performances of different gene_set methods gene_set on multi_platform genomic_data is gaining momentum approaches can be roughly classified into three different categories characterized by how the multi_platform information is integrated the first type performs a gene_set on each platform and then combines the single_platform information such as p values e g such a strategy is commonly used when the multi_platform data are from similar but not identical samples the second strategy such as that used in the sumz approach of first sums the gene specific association score of each platform to compute a multi_platform score for each gene and then uses the gene scores to perform gene_set the third strategy is similar to the second except that it directly derives the multi_platform gene scores using data from all platforms simultaneously one representative approach is the integrative int approach proposed by to whom correspondence should be addressed which uses a logistic_regression with all multi_platform values of a gene as predictors and takes the model deviances as the gene scores for downstream gene_set bayesian_methods have also been developed to analyze multi_platform genomic_data e g ibag and paradigm compared with traditional gene_set methods bayesian_methods often use extensive knowledge of the biological_relationships among different data platforms and or the interactions between studied genes sample_heterogeneity refers to molecular and cellular differences among biological_samples such differences are commonly_encountered in complex_diseases like cancer where cases with different genotypes genomic copy_numbers or expression_patterns often lead to different disease progressions and treatment_strategies several methods have been developed to address sample_heterogeneity e g cancer outlier profile analysis outlier sum outlier robust t statistics ort cancer likelihood_ratio statistics lrs and non parametric change_point statistics although the superiority of these methods over ordinary analysis has been demonstrated with heterogeneous data in a single_platform to the best of our knowledge there are no corresponding gene_set approaches for multi_platform heterogeneous data the impact of sample_heterogeneity on multi_platform analyses can be more substantial than on single_platform analyses first the level of heterogeneity can be different from platform to platform e g platforms such as somatic_mutations and dna_methylation have much higher diversity heterogeneity among individuals and samples than dna_copy in addition the heterogeneous subsets can be different from one platform to another e g some samples might have changes on platform a but no changes on platform b whereas different subsets of samples have changes on platform b but not on platform a such a scenario may lead to power_loss due to the attenuation of signals when the association is evaluated across platforms in contrast a multi_platform method that can tackle platform specific heterogeneous data would be able to identify the signals when integrating information across platforms in this study we perform simulation_studies to systematically evaluate different integrative methods under a range of scenarios we observe that the true_positive rates tpr and the truenegative rates of existing multi_platform gene_set methods decrease dramatically when heterogeneity exists these results motivated us to construct three methods to account for sample_heterogeneity in multi_platform gene_set multi_platform mannwhitney statistics mpmws multi_platform outlier robust t statistics mport and multi_platform likelihood_ratio statistics mplrs we use simulations and real_data to demonstrate the utility of these methods under various conditions in the presented work we compared different multi_platform methods for gene_set using extensive simulated studies first when there is no sample_heterogeneity we found that int and hotellings t method had the best performances compared with other methods int might have wider applicability compared with hotellings t because it can accommodate covariates second to account for sample_heterogeneity we proposed and tested three different strategies mpmws mport and mplrs for multi_platform gene_set we found that the non parametric mpmws method had satisfactory tprs and robust performance regardless of the degree of heterogeneity finally based on the results of the simulations and the real_data applications we recommend using both mpmws and int the significant gene_sets identified by both methods are more likely to be true_positives while each approach is able to identify orthogonal yet relevant biological gene_sets it might be worth following up with these orthogonal findings combining with additional biological_information so to minimize the false_positives we performed the tests assuming that genes are uncorrelated within and across platforms this assumption may not be valid in real practice especially for genes within the same gene_sets inter gene correlation is known to inflate the fdr of singleplatform gene_set and several methods have been proposed to address_this in addition the genomic variables of a gene from different platforms can also be highly_correlated with each other for example copy_number change can lead to a change of transcript_level and a high methylation_level of the gene promoter_region often leads to downregulation of transcription it is worth future_studies to evaluate how inter gene and inter platform correlations will affect multi_platform gene_set in our analysis we ignored the issues of missing_values by focusing on genes with complete observations in all platforms in reality missing_data are commonly observed in large_scale studies because of the experimental_conditions individual sample differences or platform constraints when a considerable amount of data are missing removing all the samples or genes with missing_data could lead to substantial_loss of information ten of gene_sets were selected as causal and the results were averaged over repeats to address_this imputing can be used to fill in the missing_values performing self contained gene_set tests is another strategy further research is needed to characterize the patterns of missing_data on different platforms understand their impact on the gene_set and develop the proper statistical_methods for missing_data the r code for all of the methods and test datasets are available on the web_site http www stat ncsu edu jytzeng software multiplatform gene_set
