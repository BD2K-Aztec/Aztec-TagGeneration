systems_biology protr protrweb r package and web_server for generating various numerical representation schemes of protein_sequences amino_acid derived structural and physiochemical descriptors are extensively utilized for the research of structural functional expression and interaction profiles of proteins and peptides we developed protr a comprehensive r package for generating various numerical representation schemes of proteins and peptides from amino_acid the package calculates eight descriptor groups composed of types of commonly used descriptors that include about descriptor values it allows users to select amino_acid from the aaindex database and use self defined properties to construct customized descriptors for proteochemometric mod eling it calculates six types of scales based descriptors derived by various dimensionality_reduction methods the protr package also integrates the functionality of similarity_score computation derived by protein sequence_alignment and gene_ontology semantic_similarity within a list of proteins and calculates profile_based protein features based on position_specific we also developed protrweb a user_friendly web_server for calculating descriptors presented in the protr package availability_and the protr package is freely_available from cran http cran r project org packageprotr protrweb is freely_available protrweb protein_sequence is the ultimate resource for functional protein research in order to apply various machine_learning on protein sequence_data it is common practice to encode sequence_information as numerical features the type of encoding however can significantly affect analyses and choosing a precise and effective encoding is a critical step in bioinformatics sequence derived structural and physicochemical features have been widely_applied in the research of protein_structure and functions during the past_two such as protein structural and functional_classes proteinprotein_interactions subcellular_locations and peptides of specific properties and post_translational in chemogenomics these structural and physicochemical descriptors are also routinely used to characterize target_proteins in drugtarget_pairs for potential drugtarget_interaction discovery b in proteochemometric pcm modeling continuous descriptors derived by various molecular descriptor sets and dimensionality_reduction methods van are successfully employed in several applications such as dna_binding pattern analysis compound selection in lead_optimization van novel ligand discovery van proteases ligand selectivity modeling and predicting resistance to pesticides for agrochemicals van moreover for protein and peptides amino_acid and annotation based similarity_scores derived from sequence_alignments and gene_ontology go annotation comparison are also useful representation schemes which are widely used in modeling such as genome_wide inference of proteinprotein_interactions several web_servers and stand alone programs such as profeat pseaac propy have been established to calculate such structural and physicochemical descriptors however currently available solutions are often limited to certain types of descriptors lack flexibility and usually difficult to seamlessly integrate into the predictive_modeling pipeline we still urgently need a comprehensive and flexible toolkit to calculate and customize these descriptors here we introduce protr and protrweb the r package and web_server for calculating various numerical representation schemes of protein and peptides from amino_acid we recommend using protr to represent the proteins or peptides under investigation besides in the context of systems_biology we hope that protr will be useful for exploring the biological_questions about structures functions and interactions of proteins and peptides to the best of our knowledge protr is currently the most comprehensive flexible and integrated open_source toolkit for protein_sequence derived structural and physiochemical descriptor computation users can select appropriate descriptors calculated by protr or protrweb according to their needs and conveniently apply various statistical_analysis and machine_learning in r to solve various biological_questions concerning the structures functions and interactions of proteins and peptides users of the protr package need to intelligently evaluate the underlying details of the descriptors provided instead of using protr with their data blindly it would be wise to use some negative and positive control comparisons where relevant to help guide interpretation of the results the protr package has been intensively tested to guarantee the computation correctness and speed to ensure that our calculation is accurate the calculated descriptor values were compared with the known values for these sequences in future development of protr it is a potential direction to incorporate d structural_information of proteins which would be beneficial in several analysis and modeling scenerios
