gene_expression ontology aware classification of tissue and cell_type signals in gene_expression across platforms and technologies motivation leveraging gene_expression data through large_scale in tegrative analyses for multicellular_organisms is challenging because most samples are not fully annotated to their tissue cell_type of origin genome_scale expression_profiling is an invaluable technique for quantifying gene level activity under different experimental_conditions for more than a decade researchers and clinicians have submitted their experimental_data to public_repositories such as ncbis gene_expression geo and ebis arrayexpress these repositories now include almost half a million human expression_profiles from multiple laboratories and hospitalsonly to further grow with the advent_of technologies large but independent microarray_datasets have been used to discover tissue_specific patterns establish breast_cancer cancer genome and delineate the transcriptome response to candidate_drugs previous integrative studies have leveraged these independent datasets and have developed methods based on correlation differential_expression supervised_learning and data_integration however directly dealing with multicellularity is paramount for precisely defining human homeostasis disease_manifestation and pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics to some effect few studies have focused on certain sample characteristics such as disease or phenotype yet to take full advantage of the entire compendia in all the above contexts we must explicitly uncover tissue cell_type signals in genome_wide expression data the current exponential_rate of data submission nevertheless makes manual_annotation impractical leaving a curated annotation index for only a small fraction of samples supplementary text_mining sample descriptions are often unreliable due to the lack of standardized nomenclature and structured descriptive information furthermore textual information may not reflect the potential specificity and heterogeneity that are concealed in the molecular level expression measurements of these samples therefore we need a scalable and robust computational_method to discover the tissue cell_type signals in each gene_expression deposited in these large heterogeneous data compendia in practice tissue cell_type annotation of gene_expression relies on the expression of known biomarker genes although pervasive this approach is limited by the number of sufficient or often any known discriminative expression biomarkers and ignores potential specific signals in the entire transcriptome machine_learning that model genome_wide expression have emerged as promising alternatives but so_far have only been applied in the context of classifying tumor_subtypes e g all versus aml in single datasets applying such methods across a large collection of datasets is impeded by the dataset platform and technology biases the only successful attempt at addressing dataset biases is a nearest_neighbor nn classification_method based on the barcode algorithm the task of indexing these large heterogeneous data collections by tissues cell_types presents substantial challenges first a to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com successful method for this task should be able to classify the variety of human tissues cell_types not just the better studied large tissue classes for example classifying blood from brain is a relatively easy problem but discriminating among different subtypes of blood is a much harder one second the method should maintain consistency with the developmental and anatomical relationships between these tissues and cell_types third the method must be robust across independent datasets to overcome study laboratory biases finally with emerging profiling technologies the method should be readily_applicable to novel platforms technologies no existing approach to our knowledge addresses all these challenges here we present a computational algorithm unveiling rna sample annotation ursa that is the first to leverage the relationships between tissues and cell_types based on a tissue ontology and accurately identifies specific tissue cell_type signals present in a given gene_expression ursa constructs individual tissue cell_type classifiers based on ontology aware sample labels and uses bayesian_network correction bnc to integrate these individual classifiers we demonstrate that ursa substantially outperforms barcodebased nn classification the only prior approach to this problem as well as independent classifiers that do not use the tissue ontology furthermore although ursa is trained on data from the single most popular microarray_platform it is able to make tissue cell_type predictions without re training for samples measured by other microarray_platforms and even by next_generation in the process of classification our approach learns tissue celltype signals without the use of any tissue_specific gene database such as the human protein reference_database thus by examining the biological_pathways enriched among the feature weights in each tissue cell_type classifier we are able to provide a molecular level interpretation of ursas predictions we address the cell_type prediction challenge as a multilabel classification_problem with hierarchical constraints to account for the diverse nature of biological_samples we assess the impact of incorporating the tissue ontology in our method and the methods robustness across different microarray preprocessing methods although our method can be readily retrained to any additional expression technologies given manually_curated samples we find that our method is capable of precisely annotating samples across platforms including next_generation based assays without any modifications to the original method or its parameters we finally show that our tissue cell_type predictions are interpretable based on the biological_processes enriched among learned informative genes in multicellular_organisms integrative_analysis leveraging large gene_expression compendia requires accurate annotations ofsamples to their tissue and cell_type of origin in this article we present a scalable computational_method ursa that predicts tissue cell_type signals in expression_profiles across platforms and technologies key to its performance is the incorporation of the tissue ontology much of ursas improved_performance can be attributed to the construction of more than one hundred additional intermediate i e non leaf classifiers which are then integrated using a bayesian_framework ursa can be used to automatically annotate samples in public gene_expression repositories where most samples are currently lacking tissue cell_type information researchers can discover specific signals in their own samples via our interactive interface at ursa princeton edu others interested in integrative studies can download the ursa c software and annotate samples on a large_scale despite ursas current applicability to a wide_variety of tissues cell_types its predictions can be further improved as the ontology used for integration adds additional terms and associations for example immunologists may be interested in the signal of specific t lymphocytes such as cd t cells th cells germinal b cells and so forth unfortunately the current brenda ontology which was used as a controlled_vocabulary and the ontology structure of our method does not include such terms nonetheless ursas ability to delineate tissue cell_type signals without known biomarker genes makes it naturally extendable to such specific_cell as the brenda ontology is extended with more terms and associations we plan to regularly maintain and update the software with new tissue and cell_type annotations and the latest_version of the brenda ontology both the strength and the limitation of our method across platforms and technologies depend on the amount of tissue signal in the gene_order and the number of missing_values for a given gene_expression from a different platform quantile transformation is applied to compute hg plus like expression values in consequence our method is robust to different normalization techniques used because only the information of relative gene abundance is transferred however specific signals associated with the particular gene_expression value may be lost and properly incorporating such signals may provide greater prediction_accuracy furthermore expression values for genes not measured in hg plus could affect the accuracy of our method although simple mean imputation seems to alleviate that effect ursas tissue and cell_type models provide a biological_interpretation of its predictions as such ursa could potentially be used to test and identify possible sample contaminations resolve cancer samples of unknown_primary origin and perhaps provide insight into the molecular basis of poorly_characterized clinical_subtypes
