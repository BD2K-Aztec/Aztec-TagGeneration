a non independent energy based multiple_sequence improves prediction of transcription_factor motivation multiple_sequence msas are usually scored under the assumption that the sequences being aligned have evolved by common descent consequently the differences between sequences reflect the impact of insertions deletions and mutations however non coding dna_binding sequences such as transcription_factor tfbss are frequently not related by common descent and so the existing alignment scoring_methods are not well suited for aligning such sequences results we present a novel multiple msa methodology that scores tfbs dna_sequences by including the interdependence of neighboring bases we introduced two variants supported by different underlying null_hypotheses one statistically and the other thermo dynamically generated we assessed the alignments through their performance in tfbs_prediction both methods show considerable improvements when compared with standard msa algorithms moreover the thermodynamically generated null_hypothesis outper forms the statistical one due to improved_stability in the base_stacking free_energy of the alignment the thermodynamically generated null_hypothesis method can be downloaded from http sourceforge net_projects msa edna with the advent of third generation sequencing_technology the rate of genome_sequencing is likely to continue to outstrip the capacity for experimental analysis of gene function and regulation in addition there is a similar growth in the availability of transcription_factor tfbs sequences through genome_wide chip_seq methods thus there is a continued need for more accurate computational methodologies particularly important are multiple_sequence msa programs such as clustalw and dialign that are widely used to identify sections of protein or dna_sequences that share similar consensus these alignment programs generally work under the assumption that the sequences being aligned are evolutionarily_related and that they have been derived from a common_ancestor undergoing changes because of insertions deletions and substitutions this assumption is then built into scoring_matrices which are used to find the best possible alignment such as blosum and pam as well as for gap penalties however non coding_dna regions especially tfbss are rather more conserved and not necessarily evolutionarily_related and may have converged from noncommon ancestors thus the assumptions used to align protein_sequences and dna coding_regions are inherently different from those that hold for tfbs sequences although it is meaningful to align dna coding_regions for homologous_sequences using mutation operators alignment of binding_site sequences for the same transcription_factor cannot rely on mutation operators similarly the evolutionary operator of point_mutations can be used to define an edit_distance for coding_sequences but this has little meaning for tfbs sequences because any sequence_variation has to maintain a certain level of specificity for the binding_site to function it has been long known that interdependencies between neighboring dna bases have a significant impact on dna topology for example the thermodynamic_properties of base stacking_interactions have been extensively measured and are commonly used in computational_methods for dna secondary_structure this was illustrated in work discussing the effect of dna flexure on the binding_site affinity compensating mutations between neighboring dna bases have been long known consideration of the codependencies between dna bases in a tfbs have been proved to be efficient in modeling binding site_specificity also suggesting the possibility of coevolution between the dna bases we have shown in previous work using mutual_information analysis that there are dependencies between neighboring and distant positions of the tfbss many of the distant interactions reflect the palindromic nature of tfbss the issues of effective msas for dna_binding become particularly important for supervised tfbs_prediction supervised tfbs prediction_algorithms take as input a set of known tfbs sequences known as a training_set and use these to build an expected model of the tfbs that can be used to identify further sequences these can be contrasted with de_novo binding_site prediction_methods that analyze upstream regions to whom correspondence should be addressed of genes to find overrepresented motifs and which are not the subject of this article we previously demonstrated that the use of a nonoptimal alignment for training can seriously disrupt tfbs_prediction efficacy even as compared with using a block alignment moreover effective supervised tfbs_prediction relies on a suitably large training_set of known binding_sites and so predictions can only be made for global regulators most transcription_factors only regulate a small number of genes and supervised prediction of those non global regulators has been particularly hard one solution would be to use binding_sites from paralogous or orthologous transcription_factors as interdependence patterns are similar across related transcription_factors to do so it becomes necessary to produce msas for those binding_sites that capture tfbs specificity in this article we aim to include the interdependencies in the msa to provide a better representation for the dna_binding site_specificity we introduce a dinucleotide representation method of the tfbs sequence that captures the interdependencies we then introduce two alignment cost metrics methodologies the first is using a statistical_approach similar to the one used to calculate blosum the second makes use of base_stacking thermodynamics we specifically used a boltzmann_distribution centered on the change in base_stacking free_energy as the null_hypothesis for dinucleotide substitutions to validate our work we compare both methods against each other against other commonly used alignment_methods clustalw dialign and against our previously_published method using block alignments there is a good range of benchmark alignments to test protein msa methods including balibase oxbench sabmark and smart for dna coding_regions have developed a dna reference benchmark based on the tertiary_structure of encoded_protein however no such benchmark alignments are available for non coding dna_sequences a score is often used to detect the accuracy of the msa using the homology in the resulting alignment the approach we take is to test the alignments for their capacity to act as a training_set for a supervised first order hidden_markov hmm to predict known tfbss we have developed a new methodology for msas of non coding dna_sequences that uses an alignment of dinucleotides two variants have been described using two different null_hypotheses one statistically driven and the other thermodynamically driven these have been compared with other alignment programs exemplified by clustalw and dialign which are designed with a null_hypothesis derived from the evolution of peptide_sequences they have been evaluated by assessing tfbs_prediction for global regulators from e coli k the roc_curves for the first order supervised hmm prediction using the dinucleotide alignment demonstrated better alignment than the current alignment tools irrespective of the null_hypothesis used between the two variants the use of thermodynamic driven null_hypothesis proved to be statistically better the boltzmann_distribution derived provides a base_stacking interaction dinucleotide distribution for each tfbs set studied an independent thermodynamic joint_distribution of dinucleotides represents the random_distribution of dinucleotide thermodynamic alignment the log odd scoring system in this case would provide a negative or score if the observed dinucleotides alignment joint probability is less than or equal to the random joint probability and positive otherwise accordingly scoring the observed joint_distribution versus this null_hypothesis distribution would indicate the odds of randomly aligning any dinucleotide pair under thermodynamic hypothesis the higher these odds are the less favored they are in the alignment this would indicate that the resulting alignment from edna would favor to align dinucleotides that are more thermodynamically dependent than independent
