genome_analysis genome_editing assessment using crispr genome_analyzer crispr ga clustered_regularly crispr based_technologies have revolutionized human genome_engineering and opened countless possibilities to basic_science synthetic_biology and gene_therapy albeit the enormous_potential of these tools their performance is far from perfect it is essential to perform a posterior careful analysis of the gene_editing experiment however there are no computational_tools for genome_editing assessment yet and current experimental_tools lack sensitivity and flexibility we present a platform to assess the quality of a genome_editing experiment only with three mouse clicks the method evaluates next generation data to quantify and characterize insertions deletions and homologous_recombination crispr genome_analyzer provides a report for the locus selected which includes a quantification of the edited site and the analysis of the different alterations detected the platform maps the reads estimates and locates insertions_and computes the allele replacement efficiency and provides a report integrating all the information availability_and crispr ga web is available at http crispr ga net documentation on crispr ga instructions can be found atthe journal science selected crispr clustered_regularly as one of the top breakthroughs of crispr based_technologies have revolutionized human genome_engineering and opened unlimited possibilities to basic_science synthetic_biology and gene_therapy its design simplicity and efficiency makes it an extremely versatile_tool most of the genome_engineering methods are based on the combined effort of a nuclease and an exogenous dna which encodes the desired edits the nuclease specifically cleaves the genome in a region close to the targeting site and the cellular_machinery repairs the genome using the exogenous dna as template crispr gene_editing is based on cas this protein can be programmed easily to cleave specific dna_sequences and target a la carte the desired genome region although these technologies have been widely implemented in many fields and organisms human cynomolgus_monkeys mouse rat zebrafish drosophila yeast caenorhabditis_elegans arabidopsis bacteria and others we do not have any computational_tools to analyze the outcome of these experiments yet several tools have proliferated for off target prediction http bioanalysis otago ac nz crisprtarget and experiment_design http www e crisp org http zifit partners org zifit http www crispr_cas org http wormcas hr weebly com but none of them supports experimental analysis we present crispr genome_analyzer crispr ga a platform to assess the quality of a genome_editing experiment only with three mouse clicks it can be used in any genomic locus of any organism that the sequence is available the method uses next generation data to quantify and characterize insertions deletions and homologous_recombination hr at the intended targeting sites current methods to assess genome_engineering are based on enzymatic mutation detection techniques or reporter_assays both methods suffer from important_limitations in optimal conditions an enzymatic_method such as surveyors assay it reaches a detection_limit of but often editing efficiencies are well below this value another enzymatic_method the t endonuclease i t e may achieve detection_limits around both methods have biases on the detection_limit surveyors assay is more sensitive to transition and transversion mutations whereas t e to indels reporter_assays are more sensitive as they detect single cells but they require additional steps to generate exogenous dna reporter_constructs more importantly reporters incorporate other by products i e fluorescent_proteins which may not be desired for certain applications in addition both methods deliver a binary output and none provides with a complete description of the genome_editing experiment crispr ga requires little experimental labor and it provides a complete report of the genome_editing results with a fast turnover the user is only required to use polymerase_chain pcr to amplify the area of the genome to analyze the specific instructions to carry out this pcr can be found in supplementary this amplified library is sequenced with an illumina_miseq machine other platforms may also be used see online documentation the user provides to the pipeline crispr ga the next_generation obtained reads the intended editing sequence and the original sequence to whom correspondence should be addressed crispr ga will estimate the hr normally associated with intended edits non_homologous nhej normally associated with non desired edits and a complete report of the location and characteristics of the indels next_generation is becoming available for most research institutions the possibility of bar coding hundreds of samples in a single illumina_miseq lane makes it competitive from a time and economic perspective hundred samples can be analyzed for a bit more than with cost of per sample in one overnight illumina_miseq run
