data_and peaklink a new peptide peak linking method in lc_ms using wavelet and svm motivation in liquid chromatographymass spectrometry tandem_mass lc_ms it is necessary to link tandem_ms identified peptide peaks so that protein expression changes between the two runs can be tracked however only a small number of pep tides can be identified and linked by tandem_ms in two runs and it becomes necessary to link peptide peaks with tandem identification in one run to their corresponding ones in another run without identification in the past peptide peaks are linked based on similarities in retention time rt mass or peak shape after rt alignment which corrects mean rt shifts between runs however the accuracy in linking is still limited especially for complex samples collected from different conditions consequently large_scale proteomics_studies that require comparison of protein expression_profiles of hundreds of patients can not be carried_out effectively method in this article we consider the problem of linking peptides from a pair of lc_ms runs and propose a new method peaklink pl which uses information in both the time and frequency_domain as inputs to a non linear support_vector svm classifier the pl algorithm first uses a threshold on an rt likelihood_ratio score to remove candidate corresponding peaks with excessively large elution time shifts then pl calculates the correlation between a pair of candidate peaks after reducing noise through wavelet transformation after converting rt and peak shape correlation to statistical scores an svm classifier is trained and applied for differentiating corresponding and non corresponding peptide peaks results pl is tested in multiple challenging cases in which lc_ms samples are collected from different disease_states different instruments and different laboratories testing results show significant_improvement in linking accuracy compared with other algorithms availability_and m files for the pl alignment_method are available atliquid chromatographymass spectrometry tandem_mass lc_ms is a well known tool for analyzing complex protein samples both quantitatively and qualitatively an lc_ms experiment begins with the enzymatic_digestion of proteins into peptides which are then injected to and separated in an elution column in the lc step the retention time rt it takes for a peptide to pass through the lc column is determined by the physiochemical_properties of the peptide subsequently peptides are ionized and separated by their mass over charge m z ratios at a given charge_state a peptide registers its c monoisotopic d peak at rt m z which is considered as the representing feature of the peptide in addition peptide peak shape can also be treated as a feature note that in this article properties of peptide peaks are defined as features after the lc_ms step tandem_ms may perform further fragmentation of some peptides that it picks up the resulted spectrum can be submitted to search_engines such as mascot sequest or x tandem for peptide_identification compared with older peptide_identification technologies such as the accurate_mass and time tag approach tandem_ms search provides more confident peptide_sequence and rt information based on which peptide lc_ms peaks can be located for confident quantification however only a small portion of peptide precursors are sampled in tandem_ms and only a small number of commonly identified proteins peptides can be compared across multiple lc_ms runs this creates the need to link peptide peaks in runs with identification to their corresponding peaks in runs without tandem_ms identification in this article feature linking or peak linking are used interchangeably to describe the process of linking peptide peaks based on peak features there are many algorithms such as msinspect mzmine multialign superhirn chromalign openms sima and most recently smfm smfm g that consider the problem of linking corresponding peptide peaks in lc_ms runs most of these algorithms are warping based correspondence algorithm wca in which the elution time shifts between two lc_ms runs are corrected by finding a warping alignment function and peaks are linked based on their closeness in rt m z however few of these algorithms use ms_ms information for generating warping functions directly which could provide good performance with little computing resource for example polynomial p is a simple wca that uses commonly identified peptides as anchors whose elution times in two lc_ms runs are fitted to generate a simple p warping function p has not been published as an algorithm separately it has been described in which shows that p performs similarly to smfm smfm g and mzmine and significantly superior to msinspect and multialign in four testing cases in our own testing p is shown to have a performance that fluctuates around the reported accuracy of smfm smfmg in rounds of testing this validates the results reported in and confirms that p is an easily implementable algorithm with comparable_performance to the best of wcas in the literature besides wcas a unique statistical corresponding feature identification algorithm scfia is proposed in scfia differs from wca algorithms in two aspects firstly after correcting the mean elution time shifts using a warping function scfia uses peak shape correlation between candidate corresponding peaks as an additional feature for matching secondly it treats peak shape correlation and elution time shifts between candidate corresponding peaks as random_variables and statistical_models are used for making maximum_likelihood decisions the statistical_models are trained based on common tandem_ms identified peptides between two lc_ms runs we categorize scfia as a wca with matching although wcas can perform well for technical_replicates and lc_ms data collected from simple organisms their performance deteriorates significantly when samples are collected on complex organisms or from different laboratories as shown in our own tests and in the linking accuracy could be as low as this seriously limits the capability of comparing protein expression_profiles across multiple samples required in biological and clinical_applications although scfia improves the performance significantly over p which is called gwarping in and consequently other wcas there is still significant room for improvement beyond scfia scfia calculates peak shape correlation directly based on peak shapes which are affected by both signal and noise to address_this we propose to use wavelet_decomposition to reduce noise and calculate correlation scores after de_noising also scfia assumes that rt shifts and peak shape correlations are independent statistically which is not a verified assumption to address_these we propose to treat peak shape correlations and rt shifts as correlated features and use the support_vector svm to perform classification our proposed algorithm is called peaklink pl pl first uses a non linear warping function generated based on tandem_ms information to correct mean rt shifts between lcms ms runs then it uses a threshold on an rt shift likelihood_ratio score to eliminate candidate peak pairs with big time shifts in the next step wavelet_transform is applied to remaining candidate corresponding peaks and the correlation between lowfrequency coefficients of wavelet transformation is calculated pl processing could terminate at this point by choosing the candidate pair with the highest correlation alternatively pl continues the processing by converting rt shifts and peak shape correlations to probability scores and setting these scores as inputs to an svm classifier so that corresponding features can be identified with high_accuracy our requirement on tandem_ms identification is not a limitation because tandem_ms is widely available even without it as long as reliable peptide_identification is available pl can be applied to evaluate the performance of pl two groups of publicly_available datasets are selected group contains super silac datasets collected from breast_cancer and normal_tissues group contains two label_free datasets of yeast proteins from two different laboratories in group the data were collected from different tissues with large rt shift variations if p is used the alignment_accuracy is only on average in contrast scfia and pl can align the dataset with and accuracy on average respectively in group pl achieves accuracy on average whereas p and smfm smfm g are reported to have and accuracy respectively in these results show that pl consistently improves peak linking accuracy in the most challenging cases and could have wide_applications in biological and clinical research based on lc_ms note that we consider the problem of peak linking between two lc_ms runs in this article although it is possible to extend the algorithm to multiple runs special_considerations are needed for selecting reference runs as pointed_out in in this article we propose a new method pl for linking corresponding features across two lc_ms maps the novel aspects of the algorithm include using wavelet_transform to reduce noise and using an svm classifier for linking corresponding features compared with other methods in the literature pl offers the highest_accuracy in various challenging test cases including complex samples from different tissues different instruments and different laboratories our results are shown to be reproducible across many runs using different training and testing sizes with the achieved good performance the proposed method could have wide_applications in biological and clinical studies when protein expression changes across different conditions need examination
