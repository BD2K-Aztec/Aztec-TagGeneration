a method for integrating and ranking the evidence for biochemical_pathways by mining reactions from text motivation to create verify and maintain pathway_models curators must discover and assess knowledge distributed over the vast body of biological_literature methods supporting these tasks must understand both the pathway model representations and the natural_language in the literature these methods should identify and order documents by relevance to any given pathway reaction no existing system has addressed all aspects of this challenge method we present novel methods for associating pathway model reactions with relevant publications our approach extracts the reactions directly from the models and then turns them into queries for three text_mining based medline literature_search systems these queries are executed and the resulting documents are combined and ranked according to their relevance to the reactions of interest we manually annotate document reaction pairs with the relevance of the document to the reaction and use this annotation to study several ranking_methods using various heuristic and machine_learning results our evaluation shows that the annotated document reaction pairs can be used to create a rule_based document ranking system and that machine_learning can be used to rank documents by their relevance to pathway reactions we find that a support_vector based system outperforms several baselines and matches the performance of the rule_based system the success of the query extraction and ranking_methods are used to update our existing pathway search system pathtext availability an online demonstration of pathtext and the annotated corpus are available for research_purposes atthe scale and speed with which biological_literature is published introduces multiple challenges for the creation verification maintenance and further development of formal comprehensive and up to date models of the physical entities and reactions involved in biological_systems efforts to understand a complex biological system in detail need to incorporate knowledge that may be distributed over a large number of scientific_publications from among the tens of millions available today to reduce the demands of discovering and integrating this knowledge several text_mining systems have been proposed which address many of the aspects of pathway curation however despite the obvious potential that automatic_analysis of the literature holds for assisting large_scale integration of biological_knowledge pathway curation efforts remain largely manual carried_out with limited or no support from advanced text_mining one way to try to remedy this situation is through the use of semantic search systems that make use of these methods however there are several technical_challenges to overcome such as interfacing with such systems and integrating information from various systems in a coherent way as well as the fact that few semantic search systems directly involve either the representations or the semantics physical entity and reaction definitions used in pathway model curation efforts to address_these and support pathway curation we have developed pathtext an integrated search system designed to link biological_pathways with supporting knowledge in the vast body of literature given a pathway model and a reaction the system is able to find documents that are relevant to the given reaction from medline the literature_search in pathtext is implemented by translating each reaction into a set of queries that are then executed using several semantic search systems the results of the queries are then combined ranked and presented to the user in a unified user_interface with these pathway specific functions i e the reaction based retrieval of documents and ranking of unified documents by their relevance to pathway reactions pathtext aims to reduce the number of documents curators need to focus on thus increasing the productivity of pathway curation the documents retrieved by pathtext can help curators to maintain the textual evidence for reactions and to extend pathways by finding related reactions from the documents pathtext is designed to read formal pathway_models represented in the systems_biology sbml with celldesigner extensions sbml is a major standard format for pathway representation and interchange and its use assures compatibility with a large ecosystem of existing pathway curation tools and resources celldesigner extensions are essential for determining the correct participants in the reaction in our system sbml itself does not define a fixed set of semantic types for its primitives but instead defines an extension mechanism e g allowing such types to be defined pathtext is a comprehensive enhancement of a previously released system pathtext pathtext to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons

extends the core functionality of pathtext by combining the multiple results received for a single document from the various semantic search systems into a single result introducing a new document ranking heuristic based on the relevance of the document to the given reaction offering a new api allowing other systems to easily interface with the system and supporting a novel interface for human users to access the system furthermore we have updated the individual semantic search systems that are queried by pathtext and updated the generation of queries applicable to these systems this is done by implementing a query generation and expansion system based on reaction event mapping as we are trying to support improved automatic association between pathway_models and documents we have removed previous pathtext functionality for the manual_annotation and association of documents with pathways the improved query generation and ranking of the results should make this functionality obsolete thus reducing the burden on curators we evaluate pathtext in detail on two corpora annotated by domain_experts both containing judgments on the relevance of various documents to specific pathway model reactions the evaluation shows that use of pathtext substantially improves on pubmed_search for discovering relevant documents that the annotations can support the development of heuristics for document ranking and that the task of determining documentreaction relevance is feasible using machine_learning we initially evaluated the individual contribution of each semantic search system on the training data by measuring the average hit ratio of each system separately this evaluates the ranking performance of each semantic search system on fixed document sets i e system recall is not evaluated documents that were not retrieved by a semantic search system were assigned the lowest ranking the results show that the semantic search systems vary in their effectiveness with medie event best matching the gold_standard these results were used to define the ordering for the priority ranking heuristic section we note that although some systems show similar overall ranking performance detailed analysis indicates substantial differences in the document sets retrieved by the systems see_supplementary shows the ndcg score of each ranking system for the machine_learning we found that the svm method achieved the best results notably outperforming the average hit ratio heuristic and bm ranksvm slightly outperformed the average hit ratio method but svr did not the results for svr are to be expected as we treated relevance judgments as linearly increasing absolute scores which imposes considerable constraints on svr in contrast svm and ranksvm do not have these constraints the priority ranking heuristic shows competitive_performance on the test data outperforming two of the machine_learning and showing a notable performance improvement compared with the average hit ratio heuristic for machine_learning using the pairs curated in pathway_models an svm trained on the pairs pathway performed as well as ranksvm and the pairs slightly improved_performance when used for creating an additional feature for training with the data specifically annotated for ranking svm pathway these results demonstrate that existing pathway annotations can be beneficially combined with data annotated for the ranking task we note that the performance of the methods on the test data appears somewhat lower than the results obtained for thewe have presented pathtext an integrated search system designed to link biological_pathways with supporting knowledge in the vast body of literature this system allows direct access to the most relevant documents from the literature thus supporting various tasks in the creation verification maintenance and extension of pathway_models the system implements sbml parsing the conversion of reactions into system specific queries query result combination and ranking by relevance to the given pathway reaction using heuristic or machine learningbased methods and an api supporting programmatic_access to the search functionality a major focus of our efforts has been learning_curve on svm based ranking i the development of ranking functionality that combines the candidate document information retrieved by the various text_mining based search systems into a list ordered in a way where documents most likely to be relevant to the query reaction are presented first we created a corpus of judgments that identify on a four point scale the relevance of documents to reactions randomly_selected from a set of four panther db pathways and used it to evaluate simple ranking heuristics advanced heuristics informed by evaluation of the training_set and three machine_learning ranking_methods our results show that an svm based ranking with annotations in pathway_models can notably outperform the simple ranking heuristics achieving a ndcg score an online demonstration of the pathtext system is accessible and the annotated corpus is available for research_purposes from the project homepage http www
