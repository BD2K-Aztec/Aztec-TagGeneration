sequence_analysis sclpred protein subcellular_localization prediction by n to neural_networks knowledge of the subcellular_location of a protein provides valuable information about its function and possible interaction with other proteins in the post genomic era fast and accurate predictors of subcellular_location are required if this abundance of sequence_data is to be fully exploited we have developed a subcellular_localization predictor sclpred which predicts the location of a protein into four classes for animals and fungi and five classes for plants secreted cytoplasm nucleus mitochondrion and chloroplast using machine_learning trained on large non redundant sets of protein_sequences the algorithm powering sclpred is a novel neural_network n to neural_network or n nn we have developed which is capable of mapping whole sequences into single properties a functional class in this work without resorting to predefined transformations but rather by adaptively compressing the sequence into a hidden feature_vector we benchmark sclpred against other publicly_available predictors using two benchmarks including a new subset of swiss_prot release we show that sclpred surpasses the state of the art the n nn algorithm is fully general and may be applied to a host of problems of similar shape that is in which a whole sequence needs to be mapped into a fixed size array of properties and the adaptive compression it operates may shed light on the space of protein_sequences availability the predictive systems described in this article are publicly_available as a web_server atwith the recent_advances in high_throughput there has been a rapid increase in the availability of sequence_information to fully_exploit this information sequences need to be annotated quickly and accurately which has led to the development of automated annotation systems a major step toward determining the function of a protein is determining its subcellular_localization scl knowledge of the location of the protein sheds light not only on where it might function but also what other proteins it might interact with as in order to interact proteins must inhabit to whom correspondence should be addressed the same location or physically adjacent compartments at least temporarily there is a growing gap between the number of proteins that have reliable scl annotations and the number of known protein_sequences experimental_approaches to scl prediction are timeconsuming and expensive whereas computational_methods can provide fast and increasingly accurate localization predictions there are various different mechanisms by which a protein is directed to a particular location in the cell and there are many possible compartments in which eukaryotic_proteins may be located some nuclear_proteins have a nuclear_localization nls which may occur anywhere in the sequence most secreted mitochondrial and chloroplastic proteins have n_terminal cleavable peptides sp mtp and ctp but many proteins have no known motif and many are known not to have n_terminal peptides even in these cases the information contained in a protein_sequence may be sufficient to predict the proteins location in the cell given that residue and k residue frequencies correlate with locations there are many methods for the prediction of scl that can be roughly divided_into two groups homology or knowledgebased which rely on similarity to another sequence of known location or other known information about the sequence or similar sequences for example wolf psort or sherloc and de_novo or ab_initio sequencebased methods which may use evolutionary_information in the form of multiple_sequence msas but do not depend on similarity to sequences of known location for example bacello we predict scl for eukaryotes only which we divide into animals plants and fungi there are many potential classes of subcellular_localization and different prediction systems sometimes use different class subdivisions ranging from up to more than classes here similarly to bacello to which we directly compare our results we consider four subcellular_localizations for animals and fungi and five for plants nucleus cytoplasm mitochondrion chloroplast and secreted in a first series of tests we adopt essentially the same experimental_setting as in and to which we compare our predictor we then take a further step by developing new redundancy reduced training and testing sets starting with swiss_prot releasepage
