gene_expression deconrnaseq a statistical_framework for deconvolution of heterogeneous tissue_samples based on mrna_seq for heterogeneous tissues measurements of gene_expression through mrna_seq are confounded by relative proportions of cell_types involved in this note we introduce an efficient pipeline deconrnaseq an r package for deconvolution of heterogeneous tissues based on mrna_seq it adopts a globally optimized non negative decomposition algorithm through quadratic_programming for estimating the mixing proportions of distinctive tissue_types in next_generation data we demonstrated the feasibility and validity of deconrnaseq across a range of mixing levels and sources using mrna_seq mixed in silico at known concentrations we validated our computational_approach for various benchmark data with high correlation between our predicted cell proportions and the real fractions of tissues our study provides a rigorous quantitative and high_resolution tool as a prerequisite to use mrna_seq the modularity of package design allows an easy deployment of custom analytical pipelines for data from other high_throughput platforms availability deconrnaseq is written in r and is freely_available athigh throughput next_generation ngs_technologies are becoming quickly established in biomedical_research and discovery ngs based sequencing of mrna referred to as mrna seq offers several potential advantages over microarray based_methods heterogeneous tissues are frequently collected e g blood tumour etc from humans or model animals therefore mrna seq samples are often heterogeneous with regard to those cell_types making_it to distinguish gene_expression variability that reflects shifts in cell_populations from variability that reflects change of cell typespecific expression recently we have described the deconvolution of microarray_data from complex samples such as blood_samples in a clinical_trial described a probabilistic_framework to address the similar problem using high_throughput their approach_requires strong assumptions about the distributions of gene abundance and is not able to generate per sample estimates of tissue or cell abundance mrna_seq are inherently different than microarray_data which are able to give the more refined information necessary to tackle the deconvolution problem we therefore expected that these methods need to be updated and re validated however transferring the approach of microarray_data into a robust analysis_pipeline is an inherently study specific task and poses ongoing challenges although mrna seq is promising it is widely_accepted that many factors could introduce variation and bias to mrna_seq therefore proper pre_processing methods are needed to de noise and fine_tune the mrna_seq before they are used in downstream deconvolution in light of these considerations we have developed deconrnaseq an r bioconductor based pipeline for constituent fraction estimation and quality_assessment of deconvolution on mrna seq datasets here we describe the deconrnaseq package that encapsulates the method in a convenient to use format deconrnaseq is based on a linear_model of a sum of pure tissue or cell_type reads of all cell_types weighted by the respective cell_type proportions to estimate the proportions of known tissue_types in a sample deconrnaseq solves a non negative least_squares constraint problem with quadratic_programming to obtain the globally optimal_solution for estimated fractions results from mrna_seq described here demonstrate that our method is able to accurately_predict mixing fractions for multiple species of tissues or cells using the mixing samples containing relatively rare cell_types we show that correlation_coefficient between the estimate proportions and the true proportions can reach in principle deconrnaseq is also applicable to other types of profiling data from heterogeneous_samples for example the same approach could be used to track species in metagenomics_data or dna contamination in tumour_samples depicts the workflow of our transcriptome quantification and deconvolution pipeline given the information of the short_read followed by transcript quantification we apply a statistical_approach to model expression from a mixed cell_population as the weighted_average of expression from different cell_types we solve these equations using quadratic_programming which efficiently identifies the to whom correspondence should be addressed globally optimal_solution while preserving non negativity of the fraction of the cells consequently we can accurately estimate the fractions of various cell_populations the details are described as follows deconrnaseq requires input in the form of two r data frames that contain normalized transcriptional measurements from pure tissues s and the heterogeneous_samples x to be analysed respectively the gene was used as the expression unit in our example although the methodology can be extended to transcripts or exons provided the quantification of their expression is properly obtained more specifically the expression_level x jk of gene j in a sample k is the average of expected expression levels across the cell_types s ij weighted by the respective cell_type proportions a ki i n n the total number of cell_types to systematically examine the accuracy of our deconvolution algorithm we designed several inbe noted that we investigated the influence of extremely_low fractions of contaminating cell_types more experiments including the deconvolution of biologically related cell_population can be found in supplementary_material we estimated the number of expression signatures genes through the condition number of the signature matrix see supplementary sections and for its detailed derivation consequently we seleted first genes that consist of the signatures for the five tissues and deconvoluted the data refer to the supplementary section for the validation of the optimal number of expression signatures in terms of condition number the results are shown in bf with correlation_coefficient between the estimation and the real frations reassuringly our algorithm was able to accurately_predict the level of mixing across a wide_range of proportions including multiple pure sources for mrna_seq
