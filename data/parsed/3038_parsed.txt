modeling and comparing the organization of circular genomes motivation most prokaryotic_genomes are circular with a single chromosome called circular genomes which consist of bacteria and archaea orthologous_genes abbreviated as orthologs are genes directly evolved from an ancestor gene and can be traced through different species in evolution shared orthologs between bacterial_genomes have been used to measure their genome_evolution here organization of circular genomes is analyzed via distributions of shared orthologs between genomes however these distributions are often asymmetric and bimodal to date there is no joint_distribution to model such data this motivated us to develop a family of bivariate distributions with generalized von_mises marginals bgvm and its statistical_inference results a new measure based on circular grade correlation and the fraction of shared orthologs is proposed for association between circular genomes and a visualization_tool developed to depict genome_structure similarity the proposed procedures are applied to eight pairs of prokaryotes separated from domain down to species and mycoplasma bacteria that are mammalian pathogens belonging to the same genus we close with remarks on further applications to many features of genomic_organization e g shared transcription_factor between any pair of circular genomes thus the proposed procedures may be applied to identifying conserved chromosome backbones among others for genome construction in synthetic_biology availability all codes of the bgvm procedures and prokaryotic_genomes are available atmost of the prokaryotic_genomes out of ncbi august are circular with a single chromosome called circular genomes henceforth orthologous_genes abbreviated as orthologs are genes directly evolved from an ancestor gene and can be traced through different species in evolution the fraction of shared orthologs between two circular genomes was found to be better conserved than the order of genes in which the fraction of shared orthologs between genomes was employed to measure genome_evolution of nine prokaryotes here our emphasis is on the structure of circular genomes which for example plays an important role in synthetic_biology a review paper in synthetic genomics indicates that genome_organization may influence gene_expression which is vital for organisms further predicting or modeling the rules of genome_organization via comparative_genomics may provide_valuable for genome construction we reason that genome_structure can be studied via distributions of shared orthologs between genomes e g the most or least favored region in which shared orthologs between each pair of bacterial_genomes are located while the marginal distributions of shared orthologs are often found to be asymmetric and bimodal to date there is no joint_distribution with closed formed marginals to model such data this motivated us to develop a family of joint_distribution and its related statistical inferences recent_studies show that gene_order is extensively conserved between closely_related but rapidly become less conserved among more distantly_related this trend is likely to be universal in prokaryotes however the fraction of shared orthologs between two circular genomes is more conserved than the order of genes seeof in addition to the fraction of shared orthologs between bacterial_genomes we further incorporate the distributions of shared orthologs of paired circular genomes to infer similarity of their genome_organization by converting the locations of shared orthologs in any paired circular genomes into angles these pairs of angles can be viewed as bivariate circular vectors most of the marginal distributions of shared orthologs in circular genomes are asymmetric and or multimodal which can be modeled by the generalized von_mises distribution gvm therefore we propose a family of bivariate circular distributions with each marginal assuming a gvm distribution and call this family the bivariate generalized von_mises bgvm the inference procedures estimation of the parameters in bgvm and testing for independence of structures of paired circular genomes are developed a novel correlation measure which is based on the fraction of shared orthologs and a circular grade correlation derived here is introduced to measure organizationin this section we apply the proposed procedures to shared orthologs between paired prokaryotic_genomes to measure similarity of their genome_organization however we note that our procedures can be applied to many features of genomic_organization e g shared tfbss shared repeated elements and shared non coding_genes e g rrna and small_rna by inputting their corresponding angles instead of those of shared orthologs to our algorithm for instance both escherichia_coli and bacillus_subtilis have more verified tfbss than other bacteria and we can analyze their shared tfbss using procedures developed here
