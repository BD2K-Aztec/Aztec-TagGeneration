lncrna id long_non identification using balanced random_forests motivation long_non lncrnas which are non_coding of length above nucleotides play important_biological such as gene_expression regulation to fully reveal the functions of lncrnas a fundamental step is to annotate them in various species however as lncrnas tend to encode one or multiple open_reading it is not trivial to distinguish these long non coding transcripts from protein_coding in transcriptomic_data results in this work we design a new tool that calculates the coding potential of a transcript using a machine_learning model random_forest based on multiple features including sequence characteristics of putative_open translation scores based on ribosomal coverage and conservation against characterized protein_families the experimental_results show that our tool competes favorably with existing coding potential computation tools in lncrna identification it has been suggested that less than of the human_genome codes for proteins the majority of the transcriptome contains non coding rna ncrna genes which function directly as rnas instead of coding for proteins the most recently_discovered class of ncrnas is long_non lncrnas which are generally defined as non coding transcripts of length above nucleotides increasing evidence has shown that lncrnas play important and diverse_biological for example lncrnas anril and hotair bind to chromatin_remodelling complexes prc and prc to alter chromatin and transcription gas lncrna acts as a decoy for the gr transcription_factor and prevents gr from binding to dna and transcriptional_activation malat rna binds to sr proteins to regulate mrna alternative_splicing whereas bace as rna binds to the complementary bace mrna to regulate bace translation as a result the dysfunctions of lncrnas are associated with a wide_range of diseases ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer lncrnas exist in many species such as arabidopsis zea_mays honey_bee chicken and zebrafish in recent_years a large number of lncrnas have been identified gencode comprises manually_annotated lncrna genes in the human_genome the lncrnadisease database contains human lncrnas that are likely to be associated with diseases thus given the functional_importance and ubiquity of lncrnas it is important to annotate them on a genome_scale in various species with the advances of the next_generation the transcriptomes of a large number of organisms have been sequenced providing us a unique_opportunity to mine lncrnas the assembled transcripts contain different types of functional_elements such as small ncrnas lncrnas and protein_coding lncrnas can be effectively distinguished from most small ncrnas such as v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com mirnas and snornas using size as the main criterion however lncrnas share similarities with protein_coding transcripts in terms of transcript length and splicing structure in addition lncrnas tend to encode putative_open orfs for instance h xist mirg gtl and kcnqot all have putative orfs greater than amino_acids but have been characterized as functional ncrnas thus a major_challenge for lncrna identification is to distinguish lncrnas from proteincoding_genes especially in non model_organisms lacking comprehensive protein_coding gene_annotation many efforts have been made to distinguish between lncrna and protein_coding transcripts ranging from applying a threshold for a single_feature to more complicated supervised_machine one commonly used feature is the length of the orf for example a simple approach is to classify a transcript containing an orf of length above amino_acids as a protein_coding this criterion is arbitrary and is not always correct using this simple criterion the mouse xist_rna gene which encodes a putative orf of amino_acids aa was mis classified as a protein_coding when it was first discovered a probability model constructed from multiple_criteria has also been used to identify protein coding_and such as the one used in the phylogenetic codon substitution frequencies phylocsf phylocsf is based on nucleotide_substitutions of multispecies sequences it uses multiple_sequence to calculate the phylogenetic conservation score as an alignment based method it usually requires high_quality alignments which are not trivial to produce and can incur high_computational more accurate approaches for identifying lncrnas use supervised_machine these approaches can be further divided_into two types one relies on sequence_alignments and the other is alignment_free representative examples of alignment_based include coding potential calculator cpc cpc aligns transcripts against known protein databases as homologous protein_coding tend to share higher sequence_conservation than lncrnas the alignment score or its statistical_significance provides useful information to differentiate these two types of transcripts an alternative and faster approach is alignment_free such as cpat and plek cpat integrates linguistic features of transcript sequences into a logistic regression_model for lncrna prediction plek integrates k_mer based features into a support_vector to distinguish lncrnas from mrnas in addition cpat and plek allow users to create a model with their own data this option which is not present in cpc and phylocsf is very useful for lncrna identification in different species despite the promising progress for lncrna identification there is still a need for better approaches and tools in particular existing machine_learning tools do not carefully handle the imbalanced training data in which one class has far more instances than the other the issue of imbalanced training data is particularly pronounced for lncrna identification when it is formulated as a binary classification_problem in existing_tools for example due to poor annotation of lncrnas many species have far less characterized lncrnas than protein_coding as a result a classifier tends to over predict query transcripts as the protein_coding transcript major class in addition many existing_tools need users to provide a score threshold for lncrna identification which is not always obvious from users perspective for example phylocsf and cpat do not suggest the specific type of an input transcript but only output a coding potential score the predefined score cutoffs of phylocsf and cpat vary from species to species phylocsfs score cutoffs of and were used for mouse and zebrafish respectively cpat suggests the score cutoffs of and for human and mouse respectively these specific score cutoffs cannot be immediately applied to other species even worse not every tool can be trained on different species to provide users with necessary information to choose an appropriate score cutoff in this article we present lncrna id an lncrna identification tool which applies random_forest rf classification to distinguish lncrnas from protein_coding rf is a classification model aggregating multiple classification trees generated from boot strap samples and has been successfully_applied in bioinformatics lncrna id has several advantages over existing_tools first it still takes_advantage of alignment based features which have strong discriminative_power however instead of using genome_scale multiple_sequence or pairwise_alignments against all existing protein_sequences lncrna id uses profile hidden_markov profile hmm_based alignments rendering more sensitive homology_search and shorter running time than existing alignment based lncrna identification tools second lncrnaid is easy to use as it does not require users to provide a score cutoff it automatically determines the type of a query transcript as well as provides a coding potential score third lncrna id can be applied to various species by providing an option to train the classifier for different data fourth lncrna id does not require a large number of training data of neither protein_coding transcripts nor lncrnas to construct a classifier and can handle imbalanced classes in the training data in our experiments we evaluated the performance of lncrna id on two different species human and mouse in addition we benchmarked lncrna id with cpc cpat phylocsf and plek on both species the experimental_results show that lncrna id has both good sensitivity_and lncrna id can be applied to different species we evaluated the performance of lncrna id on both human and mouse specifically we used four datasets the first human dataset h and the mouse dataset m were generated from gencode consortium within the framework of the encode_project gencode is known to have the most comprehensive annotation of long_non available to date the second human dataset h is cpats original dataset generated from multiple resources refseq a human lncrna catalog and gencode we further conducted four additional experiments simulating training data with different imbalanced ratios to demonstrate that lncrna id was able to maintain robust performance with imbalanced training data finally we tested lncrna id on a small but experimentally_verified lncrna dataset from mouse m to quantify the classification_performance we used five standard metrics sensitivity specificity accuracy false_positive fpr positive_predictive ppv and f score which are defined as follows sensitivity tp tp fn specificity tn tn fp accuracy tp tn p n fpr fp fp tn ppv tp tp fp f score sensitivity ppv sensitivity ppv lncrnas are regraded as the positive class and protein_coding transcripts are regarded as the negative class tp is the number of correctly_classified lncrnas and tn is the number of correctly_classified protein_coding transcripts sensitivity is the proportion of correctly_classified lncrnas in the set of all lncrnas specificity is the proportion of correctly_classified protein_coding transcripts in the set of all protein_coding transcripts accuracy is the ratio of correctly_classified transcripts in all predictions false_positive fpr refers to the portion of falsely classified lnrnas among all protein_coding transcripts ppv is a ratio of true_positives to combined true and false_positives f score is the harmonic mean of sensitivity and ppv and hence can be used as a single measure for the overall classification_performance in this work we have proposed and implemented lncrna id an accurate lncrna identification tool using balanced random_forest classification lncrna id ensembles multiple random_forest classifiers induced from balanced down sampled data and thus is able to maintain robust performance with imbalanced and limited learning data the experimental_results in both human and mouse genomes demonstrate that the features used by lncrna id have strong discriminative_power in distinguishing lncrnas from protein_coding transcripts in addition we conducted experiments using lr which combines our feature_set with the logistic regression_model in cpat and compared its performance with lncrna id the experimental_results showed the utility of balanced random_forest for highly imbalanced training data according to our empirical experimental_results the ribosome interaction features are the most discriminative features the reason might be that ribosome is closely_related to the protein_translation mechanism which is the major difference between coding and noncoding transcripts in our experiments we focused on the ribosome interaction in eukaryotes where annotated lncrnas are more publicly_available in eukaryotes a small s ribosomal subunit contains s rrna whereas in prokaryotes a small s ribosomal subunit contains s rrna further study is needed to investigate whether the similar ribosome signal could be captured with s rrna as with s rrna among all classification tools phylocsf had the worst performance a closer look at this result shows that in the human dataset phylocsf could not determine the coding status of a decent amount of lncrnas and some coding transcripts this is because they are either non conserved transcripts or do not have sufficient long orfs if both ribosome_profiling data ribo seq and mrna_seq are available a more accurate ribosome release signal could be measured using the number of mapped_reads on orf and utr the rrs is then defined as the ratio of the two normalized ratios of mapped_reads on these two regions rrs r orf r utr riboseq r orf r utr mrnaseq where r is the number of mapped_reads on a sequence plek has comparable_performance to lncrna id on human but did not perform well on mouse data plek was run on the prebuilt model which was trained on a very large number of coding transcripts and lncrnas thus it is possible that their training data contains some of our testing data and leads to very good performance on human if plek can be re trained using our training data we can conduct a more thorough comparison
