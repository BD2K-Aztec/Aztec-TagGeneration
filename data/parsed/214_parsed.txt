a likelihood_ratio based method to predict exact pedigrees for complex families from next_generation next_generation ngs_technology considerably changed the way we screen for pathogenic_mutations in rare mendelian_disorders however the identification of the disease_causing amongst thousands of variants of partly unknown relevance is still challenging and efficient techniques that reduce the genomic search_space play a decisive role often segregation or linkage_analysis are used to prioritize candidates however these approaches require correct information about the degree of relationship among the sequenced samples for quality_assurance an automated control of pedigree structures and sample assignment is therefore highly_desirable in order to detect label mix_ups that might otherwise corrupt downstream_analysis results we developed an algorithm based on likelihood_ratios that discriminates between different classes of relationship for an arbitrary number of genotyped samples by identifying the most likely class we are able to reconstruct entire pedigrees iteratively even for highly consanguineous_families we tested our approach on exome data of different sequencing studies and achieved high_precision for all pedigree predictions by analyzing the precision for varying_degrees of relatedness or inbreeding we could show that a prediction is robust down to magnitudes of a few hundred loci in recent_years high_throughput sequencing_approaches have been successfully_applied to identify thousands of novel pathogenic_mutations in genetic_disorders however due to the high variability of the human_genome there are several hundred variants of unclear significance in each individual and the analysis of such to whom correspondence should be addressed high_dimensional is still challenging in order to reduce_the related individuals are usually sequenced for filtering purposes or linkage_analysis when studying unknown disorders even in routine diagnostics sequencing of additional family_members is common practice whenever the disorder is highly_heterogeneous and de_novo mutations are the most promising candidates however these approaches rely on correct pedigree_information and thus there is a great need for robust and easily_manageable methods for checking the relationship between samples so_far it is common practice to infer relatedness with different kinds of genetic_markers and a comprehensive_overview of the existing_methods is given by most of the approaches that are based on likelihood_ratios lr test different pre defined relationship models and have already been thoroughly discussed by others in our work we study the effectiveness of pedigree predictions when also rare markers are used that become only accessible by direct_sequencing in general the accuracy of the prediction increases with the information content of the available markers microsatellites are very variable in length and are thus highly informative with to unlinked microsatellites it is usually possible to achieve accurate_predictions about the relationship between samples in contrast snvs are mostly biallelic and in exomes their mean heterozygosity is only around on the other hand large_numbers of snvs are detected in high_throughput sequencing_projects and we will study in this work how the accuracy of pedigree predictions scales with the number of such markers all models that have been developed for the prediction of relationships also have to account for genotyping_errors microsatellites are more difficult to genotype than snvs additionally the intrinsically higher rates of mutations can introduce biases in analyses that rely on identity by state ibs due to these technical_challenges the evaluation of microsatellite data requires a high human expertise to avoid false parentage exclusions as discussed in dakin and avisein this work we analyzed the performance of reconstructing family structures with genotype data that become available in ngs sequencing studies including rare_variants we were able to derive pedigrees with high_precision for publicly_available samples of families as well as for in house data even for as little as a few hundred markers our method is based on comparisons between likelihood_ratios for different kinship classes and as expected the closer the coefficients of relationship were between two models the more difficult it became to differentiate between them the most challenging discrimination is between unrelated_individuals in a highly inbred population and samples that are related by second order relationship so_far highly_polymorphic marker loci such as microsatellites have been used in paternity testing and to detect distant relationships however ancestry can also effectively be identified with the use of rare and family specific single_nucleotide we observed the biggest variance in likelihood_ratios for all dyads for the comparison of the hypothesis h h parent_child unrelated one drawback of our approach is that different quality levels of the data are not considered we simulated technical_replicates with a high_error by decreasing the coverage per base in the alignments and studied the influence on the classification process some replicates with a large difference in coverage and quality were misclassified as full siblings instead of technical_replicates as visualized in violet dots for lr h h with decreasing coverage the error_rates especially for heterozygous calls increase however the site_specific error probabilities that are reported by standard genotype callers are usually vastly underestimated for rare_variants allegedly small error_rates pose a problem especially in the identification of replicates another approach to estimate genotyping_errors on exome variant lists that also considers allele_frequencies from population studies reported a mean genotyping error_rate of e as more accurate for most current exomes this error_rate also yielded the best performance in our tests and is therefore suggested as a default setting the consequences of an unsuitable choice of this parameter on the likelihood_ratios is discussed in more detail in the supporting_information in summary we have shown that genotype data from ngs studies can also be used to deduce pedigree_information with high_precision our approach doesnt require any additional generation of data and will thus be easy to integrate into existing analysis_pipelines this will help to identify sample mix_ups at an early_stage and improve the overall quality in the diagnostic_procedure
