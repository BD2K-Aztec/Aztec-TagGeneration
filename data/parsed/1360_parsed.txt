detection of allele specific methylation through a generalized heterogeneous epigenome model motivations high_throughput has made it possible to sequence dna_methylation of a whole_genome at the single_base a sample however may contain a number of distinct methylation patterns for instance cells of different types and in different developmental_stages may have different methyl ation patterns alleles may be differentially_methylated which may partially explain that the large portions of epigenomes from single cell_types are partially methylated and may have major effects on transcriptional output approaches relying on dna sequence_polymorphism to identify individual patterns from a mixture of heterogeneous epigenomes are insufficient as methylcytosines occur at a much higher_density than snps results we have developed a mixture_model based_approach for resolving distinct epigenomes from a heterogeneous_sample in particular the model is applied to the detection of allele specific methylation asm the methods are tested on a synthetic methylome and applied to an arabidopsisthe advancement of high_throughput has opened up many important areas of applications one of which is epigenome sequencing dna_methylation may repress or activate_transcription and is known to be involved in embryogenesis genomic_imprinting and tumorigenesis in mammals and transposon silencing in plants to understand the regulation and dynamics of dna_methylation the locations of the modified cytosines need to be identified the first single_base mappings of dna_methylation were produced for the whole arabidopsis_thaliana genome and for selected subsets of sites in the mouse_genome using various bisulfite sequencing_technologies dna_methylation is the modification of dna_base cytosine methylcytosine a map of dna_methylation at single_base is referred to as methylome or epigenome cells of different types and in different developmental_stages may have different methylation patterns it has been observed that large portions of the arabidopsis methylomes are partially methylated this may be as a result of the to whom correspondence should be addressed sample containing a number of distinct methylomes aberrant_methylation is also a general_feature of cancer_genomes a better understanding of methylation patterns in cancer_genomes may lead to both new diagnostic_markers and therapies based on the detection of methylation changes occurring early in tumorigenesis in a tumor_tissue particularly of an early_stage however cancerous_cells and normal cells are often mixed together dna_methylation can also act as markers for tracing stem_cell expansion and tumor_growth making use of methylation patterns in this way requires determining methylation patterns associated with individual cells or cells from the same clone when comparing human fibroblast cell imr and h embryonic_stem esc lines it is observed that imr has a lower level of methylation than h esc both imr and h are of a single cell_type while it is expected that large portions of the x chromosome are partially methylated as the imr cell_line is from a female and the dna_methylation is known to play_an in x_chromosome it is unexpectedly observed that around of imr autosomes are identified as partially methylated domains pmd what is the nature of partial methylations in a single cell_type might allelic differences contribute to the partial methylations answering these questions requires detecting allele specific methylation asm patterns the methylcytosine is sometimes referred to as the fifth dna_base applying methods for detection of single_nucleotide snp to methylation however may present difficulties methylcytosine is much more dynamic than nucleotides and observations generally suggest that methylation of a cytosine site is a statistical event unlike snps where a nucleotide occurs at a rate of or in a diploid individual if sequencing_errors may be ignored the methylation_level at a particular site may fall anywhere in the range from to whether a methylcytosine is allele specific therefore cannot be determined by the site alone it needs supporting evidence from the neighboring nucleotides if a partially methylated cytosine is in the close_vicinity of a snp such that reads are long enough to cover both sites then it is straightforward to determine from which allele the reads are originated thus determining the methylation_level of the respective alleles some studies have shown that asm is associated with snps the density of methylation across the whole_genome however is much higher than that of dna sequence_polymorphism for instance while there are close to million snps discovered in the human_genome million and million methylcytosines were detected in h and imr cells it has also been observed that changes in cytosine_methylation occur at a frequency much greater than that of the dna_sequence mutations as a result snps are absent in large portions of the methylomes we will describe a method in this article that detects asm without the assistance of snps in addition even though the functionalities of asm are not well understood except that they play_an in imprinting it seems that the methylation_level of an individual cytosine is less important than the overall levels of methylations within a region which is also in contrast to the snps we therefore focus our effort in detecting regions of asm the remainder of the article is organized as follows a mixture_model is described in section for modeling the outcome of a methylation sequencing_experiment where the sample may contain a mixture of heterogeneous epigenomes it aims at predicting methylation_levels for each cytosine in each individual epigenome section lays out the details for detecting regions of asm based on the mixture_model and validates the methods on a synthetic methylome the methods are then applied to an arabidopsis root cell methylome and the results are listed in section section discusses the results and offers some future_directions
