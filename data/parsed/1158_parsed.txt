control free calling of copy_number in deep sequencing_data using gc_content normalization we present a tool for control free copy_number cna detection using deep sequencing_data particularly useful for cancer studies the tool deals with two frequent problems in the analysis of cancer deep sequencing_data absence of control sample and possible polyploidy of cancer_cells freec control free copy_number caller automatically normalizes and segments copy_number profiles cnps and calls cnas if ploidy is known freec assigns absolute_copy to each predicted cna to normalize raw cnps the user can provide a control dataset if available otherwise gc_content is used we demonstrate that for illumina single_end mate_pair or paired_end gc contentr normalization provides smooth profiles that can be further segmented and analyzed in order to predict cnas availability source_code and sample data are available atin many studies that apply deep_sequencing to cancer_genomes one has to calculate copy_number profiles cnps and predict regions of gain and loss there exist two frequent obstacles in the analysis of cancer_genomes absence of an appropriate control sample for normal_tissue and possible polyploidy most current_tools do not take these points into account supplementary for various reasons sequencing of an appropriate control sample is not always possible there is therefore a need for a bioinformatics tool able to automatically detect copy_number cnas without use of a control dataset several programs have been published that allow automatic calculation and analysis of cnps however both cnv seq and segseq need datasets for the given tumor and its paired_normal dna moreover both programs predict cnas without providing information about how many copies were lost or gained an interesting approach for predicting copy_number was suggested by where gc_content is used to normalize data however to estimate the normal copy_number to whom correspondence should be addressed they rely on the assumption that there are similar percentages of amplified and deleted regions which is not true in general for cancer_cells moreover their tool was designed to analyze normal human_genomes and is unable to take into account possible polyploidy here we propose an algorithm to call cnas with or without a control sample the algorithm is implemented in the c program freec control free copy_number caller freec uses a sliding_window approach to calculate read_count rc in non overlapping windows raw cnp then if a control sample is available the program normalizes raw cnp using the control profile otherwise the program calculates gc_content in the same set of windows and performs normalization by gc_content since this removes a major source of variability in raw cnps the resulting normalized profile becomes sufficiently smooth to apply segmentation this is followed by the analysis of predicted regions of gains_and in order to assign copy_numbers to these regions we applied the method to predict cnas in mate_pair datasets for the melanoma cell_line colo and matched normal cell_line colo bl a paired_end dataset for the smallcell lung_cancer cell_line nci h and a single_end dataset for the breast_cancer cell_line hcc all four samples were sequenced using the illumina_genome platform the number of reads in samples varied from to million supplementary the polynomial fit by gc_content explained well the observed rc d using cnps normalized by gc_content we identified regions of gain and loss in the four samples h supplementary we also assessed true_positive and false_positive for a normal_diploid sample na supplemenary we compared freec with three other existing_tools cnv seq segseq and rdxplorer supplementary tables and as well as providing other additional functionalities freec understands more input_formats than any other tool it can be used to analyze data produced for any organism and for polyploid genomes being implemented in c freec shows excellent_performance and operating system portability we have presented a tool for automatic_detection of cnas and calculation of cna frequency freec provides more functionalities than existing_tools in particular it can deal with the situation when no control experiment is available and when the genome is polyploid frequent problems in cancer studies the main steps are i normalization of the cnp using gc_content or control cnp if available ii segmentation of normalized profiles and iii assignment of copy_number changes to losses and gains the program is fast accurate and freely_available
