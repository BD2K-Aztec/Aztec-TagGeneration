sequence_analysis fdm a graph_based statistical_method to detect differential transcription using rna_seq motivation in eukaryotic_cells alternative_splicing expands the diversity of rna_transcripts and plays an important role in tissue_specific differentiation and can be misregulated in disease to understand these processes there is a great need for methods to detect differential transcription between samples our focus is on samples observed using short_read rna_sequencing rna_seq methods we characterize differential transcription between two samples as the difference in the relative_abundance of the transcript_isoforms present in the samples the magnitude of differential transcription of a gene between two samples can be measured by the square_root of the jensen shannon divergence jsd between the genes transcript_abundance vectors in each sample we define a weighted splice graph_representation of rna_seq summarizing in compact form the alignment of rna_seq to a reference_genome the flow difference metric fdm identifies regions of differential rna transcript_expression between pairs of splice_graphs without need for an underlying gene model or catalog of transcripts we present a novel non parametric statistical_test between splice_graphs to assess the significance of differential transcription and extend it to group wise comparison incorporating sample replicates results using simulated rna_seq consisting of four technical_replicates of two samples with varying transcription between genes we show that i the fdm is highly_correlated with jsd r when average rna_seq coverage of the transcripts is sufficiently deep and ii the fdm is able to identify of genes with differential transcription when jsd and coverage this represents higher sensitivity than cufflinks without annotations and rdiff mmd which respectively identified and of the genes in this region as differential transcribed using annotations identifying the transcripts cufflinks was able to identify of the genes in this region as differentially transcribed using experimental_data consisting of four replicates each for two cancer_cell mcf and sum fdm identified genes as significantly different in transcription subsequent study of the samples using quantitative_real qrt_pcr of several differential transcription sites identified by fdm confirmed significant differences at these sites the transcriptome is a key vantage_point for a molecular_biologists study of phenotypic_differences between cells that result from environmental_factors cell specialization or disease classically this study has been conducted largely by observing differential_gene levels using microarrays or high_throughput rna sequencing_technologies however detailed analysis of the transcriptome has shown that significant variation is also encoded in the diversity and relative_abundance of a genes constituent transcripts consequently beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples there is a need to measure differences in expression at the transcript_level we define differential transcription of a gene between samples as a difference in the relative_abundance of the genes transcript_isoforms in the samples in this manner differential transcription is independent of the overall gene_expression in the samples short_read rna sequencing_technologies rna_seq have evolved rapidly to sample the transcriptome at increasing_depth and accuracy using rna_seq obtained from samples the locus and depth of coverage by reads aligned to a reference_genome provide the starting_point for the detection of differential transcription recently two approaches have emerged to detect differential transcription between samples the first approach is based on transcript inference and abundance estimation of the transcripts as performed by tools like cufflinks rquant trans abyss and scripture applying these methods to each of two samples differential transcription can be determined directly for each gene using the estimated relative_abundances of the genes transcripts in the two samples however transcript inference algorithms rely on heuristics to resolve the transcript structure because the inference problem is in general underdetermined as a result some transcripts may be missed or inferred incorrectly abundance estimation in turn is not able to correctly explicatewhile splice_graphs were introduced nearly a decade_ago our definition is intended to record rna_seq read_coverage in such a graph this is also the approach taken in the flux capacitor to make such graphs efficient to analyze we choose a specific representation that differs from classic splice_graphs nodes are labeled with genomic_coordinates which are unique and help address the ambiguities caused by overlapping exons and unannotated genomic_regions the node labels are also well suited for computing the union of graphs from which the edge set for comparison of coverages is easy to determine the actgraph representation can dramatically decrease the data storage requirement for rna_seq it is not a lossless_compression as the underlying reads cannot be recovered from the act graph but it does suffice for the analysis of differential_expression and transcription the fsm captures the signal of differential transcription directly from a pair of act graphs without knowledge or inference of the underlying transcripts or need for normalization the fdm has high correlation with jsd which is an independent measure of differential transcription we showed that fdm can be used as classifier for differential transcription we presented a statistical_method using a permutation_test on act graphs to find genes with significant differential transcription between pairs of samples or between groups of replicates
