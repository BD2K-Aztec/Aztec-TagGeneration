ppdms a resource for mapping small_molecule bioactivities from chembl to pfam a protein_domains ppdms is a resource that maps small_molecule bioactivities to protein_domains from the pfam a collection of protein_families small_molecule bioactivities mapped to protein_domains add important precision to approaches that use protein_sequence searches alignments to assist applications in computational drug_discovery and systems and chemical_biology we have previously_proposed a mapping heuristic for a subset of bioactivities stored in chembl with the pfam a domain most likely to mediate small_molecule binding we have since refined this mapping using a manual procedure here we present a resource that provides up to date mappings and the possibility to review assigned mappings as well as to participate in their assignment and curation we also describe how mappings provided through the ppdms resource are made accessible through the main schema of the chembl database availability_and the ppdms resource and curation interface is available at https systematic_analyses of bioactive_small and their molecular_targets and homologues form the basis of a number of novel applications in computational drug_discovery and systems and chemical_biology including methods of target prediction and for the establishment of functional_relationships between proteins to add precision to these methods we have previously_proposed a simple mapping heuristic of small_molecule bioactivities to protein_domains here we present a full implementation of the mapping to a relevant subset of biological_assays stored in the current version of the chembl database this implementation also accommodates edge cases that were unaddressed in the original implementationspecifically cases where more than one pfam a domain could mediate small_molecule binding in the refined implementation such cases were resolved manually the ppdms server provides a platform to review and contribute manual assignments previous computational_approaches exist that link small_molecule binding to specific protein_domains but these approaches use information extracted from crystal_structures of protein_ligand to transfer binding annotations between homologous_proteins v c the author published_by
