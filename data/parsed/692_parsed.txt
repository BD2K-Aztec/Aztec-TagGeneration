genome_analysis bayespeak an r package for analysing chip_seq motivation identification of genomic_regions of interest in chip_seq commonly referred to as peak_calling aims to find the locations of transcription_factor modified histones or nucleosomes the bayespeak algorithm was developed to model the data_structure using bayesian statistical_techniques and was shown to be a reliable method but did not have a full genome implementation results in this note we present bayespeak an r package for genome_wide peak_calling that provides a flexible implementation of the bayespeak algorithm and is compatible with downstream bioconductor_packages the bayespeak package introduces a new method for summarizing posterior_probability output along with methods for handling overfitting and support for parallel processing we briefly compare the package with other common peak callers availability available as part of bioconductor version url chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip experiments produce short dna_fragments preferentially selected to identify the locations of protein binding_sites histone_modifications or nucleosome_positions in the chip_seq protocol as described in the end of one strand of each fragment is sequenced obtaining a read and then aligned to a reference_genome these aligned_reads form peakslocalized regions of high read densityalong the genome determining the locations and magnitudes of these peaks is an active area of research and a number of tools exist for the so_called peak_calling using a variety of methodologies the algorithm described intakes a bayesian_approach to modelling aligned_reads from chip_seq many peak callers model read_counts with the poisson_distribution and thus do not allow for the overdispersion seen in practice bayespeak addresses this issue by using the negative_binomial page a schematic representation of a hypothetical peak region with bins labelled by genomic order supposing that each bin has an associated pp value above a threshold by default we would merge these six bins into a peak from to with an associated pp value as calculated in section are collected where two adjacent jobs call the exact same bin the maximal pp value is usedthis is a rare occurrence under default_settings we present the peak caller comparison results in the supplementary_material bayespeak demonstrated a competitive sensitivity_and on the genome_wide scale and showed a substantial overlap with other peak callers the over fitting correction greatly_improved the enrichment for true binding_sites in bayespeaks data as did subsequent filtering by pp value in its raw output bayespeak returns pp values for each bin and for each job the posterior mean of each estimated parameter excluding half of the draws as burn in as of bayespeak version mcmc samples of several key_parameters are also present permitting convergence tests such as the geweke diagnostic in the boa or coda packages since the summarized output is in rangeddata format this allows direct analysis of the peaks in any downstream package compatible with iranges including those in bioconductor for example chippeakanno can annotate the output we have observed some phenomena that occur with lower_quality data for example over fitting can occur as follows the model assumes that for each job there are both enriched and unenriched states as such when there are no peaks in a job or when the peaks are extremely weak these two states are used to explain the natural variance present in the unenriched background we identify over fit jobs from their low values where is the expected number of counts in an enriched bin and from their pp values being spread out overrather than tending to be or bayespeak supports the identification and removal of jobs that have encountered this effect supplementary table s and bayespeak provides a bayesian_analysis with advantages including allowance for overdispersion in read_counts and a competitive genome_wide specificity and sensitivity by anticipating peak structure bayespeak does not call peaks based on sheer numbers of reads without appropriate read formation careful_selection of job regions may improve the analysis for example we can use prior_knowledge to partition jobs in a manner that avoids analysing the centromeres and telomeres which usually contain no reads this will prevent unnecessary computation and may also improve results in the surrounding regions there is scope for adapting the bayespeak approach to other forms of peak_calling for example some histone mark data consist of regions of enrichment containing many peaks and in brdu seq data peaks are much broader than those in transcription_factor data
