structural_bioinformatics strike evaluation of protein msas using a single d structure motivation evaluating alternative multiple protein sequence_alignments is an important unsolved_problem in biology the most accurate way of doing this is to use structural_information unfortunately most methods require at least two structures to be embedded in the alignment a condition rarely met when dealing with standard datasets result we developed strike a method that determines the relative accuracy of two alternative alignments of the same sequences using a single structure we validated our methodology on three commonly used reference datasets balibase homestrad and prefab given two alignments strike manages to identify the most accurate one in of the cases on average this figure increases to when considering very challenging datasets like the rv category of balibase this discrimination capacity is significantly_higher than that reported for other metrics such as contact accepted mutation or blosum we show that this increased performance results both from a refined definition of the contacts and from the use of an improved contact substitution score contact cedric notredame crg eu availability strike is an open_source freeware available fromthe assembly of accurate multiple_sequence msas is one of the most important tasks in biology judging from citation index msa packages have become the most widely used tools for biological sequence modeling this should not come as a surprise given their wide_range that include phylogenetic_tree profile building and structural_modeling these diverse modeling schemes are becoming increasingly important in defining the way experimental information is being transferred across uncharacterized sequences yet trees profiles and structural_models all have one thing in common their strong dependency on the msa framework they are based upon for instance it is well established that homology_modeling is very dependent on msa accuracy in a similar fashion have recently described the to whom correspondence should be addressed influence of msas onto phylogenetic tree_topologies showing how minor variations across different aligners can lead to significantly different tree_topologies albeit these authors have not formally established a direct dependency between msa accuracy and proper phylogenetic_tree they have nonetheless shown the existence of a strong methodological bias induced by the aligners choice more recently markovahave used a different set up to show how the use of different aligners can result in significantly different estimates for positive_selection rates these observations confront biologists with a complex_situation on the one hand it is clear that the choice of an alignment strategy will have an impact on any result drawn upon the msas on the other hand there is no simple way to quantify this impact and determine its positive_or nature using sequence_information alone it is very hard to decide which one is the best among two or more alternative msas of the same sequences this difficulty stems from the impossibility of accurately aligning proteins with sequence_identity using sequence_information only sequence_similarity is only a useful indicator of alignment_accuracy for closely_related sequences the most biologically_relevant alignment defined with respect to structural_information in standard datasets is rarely the one having the highest possible score the practical consequences of these observations are important as they imply the need for external evaluation criteria in order to evaluate msas in a biologically_meaningful way the problem of estimating the biological_relevance of an alignment is particularly acute considering alternative msa methods as shown in m coffee different packages tend to deliver significantly different msas most scientists address this problem by ignoring it and using a single aligner most frequently clustalw however for those ready to consider the aligner as yet another parameter in a complex modeling pipeline at least two sequencebased solutions exist the first one involves combining all the alternative alignments into one unique consensus msa this approach has been shown to improve slightly on all the combined methods along the same lines it has also been shown that regions showing a high agreement across methods are also more likely to be correctly aligned as estimated by comparison with a reference msa the second approach is to evaluate the alignment for specific features difficult to take into account while building the msa but measurable on a complete model e g completely conserved positions the alexsys strategy is built on this approach and combines features measured on the unaligned sequences length divergence etc to determineour first task was to determine which type of contact yields the most informative log odds substitution matrix for this we checked the mcmc scsc and allall contacts we determined the corresponding matrix values on the astral subset and measured the entropy of the resulting matrix as one would expect the side chain contacts are those yielding the most informative matrix indeed while the mcmc matrix has an entropy of and the allall has an entropy of the scsc reaches this value is in the same range as that reported byfor the blosum and blosum matrix in order to assess_the of this value we generated random matrices and found their entropies to be distributed normally with mean entropy of and a sd of altogether these results suggest that the scsc matrix named strike matrix in the rest of this text has all the desirable properties for evaluating the conservation of contacts in msas these finding is in agreement with previous results where it is shown that main_chain contacts are less informative for the task of discriminating correct d predicted models from incorrect ones if the decoys are based on templates sharing structural_motifs with the native_structure mc atoms mainly contribute to the stabilization of secondary_structure and therefore constitute energetically_favorable components of the fold in the context of strike mcmc connections disturb the signal because they increase the frequency of contacts between residues not sharing the adequate physicochemical_properties for an interaction as one can see in the strike matrix recapitulates quite well the bestknown properties of protein_structures for instance the entry with the highest_score is the cysteincystein interaction an observation that is in good agreement with the well established importance of disulfide_bridges likewise contacts between hydrophobic_residues interactions tend to have positive values whereas contacts between charged_residues with the same sign or have a clear negative trend the interactions between amino_acids with opposite charges are only slightly positive as one would expect given the tendency of these residues to interact with the solvent rather than forming salt_bridges within the hydrophobic_core only glycine contacts remained undetermined owing to the lack of a side chain the corresponding entries were set to it is interesting to note that the matrix is slightly asymmetric this reflects the underlying asymmetry of residueresidue interactions along the peptide_chain indeed the contacts are determined in nter cter direction and can therefore not be assumed to be reversible the most asymmetric entry is the prolinetryptophan interaction with p w and w p aside from this extreme observation most of the other values have limited variation when comparing the nter cter with the cter nter entry our next task was to estimate whether the strike method is suited to discriminate between accurate and less accurate sequence_alignments accuracy being defined with respect to the reference alignment for this purpose we estimated the correlation between the reference score rs as produced by the balibase program baliscore and the normalized strike score see section for details for each dataset a strike score was computedindependently for each structure and its related sequences i e one sequence with known structure was used as a template while others were considered as targets the result is displayed in the resulting correlation with a pearsons coefficient of r spearmans rho is very weak nonetheless the graph suggests the existence of a trend in the relation between structure based accuracy estimates and strike scores our goal was not so much to estimate the msa accuracy in absolute terms but rather to tell apart two or more alternative alignments of the same structure sequence pair for that purpose we were therefore more concerned with the existence of a nonparametric correlation allowing such comparisons a non parametric correlation exists whenever the relation of order defined between two observations is similar across the two considered metrics for instance if the reference score indicates that a t coffee msa is more accurate than its clustalw counterpart the relation of order is conserved if the strike score of the t coffee msa is superior to the clustalw msa strike score in order to estimate the existence of such a non parametric correlation we computed alternative alignments of each available dataset using seven methods clustalw mafft muscle pcma poa probcons and t coffee we also included the reference alignments themselves and treated them as an eighth additional method we then computed the rs for each msa using the evaluation package suitable for the considered reference dataset resulting in a single accuracy score for each msa using the same alignments we evaluated the scores we wanted to test including a blosum sums of pairs a pam sums of pairs the cao score one for each structure and the strike score given any of these datasets and two alternative alignments generated with two different methods we plotted the difference in rs versus the difference in the test score the results obtained on the rv component of the balibase data when comparing the difference in rs with the difference in strike scores are shown in in this graph each point corresponds to one dataset aligned with two different aligners the horizontal axis indicates the difference of rs between the two msas while the vertical_axis represents the difference in strike score considering the same template structure the total number of points is therefore a product of the number of datasets the number of structures they contain and the number of possible pairwise method comparisons as suggested by the absolute correlation between these differences is relatively weak nonetheless observations made insuggest a very strong non parametric correlation indeed the two quadrants corresponding to rs differences and strike differences having the same sign contain the most data_points top right and bottom left quadrant in total a significant proportion of of the points fall into these quadrants note that the striped patterns that can be seen on this graph result from the same msa being evaluated several times for its strike score once for each structure it contains by definition the reference alignments red squares always have the highest_accuracy and it is interesting to note that a vast_majority of these reference alignments are in the proper quadrants of the graph a graph like the one shown oncan be summarized with an estimate of the fraction of measures falling within the two correct quadrants we therefore repeated the same analysis on the whole balibase prefab and homstrad databases in order to compare the effect of using different metrics like sequencebased measures pam and blosum or cao the results are summarized in it is interesting to note that these results are in broad agreement across the three datasets as one would expect the sequence_based measures pam and blosum have a limited capacity of discriminating msas for their structural accuracy overall using them to rank two alignments is only slightly more accurate than flipping a coin surprisingly the cao based metrics is not significantly more informative than a direct sequence_analysis this surprising result is most likely a consequence of the underdetermination of the cao substitution matrices the last column summarizes the tests carried_out with strike it shows that in this context our approach yields the best results on the most challenging dataset rv made of distantly_related sequences with a known d structure the discrimination capacity of strike is on the rest of the datasets this capacity ranges from the number of comparison comp is much higher for the structural measurements because a score can be computed for each structure included to a significant_improvement over the alternative_methods considered here interestingly this discriminative capacity seems to be independent of the nature of the considered proteins and the performances are relatively even when considering most structural subclasses categories with members were excluded when using a method like strike to estimate the relative accuracy of two msas it is important to have a notion of howmeaningful the score may be and whether it might be influenced by the level of sequence_identity in the considered dataset we therefore binned the results of the analysis presented inaccording to the average level of sequence_identity in the considered msas as estimated on the reference results are displayed in where the color code indicates the fraction of residues appearing in the correct quadrants the p values were computed using a two sided binomial_test with p given two alignments and a difference in strike score this figure gives an estimate of how much trust one can have that the strike difference reflects the difference in structural accuracy the strongest trend on this graph is the poor level of information provided by strike score differences it seems one can rarely use this level of difference to effectively distinguish between two alternative alignments above this value if we ignore the situations with counts the level of information provided by a difference in strike score is roughly constant across all ranges of identity with sequences within the twilight zone differences of strike score make it possible to identify the most accurate msa in nearly of the cases on our datasets such discrimination can be carried_out on a significant fraction of the data the reason why our approach is much more informative than cao is not entirely clear there are two main differences between our method and cao first our metric evaluates contacts rather than the conservation of contacts second the strike matrix was determined using all atom contacts instead of coarse_grained c spheres as in cao we therefore determined an additional strike matrix using the coarse_grained side chain contacts of cao instead of the all atom strike contacts the resulting matrix has an entropy and when tested on homestrad it was only able to correctly_classify of the alignments while this figure is higher than that of cao itself it is also significantly_lower than the original strike matrix whose improved performances are therefore quite likely to be a combination of better contact estimation complemented with a larger amount of usable information in this work we present the strike score a new metric using a single structure to estimate the structural correctness of msas we show that using strike one can distinguish between alternative msas of the same sequences more reliably than when using similarity based scoring_schemes like blosum or pam strike is not the first attempt to compare alternative msas using the information from a single_sequence and in this work we have extensively compared our approach with that developed in cao which is conceptually similar albeit more complex in its implementation our results suggest that comparisons based on strike result are more likely to reveal the most trustworthy msa than those using cao two reasons explain this difference first the strike matrix is not estimated on structural_alignments but on single structures consequently the strike matrix could be estimated on a much larger reference dataset in comparison the cao matrix that considers the substitution cost for every contact pair of amino_acids was probably underdetermined the second reason for the reported improvement is the all atom definition of contacts while cao was determined using coarse_grained c side chain contacts strike uses a more sophisticated definition of contacts discriminating between side_chains and backbone we showed that this choice accounts for the largest part of the difference between cao and strike we also explored the factors_influencing strikes capacity to discriminate between accurate and inaccurate msas against our expectation we found the protein class to have only a weak influence on the trustworthiness of strike on the datasets analyzed here the variations between all all and structures are percentage_points we found that the differences in strike scores are most useful when considering datasets with low average identity and unsurprisingly when the difference in the scores is high for instance a strike difference of nat on a dataset with average sequence_identity makes it possible to identify with a reliability close to the most correct of the two considered this makes strike a potentially very useful tool to evaluate the alternative msas indeed following the work ofon the uncertainty of phylogenetic_trees biologists are now confronted with a complex_situation on the one hand it has now been established that alternative alignments can result in significantly different phylogenetic_trees on the other hand no solution has yet been provided as to how biologists should proceed to select the most useful aligners or alignments the method we introduce here could conveniently address_this by providing users with an objective criterion to select the msas that are most likely to be structurally correct such a criterion would also be useful in the context of homology_modeling
