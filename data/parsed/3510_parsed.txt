pez phylogenetics for the environmental sciences pez is an r package that permits measurement modelling and simulation of phylogen etic structure in ecological data pez contains the first implementation of many methods in r and aggregates existing data_structures and methods into a single coherent package availability_and pez is released under the gpl v open_source available on the internet from cran http cran r project org the package is under active development and the authors welcome contributions seecommunity phylogenetics or eco phylogenetics combines ecology and evolutionary_biology linking ecological phenomena with the evolutionary_processes that generate species and their traits see this growing field has produced a number of statistical_tools and software code to implement them e g but this code is disparate and handles data differently making routine data analyses challenging in many cases published_methods are not formally implemented in a software_package and are available only as supplementary_materials to papers without active public maintenance these valuable techniques are effectively lost to the scientific_community here we present the pez r r core package which provides an intuitive framework that merges existing_tools and supports the development of the next generation of eco phylogenetic_methods it is based around an r class comparative comm that links phylogenetic community environmental and trait data in a single_object with a comparative comm object one can presently calculate over phylogenetic and trait diversity metrics described in the documentation for pez metrics including more than that were previously unavailable in r pez additionally implements statistical_models to infer the processes that underlie patterns in community phylogenetic and trait data users can also perform simulations under various community assembly and evolutionary_processes to help test_hypotheses about the structure of biodiversity pez integrates and makes use of much existing r code and its comparative comm class is directly compatible with all caper code easing comparative_analysis of species trait data
