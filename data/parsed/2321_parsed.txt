genetics_and identifying disease associated snp clusters via contiguous outlier_detection motivation although genome_wide gwas have identified many disease_susceptibility single_nucleotide snps these findings can only explain a small portion of genetic_contributions to complex_diseases which is known as the missing_heritability a possible explanation is that genetic_variants with small effects have not been detected the chance is that a causal snp will be directly genotyped the effects of its neighboring snps may be too weak to be detected due to the effect decay caused by imperfect linkage_disequilibrium moreover it is still challenging to detect a causal snp with a small effect even if it has been directly genotyped results in order to increase the statistical_power when detecting disease associated snps with relatively small effects we propose a method using neighborhood information since the disease associated snps account for only a small fraction of the entire snp set we formulate this problem as contiguous outlier_detection code which is a discrete optimization_problem in our formulation we cast the disease associated snps as outliers and further impose a spatial continuity constraint for outlier_detection we show that this optimization can be solved exactly using graph cuts we also employ the stability selection_strategy to control the false_positive caused by imperfect parameter_tuning we demonstrate its advantage in simulations and real experiments in particular the newly_identified snp clusters are replicable in two independent datasets for the purpose of understanding complex_diseases genome_wide gwas use high_throughput to assay hundreds of thousands of single_nucleotide snps by october about gwas covering diseases to whom correspondence should be addressed and traits have been published and nearly snps have been reported as significantly associated with diseases or traits despite of the success of gwas most of the findings only explain a small portion of genetic_contributions to complex_diseases for example snps identified from type_diabetes t d only account for of the inherited genetic_risk this phenomenon is referred to as the missing_heritability to find the missing_heritability some possible methods have been suggested from biological views such as detecting genetic_variants with small or moderate effects identifying rare genetic_variants and structural_variants that contribute to the disease risk and detecting genegene_interactions underlying the human_diseases to speed up the search of genetic_variants that underly human_diseases more powerful computational and statistical_tools are needed it is typical to test about k snps simultaneously in gwas for large_scale inference controlling the false_discovery fdr turns out to be a powerful strategy the most commonly used fdr procedure is called bh procedure which is based on thresholding the ranked p values it has been observed that bh procedure is able to control the fdr at nominal level for casecontrol_studies but its power decreases as the dependency among snps increases a better fdr control can be achieved in snp analysis by exploring the dependency_structure e g linkage_disequilibrium a direct simulation approach dsa based on multivariate_normal mvn was proposed in although these studies primarily focused on datasets used in candidate_gene studies their work suggested that the block wise strategy might be a possible approach for genome_wide studies by extending the framework of mvn a sliding_window approach was further proposed to account for the dependency among locally intercorrelated markers to be more adaptive to the dependency_structure of the human_genome a hidden markov_chain model hmm which is a more flexible structure compared with the block wise and slidingwindow structures was proposed to account for the dependence however applying these methods to analyze real snp datasets in gwas is very time consuming moreover some methods report many false_positive in real applications thus finding the missing_heritability is still a challenging issue page in order to detect disease associated snp clusters our formulation makes use of information among adjacent snps it turns out that our formulation is an regularization problem and it can be exactly solved by graph cuts we have shown that this method is particularly powerful when the effective size is small or moderate which may be of great help in finding the missing_heritability using two independent cd datasets we demonstrate that code is able to reliably detect weak signals code begins with z values assumed to be normally distributed when applying code to statistics with other distributions they need to be transformed to be normally distributed as what has been done for the locfdr method
