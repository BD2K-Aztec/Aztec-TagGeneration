gene_expression rfmapp ribosome flow model application the rfmapp is a graphical_user application based on the rfm ribosome flow model enabling the estimation of the translation_elongation rates of messenger ribonucleic_acids mrnas and the profile of ribosomal densities along the mrnas in a computationally_efficient way the rfmapp is based on the approach previously described by reuveni et_al and unlike other traditional approaches in the field which are mainly related to the genes mean codon translation efficiency the rfm additionally considers the codon order the ribosomes size and their order thus it has been shown that rfm outperforms traditional predictors when analyzing both heterologous and endogenous_genes availability_and distributable cross_platform application and guideline are available for download at gene translation is a complex process through which a messenger_ribonucleic mrna sequence is decoded by the ribosome to produce a specific protein the elongation step of this process is an iterative procedure in which each codon in the mrna sequence is recognized by a specific transfer_rna trna which adds one additional amino_acid to the growing peptide as gene translation is a central process in all living_organisms its understanding has important ramifications to every biomedical_field namely human_health biotechnology and evolution in recent_years there has been a sharp_increase in emerging technologies for measuring different features related to the process of gene translation however this process is still enigmatic and contradicting conclusions regarding the essential parameters that determine translation rates appear in different studies suggesting that the rate_limiting parameters vary across organisms under diverse conditions and in different genes ribosome flow model rfm is a new approach for modeling the process of translation_elongation affording the first large_scale analysis of gene translation_elongation while taking_into the stochastic_nature of the translation process rfm is aimed at
