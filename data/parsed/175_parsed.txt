sequence_analysis a hidden_markov to identify combinatorial epigenetic_regulation patterns for estrogen_receptor target_genes motivation many studies have shown that epigenetic changes such as altered dna_methylation are linked to estrogen_receptor er positive tumors and disease prognoses several recent_studies have applied high_throughput such as chip_seq and mbd seq to interrogate the altered architec tures of er regulation in tamoxifen tam resistant breast cancer_cells however the details of combinatorial epigenetic_regulation of er target_genes in breast_cancers with acquired tam resistance have not yet been fully examined results we developed a computational_approach to identify and analyze epigenetic patterns associated with tam resistance in the mcf t cell_line as opposed to the tam sensitive mcf cell_line with the goal of understanding the underlying_mechanisms of epigen etic regulatory influence on resistance to tam treatment in breast_cancer in this study we used chip_seq of er rna_polymerase three histone_modifications and mbd seq data of dna_methylation in mcf and mcf t cells to train hidden_markov hmms we applied the bayesian_information to determine that a state hmm was best which was reduced to a state hmm with a bayesian_information score of we further identified four classes of biologically_meaningful states in this breast_cancer cell model system and a set of er combinatorial epigenetic regulated target_genes the correlated gene expression_level and gene_ontology analyses showed that different gene_ontology were enriched with tam resistant versus sensitive breast cancer_cells our study illustrates the applicability of hmm_based analysis of genome_wide high_throughput to study epigenetic influences on e er regulation in breast_cancer the dysfunction of estrogen_receptor er an estrogen e inducible transcription_factor accounts for the growth of of breast_tumors treatment with tamoxifen tam an estrogen antagonist and a selective er modulator has been successful however of the patients that respond to antihormonal therapy relapse within years many studies have shown that epigenetic changes such as altered dna_methylation are linked to er positive tumors and prognoses of the disease other recent_studies including ours have applied high_throughput such as chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq and methyl binding_domain sequencing mbd seq to interrogate the altered architectures of er regulation in tam resistant cells however the details of combinatorial epigenetic_regulation of er target_genes in breast_cancers with acquired tam resistance have not yet been fully examined we sought to develop a computational_approach to identify and analyze these epigenetic patterns to gain insight into the epigenetic changes associated with tam resistance in the mcf t cell_line compared with the tam sensitive mcf cell_line and ultimately to understand_the of epigenetic regulatory influence on tam resistance in breast_cancer the hidden_markov hmm originally developed for computerized speech_recognition is a widely used statistical_method for computational_modeling and analysis of various biological_questions the basic principle of a markov_model is that it is a form of a markov_chain a type of stochastic finite_state machine in which each state has been extended with a set of outputs and probabilities to emit each output in an hmm the state sequence giving rise to the outputs is not visible but the output sequence is known ernst et_al used hmms to find epigenetic states in several human cell_types on the basis of epigenetic data used hmms to identify differential histone modification_sites between two chip_seq samples given these successful applications of hmms we applied the hmm to study epigenetic mechanisms_underlying tam resistance in this study we used chip_seq of er rna_polymerase polii three histone_modification marks and mbd seq data of dna_methylation in both mcf and mcf t cells to train a first order hmm these datasets were used because they were the only datasets available in both mcf and mcf t at the time this study was begun we then applied the bayesian_information bic to determine a best number of combinatorial epigenetic states we further identified a set of er regulated combinatorial epigenetic states including promoter states and several levels of transcription by their probability of emitting er e finally gene_ontology go analysis was performed through the web_based david on the genes in each list to find functional enrichments b to whom correspondence should be addressed using a hmm we have identified states reflecting combinatorial epigenetic patterns for er regulated target_genes in mcf and mcf t we have interpreted each of the states to determine their biological_significance with our results we have determined lists of genes affected by er binding with e in both mcf and mcf t considering a variety of other epigenetic_effects although these results do not conclusively elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms_underlying tam resistance they nonetheless illustrate the applicability of hmm_based analysis of genome_wide high_throughput to study epigenetic influence on e er regulation in breast_cancer although the application of go analysis did not yield statistically_significant terms for every gene_list the results of this study nonetheless suggest several possible future_directions for instance this study was confined to hmm analysis and gene listing perhaps application of gene network_analysis could reveal key_genes responsible for the regulation of the genes in the lists formulated by this study the lists of genes may provide a starting_point for further analyses such as microarray assays of tumor_samples focusing on these genes the methods used here should be applicable in cases other than tam resistance in mcf t using other genome_wide epigenetic datasets than those used in this study the hmm training and identification of combinatorial regulated_genes is extensible to more than two cell_lines o n in hmm training time and space where n number of cell_lines but this is parallelizable with a sufficient number of compute cores for example this can be used to interrogate combinatorial epigenetic_regulation patterns in multiple types of cancer or multiple patient samples with the same type of cancer in the hmm implementation used in this study each possible combination of marks is enumerated as a possible output of the hmm this permits more straightforward analysis of combinatorial marks for example whether marks x and y are found together more often or not which is critical to this study ernst et_al used a multivariate hmm approach in which the output probabilities of each mark are considered independently of each other although multiple marks are allowed in each bin with this model it does not directly model the frequency with which marks co occur which would be calculated after viterbi decoding for example consider a toy hmm with two marks and one state learned over a sequence of two bins if bin has mark and bin has mark the state in both an ernst hmm and one of our hmms would have an emission probability of for each mark however if bin has both marks and and bin has no marks the ernst hmm would be the same and our hmm would have an emission probability of for both marks and for each mark alone future_studies could greatly benefit from the incorporation of additional data in the hmm although many mcf datasets are available datasets were available for only the eight epigenetic_marks used in this study in both mcf and mcf t at the time this study was begun a dataset must be available in all cell_lines studied to be usable in the hmm histone_acetylation data could broaden the context of the hmm analysis by providing histone epigenetic data separate from the methylations analyzed in this study for example h k ac data could support the h_k data and possibly allow the detection of enhancers enriched in both marks as well as better differentiation between active promoter and weak promoter states h_k data may permit differentiation between constitutive and facultative heterochromatin h_k data could allow differentiation between exons and introns chip_seq of er and polii with tam and e treatment would allow more direct investigation of tam resistance the potential utility of further next_generation ngs_data is most powerfully demonstrated by the scope of the work of in which the authors were able to define hmm states by using datasets of acetylations methylations and other marks though it would undoubtedly be impractical with current_technology to perform ngs experiments each in two cell_lines it is clear that the addition of other carefully_selected datasets can improve the discriminatory_power of hmm based_methods such as those used by ernst et_al and this study additionally the usage of additional datasets can reduce the impact of biases in individual_datasets produced by differing experimental_protocols as the contribution of each dataset to the observation sequences used for hmm training is reduced this may allow the state sequences in each cell_line to be directly compared instead of comparing state associated genes as well as reduction of the bp bin size for higher_resolution the addition of further ngs_datasets may be complicated by the increased computational and memory_requirements potentially necessitated by additional data additional datasets may require additional states to be included in hmms as the computational and memory costs of our implementation of the baumwelch algorithm in particular the gamma values grow according to o nb where n number of bins and b number of states this would become prohibitive with increasing numbers of states for example the gamma values for states bp bins and two cell_lines with long double precision bytes with gcc on the x architecture would require about gb of memory bytes with states this increases to gb although not all of this must be allocated at once as forwardbackward is performed_separately on each chromosome to allow it to be parallelized this would nonetheless require a computer with a great_deal of available memory however given the historical decrease of the cost of memory this may become less of an issue in the future in addition there are many subjective parameters in this study for example bp bins were used primarily to mitigate chip_seq noise reducing the bin size can potentially increase the resolution of the state assignments however it would increase the sensitivity of state assignment to chip_seq noise the cutoff of p for the number of reads in a bin required to call that mark present was selected solely because of its successful use in previous work this cutoff may potentially be overly strict or overly permissive in this study we chose to select states with at least a probability of emitting er e for further analysis although we used this threshold to choose states with some relation to er binding it is admittedly arbitrary perhaps a statistical_method could be devised to select states for gene identification in future work additional data_files are available at http motif bmi ohiostate edu erhmm
