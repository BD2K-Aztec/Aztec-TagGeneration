genome_analysis maldiquant a versatile r package for the analysis of mass_spectrometry data maldiquant is an r package providing a complete and modular analysis_pipeline for quantitative analysis of mass spectro metry data maldiquant is specifically_designed with application in clinical_diagnostics in mind and implements sophisticated routines for importing raw_data preprocessing non linear peak alignment and calibration it also handles technical_replicates as well as spectra with unequal resolution availability maldiquant and its associated r packages readbrukerflexdata and readmzxmldata are freely_available from the r archive cran http cran r project org mass_spectrometry profiling is increasingly becoming an important tool in clinical_diagnostics for example to identify_biomarkers for cancer e g similarly as with other high_throughput sophisticated_statistical algorithms are essential in the analysis of spectrometry data we have developed maldiquant to provide a complete opensource analysis_pipeline on the r platform r development comprising all steps from importing of raw_data preprocessing e g baseline removal peak_detection and non linear peak alignment to calibration of mass_spectra maldiquant is written as a standalone package using s object oriented programming to facilitate further extension maldiquant was initially_developed for clinical proteomics using matrix_assisted maldi technology however the algorithms implemented in maldiquant are generic and may be equally applied to other d mass_spectrometry data
