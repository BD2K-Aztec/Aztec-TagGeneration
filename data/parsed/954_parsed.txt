chemtreemap an interactive map of biochemical similarity in molecular datasets motivation what if you could explain complex chemistry in a simple tree and share that data online with your collaborators computational_biology often incorporates diverse chemical data to probe a biological_question but the existing_tools for chemical data are ill suited for the very large_datasets inherent to bioinformatics furthermore existing visualization methods often require an expert chemist to interpret the patterns biologists need an interactive tool for visualizing chemical_information in an intuitive accessible way that facilitates its integration into todays team_based biological_research results chemtreemap is an interactive bioinformatics tool designed to explore chemical_space and mine the relationships between chemical_structure molecular_properties and biological_activity chemtreemap synergistically combines extended connectivity fingerprints and a neighbor_joining algorithm to produce a hierarchical tree with branch_lengths proportional to molecular similarity compound properties are shown by leaf color size and outline to yield a user_defined visualization of the tree two representative analyses are included to demonstrate chemtreemaps capabilities and utility assessing dataset overlap and mining structure_activity sar availability the examples from this paper may be accessed at http ajing github io chemtreemap code for the server and client are available in the supplementary_information at the aforementioned github site and on docker hub https hub docker com with the nametag ajing chemtreemap researchers in the field of bioinformatics are frequently tasked with exploring the relationship between chemical_structures and their potential biological_actions for example one can predict the interaction between a small_molecule and a corresponding protein target given the chemical_structure the degree of similarity between chemical_structures can also indicate a potential for drug_repositioning or off target effects a molecules ability to inhibit protein_protein may also be predicted in order to discover such interactions researchers must harness large_databases including pubchem and chembl which contain vast_amounts of heterogeneous_biological and chemical data the size and complexity of these datasets necessitate automated tools to explore available chemical_space in order to determine chemical relationships and predict potential interactions exploring chemical_space frequently requires a comparison of the number of shared chemicals among multiple_databases an understanding of the similarity within a compound series series and an analysis of how compound structures give rise to a specific biological_action such analysis begins with the visualization of molecular datasets there are general visualization strategies such as venn diagrams networks heat maps and clusters however those strategies have limited utility depending on the biological_question and how detailed the analysis must be chemtreemap is innovative for quantifying chemical similarity in the branch_lengths as done for phylogenetic_trees organizing molecules in an alternative hierarchy and mapping multiple properties to graphical attributes it uses robust widely_accepted methods chemtreemap is designed as a general_purpose chemical visualization and data_mining tool with many interactive features to ease the navigation in large_datasets dragging zooming searching etc a single click on a leaf yields detailed molecular information its dynamic layout allows users to modify the tree using a click and drag feature on the nodes that can reposition branches to improve the view chemtreemap is applicable to a wide_range of problems any data can be mapped onto the similarity tree the approach does not make any assumptions about the relationship between activity and structure thus enabling a data_driven interpretation of biochemical information it can also be also implemented in a client server format that allows efficient data_sharing between collaborators
