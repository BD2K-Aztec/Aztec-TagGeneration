databases_and aluhunter a database of potentially polymorphic alu insertions for use in primate phylogeny and population_genetics aluhunter is a database of taxon specific primate alu_elements for use in phylogeny and population_genetics the software automatically isolates potentially polymorphic alu insertions in sequences submitted to genbank by screening the elements against reference_genomes the resultant database of variable markers is a valuable resource for researchers interested in characterizing alu_elements in their primate taxon of interest availability_and the aluhunter database can be accessed at http www aluhunter com alu_elements are a class of primate specific short interspersed elements sines that replicate through the genome via a copy and paste mechanism inserted alu_elements are rarely precisely excised and always ancestrally absent making them nearly free of homoplasy of known polarity and thus ideal markers for inferring phylogeny if two taxa share a retrotransposon insertion at a certain genomic location it is most likely due to shared descent as a result one can easily infer the phylogeny of a group of primates using presence_or data for a sufficient quantity of alu_elements by grouping via dollo parsimony those that share a particular alu insertion to the exclusion of the taxa that do not their use has allowed the resolution of certain phylogenetic problems within primates that traditional dna sequence_based or morphology based_methods had failed to decisively resolve such as the placement of tarsiers within haplorhines determining whether an alu known to be present in one taxon is present in another can be easily accomplished with the standard laboratory_techniques given amplification primers flanking a known alu element a researcher need only to amplify the region with pcr and use gel_electrophoresis to determine the amplicons size sequencing can then confirm whether the alu is present in an organisms genome since relying on size estimates alone is prone to misinterpretation of rare shifted parallel insertions of alu_elements unfortunately the process of finding novel phylogenetically informative alu elementsones already known to be absent in other taxacan take weeks of lab work a process that can benefit from an efficient in silico solution because of their prevalence in primate genomes alu_elements are often unintentionally sequenced meaning sequence repositories such as genbank are sources of millions of non human primate alu_elements however most of these insertions are useless for purposes of phylogenetic or population genetic_analysis because they are not variable at the generic or subgeneric levels the human_genome for example contains over million alu_elements but are polymorphic within the species isolating useful alu_elements for researchers of primate phylogeny or population_genetics requires the determination of whether an alu was inserted before the diversification of a taxon of interest and is therefore fixed or was inserted recently and is therefore potentially polymorphic one simple bioinformatic solution is to search a sister taxons genome for the alu_elements flanks if the flanks are found in a sister taxons genome with no alu element in between one can assume that the alu was inserted since the split with the sister taxon and is therefore potentially polymorphic within the taxon of interest this method has only recently become possible with the availability of a large amount of source dna_sequences in which to find alu_elements and the advent of multiple publicly_available primate genome_sequences against which to screen them aluhunter uses this screening process to bioinformatically isolate polymorphic insertions on a large_scale the project is an attempt to broadly characterize all alu_elements in genbank sequences and isolate those that may be informative at the generic or subgeneric level
