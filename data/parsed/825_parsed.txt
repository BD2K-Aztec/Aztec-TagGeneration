systems_biology bridging the gap between transcriptome and proteome measurements identifies post_translationally regulated_genes motivation despite much dynamical cellular behaviour being achieved by accurate regulation of protein concentrations messenger_rna abundances measured by microarray_technology and more recently by deep sequencing_techniques are widely used as proxies for protein measurements although for some species and under some conditions there is good correlation between transcriptome and prote ome level measurements such correlation is by no means universal due to post_transcriptional and post_translational both of which are highly_prevalent in cells here we seek to develop a data_driven machine_learning approach to bridging the gap between these two levels of high_throughput omic measurements on saccharomyces_cerevisiae and deploy the model in a novel way to uncover mrna protein pairs that are candidates for post_translational results the application of feature_selection by sparsity inducing regression l norm regularization leads to a stable set of features i e mrna ribosomal occupancy ribosome density trna adaptation_index and codon_bias while achieving a feature_reduction from to a linear predictor used with these features is capable of predicting protein concentrations fairly accurately r proteins whose concentration cannot be predicted accurately taken as outliers with respect to the predictor are shown to have annotation evidence of post_translational significantly more than random subsets of similar size p in a data_mining sense this work also shows a wider point that outliers with respect to a learning method can carry meaningful_information about a problem domain the analysis of high_throughput experimental_data has played a dominant role in biological_research over the last decade or so advances in instrumentation coupled with our ability to archive and share data have revolutionized the way one approaches biological_problems more at a systems level than at the individual component level terabytes of data from thousands of experiments at the transcriptome proteome and metabolome levels are now available along with metadata corresponding to the primary scientific question there is however a massive skew in the amount of interest shown across the above omic scales gene_expression made with microarray_technology being highly dominant with respect to the other two the rapid take up of this technology by the experimental community the monotonic reduction in cost of arrays and the early establishment of data archiving initiatives have led to a large community_wide focus on the transcriptome functional inference about co regulated_genes or genes along a signalling_pathway disease_state classification focusing at the molecular level subtypes subspace projections and the reconstruction of regulatory_networks have been a number of notable success_stories with transcriptome level studies however the transcriptome itself can at best give an approximate picture of cellular state and function useful biological_phenomena such as dynamic cellular function and differential spatiotemporal behaviours arise from quantitatively and precisely regulating protein levels such behaviours arising from protein level regulations have been modelled extensively by mathematical and computational_models examples_include controlled progression through the cell_cycle transcription delay driven oscillations and spatial selectivity in morphogenesis several authors have evaluated the correlation between mrna measurements and the corresponding protein measurements and report varying levels of correlation have developed a machine_learning predictor of protein concentrations which takes a different approach to previous_research in addition to mrna_levels they construct a dataset with several properties of mrnaprotein pairs and train a linear predictor to predict protein levels they carry out a greedy feature_selection procedure to select a subset of relevant_features by this process achieved a correlation of between the true concentrations and the corresponding linear predictions their greedy feature_selection approach selects three input_features as relevant predictors i mrna_levels ii trna adaptation_index tai and iii evolutionary_rate er determined by rate of evolution of a gene by comparison with orthologous in other organisms data_driven models have been used extensively in the analysis of genomic_data clustering classification and time series analysis of microarray_data have been carried_out by several authors probabilistic approaches such as coupled mixture_model with clustering and bayesian_model on transcriptomic and proteomic expressions investigate the relationship between these measurements an approach that has not attracted much usage in genomic_data to whom correspondence should be addressed analysis is novelty detection in which one builds a statistical_model of normal data and tests these against newly arriving abnormal data the basic premise in such an approach is that when a data_driven model is applied to data examples or subsets of data on which the model fails will also be informative we build on this notion and by seeking to develop a predictor of protein concentrations in the same spirit as in previous work identify mrnaprotein pairs that are novel with respect to the performance of such a predictor we construct a data_driven linear predictor of protein concentrations using as input mrna concentrations and other proxy variables that can potentially regulate protein levels once we construct such a predictor we look for systematic errors made by the predictor i e we hypothesize that those mrnaprotein pairs for which construction of a data_driven predictor is difficult and also predicted protein_abundance is lower than the measured abundance are likely candidates for post_translational this follows from the fact that the input_features used in constructing a regressor have no information pertaining to post_translational ptms post_translational of proteins is important in many biological_processes for example demonstrate significant response variations at the translational level decoupled from the transcriptional level of mammalian_cells under various stimuli oshow that animal and plant cells have prominent post_translational contributions to timekeeping with respect to biochemical oscillations further powerful computational_models are also being applied to correcting measurements of post_translationally proteins ptms are known to be triggers of intracellular proteolytic_degradation in vivo stability of proteins can be substantially influenced by specific amino_acid ptms such as phosphorylation and acetylation can act as proxies for such mutations by attachments at specific local sites increasing the susceptibility of the protein to proteinase action localized ptms such as methylation can be equivalent to site_specific amino_acid affecting the degradation_rate of proteins reviewing ptms suggest that glycosylation glycoprotein and n link acetylation influence protein_stability they also claim modifications caused by isopeptide bond formations with members of the ubiquitine family can be implicated in protein_turnover post_translationally swaney et_al s study shows that phosphorylation machinery can be regulated by ubiquitination further motif information on determinants of protein_stability and degradation under ptms is often available the presence of pest motif sequences located in flexible regions accelerates degradation under phosphorylation n terminus segments act as degradation signals in cellular_proteins thus n actelylation with n acetyltransferase segments is directly involved in protein degradation_process d and ken box motifs signal the anaphase_promoting machinery that leads to ubiquitination and subsequent protein_degradation the previously mentioned are observations we will exploit to confirm that proteins found by our novelty detection framework are likely candidates for post_translational of their concentrations see section this article makes two contributions to data_driven modelling at the transcriptomeproteome interface first the linear_regression with sparsity inducing regularization lasso method can identify features that are relevant to a prediction_problem this in the context of computational_biology problems is an alternate approach to the often used greedy forward selection of features the accuracy of prediction of protein concentrations shows improvement over previous_efforts at this problem second model failures carry useful information and this is demonstrated by identifying genes whose predicted protein concentrations are outliers with respect to predictions obtained by a global regression these are confirmed by checking functional_annotations sparse linear_regression selects a compact set of features relevant for predicting protein concentrations accurately further outliers with respect to the predictor we constructed for whom the predicted protein concentration p was greater than the measurement p contained significant over representation for proteins annotated with keywords of ptms
