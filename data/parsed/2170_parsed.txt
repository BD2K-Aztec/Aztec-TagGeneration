data_and hcs analyzer open_source for high_content data correction and analysis motivation high_throughput is a powerful technology principally used by pharmaceutical_industries allowing the identification of molecules of interest within large_libraries originally target based cellular assays provide a way to test compounds or other biological_material such as small_interfering in a more physiologically_realistic in vitro environment high_content hcs platforms are now available at lower cost giving the opportunity for universities or research institutes to access those technologies for research_purposes however the amount of information extracted from each experiment is multiplexed and hence difficult to handle in such context there is an important need for an easy to use but still powerful software able to manage multidimensional screening data by performing adapted quality_control and classification hcs analyzer includes a user_friendly interface specifically dedicated to hcs readouts an automated approach to identify systematic errors potentially occurring during screening and a set of tools to classify cluster and identify phenotypes of interest among large and multivariate_data availability the application the c net source_code as well as detailed documentation are freely_available at the following url high_content hcs can be seen as an extension of highthroughput screening when multiplexing readout this technology usually relies on complex_biological such as cells combined with novel automated imaging platforms this technology currently allows acquisition of a huge amount of experimental_data followed by image_analysis this approach performs the extraction of high_dimensional signatures called phenotypes here we propose an open_source front end interface dedicated to analyze high_dimensional generated during hcs campaigns we embedded weka alglib http www alglib net and accord http accord net origo ethz ch open_source scientific libraries and created a link to the kegg_database soap server http www kegg jp kegg in a very easy and efficient way to whom correspondence should be addressed the users can import screening datasets visualize them evaluate and correct potential_biases edge effect dispensing effect etc cluster and classify the data all in a supervised or unsupervised mode in the case of sirna screening gene and pathway_information can be extracted as well as pathways frequency in addition one can export the results and generate a report including tables graphs and annotated images thus our application is well suited for analysis of complex hcs data this method can be used to further develop high_level plugins taking_advantage of statistical and mathematical toolboxes which can be shared within the community the stand alone software presented here aims to simplify the process of correcting and analyzing multivariate screening datasets the full c source_code is available as well as a plugin sample supplementary allowing the user to adapt or to extend the currently provided version of the application a tutorial as well as visual documentation can be downloaded at the same url further development of the application is expected to adapt the software to evolving community requirements
