genome_analysis clonality an r package for testing clonal relatedness of two tumors from the same patient based on their genomic_profiles if a cancer patient develops multiple_tumors it is sometimes impossible to determine_whether these tumors are independent or clonal based solely on pathological characteristics investigators have studied how to improve this diagnostic_challenge by comparing the presence of loss_of loh at selected genetic locations of tumor_samples or by comparing genomewide copy_number array profiles we have previously_developed statistical methodology to compare such genomic_profiles for an evidence of clonality we assembled the software for these tests in a new r package called clonality for loh profiles the package contains significance_tests the analysis of copy_number profiles includes a likelihood_ratio statistic and reference distribution as well as an option to produce various plots that summarize the results availability bioconductormultiple cancerous_lesions in the same patient can be either clonal or independent clonal tumors for example a primary_tumor and its metastasis originate from the same clonal cell a second primary_tumor develops completely independently from the original primary this distinction can have important clinical_implications for example a lung nodule in a survivor with a previous head_neck cancer is potentially_curable by surgery if it is a primary lung_cancer but not if it is a metastasis from the original primary in such cases the genomic_profiles of tumors can provide insight into their relationship since clonal tumors necessarily possess at least some identical somatic_mutations researchers have utilized two types of genetic data for evaluating clonality the most common approach is to evaluate heterozygous markers at a set of candidate genetic_loci for loss_of loh this strategy has promise as a clinical tool because of its simplicity and because it can be accomplished easily with minimal quantities of dna more recently investigators have compared genomewide copy_number arrays cnas e g cgh arrays to search for identical copy_number or losses this is a more elaborate and expensive strategy less likely to see clinical to whom correspondence should be addressed application in the near future but potentially valuable for its greatly_increased resolution compared with the use of candidate markers we have previously_published statistical methodology for formal statistical_testing in both settings for loh data we have developed a concordant mutations cm test and a likelihood_ratio lr test for cgh data we proposed a lr statistic and an algorithm for calculating its reference distribution under the independence hypothesis we have created the r bioconductor_package called clonality that implements these methods this enables users to summarize genetic profiles of tumors and to perform tests for clonal relatedness
