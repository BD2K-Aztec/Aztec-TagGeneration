sequence_analysis samblaster fast duplicate marking and structural variant read extraction motivation illumina dna_sequencing is now the predominant source of raw genomic_data and data_volumes are growing rapidly bioinformatic analysis_pipelines are having trouble keeping pace a common bottleneck in such pipelines is the requirement to read write sort and compress large bam_files multiple times results we present samblaster a tool that reduces the number of times such costly operations are performed samblaster is designed to mark duplicates in read sorted sam_files as a piped post pass on dna aligner output before it is compressed to bam in addition it can simultaneously output into separate files the discordant read_pairs and or split_read mappings used for structural variant_calling as an alignment post pass its own runtime overhead is negligible while dramatically reducing overall pipeline complexity and runtime as a stand alone duplicate marking tool it performs significantly better than picard or sambamba in terms of both speed and memory_usage while achieving nearly identical results availability_and samblaster is open_source c code and freely_available for download from https github com gregoryfaust samblaster
