jumping across biomedical contexts using compressive data fusion motivation the rapid_growth of diverse biological data allows us to consider interactions between a variety of objects such as genes chemicals molecular_signatures diseases pathways and environmental_exposures often any pair of objectssuch as a gene and a diseasecan be related in different ways for example directly via genedisease_associations or indirectly via functional_annotations chemicals and pathways different ways of relating these objects carry different semantic meanings however traditional_methods disregard these semantics and thus cannot fully_exploit their value in data modeling results we present medusa an approach to detect size k modules of objects that taken together appear most significant to another set of objects medusa operates on large_scale collections of heterogeneous datasets and explicitly distinguishes between diverse data semantics it advances research along two dimensions it builds on collective matrix_factorization to derive different semantics and it formulates the growing of the modules as a submodular optimization program medusa is flexible in choosing or combining semantic meanings and provides theoretical guarantees about detection quality in a systematic study on complex_diseases we show the effectiveness of medusa in associating genes with diseases and detecting disease modules we demonstrate that in predicting genedisease_associations medusa compares_favorably to methods that ignore diverse semantic meanings we find that the utility of different semantics depends on disease categories and that overall medusa recovers disease modules more accurately when combining different semantics availability_and source_code is atin recent_years there is increasing evidence that genedisease association prediction and disease module detection can benefit from integrative data analysis large_scale molecular_biology data systems analyzed with integrative approaches are typically heterogeneous and contain objects of different types such as genes pathways chemicals disease symptoms and exposure measurements these objects interconnect through multiple most often pairwise relations encoded in the data consider an example of such a data system fromthat contains datasets solid edges and objects of different types nodes for example dataset r encodes the clinical_manifestations of diseases whereas dataset r describes associations of chemicals with biological_processes and molecular_functions the ubiquity of complex data systems of this kind presents many unique opportunities and challenges for uncovering genotypephenotype interactions or in general interactions between any kind of objects challenges in the joint consideration of systems of datasets such as that in include inferring accurate_models to predict disease traits and outcomes elucidating important disease genes and generating insight into the genetic_underpinnings of complex_diseases we would like these models to collectively consider the breadth of available data from whole_genome to transcriptomic methylomic and metabolic data a major barrier preventing existing_methods from fully exploiting entire data collections is that individual_datasets usually cannot be directly related to each other for example datasets r annotation of chemicals with gene_ontology go terms and r symptoms of diseases inreside in completely different feature_space as we will learn in this manuscript we can relate distant objects by chaining through the fusion graph for example we can relate molecular_signatures with disease symptoms through genes go terms chemicals and diseases but such chaining actually exacerbates the problem as distant objects can be linked in many different ways for example another way to relate molecular_signatures with disease symptoms is via genes pathways chemicals go terms exposure events and diseases a priori it is not obvious which of the two ways or which of any existing ways of connecting the signatures with the symptoms performs better and should thus be preferred when mining disease data different ways of relating objects often carry different semantic meanings and can potentially generate different results intuitively different semantics imply different similarities however traditional_methods that we review in the next section disregard the subtlety of different types of objects and links these methods mix discard or ignore different semantics which might impede their performance and explanatory capabilities in this work we aim to fill this gap by developing an approach for disease module detection that can consider diverse semantics in a principled manner we here introduce a novel approach called medusa for automatic_detection of size k significant modules from heterogeneous systems of biological data unlike previous_works in integrative data analysis medusa explicitly takes different semantics into consideration during module detection by allowing a user to either choose a particular semantic or combine them our goal is to answer association queries on possibly complex data systems such as the one in for example given a small number of diseases infer the most significant group module of genes of size k or given a list of genes propose a group of k other genes that taken together will give the highest significance under a particular null_hypothesis or given a selection of molecular_pathways of interest find which k chemicals have the largest collective impact on these pathways to achieve this level of versatility medusa builds upon a recent collective matrix_factorization algorithm in addition medusa formulates a submodular optimization program which provides theoretical guarantees about the significance of the detected modules in a case study with datasets shown in we applied medusa to find genedisease_associations and infer disease modules we demonstrate that medusa inferred associations are more accurate than those of alternative_approaches which conflate distinct semantics that exist in the data system importantly we find that different semantics vary in their ability to make accurate_predictions we also show that the performance of different semantics depends on the disease category finally we observe that the overall best performance is achieved when medusa infers associations by combining distinct semantics we here presented a novel and practical approach to infer connections between objects that are either close to each other or far away from each other in heterogeneous_biological data domains we introduced medusa a module detection algorithm that given a set of pivot objects finds a size k module of candidate objects that are jointly relevant to the pivots importantly this module achieves significance that is provably close to the maximum significance that could be achieved by any size k set of the candidates our experiments reveal the versatility of medusa to accurately detect disease modules and predict genedisease_associations by either flexibly choosing or combining different semantic meanings the distinct property of medusa to distinguish diverse semantics enabled medusa to compare favorably against several alternative_methods these findings put medusa on the path towards a biomedical data fusion
