databases_and planform an application and database of graph encoded planarian regenerative experiments understanding the mechanisms_governing the regener ation capabilities of many organisms is a fundamental interest in biology and medicine an ever increasing number of manipulation and molecular experiments are attempting to discover a comprehensive model for regeneration with the planarian flatworm being one of the most important model species despite much effort no comprehensive constructive mechanistic_models exist yet and it is now clear that computational_tools are needed to mine this huge dataset however until now there is no database of regenerative experiments and the current genotypephenotype ontologies and databases are based on textual descriptions which are not understandable by computers to overcome these difficulties we present here planform planarian formalization a manually_curated database and software_tool for planarian regenerative experiments based on a mathematical graph formalism the database contains more than a thousand experiments from the main publications in the planarian literature the software_tool provides the user with a graphical_interface to easily interact with and mine the database the presented system is a valuable resource for the regeneration community and more importantly will pave the way for the application of novel artificial_intelligence tools to extract knowledge from this dataset availability the database and software_tool are freely_available atthe main goal in regenerative biology is to find the control mechanisms that allow many organisms to regenerate missing appendages or organs including the brain planarian worms are of special interest because despite their complexity they possess a brain eyes sensory and digestive systems musculature etc they exhibit an outstanding regenerative_capacity cutting a worm in many pieces results in a regenerated complete worm from each piece however despite the current outstanding efforts of surgical pharmacological and molecular_genetic experiments no model exist that can explain more than one or two aspects of planarian regeneration what is needed now for the discovery of constructive mechanistic and predictive_models of regeneration are automated computational_tools and a centralized database that unambiguously stores experimental assays and outcomes in a formal structure permitting efficient retrieval of the developmental knowledge_acquired during years of planarian experiments certainly the goals of true systems_biology require the ability to manipulate information about higher_order properties of pattern control in addition to gene and protein level data ontologies have been proposed to standardize the vocabulary to describe phenotypes and are in use in valuable databases linking genomic and phenotype data however current phenotype ontologies are based in well defined textual descriptions which are not adequate for regeneration data and cannot be interpreted by automated algorithms here we present a novel database based on a mathematical graph formalism which can describe unambiguously the geometric relations between morphological parts and a computational_tool to mine and extract knowledge from this vast amount of data from the regeneration field at the time of writing the centralized database contains experiments manually_curated from publications from the scientific_literature and we are continually expanding it shows screenshots of planform the main window lists all the experiments manipulation morphologies drugs rnai species and publications stored in the database a form is used to introduce the characteristics of an experiment publication drugs manipulation resultant morphologies etc these characteristics can be selected from the database if they are similar to previously_introduced experiments or defined anew an experiment can define several different morphological outcomes depending on the penetrance of the treatment and the elapsed regeneration time to facilitate the interpretation of the formalism by the user planform draws cartoon representations of the formal morphologies and manipulations in real_time so that the user can immediately see a schematic of the phenotype being described to introduce new morphologies and manipulations the tool presents an interactive graphical_representation which permits one to drag vertices and parameters as well as to create and delete regions organs and perform other edits the user can introduce a new morphology or manipulation by starting from scratch or by copying and editing an existing one importantly planform includes a search module that permits a scientist to query for experiments worm manipulations regenerated morphologies etc stored in the database a query is defined by the type of entity to search experiments manipulations morphologies drugs rnai species or publications a characteristic to search for name publication title or year drug or rnai names or number of specific organs or regions a comparator operator contains equal less or greater and a free_text with which to compare the operator in this way any scientist can easily find specific results contained in the database according to a familiar criterion
