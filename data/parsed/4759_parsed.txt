systems_biology tvnviewer an interactive visualization_tool for exploring networks that change over time or space the relationship between genes and proteins is a dynamic relationship that changes across time and differs in different cells the study of these differences can reveal various insights into biological_processes and disease_progression especially with the aid of proper tools for network_visualization toward this purpose we have developed tvnviewer a novel visualization_tool which is specifically_designed to aid in the exploration and analysis of dynamic networks availability tvnviewer is freely_available with documentation and tutorials on the web atbiological relationships such as those between proteins between transcription_factors and dna_binding and between cells differ across different tissues and change over time recent_studies that changes in network architecture from the cell_cycle and in response to diverse stimuli are quite significant despite the dynamic nature of these interactions the general scientific paradigm has often been to consider these relationships as static entities however many recent_studies have advanced the field through insight from network_dynamics across time or tissue in a variety of species including human blood leukocyte response rice regulatory hierarchies of gene_expression temporal interaction in caenorhabditis_elegans and correlated changes in gene_expression between mouse_tissues the study of network_dynamics has the potential to produce crucial discoveries in gene_regulation cell_cycle and cancer_progression representing biological_relationships visually through networks is considered the best way to demonstrate the interplay between different genes or proteins network representations of such data range from the small and simple networks to large complex_networks that represent thousands of genes the potential for network_visualization to aid in our fundamental understanding of biological_relationships has resulted in an explosion of software platforms and visualization toolkits these software applications include popular tools such as cytoscape osprey to whom correspondence should be addressed visant graphle and many more while some tools are specific to biology others such as medusa are general_purpose and can be customized to other domains each network visualization_tool approaches the problem from a different angle advantages_and between them are varied however despite the complex array of software available there remains the unmet need for software to explore dynamic networks to explore dynamic networks researchers must awkwardly create a series of static networks and manually inspect them to identify rewiring behavior we have developed tvnviewer a web_site built for the exploration and analysis of networks that change over time and space both circle and force directed layouts are available for users to scroll through a series of networks in real_time providing a natural way to quickly identify network rewiring additionally tvnviewer gives users access to analysis tools describing how the degree of the nodes and descriptors in the network change over time although tvnviewer was developed with biological_interactions in mind it can be used for any type of dynamic_network
