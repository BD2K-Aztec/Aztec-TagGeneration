somaticsignatures inferring mutational signatures from single_nucleotide mutational signatures are patterns in the occurrence of somatic single_nucleotide that can reflect underlying mutational processes the somaticsignatures package provides flexible interoperable and easy to use tools that identify such signatures in cancer sequencing_data it facilitates large_scale cross dataset estimation of mutational signatures implements existing_methods for pattern decomposition supports extension through user_defined approaches and integrates with existing bioconductor workflows availability_and the r package somaticsignatures is available as part of the bioconductor_project its documentation provides additional details on the methods and demonstrates applications to biological_datasets mutational signatures link observed somatic single_nucleotide to mutation generating processes the identification of these signatures offers insights into the evolution heterogeneity and developmental_mechanisms of cancer existing softwares offer specialized functionality for this approach and have contributed to the characterization of signatures in multiple_cancer while their reliance on custom data input and output_formats limits integration into common workflows the somaticsignatures package aims to encourage wider adoption of mutational signatures in tumor genome_analysis by providing an accessible r implementation that supports multiple statistical_approaches scales to large_datasets and closely interacts with the data_structures and tools of bioconductor r core somaticsignatures is a flexible and efficient tool for inferring characteristics of mutational mechanisms based on the methodology_developed by it integrates with bioconductor tools for processing and annotating genomic_variants an analysis starts with a set of snv calls typically imported from a vcf file and represented as a vranges object since the original calls do not contain information about the sequence_context we construct the mutational motifs first based on the sequence of a reference or personalized genome
