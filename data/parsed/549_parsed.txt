genome_analysis a statistical variant_calling approach from pedigree_information and local haplotyping with phase_informative motivation variant_calling from genome_wide sequencing_data is essential for the analysis of disease_causing and elucidation of disease mechanisms however variant_calling in low coverage regions is difficult due to sequence_read errors and mapping errors hence variant_calling approaches that are robust to low coverage data are demanded results we propose a new variant_calling approach that considers pedigree_information and haplotyping based on sequence_reads spanning two or more heterozygous positions termed phase_informative in our approach genotyping and haplotyping by the assignment of each read to a haplotype_based on phase_informative are simultaneously performed therefore positions with low evidence for heterozygosity are rescued by phase_informative and such rescued positions contribute to haplotyping in a synergistic way in addition pedigree_information supports more accurate haplotyping as well as genotyping especially in low coverage regions although het erozygous positions are useful for haplotyping homozygous positions are not informative and weaken the information from heterozygous positions as majority of positions are homozygous thus we introduce latent_variables that determine zygosity at each position to filter out homozygous positions for haplotyping in performance evaluation with a parentoffspring trio sequencing_data our approach outper forms existing_approaches in accuracy on the agreement with single_nucleotide array genotyping_results also performance analysis considering distance between variants showed that the use of phase_informative is effective for accurate variant_calling and further performance improvement is expected with longer sequencing_data owing to the progress of next_generation ngs_technologies whole_genome for each individual becomes possible in practical time and with reasonable cost for the identification of disease associated mutations also individual genome data from casecontrol study or study with pedigree_analysis contribute to the elucidation of unknown disease mechanisms because accurate variant_calling is required for the analysis of these genomes in a reliable manner the development of accurate variant callers is demanded in most of the variant callers variants such as single_nucleotide snps insertions_and are detected at each position in a reference_genome from the information of mapped sequence_reads because there exist positions with insufficient coverage of reads due to bias in the library_preparation and mapping failures at short_tandem polymorphic_sites or variable number of tandem_repeat sites reliable variant_calling is challenging at these sites to improve the reliability of variant_calling several approaches have been proposed where additional information such as pedigree_information among individuals and linkage_disequilibrium among snps is considered at present read_length of sequence_reads from most of the next generation sequencers is bp however read_length is still extending from the improvement of sequencing protocols and several sequencers such as pacific_biosciences rs sequencer can produce sequence_reads with thousands of base_pairs although their throughput is not high and their read error_rate is relatively high compared with other sequencers such as illumina_hiseq longer sequence_reads are more likely to cover two or more heterozygous genotyping positions and the use of reads spanning multiple heterozygous positions is effective for accurate phasing thus an approach considering such phase_informative is promising for reliable variant_calling even in low coverage regions we propose a new statistical variant_calling approach that considers pedigree_information and haplotyping based on phase_informative in the estimation process genotyping and haplotyping by the assignment of each read to a haplotype_based on phase_informative are simultaneously performed in a probabilistic manner thus positions that have low evidence for heterozygosity owing to the lack of mapped sequence_reads are rescued by the phase_informative and such rescued variant positions also can be used for the evidence on phasing to whom correspondence should be addressed in addition the use of pedigree_information is effective not only for phasing but also for estimating variant positions because low coverage regions in each individual are supported by sequence_reads covering the same regions in other individuals via pedigree_information from the synergistic_effect by the use of phaseinformative reads and pedigree_information more accurate variant_calling is expected in our proposed approach than other variant callers estimating variants independently on positions and individuals in the haplotyping process of our approach sequence_reads are assigned to a more probable haplotype between two haplotypes based on a binomial model and heterozygous positions are phased by the assigned reads spanning multiple heterozygous positions although homozygous positions are not informative for phasing and cannot be used to distinguish between haplotypes they are also used for data for the binomial model for phasing because the majority of positions are homozygous information from heterozygous positions is weakened and assignment of reads to haplotypes can be misled to address_this we introduce latent_variables that determine zygosity at each position to the model by filtering out the information from highly probably homozygous positions by using the latent_variables only information from heterozygous positions is selectively used for phasing the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows we describe a statistical_model of our proposed approach and provide how the parameters and genotypes are estimated in section in section we compare the performance of our proposed approach and other existing variant callers through a simulation_data analysis and real_data analysis with human whole_genome sequencing_data from illumina_hiseq and snp_array genotyping_results from illumina omni beadchip we finally discuss and conclude the performance evaluation results and effective points of our approach in section
