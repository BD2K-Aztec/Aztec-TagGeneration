optimization strategies for fast detection of positive_selection on phylogenetic_trees motivation the detection of positive_selection is widely used to study gene and genome_evolution but its application remains_limited by the high_computational of existing implementations we present a series of computational optimizations for more efficient estimation of the likelihood_function on large_scale phylogenetic problems we illustrate our approach using the branch site model of codon evolution results we introduce novel optimization techniques that substantially outperform both codeml from the paml package and our previously optimized sequential version slimcodeml these techniques can also be applied to other likelihood_based phylogeny software our implementation scales well for large_numbers of codons and or species it can therefore analyse substantially larger datasets than codeml we evaluated fastcodeml on different platforms and measured average sequential speedups of fastcodeml single threaded versus codeml of up to average speedups of fastcodeml multi_threaded versus codeml on a single_node shared memory of up to for cpu cores and average speedups of the distributed fastcodeml versus codeml of up to on eight nodes cpu cores in total the development of evolutionary_models has a long_tradition in phylogenetics and recent_advances have enhanced our understanding of the molecular_mechanisms at the heart of these advances is the democratization of the use of the likelihood framework which was made possible by algorithmic developments and the wide availability of powerful computing platforms the surge of genomic_data is however pushing the limits of current implementations e g and demands for the developments of better and more efficient ways to compute the phylogenetic likelihood_function plf the development of codon models is a good example to illustrate these current_challenges and the benefits that can be reached by improving the efficiency of current likelihood calculations there are clear advantages to use codon models in phylogenetics but these are currently not widely used because of the large computational burdens involved further the detection of positive_selection has been facilitated by the development of new codon models however their application to genome_scale comprising a large number of species or individuals in the case of population genomic studies remains_challenging thus there exists an urgent need for improved implementations and novel optimization techniques to analyse emerging genomic_datasets the prevalent approach for detecting positive_selection in protein_coding is to use markov_models of codon substitution to estimate the ratio of non synonymous to synonymous changes along the branches of a phylogenetic_tree the branch site model bsm section allows to detect positive_selection that affects a subset of codon sites for a subset of branches in a phylogenetic_tree this model is particularly useful to perform interspecific comparisons and is probably the most widely used approach for this specific purpose the test compares a model that assumes positive_selection on one branch or on a set of a priori specified branches hypothesis h with a null_model that does not incorporate positive_selection hypothesis h if the test is significant the bayes empirical_bayes beb method is used to compute the posterior_probability of each particular codon to evolve under positive_selection along the specified branches in codeml the test is usually applied iteratively and independently to each branch of a given phylogenetic_tree this approach is compute bound and although alternatives have recently been proposed the limiting_factor of such analyses to whom correspondence should be addressed
