ledpred an r bioconductor_package to predict regulatory_sequences using support_vector supervised_classification based_on svms has successfully been used for the prediction of cis_regulatory crms however no integrated tool using such heterogeneous data as position_specific chip_seq or conservation scores is currently available here we present ledpred a flexible svm workflow that predicts new regulatory_sequences based on the annotation of known crms which are associated to a large variety of feature_types ledpred is provided as an r bioconductor_package connected to an online ser ver to avoid installation of non r software due to the heterogeneous crm feature integration ledpred excels at the prediction of regulatory_sequences in drosophila and mouse datasets compared with similar svm based software availability_and ledpred is available on github https transcriptional_programs are tightly_controlled by cis_regulatory crms that control gene_expression crms are stretches of dna that contain specific combinations of transcription_factor tfbs and are often associated with histone_modification or nucleosome free regions a wellestablished strategy to predict crms is to analyze combinations of crm features described above in a set of experimentally_validated crms support_vector svm algorithms are appropriate for this task since they can learn sequence_features that distinguish crms from background sequences existing_tools supplementary score sequences based on k_mer discovery kirmes k_mer svm fletez positionspecific scoring_matrices pssms clare or chip_seq the deep tool theoretically integrates a large palette of features but is specific to mammals does not return a model to score new sequences and is currently unavailable here we present an r bioconductor_package based on the libsvm library
