automated validation of genetic_variants from large_databases ensuring that variant references refer to the same genomic_locations accurate annotations of genomic_variants are necessary to achieve full genome clinical interpretations that are scientifically sound and medically relevant many disease associations especially those reported before the completion of the hgp are limited in applicability because of potential inconsistencies with our current_standards for genomic_coordinates nomenclature and gene structure in an effort to validate and link variants from the medical_genetics literature to an unambiguous reference for each variant we developed a software pipeline and reviewed single amino_acid from online_mendelian omim human gene_mutation database hgmd and dbsnp the frequency of unresolved mutation annotations varied_widely among the databases ranging from to a taxonomy of primary causes for unresolved mutations was produced large_numbers of genetic_variants from medical and genetics publications have been compiled in databases including the online_mendelian omim the human gene_mutation database hgmd among others for example the hgmd has curated disease associated genetic_variants in its current release and omim has described variants as of june these disease associated variants are valuable in the understanding prevention and diagnosis of human disease with the imminent reduction to practice of whole_genome interpretation an overview of the accuracy of these databases is important in understanding how much quality_improvement work remains to make these prior genome_wide annotations clinically useful we focus here on the syntactic accuracy of the annotations which are an important but small step toward assessing their clinical_validity to whom correspondence should be addressed to this end we developed a software module aa nt which provides basic validation of single amino_acid changes using information from current databases derives the corresponding dna change from an amino_acid change and generates human genome_variation society hgvs recommended names supplementary we applied aa nt to a selected set of variants from three commonly used databases omim hgmd and dbsnp to evaluate whether we could correctly resolve the locations of variants in current annotation databases we validated single_nucleotide from omim hgmd and dbsnp and obtained a passing rate ranging from to
