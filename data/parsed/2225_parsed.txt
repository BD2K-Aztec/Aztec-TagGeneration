databases_and homolonto generating homology relationships by pairwise_alignment of ontologies and application to vertebrate anatomy motivation the anatomy of model species is described in ontologies which are used to standardize the annotations of experimental_data such as gene_expression to compare such data between species we need to establish relations between ontologies describing different species results we present a new algorithm and its implementation in the software homolonto to create new relationships between anatomical_ontologies based on the homology concept homolonto uses a supervised ontology alignment approach several alignments can be merged forming homology groups we also present an algorithm to generate relationships between these homology groups this has been used to build a multi species ontology for the database of gene_expression evolution bgee availability download section of the bgee websitedatabases dedicated to model species rely on the usage of ontologies for example the zebrafish anatomy for zfin or the mouse gross_anatomy and development such ontologies of anatomy and development facilitate the organization of functional data pertaining to a species for example all gene_expression described in zfin are annotated using the zebrafish anatomical ontology a list of such ontologies is kept on the open biomedical_ontologies obo website to pool the experimental_data from different model species we need to encode corresponding information between ontologies which describe different anatomies e g zebrafish and human for example we are interested in integrating and comparing gene_expression between several species the most widely_accepted criterion to make such comparisons in biology is homology when we compare two elements whether or not they are derived from the same ancestral element defines our expectation of similarity to whom correspondence should be addressed between them and the interpretation of differences for example if a chicken wing is not homologous to a fly wing we do not expect the same underlying structures and similarities can be attributed to functional convergence whereas the chicken wing is homologous as a limb to the human arm thus we do expect the same underlying structures and differences can be attributed to divergent_evolution there are different definitions of homology and our algorithm does not in itself impose one on the user we do recommend choosing an explicit definition and using it consistently throughout the analysis in practice hundreds of terms must be compared between ontologies that may differ both in the actual biology modeled i e a fish is not a mammal and in the representation used although a purely manual_annotation of homologies is possible it would be too time consuming to be done for all terms between several divergent_species have used a manual approach to find similarities between simplified anatomy ontologies for human and mouse as both are mammals they share most structures and terminology there are also on going efforts to integrate anatomical_ontologies which are often geared towards the comparison of phenotypes as far as we know the question of using homology to align anatomical_ontologies has never been explicitly addressed since the problem is to find correspondences between the concepts of two ontologies we draw on methods from schema matching or ontology alignment as opposed to more generalist solutions we present a algorithm which is specialized in the alignment of anatomical_ontologies the specificities of these ontologies include high redundancy of terms and few types of relations finally a specific issue is that structures which have the same name and are related to similar concepts may not be homologous this is the case of the insect eye and the mammalian eye while some underlying_molecular are similar these structures evolved independently and are not considered homologous discussed in unsupervised alignment_algorithms would misleadingly align such similarities this is for instance the case for the loom software used on the ncbo portal in principle an alignment algorithm should aim at finding the largest number of true_positives while avoiding false_positives in practice our experience is that the size and structure of anatomical_ontologies leads to very large_numbers of false_positives if a naive approach is taken i e common words thus the basic aim of homolonto is to propose in priority to the user the best candidateto date the use of homolonto followed by a curation process has allowed to define hogs involving structures from seven anatomical_ontologies zfa ehdaa ev emapa ma xao and fbbt the algorithm to design relationships amongst the hogs inferred relations with the most stringent parameters ontology coverage withinontology agreement inter ontology agreement of them were defined automatically as part of as is a all the others as broader than after curation there are part of and is a relations the resulting alignments are used in the database bgee thus an important result is that we have been able to implement in a practical manner anatomical homology relationships here we present in more detail two alignments first zebrafish xenopus which illustrates a best case scenario of two consistent ontologies conforming to the caro standards with annotations of synonyms and definitions and low redundancy on the other hand xenopus a frog and zebrafish a ray_finned fish present important differences in anatomy and second human mouse which despite the similarity in anatomy page the main_feature of homolonto is its efficiency in identifying and ranking valid pairs of terms although most homologies concern terms with the same name the algorithm is successful both in generating relevant propositions for terms with different names and in ranking poorly terms with the same name which are not homologs the algorithm has been shown to perform well in proposing valid pairs of homologous terms for two quite different cases zebrafish and xenopus have divergent anatomies from the two major branches of vertebrates ray_finned fishes and tetrapodes but are described by ontologies which follow consistent guidelines the xenopus ontology is also relatively small conversely human and mouse have very similar anatomies both are mammals but are described by large ontologies with little structured information despite these differences the results of homolonto are consistent proposing almost exclusively valid pairs in a first series of iterations covering approximately half of the smaller ontology iterations for xenopus zebrafish iterations for human mouse the size of some biological ontologies makes the user_interface important the gui of homolonto provides rapid access to information about the terms considered and includes keyboard shortcuts the combination of an algorithm which proposes relevant pairs of terms and of this gui allows the alignment of large ontologies of anatomy in reasonable time i e weeks as all propositions have to be manually validated the expertise of the curator is important to consider in our experience most propositions between closely_related represent text book knowledge that do not require the curator to be an anatomy expert although she he needs to be a biologist on the other hand when dealing with complex structures e g substructures of the brain or distant_species e g alignment of insect and vertebrate anatomies such an expertise might be needed future development of homolonto should include more relationships than simple homology for example homoplasy analogy in the common_sense of the word may be relevant in cases of functional equivalence such as the vertebrate and insect eyes also it would be of interest to model explicitly serial homology to improve the management of e g somites
