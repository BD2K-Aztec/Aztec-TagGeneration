phylogenetics stability analysis of phylogenetic_trees motivation phylogenetics or reconstructing the evolutionary_relationships of organisms is critical for understanding evolution a large number of heuristic_algorithms for phylogenetics have been developed some of which enable estimates of trees with tens_of of taxa such trees may not be robust as small changes in the input_data can cause major differences in the optimal topology tools that can assess the quality and stability of phylogenetic_tree estimates and identify the most reliable parts of the tree are needed results we define measures that assess the stability of trees sub trees and individual taxa with respect to changes in the input_sequences our measures consider changes at the finest granularity in the input_data i e individual nucleotides we demonstrate the effectiveness of our measures on large published datasets our measures are computationally_feasible for phylogenetic datasets consisting of tens_of of taxa availability this software is available at http bioinformatics phylogenetics or reconstructing the evolutionary_history of organisms is important for many areas of biological_research rapid increases in the amount of available sequence_data and computational advances have enabled construction of phylogenetic_trees with tens_of of species e g however it often is difficult to assess the quality and reliability of large phylogenetic_trees an ideal_method for assessing tree quality should be computationally_tractable for extremely large_datasets quantify the confidence in relationships within the tree and compare the quality of the best tree to alternate trees in this article we describe a novel method for computing the stability of phylogenetic_trees we say that a tree is stable if its topology is largely robust to small changes in the input_data used to infer the tree conversely unstable trees may be subject to major structural changes with only a few alterations in the input_data often the quality of trees is determined using nodal support measures such as non parametric bootstrapping jackknifing relative support or bayesian posterior_probabilities these methods assess a large number of trees that represent a range of possible solutions perhaps the most commonly used method is the non parametric bootstrapping this method builds a collection of trees from pseudoreplicate datasets obtained by sampling with replacement from the original dataset because the phylogenetic_analysis has to be repeated for each bootstrap replicate it can be computationally_expensive for large_datasets bootstrap analysis of tens_of of sequences can take years of processing time also the bootstrap methods consider only a few of the possible alterations in the input_data the bremer support or decay index measures for all groups in the tree the minimum number of additional parsimony steps needed to find a tree without that group this is similar to a stability measure however it does not examine how similar the alternate suboptimal topologies are to the original tree several recent methods seek to identify rogue taxa or taxa that cannot be placed reliably anywhere in the tree the issue of stability of phylogenetic_trees has been proposed in the past in other areas of research what if analyses have been discussed under the name of post optimality analysis or sensitivity analysis see in this article we describe a framework of phylogenetic stability measures based on sensitivity and post optimality analysis our methods measure stability of trees with respect to the input_data allowing the data from each taxon to be modified independently our framework provides a measure of the minimum change in the input_sequences that are required to alter significantly the topology of a given phylogenetic_tree thus they assess if and how much a particular tree relies on the accuracy of a small number of character states the more changes in input_data required to alter a tree significantly the more stable the tree is further nodal measures developed within this framework can be computed quickly we demonstrate that our stability measures provide a new computationally_feasible perspective on the quality of large phylogenetic_trees the main contributions of this work are as follows we present an original framework for assessing the stability of phylogenetic_trees and define several measures of stability these measures capture information about stability of trees relative to changes in the input_data we apply our stability measures to published datasets in these examples we identify unstable subtrees and discuss why they are unstable to whom correspondence should be addressed background and preliminary information is presented in section we then formally define the notions of stability and discuss their relevance in section in section we discuss how data obtained from stability measures can be used to analyse subtrees the computational challenges for computing stability and our solutions to them are described in section we present experimental_results in section and finally conclude in section implementation details we have implemented our algorithm using java we were able to compute all the taxa stability measures on the datasets described in this article in h this includes a dataset with taxa further this computation can be easily parallelized datasets in our experiments we used three datasets that represent the variation found in current large_scale molecular phylogenetic_studies the mammals dataset is a phylogeny of species of mammals published in the length of the alignment is the sequence_length varies from to with an average length of and a standard_deviation of the saxifragales data is a phylogeny of plant_species d soltis et_al submitted for publication the length of the alignment is positions the sequence_length ranges from to with an average length of and a standard_deviation of the plants dataset is a phylogeny of plant_species the length of the alignment is positions the sequence_length ranges from to with an average length of and a standard_deviation of we have presented a novel framework to evaluate the stability of phylogenetic_trees these measures may be used to assess the stability of individual sequences clades or entire trees they provide information that may be used to direct further phylogenetic research and also suggest alternate plaubile topologies thus the stability measures presented in this article may be used to improve quality of phylogenetic_analyses and the performance of iterative algorithms our experiments demonstrate that our stability measures can be easily computed for the largest published empirical datasets it is important to note that the success of these measures is dependent on the choice of editing and tree distance measures used while we have used edit and rf distance measures any set of measures can be used we can easily replace the edit_distance with a distance estimated using the general time reversible model tavare tavare or the rf distance with a weighted rf distance in our current search_strategy spr or tree bisection and reconnection tbr distance measures may not be useful criteria for the selection of e and r strongly depends on the choice of distance functions this is a complex issue but we briefly suggest how this problem may be approached a simple approach could be to use percentages of average or current sequence_length and tree height for determining e and r respectively alternatively it is possible to rank the nodes in the order of their stability with respect to a e or r finally it is possible to compute the statistical_properties of sequence_length and move distances to determine outliers with respect to mean and standard_deviations for range our analyses on published large_datasets identified strengths_and of these phylogenetic hypotheses our measures found that the plants and saxifragales datasets were highly_unstable both include many closely_related and both contain taxa with short_sequences and with much missing_data it is therefore not surprising that small changes in the sequences can lead to large tree rearrangements our measures also recognized the stability in the mammals dataset which has far fewer taxa and much more sequence_data it is important to note that the stability measures discussed here complement rather than replace existing_measures of phylogenetic support as a sanity check we performed a limited comparison to a method that identifies rogue taxa running roguenarok while there was some overlap between the unstable taxa and the rogue taxa the rankings were not obviously correlated we do not pursue a detailed comparison with the measures of rogue taxa identification as their objectives are different from stability the intent of the stability measures is not to invalidate a tree or a method but to provide explicit guarantees on situations where a specific tree on a give dataset will not be unstable the placement of any subtrees and taxa identified as unstable should be interpreted with caution the ranked_list of unstable nodes should help prioritize areas of the tree that need further study or data b
