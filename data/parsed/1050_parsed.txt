genetics_and comment on 'bayesian parentage analysis with systematic accountability of genotyping error missing_data and false matching' we show the software solomon is improved by using the likelihood_ratio instead of an ad_hoc statistic in a recent bioinformatics article christie tennessen and blouin hereafter ctb present the software solomon for parentage inference from genotype data they propose a method of estimating the number of true parent_offspring pairs amongst all the candidate pairs in a dataset and show it provides better results than the program cervus when the fraction of sampled candidates an input to cervus is misspecified here we show that the performance of solomon can be improved by making full use of the genotype data replacing ctbs statistic with the likelihood_ratio as prescribed by a well established literature this is particularly beneficial when using single_nucleotide snps chosen to have minor_allele near as desired for snp based pedigree reconstruction
