solodel a probabilistic_model for detecting low frequent somatic deletions from unmatched sequencing_data finding somatic_mutations from massively_parallel sequencing_data is becoming a standard process in genome based biomedical_studies there are a number of robust_methods developed for detecting somatic single_nucleotide however detection of somatic copy_number has been substantially less explored and remains vulnerable to frequently raised sampling issues low_frequency in cell_population and absence of the matched control samples results we developed a novel computational_method solodel that accurately classifies low frequent somatic deletions from germline ones with or without matched control samples we first constructed a probabilistic somatic_mutation progression model that describes the occurrence and propagation of the event in the cellular lineage of the sample we then built a gaussian_mixture to represent the mixed_population of somatic and germline deletions parameters of the mixture_model could be estimated using the expectation_maximization with the observed distribution of read_depth ratios at the points of discordant read based initial deletion calls combined with conventional structural_variation caller solodel greatly_increased the accuracy in classifying somatic_mutations even without control solodel maintained a comparable_performance in a wide_range of mutated subpopulation size solodel could also successfully recall experimentally_validated somatic deletions from previously_reported neuropsychiatric whole_genome sequencing_data availability_and java_based implementation of the method is available at http sourceforge net_projects solodel advances in next_generation ngs_technologies enable us to find novel aspects of disease onsets that could not be detected in the previous chip based_technologies finding somatic_mutations is a representative ngs_analysis to detect genetic_variants that occurred after conception various types of somatic_mutations such as single_nucleotide snvs gene_fusions and transposable_element insertions have been focused in a number of disease genome studies which has led to a successful development of the relevant computational detection methods somatic copy_number scna is one of the major genomic_aberrations frequently found in cancer several scna detection_algorithms have been developed based on read_depth comparison and or read_pair analysis between tumor and matched control samples while these algorithms have successfully discovered a number of diseaseassociated scnas several hurdles still remain first many somatic_mutations reside only in a small population of the sample to be present in a low allele fraction this problem is well known as tumor cellularity or tumor subclonality in cancer furthermore non tumor diseases may harbor similar issues due to somatic_mosaicism for example remarkably_low frequent down to a few percent mutations have been reported in brain_diseases such as neuropsychiatric_disorders and neurodevelopmental malformations at this range conventional scna detection methods can be seriously compromised because their key evidence read_depth discrepancy in disease control pair is obscured copy_number changes occur only in a subset to make only an insignificant difference in overall read_depth consequently these subtle read_depth changes are hardly distinguished from natural variance second matched control samples e g blood saliva or normal_tissue are not always available genomic study of brain_diseases is one typical case because brain_tissues are usually collected posthumously control samples are no more available once they are missed in the initial design for example only of brain non tumor and of brain_tumor whole_genome samples deposited in the sequence_read contain matched control information supplementary although less frequent there is still lack of matched control in general cancer data including case only studies samples archived in the database of genotypes and phenotypes this absence of control samples prohibits the use of current_algorithms for scna detection we found the two critical problems low mutational frequency and absence of control turn to be a rather solvable probabilistic problem when considered simultaneously a germline_mutation is expected to be observed in the entire population of the sample so the expected allele_frequency of a germline_mutation is for heterozygous and for homozygous events and we expect a broadly shared somatic_mutation would represent a similar frequency to germline_mutations on the contrary if a somatic_mutation exists only in a subpopulation e g of the sample the allele_frequency of its heterozygous_mutation is expected to be much lower e g these frequencies are hardly expected in germline_mutations according to the binomial probability that one haploid is dominantly sequenced by chance and can be separated without control if we can catalog all existing somatic and germline_mutations in the sample the overall allele_frequency distribution can be utilized to de convolute somatic_mutations in a subpopulation from the others however the classification of somatic_mutation among the all cataloged mutations is also dependent upon the assumed subpopulation composition for example a allele_frequency is generally a noise but can be a successful somatic_mutation candidate with a sized subpopulation so an efficient inference should be applied to find the optimal list of somatic_mutations with proper composition that maximizes the observation probability another problem is interpreting the deviations in read_depth to a deletion call and its frequency deletions in rare populations are difficult to be distinguish from noises likewise rich populations are almost germline like and hardly separated here we introduce a novel computational_method solodel somatic low frequent deletion call model to find low frequent somatic deletions with and without matched control data we first construct a probabilistic_model of somatic_mutation progression to represent the composition of two subpopulation groups normal and mutated cells two types of model_parameters a rate of somatically affected haploid p s a half of mutated subpopulation size assuming that all somatic deletions are heterozygous and a proportion of somatic to total deletion k s are defined for somatic deletions to show the status of the mutated cell_population and the number of somatic deletions we then fit the constructed model for a given sample with the assumption that the sample_consists of normal cells and mutated cells optimal model_parameters that maximize the observation probability are estimated by applying the expectation_maximization em algorithms for gaussian_mixture which represent the mixed allele_frequencies of deletions from normal and mutated cells we accept the mixed model only if the likelihood of the estimated model is higher than that of a simple germline model subpopulation free final somatic deletion candidates that show higher probability to be somatic are selected based on the estimated model using simulated_data with various conditions we demonstrated that solodel accurately estimates the mutated subpopulation size with an average error_rate of false rejection of mixture_model only happened in near germline samples with the combined use of external structural_variation caller we also showed that solodelgreatly improves the accuracy in terms of overall precision and recall in the entire range of subpopulation size and total number of somatic deletions moreover the performance remained_consistent without matched control in a wide_range of subpopulation size finally we could successfully recall experimentally_validated low frequent somatic deletions from neuropsychiatric disease samples this implies that low frequent somatic deletions can also be recruited using our in silico probabilistic_model to alleviate high priced and laborious deletion searching procedures including nested_pcr and single_cell in this article we developed a novel computational_method solodel for detecting low frequent somatic deletions with and without matched control samples we defined a probabilistic_model for somatic deletion generation and estimated model_parameters using em algorithms to provide the criteria of classifying somatic deletion candidates compared with previous methods we showed outstanding performances of detecting low frequent somatic deletions with various simulation datasets with the real sequencing_data we successfully recalled experimentally_validated somatic deletions confirmed by the previous study supporting the reliable performance recent_studies have been increasingly reporting the contribution of low frequent somatic_mutations to the onset of various diseases including neuropsychiatric_diseases however confirmed list of low frequent somatic_mutations are still limited due to the lack of detecting methods insufficiency of matched control information and difficulty of experimental_validation advances of new techniques such as single_cell and targeted ultradepth sequencing will allow us to fill up the catalog of low frequent somatic_mutations decline of sequencing cost and growth of interest for the somatic analysis will increase the datasets with matched control and improve the quality of somatic call with enough numbers of secured gold_standards the development of computational_tools for accurate detection of somatic_mutations will be followed there are several issues to enhance the detecting ability of solodel to detect low frequent somatic deletions as intended enough coverage of whole_genome sequencing_data is indispensable initial calling of deletion candidates that completely depend on the external callers is another issue to improve consideration of polyploidy that affects the estimation of subpopulation size may also elevate the performance of solodel by using gc_content normalization in spite of the issues for improvement solodel showed considerable results compared with the conventional methods even with the harsh conditions which makes it applicable for identifying low frequent somatic deletions of many challenging cases
