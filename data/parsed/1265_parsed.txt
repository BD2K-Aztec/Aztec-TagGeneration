gene_expression data exploration quality_control and testing in single_cell qpcr based gene_expression experiments motivation cell_populations are never truly homogeneous individual cells exist in biochemical states that define functional differences between them new technology based on microfluidic arrays combined with multiplexed quantitative polymerase_chain now enables high_throughput single_cell gene_expression measurement allowing assessment of cellular_heterogeneity however few analytic tools have been developed specifically for the statistical and analytical challenges of single_cell quantitative polymerase_chain data results we present a statistical_framework for the exploration quality_control and analysis of single_cell from micro fluidic arrays we assess accuracy and within sample_heterogeneity of single_cell expression and develop quality_control criteria to filter unreliable cell measurements we propose a statistical_model accounting for the fact that genes at the single_cell level can be on and a continuous expression measure is recorded or dichotomously off and the recorded expression is zero based on this model we derive a combined likelihood_ratio for differential_expression that incorporates both the discrete and continuous components using an experiment that examines treatment specific changes in expression we show that this combined test is more powerful than either the continuous or dichotomous component in isolation or a t test on the zero inflated data although developed for measurements from a specific platform fluidigm these tools are generalizable to other multi_parametric measures over large_numbers of events availability all results presented here were obtained using the singlecellassay r package available on github http github com rglab singlecellassay the development of fluorescence based flow_cytometry fcm revolutionized single_cell analysis although populations of cells sorted by fcm using surface markers may appear monolithic mrna_expression of specific genes within these cells can be heterogeneous and could further discriminate cell_subsets on the other hand classical gene_expression experiments microarrays rna_seq quantitative polymerase_chain qpcr richly characterize a cellular population but at the cost of reporting a summation of expression from many individual cells recent_advances in microfluidic technology now permit performing thousands of pcrs in a single device enabling gene_expression at the single_cell level across hundreds of cells and genes this provides a technology that probes the stochastic_nature of biochemical_processes resulting in relatively large cell to cell expression variability this heterogeneity may carry important information thus single_cell expression data should not be analysed in the same fashion as population_level at the scale of a single_cell biological_variability the object of interest and technical variability a nuisance factor are often of the same magnitude making_it to distinguish between the two no expression i e the gene is off may be detected in individual cells owing to real biological_effects resulting in zero inflation of otherwise continuous measures these features of single_cell data require special_attention during analysis here we focus on the reverse_transcriptase qpcr rt_qpcr based fluidigm san_francisco ca single_cell gene_expression assay which provides simultaneous measurements of up to genes on mrna sources as minute as a single_cell in traditional rt_qpcr despite careful measurement of input cdna concentrations differences in starting_material below the limit of detection require correction for reliable results subtraction of internal control genes or averages thereof is typically used e g the ct method and results are often reported in fold increase per cell in array based gene_expression differences in hybridization and washing of non specific dna between chips require additional correction such normalization schemes are not directly applicable in single_cell gene_expression experiments nor is it obvious that they are needed for single cells the individual cell is the atomic unit of normalization and the amount of starting_material naturally measured in number of cells per reaction even if one attempted direct_application of traditional normalization to whom

http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work approaches the dichotomous nature of single_cell expression hinders their use nonetheless it is important to test for and address any technical biases we present a filtering_approach for removing outlying measurements at the single_cell level that accounts for the dichotomous nature of the data using concordance measures derived from three datasets where gene_expression was measured at the single_cell and cell levels we show that classical rt_qpcr type normalization is not necessary with single_cell multiplexed pcr data and that our filtering step removes technical_artifacts that most severely impact quantitation a typical goal of gene_expression experiments is to search for differential_expression across groups the zero inflation of expression in fluidigm introduces problems for testing differential representation of cell_subsets characterized by expression_patterns as well traditional tests of differential_expression such as the t test or other approaches based on normality are likely inappropriate for zero inflated data approaches to this problem have varied used a winsorized z transformation of the expression values and then treated them as continuous used the non parametric kolmorgovsmirnov test for differences in distribution to find differentially_expressed after winsorizing dichotomized the expression and worked with the binary trait of these authors onlymade use of formal tests of differential_expression however as we will see later both the continuous and discrete parts of the measurements are informative for differential_expression and should be used a parametric test allows directions of difference to be assessed here we propose a discrete continuous model for single_cell expression data based on a mixture of a point mass at zero and a log_normal using this model we derive a likelihood_ratio lrt that can simultaneously test for changes in mean expression conditional on the gene being expressed and in the percentage of expressed cells
