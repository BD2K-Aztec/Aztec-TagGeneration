systems_biology a pathway based data_integration framework for prediction of disease_progression motivation within medical_research there is an increasing trend toward deriving multiple types of data from the same individual the most effective prognostic prediction_methods should use all available data as this maximizes the amount of information used in this article we consider a variety of learning_strategies to boost prediction_performance based on the use of all available data implementation we consider data_integration via the use of multiple_kernel supervised_learning methods we propose a scheme in which feature_selection by statistical score is performed_separately per data type and by pathway membership we further consider the introduction of a confidence measure for the class assignment both to remove some ambiguously labeled datapoints from the training data and to implement a cautious classifier that only makes predictions when the associated confidence is high results we use the metabric dataset for breast_cancer with prediction of survival at days from diagnosis predictive_accuracy is improved by using kernels that exclusively use those genes as features which are known members of particular pathways we show that yet further improvements can be made by using a range of additional kernels based on clinical_covariates such as estrogen_receptor er_status using this range of measures to improve prediction_performance we show that the test accuracy on new instances is nearly though predictions are only made on of the patient cohort within the biomedical_sciences it is increasingly common to derive multiple types of data from the same individual a good example is the cancer_genome cancergenome nih gov in which gene_expression exp array microrna array methylation and copy_number cnv data are derived from the majority of tumor_samples by using multiple types of data derived from a given sample we can understand linkages between attributes within each type of data also by maximizing the information content models that use all the available data are intrinsically more powerful than models that use only one data type for these reasons there has been an increasing interest in data_integration methods both for unsupervised and supervised_learning gonen and their use with genomic_datasets for supervised_learning with multiple types of input_data the decision function will need to successfully integrate the different components of the input_data one way of doing so is to create a committee of decision functions each handling a separate component of the data and feed these decisions into an integrative decision function for the final_outcome decision of course different types of data will have different degrees of informativeness and consequently we need to be able to weight the contribution of different members of the committee accordingly one way of doing so is to associate a confidence measure with the vote of individual committee members and use these probabilistic measures to define their relative_contribution to the final decision in this article though we follow the more direct route of encoding each type of data into objects called kernels and using a weighted combination of these in the final decision function an approach_called multiple_kernel mkl see kernels encode the similarity between data_objects shawe in this article learning is performed using composite kernels which are a linear combination of a large set of base kernels encoding particular types of data in section we also consider probabilistic mkl by restricting prediction to high_confidence instances only we can further improve predictive_accuracy in section we apply to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint last authors exp cnv and clinical data from the metabric dataset were made available for evaluating the performance of different approaches for predicting breast_cancer survival the model that gave the best results was an ensemble of different methods including cox regression_based on the akaike_information a generalized boosting model and k nearest_neighbors this model included prior_knowledge based on the selection of groups of genes inthe authors analyzed several models submitted to this competition including random_forest lasso based regression_models elastic nets and boosting and ensemble models and thus we compare with these we now discuss some broad conclusions that can be drawn from this study various ways in which classifier test accuracy can be further improved and other contexts in which we could apply the method outlined two key conclusions coming from our study are the importance of incorporating prior_knowledge and performing feature_selection prior_knowledge was represented by pathway_information where appropriate data were grouped into clusters representing their particular pathway membership using feature_selection within each such cluster we use the most representative features within each pathway because of the sparse nature of this particular mkl implementation we can select a set of pathways that are most relevant to survival_prediction as expected classifiers that can use all the available data are more powerful that those that use only one type of data mkl methods also have the advantage that they weight the contribution of individual data types and thus indicate their relative significance our study highlighted the importance of using all available clinical data alongside expression array and cnv data in addition expression and cnv data were best incorporated into the classifier by using pathway based kernels further improvements came from using a cautious classifier that only makes predictions on a restricted class of high_confidence cases and by removal of ambiguously labeled samples from the training data these last improvements highlight the importance of using a confidence measure associated with the label assignment and motivate further work on devising robust probabilistic classifiers for use with mkl using these various measures predictive_performance moved from for prediction with exp array data alone to almost with the qualification that prediction is made on of individuals however it is reasonable to expect that this test accuracy can be improved beyond through the use of additional types of data and further refinement of the method microrna array data methylation data and condensed information from images of tumor_biopsies are complimentary types of data which could provide additional base kernels in addition to string kernels shawe taylor and incorporating sequence_data furthermore expression by certain individual genes e g p or small sets of genes e g associated with tp has documented correlation with survival status and these genes could be given extra weight by assigning them individual base kernels for the methodology there are some further directions that could be considered rather than using kegg_pathway data we could investigate other approaches to feature_selection such as filtering features based on gene_ontology labels the kernel coefficients would then indicate which gene_ontology labels are most relevant to predicting survival_outcome if one of the two classes is viewed as more clinically_important than the other then we could use an asymmetric soft margin during svm training this improves test accuracy on one class at the expense of accuracy on the other the simplemkl method used in this article has associated publically available software http asi insa rouen fr enseig nants arakoto code mklindex html it is an effective and representative mkl algorithm and it gives a sparse_representation over the set of base kernels however a large number of mkl methods have been proposed gonen and some methods with a less sparse solution may give higher accuracy in short additional data further refinement of the method and the use of a cautious classifier could lead to a test performance nearer this performance though would be achieved at the cost of a wide_range of genomic and clinical measurements and does not result in prediction with all patients nomograms and simple clinical_measures such as er_status are reliable indicators of disease_progression for breast_cancer a predictive method such as that described would need to be competitive against these however it is in other contexts that similar studies could be effective thus for prostate_cancer there is a well recognized problem distinguishing aggressive from lowrisk cancer in the us of men will be diagnosed with prostate_cancer whereas only would die from the disease with limited ability to predict risk many tumors are unnecessarily labeled as high_risk and treated aggressively it would be interesting to see if the test accuracies stated in this article can be achieved with prostate_cancer and other cancers this would require similar large_datasets with a broad range of genomic and clinical measurements to get good predictive_performance the dataset would need to contain a sufficient number of aggressive_disease examples and not just represent the spectrum of disease observed in the general populationwhich is numerically weighted toward low_risk disease
