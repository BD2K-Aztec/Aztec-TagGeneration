investigating microbial co occurrence patterns based on metagenomic compositional data motivation the high_throughput have provided a powerful_tool to study the microbial organisms living in various environments characterizing microbial_interactions can give us insights into how they live and work together as a community metagonomic data are usually summarized in a compositional fashion due to varying sampling sequencing_depths from one sample to another we study the co occurrence patterns of microbial organisms using their relative_abundance information analyzing compositional data using conventional correlation methods has been shown prone to bias that leads to artifactual correlations results we propose a novel method regularized estimation of the basis covariance based on com positional data rebacca to identify significant co occurrence patterns by finding sparse solutions to a system with a deficient rank to be specific we construct the system using log ratios of count or proportion data and solve the system using the l norm shrinkage method our comprehensive simulation_studies show that rebacca i achieves_higher in general than the existing_methods when a sparse condition is satisfied ii controls the false_positives at a pre specified level while other methods_fail in various cases and iii runs considerably faster than the existing comparable method rebacca is also applied to several real metagenomic_datasets microorganisms coexist with highly_diverse patterns in different environments studying the microbial inter organism relationships may provide us important insights to the underlying properties of the ecosystem it has been shown that symbiosis of microbes is responsible for important metabolic_processes such as pesticide degradation biogeochemical cycling in seawater and dental plague development with recent development_of metagenomic_studies based on uncultivated microbial samples have allowed us to survey the compositions of microbial_communities although numerous microbes have been identified our understandings of the relationships among microbes have been much less fruitful one of the reasons is that we lack of tools to analyze the correlation_structure in metagenomic_data due to its high_dimensions and complex distributions after annotating binning of metagenomic sequencing_data the outputs are usually recorded as counts for downstream_analysis because metagenomic_samples usually cannot be collected at the same scale after identifying the taxa or operational_taxonomic otus in a sample the count of each otu is usually then converted into relative_abundance such as proportion or percentage bydividing its count by the total this implies that the metagenomic relative_abundance data follow a compositional fashion it is well known that applying conventional correlation_coefficient methods on compositional data may lead to biased results although the compositional effect may be weaker on datasets with larger number of components such as the metagenomic compositional data to take advantage of the existing statistical_methods and also avoid producing spurious correlations various types of data transformations have been applied in many compositional data studies these transformations include the additive and centered log_ratio transformation isometric log_ratio transformation chen and li modeled the metagenomic_data directly using dirichlet multinomial distribution recently studied the microbial ecological networks using the concept of conditional_independence these studies provide us tools to handle compositionality however using these tools to infer pair_wise correlations has been a challenge some computational_techniques have been developed to mitigate the compositional effect to evaluate the significance of pearson_correlation calculated based on compositional data used a permutation renormalization bootstrap method reboot to mitigate the compositional bias using simulation_studies we find that while reboot shows some improvement over the conventional method its performance is not consistent and depends on data_structure by assuming unobserved basis abundance sparcc was proposed to infer the pair_wise correlations of basis abundance rather than their proportions basis abundance is defined as a positive unconstrained quantity which forms the composition although basis abundance is conceptual it does not involve any relative information as opposed to relative_abundance and thus analysis based on it is free of the compositional bias sparcc estimates correlations based on basis abundance but is not efficient due to its high_computational therefore these methods have their limitations and have not been investigated thoroughly against compositional data with various types of structures we propose a method regularized estimation of the basis covariance based on compositional data rebacca which estimates the correlations between pairs of basis abundance using the log_ratio transformation of metagenomic count or proportion data estimating the basis covariance_structure from compositional data is equivalent to solving a linear system with a deficient rank difference between rebacca and sparcc can be summarized as i we construct a linear system that is exactly equivalent to the log_ratio transformations and ii we use the popular l norm shrinkage method to solve the system under a sparsity assumption our simulation_studies show that rebacca achieves_higher in general and has better asymptotic performance with large_sample as compared with other methods its performance is more consistent on datasets of various structures it is also computationally_efficient and can be used to analyze large_scale metagenomic_data we propose a method to study pair_wise microbial relationships for metagenomic_data applying conventional measures directly on proportion data can lead to incorrect inference on the pair_wise relationship due to spurious correlation by assuming the underlying basis abundance rebacca infers pair_wise relationships of basis abundance and thus is free of compositional bias in general it provides higher power on identifying correlated pairs than other existing_methods while controlling false_positives another major advantage of rebacca as compared with sparcc is the computational_efficiency sparcc solves the system relying on recursively refining its solution by identifying strong correlations and its computing time and accuracy depends on the number of strongly correlated pairs the computing time for rebacca does not depend on the complexity of the data and is nearly independent of the size of samples for the mouse skincontrol dataset running sparcc with bootstraps on a cluster of cores of intel westmere x processors ghz gb_memory per core requires more than h whereas running rebacca with b equivalent to bootstraps on the same cluster takes only about min a fast implementation of sparcc reduces the computing time nevertheless both the original and improved version of sparcc require setting a maximum number of recursions the default is which can reduce their computing time but also lower their accuracy when there are quite a few strong correlations between otus such as the clustered cases and supplementary we show that the rank deficient system is identifiable or can be solved exactly provided a sparse condition that each taxon correlates with less than a quarter of the total number of taxa supplementary_file in the case where a component is positively correlated with all other components with the same magnitude none of these correlations can be identified no matter how large the sample_size is however based on our experiments if some correlations are positive and some are negative rebacca can find the exact solution despite that the sparse condition is violated above all the sparse condition is derived from an ideal noise_free case and thus in reality even if the sparse condition is satisfied there still can be an issue of identifiability for the system in this is because that given small_sample correlation can be substantially influenced by uncertainties the noise and identifiability issues may be the main_reason that we obtain lower auc for rebacca in case than other two cases nevertheless it should be noted that the sparse condition applies to the model in which is equivalent to and thus the condition should also apply to sparcc in the high_dimensional setting of a real metagenomic_dataset the sparse condition should usually hold because bacterial interaction_network is highly sparse although it is possible to solve the system with some regularization such as constraining the diagonal elements of to be positive the error_distribution in the linear system is unlikely to be normal and thus further transformation may be required thethere are significantly more correlated pairs consistent between the immunized groups than other comparisons construction of the linear system in is not unique however the system constructed by equation is optimal because the right hand side of contains information of all variables and the homogeneity assumption of error variance is satisfied if the distributions for upper diagonal variables in are exchangeable calculation of p values in high_dimensional variable_selection methods is an open_problem stability_selection offers a way to control for fwer using a sample splitting resampling method meinshausen and b hlmann however based on our experiments we find that this method is too conservative for the mouse_skin data instead we use the modified stability_selection method proposed by shah and samworth this method has much better power while also controlling for fwer change of bacteria abundance in mouse_skin microbiota is linked to the cause of skin disease we show that the microbial correlation patterns in immunized samples are different from the non immunized ones the difference highlights the response of a group of bacteroidetes and clostridia to immunization these species have been reported associated with anaerobic infections further analysis of the difference of bacterial correlations between the healthy and diseased groups may reveal the link between microbial factors and disease_susceptibility
