sequence_analysis odoractor a web_server for deciphering olfactory coding odoractor is an open_access web_server aimed at providing a platform for identifying odorant_receptors ors for small_molecules and for browsing existing or ligand pairs it enables the prediction of ors from the molecular_structures of arbitrary chemicals by integrating two individual functionalities odorant verification and or recognition the prediction of the ors for several odorants was experimentally_validated in the study in addition odoractor features a comprehensive repertoire of olfactory_information that has been manually_curated from literature therefore odoractor may provide an effective way to decipher olfactory coding and could be a useful server tool for both basic olfaction research in academia and for odorant discovery in industry availability freely_available atthe detection of volatile odorants is mediated by odorant_receptors ors in the olfactory_sensory of the nose mammalian ors comprise the largest subfamily of g_protein on the cell surface_membranes of these neurons to understand how the plethora of ligands in the environment are detected and discriminated at the molecular level it is essential to match ors with their cognant odorant molecules previous_studies attempted to compile pertinent information of ors into a database format the most comprehensive or database to date is the olfactory_receptor database ordb which includes sequence expression and orthology information for ors in species the human olfactory data explorer horde which is also accessible through ordb is specially formulated for human ors to include practical genomic_information in addition to the sequence and expression information many studies have provided functional profiles of ors using a diverse_array of techniques recently large_scale matching of ors to ligands was made possible though the establishment of to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors and the eleventh author should be regarded_as a number of heterologous_expression systems with an increasing number of deorphaned mammalian ors it became imperative to integrate these data into an all inclusive database however to our knowledge there is yet no such chemical_biology database detailing or ligand pairs in mammals while extracting or ligand pairs from literature to a database may provide accessibility the power to infer novel candidate receptors for a given ligand would ultimately fuel further research in the field several studies used computational_models to predict olfactory responses based on existing ones for example khan et_al employed principle_component pca for the reduction of the dimensionality of percept and of physicochemical descriptors to explain the pleasantness of novel molecules by their properties the same group also demonstrated that a multidimensional metric may be a better predictor of differences in olfactory neuronal_activities recently using an or heterologous_expression system that supports efficient or functional activation upon ligand_stimulation we robustly deorphaned human and mouse ors and used the data to develop a model for predicting odorant receptor_activation in this study we present for the first time a web_server for predicting the ors for small_molecule compounds made possible by the permutation of two individual models aimed at defining an odorant and then predicting its candidate ors in benchmark studies the model for odorant determination shows a high_accuracy of on the test data and the model for receptor_recognition has improved_performance by in comparison with the previous method more importantly the prediction of the ors for several odorants using odoractor was experimentally_validated in the study thus the dual prediction capability and the user_friendly interface of this web_server can be readily applied to experiments involving mammalian ors to serve as a starting_point for identifying the respective receptors for chemicals of interest by allowing a more informed approach in selecting odorants and receptors we have developed the odoractor web_server that functions as a platform for the advanced identification of chemical odorants and their cognate receptors in combination with an olfactory repository covering annotated odorants receptors and their interactions to the best of our knowledge this web_server is the first of its kind and will be of considerable value to scientists interested in olfaction we have demonstrated that odoractor is capable of identifying novel odorants and their receptors for example we predicted and subsequently validated additional ligands for mor and mor which were previously matched to ligands of diverse structures the potencies of these newly_identified ligands as assessed by their respective ec values fall within the same previously described range for each of the receptors in addition using odoractor we were able to successfully deorphan two mouse ors mor and olfr matching them to and ligands respectively finally a prominent strength of this web_service is its ongoing integration of up to date information of both odorant and its receptors from literature for improving its prediction power the odoractor server is available at http mdl shsmu edu cn odoractor
