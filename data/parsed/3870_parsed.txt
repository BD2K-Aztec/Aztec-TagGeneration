ranks a flexible tool for node label ranking and classification in biological_networks ranks is a flexible software_package that can be easily applied to any bioinformatics task formalizable as ranking of nodes with respect to a property given as a label such as automated protein_function gene disease prioritization and drug_repositioning to this end ranks provides an efficient and easy to use implementation of kernelized score functions a semi_supervised algorithmic scheme embedding both local and global learning_strategies for the analysis of biomolecular networks to facilitate comparative_assessment baseline network based_methods e g label propagation and random_walk algorithms have also been implemented availability_and the package is available from cran https cran r project org relevant bioinformatics problems can be modeled through networks where nodes represent biomolecular entities e g proteins or genes and edges functional_relationships between them in this context a typical class of problems is node label ranking which consists of ordering nodes with respect to a given property under studye g the annotation with a specific gene_ontology go or online_mendelian omim term examples of these problems are represented by protein_function disease_gene and drug_repositioning several software_tools have been recently_developed for the analysis of biomolecular networks the bionet r package provides a set of methods for the integrated analysis of gene_expression data and biological_networks htsanalyzer is a tool optimized for network_analysis of highthroughput screens while svd phy predicts functional_associations between non homologous_genes by comparing their phylogenetic distributions generev aims at assessing the functional_relevance of genes from highthroughput data santa uses spatial statistics techniques to assess the functional information content of a biological_network with respect to a given set of seed genes the genenet toolbox for matlab can evaluate the relevance of functional_relationships by performing a statistical assessment of gene connectivity using seed nodes network randomization and permutation techniques the aforementioned tools are limited in their application by the usage of a specific source of data as in the case of bionet and htsanalyzer or do not allow to integrate custom methods in the analysis workflow as in the case of generev other software_tools can use different sources of data but are devised to evaluate the relevance of functional_relationships as in the case of genenet and cannot be obviously used to predict functional labels for the nodes of the network to provide a data source independent bioinformatics tool for solving arbitrary node label ranking and classification_problems in v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com biological_networks we devised ranks ranking of nodes with kernelized score functions a flexible algorithmic scheme implemented and distributed as an r software_package ranks embeds kernelized score functions that have been successfully_applied to gene_function gene disease prioritization and drug_repositioning problems other popular network based_algorithms such as random_walk and label propagation are also provided by the package the ranks learning framework is well suited to perform functional prediction experiments on the whole_genome as its semisupervised learning_strategy allows to efficiently infer node labels in large_networks starting from a small set of annotated examples the highly modular_structure of the functions and methods available in the corresponding r package allows users to easily experiment with different learning algorithms by using a rich collection of interchangeable building_blocks notably the library can be extended through user_defined kernels and score functions and can be easily used as a stand alone tool or within software pipelines aimed at ranking classifying node labels in complex biological_networks conflict of interest none declared bionet an r package for the functional analysis of biological_networks bioinformatics
