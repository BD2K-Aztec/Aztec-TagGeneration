ppixpress construction of condition specific protein_interaction based on transcript_expression proteinprotein_interaction are an important component of modern systems_biology yet comparatively few efforts have been made to tailor their topology to the actual cellular condition being studied here we present a network construction method that exploits expression data at the transcript_level and thus reveals alterations in protein connectivity not only caused by differential_gene but also by alternative_splicing we achieved this by establishing a direct correspondence between individual protein interactions and underlying domain interactions in a complete but condition unspecific protein_interaction this knowledge was then used to infer the condition specific presence of interactions from the dominant protein isoforms when we compared contextualized interaction networks of matched normal and tumor_samples in breast_cancer our transcript based construction identified more significant alterations that affected proteins associated with cancerogenesis than a method that only uses gene_expression data the approach is provided as the user_friendly ppixpress availability_and ppixpress is available at https sourceforge net_projects ppixpress proteinprotein_interaction ppin are an important pillar of data_integration in computational_biology and have been used in a large number of studies and approaches generally such networks are collections of physical_interactions between pairs of proteins compiled from different experiments full ppins provide a convenient overview of the interactome of an organism yet they do not reflect the true wiring exhibited by the cell in a specific state because an interaction can only be realized if both partners are available pruning the full network to the set of proteins whose genes are expressed in the same condition has proven to be a straightforward solution for this this allowed investigating the interaction landscape across tissues as well as the origin of tissue_specific diseases furthermore it improved the prediction of disease genes an estimated of human multi exon genes undergo alternative_splicing as and the specific_isoform of a protein was shown to have a considerable impact on its ability to bind interaction_partners thanks to the ability of quantifying individual transcripts nowadays it thus appears worthwhile to also increase the granularity of condition specific networks to this resolution domaindomain interaction networks ddin depict interactions between individual protein_domains and provide a convenient framework to relate interaction sites with sequence_information in contrast to models based on atomistic structural data ddins allow for universal applicability v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com so_far the only methodical effort regarding the effect of as on interaction networks is found in the cytoscape x plugin domaingraph when linked to the as analysis tool altanalyze domaingraph can highlight protein_domains in ddins that are affected by differential exon usage however this tool is intended for visual_exploration while the user can manually estimate the implications of respective changes as ppin and ddin are visualized together the tool does not allow to automatically infer conclusions for the ppin on a whole proteome scale with ppixpress we aim here at providing a simple standalone solution for the automatic construction of condition specific protein_interaction based on domain information and transcript_expression in addition to this core functionality the tool is able to retrieve current protein interaction data to add functional association scores from the string database to unweighted networks and it can output the underlying conditionspecific ddin for each sample it allows the usage of compressed input_files in the gzip format and is well suited for batch processing ppixpress exploits domain interaction data to adapt protein_interaction to specific cellular conditions at transcript_level detail for the example of protein interactions in breast_cancer we showed how this increase in granularity positively_affected the performance of the network construction compared to a method that only makes use of gene_expression data a platform independent and dependency as well as installation free implementation is provided that only requires little manual effort by the user
