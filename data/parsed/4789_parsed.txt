unified tests for fine_scale mapping and identifying sparse high_dimensional sequence associations downloaded from motivation in searching for genetic_variants for complex_diseases with deep sequencing_data genomic marker sets of high_dimensional genotypic data and sparse functional_variants are quite common existing sequence association tests are incapable of identifying such marker sets or individual causal loci although they appeared powerful to identify small marker sets with dense functional_variants in sequence association studies of admixed individuals cryptic relatedness and population_structure are known to confound the association_analyses method we here propose a unified marker wise test ufinemap to accurately localize causal loci and a unified high_dimensional set based test uhdset to identify high_dimensional sparse associations in deep_sequencing genomic_data of multi_ethnic individuals with random relatedness these two novel tests are based on scaled sparse linear mixed regressions with l p p norm regularization they jointly adjust for cryptic relatedness population_structure and other confounders to prevent false_discoveries and improve statistical_power for identifying promising individual_markers and marker sets that harbor functional genetic_variants of a complex_trait results with large_scale simulation_data and real_data the proposed tests appropriately controlled type_i and appeared to be more powerful than several prominent methods we illustrated their practical utilities by the applications to dna sequence_data of framingham_heart for osteoporosis the proposed tests identified novel significant genes that were missed by the prominent famskat and gemma in particular four out of six most significant pathways identified by the uhdset but missed by famskat have been reported to be related to bmd or osteoporosis in the literature availability_and the computational toolkit is available for academic use deep sequencing_technologies have been generating huge_amounts of data of rare and common dna sequence_variants a number of sequence association tests have been developed to identify marker sets e g a group of snps or cnvs copy_number that contain functional genetic_variants most of these tests however do not jointly_model cryptic relatedness population_structure and other covariates with the growing demand of analyzing next_generation data of multi_ethnic individuals linear_mixed have become popular because of their demonstrated effectiveness in accounting for sample relatedness and population_structure which occurs when there are large_scale systematic_differences in genetic ancestry among individuals in a sample typical examples_include individuals with various levels of immigrant ancestry and more recent shared ancestors than one would expect in a homogenies population cryptic relatedness refers to the presence of relatives in a sample of ostensibly unrelated_individuals could pose more serious confounding than population_structure especially for samples from small and isolated populations accounting for population_structure is more challenging when family_structure or cryptic relatedness is also present we paved the way to correct for the effects of both confounders jointly within the framework of linear_mixed famskat and gemma genome_wide efficient mixed model association appeared as two powerful sequence association tests for identifying small marker sets that harbor dense functional genetic_variants famskat is a set based test which is an extension of skat to be applicable to family data gemma is a computationally_efficient method for fitting multivariate linear_mixed these prominent tests require that the number of markers in a testing_set is much smaller than the sample_size however in deep_sequencing studies one encounters quite often high_dimensional data_sets hds where the number of marker loci is larger than the sample_size and the number of functional_variants is very small the aforementioned tests are incapable of identifying such sparse hds and the functional_variants some sparse regression_methods were developed to localize individual functional markers from high_dimensional marker sets jointly modeling pedigree structure and population_structure they include lasso ridge_regression elastic_net and the usr that we proposed recently however these methods yield biased solutions and are ineffective to prevent false_discoveries of random markers and high_dimensional marker sets irrelevant to functional_variants in this article we first present a unified test ufinemap for accurately localizing individual causal loci the ufinemap is a marker wise test under a scaled sparse linear mixed regression which jointly models marker wise effect relatedness and population_stratification it applies scaled l p p norm regularization to generate a debiased solution next we present an additional significant test unified high_dimensional set based test uhdset for identifying highdimensional sparse associations in deep_sequencing genomic_data of related individuals the uhdset integrates the marker wise statistics of the ufinemap to identify susceptible high_dimensional marker sets in the uhdset the dependence among markers is modeled to appropriately control set based type_i under extensive simulations the ufinemap outperformed the gemma and a scaled lasso based method the uhdset yields higher statistical_power than famskat and gemma applications to framingham_heart also show that our methods yield novel interesting candidate_genes and pathways for follow_up studies showing its advantages over the two compared prominent alternative_methods finally caveats of the proposed methods and perspective future efforts are discussed to validate our proposed tests we conducted simulations under various types of pedigree structures to demonstrate their performances comprehensively in terms of both type_i control and statistical_power some promising association tests with the adjustment of family_structure have been established on the ldss low_dimensional sets however these tests would suffer power_loss in high_dimensional to overcome the limitations of these tests we propose the ufinemap and uhdset tests for assessing the significance of the hdss with cryptic relatedness which are based on novel scaled linear mixed sparse regressions the proposed tests are designed to address the challenge of variants detection under complex pedigree structures which implement an explicit way to properly control the type_i at both single marker level and snps set level the promising results of testing on both simulated_and indicate that the ufinemap and uhdset tests yield considerably_higher statistical_power gains in comparison to other competing_methods especially for high_dimensional with cryptic relatedness the ufinemap test can pinpoint single susceptible variants with higher resolutions even for rare functional_variants in addition our methods also maintain substantial power for detecting susceptibility variants in low_dimensional data of large samples last but not least our methods can identify both rare and common_variants efficiently one limitation of the proposed methods is that we assume linear mixed relationship between phenotype and genotype which might not be true in the real_world therefore non linear_regression with adjustment of relatedness and population_stratification may be more suitable in addition the overall computational_complexity is on m which is much higher than simply solving the sparse linear_mixed or other efficient methods designed for ldss particularly for extremely_large data to solve this issue parallel_computing is implemented to reduce the total computational time for large_scale genetic data analyses
