sequence_analysis consed a graphical editor for next_generation the rapid_growth of dna_sequencing throughput in recent_years implies that graphical interfaces for viewing and correcting errors must now handle large_numbers of reads efficiently pinpoint regions of interest and automate as many tasks as possible we have adapted consed to reflect this to allow full feature editing of large_datasets while keeping memory_requirements low we developed a viewer bamscape that reads billion read bam_files identifies and displays problem_areas for user review and launches the consed graphical editor on user selected regions allowing in addition to long_standing consed capabilities such as assembly editing a variety of new features including direct editing of the reference_sequence variant and error_detection display of annotation tracks and the ability to simultaneously process a group of reads many batch processing capabilities have been added availability the consed package is free to academic government and non profit users and licensed to others for a fee by the university of washington the current version is available for linux macosx and solaris systems or as c source_code it includes a users manual with exercises and example datasets dna_sequencing practice has changed dramatically in recent_years for many organisms high_quality reference_genomes are now available and current research focuses on identifying variants in particular individuals via resequencing rather than de_novo in addition several high_throughput next_generation which generate reads that are generally shorter and or less accurate than sanger sequencing_reads have become widely available in resequencing applications newly derived reads are aligned to an existing reference using an alignment program e g when no reference is available the reads must first be assembled into contigs using a de_novo program e g in the following we use assembly to mean either read_alignment to a reference or de_novo although such programs are reasonably accurate errors are not uncommon much useful information can be extracted from an imperfect assembly but accurate sequence is crucial for some applications mismapped reads and systematic base_calling errors can confuse snp_calling programs accurate sequence is also needed to reliably identify mutations and when biological_features in the sequenced region will be the subject of significant experimental work as a result finishingthe process of identifying and correcting assembly errorsremains an important component of many sequencing_projects reliable finishing generally requires some viewing and manipulation of the assembly by the researcher using a graphical assembly editing program several programs allow viewing but not manipulating the assembly e g whereas others allow automated but not manually directed finishing e g to our knowledge gap and consed are the only programs that allow editing billion read assemblies consed was originally developed in the era of sanger_sequencing and used in finishing the human and other genomes it continues to be widely used with citations per year and downloads per year here we describe recent adaptations to handle large_datasets of next generation reads as well as new viewing and searching features unrelated to finishing
