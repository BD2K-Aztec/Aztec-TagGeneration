genetics_and eps an empirical_bayes approach to integrating pleiotropy and tissue_specific information for prioritizing risk genes motivation researchers worldwide have generated a huge volume of genomic_data including thousands of genome_wide gwas and massive_amounts of gene_expression data from different tissues how to perform a joint analysis of these data to gain new biological_insights has become a critical step in understanding the etiology of complex_diseases due to the polygenic architecture of complex_diseases the identification of risk genes remains_challenging motivated by the shared risk genes found in complex_diseases and tissue_specific gene_expression we propose as an empirical_bayes approach to integrating pleiotropy and tissue_specific information eps for prioritizing risk genes results as demonstrated by extensive_simulation eps greatly_improves the power of identification for disease risk genes eps enables rigorous hypothesis_testing of pleiotropy and tissue_specific risk gene_expression all of the model_parameters can be adaptively estimated from the developed expectationmaximization em_algorithm we applied eps to the bipo lar disorder and schizophrenia gwas from the psychiatric genomics consortium along with the gene_expression data for multiple tissues from the genotype tissue expression project the results of the real_data analysis demonstrate many advantages of eps availability_and the eps software is available on https sites google com site as of april genome_wide gwas have identified more than disease associated single_nucleotide snps at a genome_wide significance_level i e p value despite these discoveries these snps can only explain a small fraction of the genetic_contribution to diseases it is widely agreed that this phenomenon is due to polygenicity of complex phenotypes and the large number of risk_variants with weak effects that remain undiscovered growing_evidence that there are many genetic_variants that may affect the multiple seemingly different phenotypes traits diseases in fact a term named pleiotropy was introduced to describe such a phenomenon more than years_ago the original definition of pleiotropy only v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com concerns the nonzero effect of a locus on different phenotypes and allows the effect direction to be either the same i e the risk_allele increases the risk of two diseases or different i e the risk_allele increases the risk of one disease while decreases the risk of another disease for example the g allele of rs increases the risk for prostate_cancer and colorectal_cancer but the g allele of rs increases the risk for crohns_disease and decreases the risk for psoriasis a closely_related but different concept is genetic_correlation also known as co heritabilitycross disorder group of the psychiatric this refers to the correlation between the genetic effect_sizes of two phenotypes and thus the direction of these effects plays a role to be clear when referring to pleiotropy in this article we adopt its original definition we are interested in the substantial overlap of genetic_factors that underlie the multiple seemingly different phenotypes fortunately more gwas results are becoming publicly_available from gwas repositories such as the gwasgrasp this offers us an unprecedented opportunity to explore pleiotropic_effects besides an enormous amount of gwas data diverse data resources for biological_processes at different layers are also becoming available for example the ongoing genotype tissue expression project gtex is generating a comprehensive atlas of gene_expression and regulation across multiple human tissues this provides abundant information to quantify biological_processes that occur at the cellular_level and thereby helps us to dissect the etiology of complex_diseases moreover the comprehensive gene_expression data in multiple tissues may avoid the potential_bias of the candidate tissue approach for example in the study of obesity the affected tissue is fat but the causal tissue is in some cases the hypothalamus this suggests that the integration of gwas data and gene_expressions from multiple tissues may advance_our of complex_diseases at present the accumulating_evidence on pleiotropy and vast publicly_available data on tissuespecific gene_expression e g tiger and gtex require novel statistical_approaches to gain_a of complex_diseases statistical_approaches that take pleiotropy into consideration have recently become very active such as the conditional false_discovery fdr approach and linear_mixed based_approaches various statistical_methods have also been proposed to analyze tissue_specific gene_expression data such as joint eqtl_analysis in multiple tissues and covariate modulated fdr cmfdr more recently a statistical_approach named gpa was proposed to simultaneously integrate both pleiotropic information and functional_annotation although gpa has demonstrated a very promising direction for the integration of multiple sources of genomic_information it does not fully account for the effects of linkage_disequilibrium ld and only allows binary annotation as its input these disadvantages may limit its use in the integrative_analysis of large_scale genomic_data in this article we propose an empirical_bayes approach to integrating pleiotropy and tissue_specific eps information for prioritizing risk genes compared with some existing_approaches eps has several merits first eps only requires the summary_statistics at the gene level rather than the genotype data at the individual_level the ld effects are carefully accounted for when grouping the snp level summary_statistics into the gene level summary_statistics by using reference_panel data e g genome data second eps is able to integrate both pleiotropy information and gene_expression data e g gtex data which greatly_improves the power of risk gene_prioritization third eps provides rigorous hypothesis_testing to evaluate the significance of pleiotropy and tissue_specific patterns these merits are demonstrated via extensive simulation_studies analysis we have presented a statistical_approach named eps that can integrate pleiotropy information from gwas data and tissue_specific gene_expression data compared with some existing_approaches such as linear_mixed which require genotype data at the individual_level eps only requires summary_statistics for analysis more importantly eps provides statistically_rigorous evaluations of tissue_specific gene_expression and pleiotropic_effects via hypothesis_testing these merits make eps an attractive and effective tool for the integrative_analysis of gwas data with gene_expression data from multiple tissues despite the promising statistical improvements we have made the biological_implications need to be independently replicated one limitation of eps is that it does not take into account overlapping samples addressing this issue in integrating_multiple gwas is an important area for future work
