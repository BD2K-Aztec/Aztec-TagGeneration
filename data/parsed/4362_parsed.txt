sequence_analysis speed fast computation of sensitive spaced seeds multiple spaced seeds represent the current state of the art for similarity_search in bioinformatics with applications in various areas such as sequence_alignment read_mapping oligonucleotide design etc we present speed a software_program that computes highly_sensitive multiple spaced seeds speed can be several orders_of and computes better seeds than the existing leading software programs availability the source_code of speed is freely_available atapproximate string searching is at the core of many fundamental algorithms in bioinformatics since the quadratic time dynamic_programming of smithwaterman is too slow heuristic methods have to be used the most popular of those is implemented in blast and uses the hit and extend approach consecutive matches are considered a hit and the neighborhood is investigated further for potentially local_similarity such a match is called a seed it has been noticed bythat requiring the matches to be non consecutive increases the chance of finding similarities andintroduced the idea of optimal spaced seeds that is seeds where the matches are distributed so as to maximize the sensitivity i e probability to find a local_similarity multiple spaced seeds go much further and approach perfect sensitivity since then multiple spaced seeds have been used in many software programs in a variety of applications such as sequence_alignment read_mapping oligonucleotide design to name a few it is therefore very important to compute seeds with very high_sensitivity the relevant problems are hard and all heuristic_algorithms for computing seeds require exponential time with the exception of the one of ilie and ilie our goal in this note is to engineer this algorithm into an efficient software for computing multiple spaced seeds the new program speed has two execution modes fast and best we have compared speed with the two leading software programs mandala to whom correspondence should be addressed and iedera for a variety of seeds used in practice speed best computes always the best seeds with speedfast coming often in the second place whereas speed fast is three to five orders_of than all the other ones we have compared speed with the two leading software programs mandala and iedera seeds were computed by mandala iedera and speed fast and best with the same parameters as those of shrimp patternhunter ii and bfast the number of iterations was for iedera and for mandala both according to the authors instructions and for speed best the maximum time allowed for all programs was day we give the times until the best seed was obtained
