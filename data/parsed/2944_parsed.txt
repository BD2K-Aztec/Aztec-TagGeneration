data_and metpp a computational platform for comprehensive two_dimensional gas_chromatography time of flight mass_spectrometry based_metabolomics motivation due to the high_complexity of metabolome the comprehensive d gas_chromatography time of flight mass_spectrometry gcgc tof_ms is considered as a powerful analytical platform for metabolomics study however the applications of gcgc tof_ms in metabolomics are not popular owing to the lack of bioinfor_matics system for data analysis results we developed a computational platform entitled metabolo mics profiling pipeline metpp for analysis of metabolomics_data acquired on a gcgc tof_ms system metpp can process peak filtering and merging retention_index matching peak list alignment normalization statistical significance_tests and pattern_recognition using the peak lists deconvoluted from the instrument data as its input the performance of metpp software was tested with two sets of experimental_data acquired in a spike in experiment and a bio marker discovery experiment respectively metpp not only correctly aligned the spiked in metabolite standards from the experimental_data but also correctly recognized their concentration difference between sample groups for analysis of the biomarker_discovery data metabolites were recognized with significant concentration difference between the sample groups and these results agree with the literature results of histological_analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of applying metpp software for disease biomarker_discovery availability the source_code of metpp is available at http comprehensive d gas_chromatography time of flight mass_spectrometry gcgc tof_ms uses two gc columns connected via a thermal modulator compared with the first column the second column is usually a short column with a different stationary_phase and is operated at a higher_temperature the metabolites co eluted from the first column are further separated in the second column and are directed to a time of flight mass_spectrometer for detection consequently the gcgc tof_ms system brings more accurate and rich_information about compound retention_times and mass_spectrum than a d gc_ms system representing a powerful technique for analysis of metabolites in complex_biological the gcgc tof_ms system generates a huge amount of high_dimensional in metabolomics study that require efficient and accurate data analysis algorithms to uncover the biological_information many data analysis algorithms have been developed to process the gcgc tof_ms data for peak_picking chromatogram alignment and peak list alignment guineu is the only reported tool that uses the peak lists as its input and performs retention time correction peak list alignment normalization and statistical significance_tests a comprehensive_review of the developed methods is given by compared with liquid_chromatography lc_ms the applications of gcgc tof_ms to metabolomics were not fully explored during the past_decade one significant bottleneck limiting the usage of gcgc tof_ms in metabolomics is the lack of accurate and comprehensive data analysis tools we herein report a computational platform for analysis of metabolomics_data generated from the gcgc tof_ms instrument in a form of metabolomics profiling pipeline metpp metpp uses the peak lists deconvoluted from the instrument data as its input and then renders peak filtering and merging retention_index matching peak list alignment normalization statistical significance_tests and pattern_recognition to test its performance metpp was used to analyze the gcgc tof_ms data of metabolite extracts of mouse livers with spiked in metabolite standards at different concentrations and two groups of liver metabolite samples from mice_fed different diets metpp was developed using matlab the mathworks natick ma usa and its source_code is available at http metaopen sourceforge net to whom correspondence should be addressed metpp has a modular design including project_management and multiple data analysis components supplementaryis a screenshot of the project_management module which contains all sample meta_information and information of experimental_conditions while supplementary figures s s are the screenshots of data analysis components and respectively demonstrating a good stability of the instrument during the d gc separation and a high_accuracy of chromatof in determining peak location in the d gas chromatograms depicts the peak_area distribution of the spiked in metabolites in g before and after peak_area conversion a large variation in each box represents the peak_area variation of the same compound between the six samples by design each compound should have the identical peak_area among the six samples however chromatof reports only the peak_area of a quant mass a fragment_ion that has the highest quality for quantification and it often chooses different quant mass for the same metabolite depending on the data of the metabolites metabolites in at least one of the six samples have quant mass different from the other samples for instance compound oxalic_acid inhas quant mass values and the value of peak_area has a large deviation ranging from to after reference spectrum based peak_area conversion the span of peak_area is greatly_reduced to demonstrating the effectiveness of the reference spectrum based peak_area conversion the converted peak_area values not only reduced the variation in peak_area but also guarantee the consistency of the values of peak_area across samples for the downstream statistical_analysis to demonstrate whether the concentration differences of the spiked in metabolite standards can be recognized from the alignment table a two tailed t test was used to check the mean difference of the peak_area of each compound between sample groups through different p value settings the true_positive tpr and the false_positive fpr are used as measures for metabolite relative quantification supplementary_information depicts the receiveroperating characteristic curve roc of recognizing the concentration difference of the spiked in metabolite standards between sample groups usingmetpp uses the peak lists generated by peak deconvolution software such as commercial software chromatof as its input it is well known that the chromatof software has some shortcomings including multiple peak table entries for the same compound limited accuracy in calculation of peak_areas etc to minimize these shortcomings of chromatof software metpp provides options for users to filter data from the peak lists generated by chromatof using the peak quality information profile purity purity concerns provided by chromatof the multiple peak entries of the same compound are recognized based on user_defined d retention time variation windows these peak entries are then merged and represented by one representative peak entry to handle peaks detected in blank sample s metpp has three options for the user to select from no action deducting the peak_area of blank sample s from the biological_samples and removing the metabolites the user can also remove metabolites using a user provided exclusion list in this study the default values for peak quality based filtering and merging multiple peak entries were used the analysis of spike in data demonstrates that the data preprocessing methods implemented in metpp is able to remove some of the shortcomings of chromatof software without affecting identification and quantification of the spiked in standards to reduce the rate of false_positive identification the current version of metpp provides an option for users to match the firstdimension retention_index of each compound with the database values a large value of the mean absolute deviation between the database value and experimental retention_index of the removed metabolites ae i u for the spike in data ae i u for the biomarker_discovery data and a small value of the corresponding values of the preserved metabolites ae i u for the spike in data ae i u for the biomarker_discovery data demonstrates the mass_spectral matching based metabolite_identification can introduced a high rate of false identification and the retention_index filtering_methods in metpp can detect and remove some of these false identified metabolites metpp performs peak list alignment using a mixture score function to simultaneously evaluate the deviation of the d retention time and mass_spectral similarity compared with the progressive retention time map searching method implemented in the distance and spectrum correlation optimization disco algorithm the mixture score approach is able to align chromatographic peaks that may have a large variation in either retention time or mass_spectral similarity as long as the overall quality of two peak are similar supplementarydepicts the alignment results of the spike in experimental_data by disco and metpp all spiked in metabolites were fully aligned in all samples by metpp however metabolite standards were fully aligned by disco while the rest of the spiked in metabolites were aligned in a portion of the samples in terms of metabolite quantification the data analysis algorithms implemented in metpp are able to correctly identify and quantify all spiked in metabolite standards analysis of biological_samples using metpp revealed that metabolites have significant abundance changes between two sample groups the accuracy of clustering samples using all metabolite data in each sample is while the clustering accuracy is improved to when the abundance of the metabolites in each sample are used for clustering the improvement in sample clustering accuracy demonstrates that metpp correctly recognized the metabolites with significant abundance difference between sample groups lfd and hfd the abundance changes of the free_fatty agree with the literature results of hepatic lipid level test a different analytical_method these analysis results further demonstrate that the metpp software can be used to recognize the metabolites with significant abundance changes between sample groups the performance of metpp in analysis the spike in data was also compared with the existing guineu software in terms of accuracy of alignment and relative quantification supplementaryshows that only of the spiked in metabolites were fully aligned by guineu while all the spiked in metabolites were fully aligned by metpp for relative quantification metpp also significantly_outperforms guineu in all three statistical_measures of tpr ppv and their harmonic mean f for analysis of all pairwise_comparison between the five sample groups supplementary analysis of both the spike in data and biomarker_discovery data demonstrates that the methods implemented in metpp for peak filtering and merging are effective in minimizing the shortcomings of chromatof however compound nonanoic acid instill has a large variation in peak_area after the peak filtering and merging for the future development accurate peak deconvolution algorithms are needed to improve the quality of peak lists a large variation in peak_area introduced during peak deconvolution can significantly affect the downstream statistical_analysis it is also important to develop algorithms for analysis of time course data and construction of metabolite correlation networks
