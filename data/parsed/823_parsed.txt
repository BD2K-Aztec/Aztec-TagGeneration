genome_analysis breakpointer using local mapping artifacts to support sequence breakpoint discovery from single_end we developed breakpointer a fast algorithm to locate breakpoints of structural_variants svs from single_end produced by next_generation by taking_advantage of local non uniform read_distribution and misalignments created by svs breakpointer scans the alignment of single_end to identify regions containing potential breakpoints the detection of such breakpoints can indicate insertions longer than the read_length and svs located in repetitve regions which might be missd by other methods thus breakpointer complements existing_methods to locate svs from single_end availability https github com ruping breakpointeridentifying structural_variants svs from short_sequencing remains_challenging existing next_generation ngs based_methods for sv_detection are primarily based on the analysis of paired_end pe assuming that deviations from the expected mapping distance are caused by svs alternatively to characterize svs from single_end se split_read methods can be adopted to generate pseudo pe however the short_length of the artificial pe limits the mappability and the size of detectable insertions up to medium_size alternative se based_methods are needed to facilitate the discovery of breakpoints of longer insertions and svs located in repetitive_regions svs usually cause specific mapping artifacts in the vicinity of the sv boundaries reads slightly crossing the breakpoint of an sv can be mapped only if they contain a few bases of the variant depending on the allowed edit_distance this case usually leads to consistent misalignments next to the breakpoint such misalignments have already been used to clean snp calls or to determine the regions for local realignment in contrast reads spanning the breakpoint will be unmappable consequently on the left or right side of the sv boundary fewer read_alignments will start or end respectively and supplementary our tool breakpointer locates sv breakpoints by analyzing both to whom correspondence should be addressed misalignment artifacts and local non uniform read_distribution created by svs
