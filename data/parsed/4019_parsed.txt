sequence_analysis risearch fast rna rna interaction search using a simplified nearest_neighbor energy_model motivation regulatory non_coding often function by forming a duplex with other rnas it is therefore of interest to predict putative rnarna duplexes in silico on a genome_wide scale current computational_methods for predicting these interactions range from fast complementary based searches to those that take intramolecular binding into account together these methods constitute a trade_off between speed and accuracy while leaving room for improvement within the context of genome_wide screens a fast pre filtering of pu tative duplexes would therefore be desirable results we present risearch an implementation of a simplified turner energy_model for fast computation of hybridization which significantly_reduces runtime while maintaining accuracy its time complexity for sequences of lengths m and n is om n with a much smaller pre factor than other tools we show that this energy_model is an accurate approximation of the full energy_model for near complementary rnarna duplexes risearch uses a smith_waterman like algorithm using a dinucleotide scoring_matrix which approximates the turner nearest_neighbor energies we show in benchmarks that we achieve a speed improvement of at least compared with rnaplex the currently fastest method for searching near complementary regions risearch shows a prediction_accuracy similar to rnaplex on two datasets of known bacterial short_rna srna messenger_rna mrna and eukaryotic microrna mirna mrna interactions using risearch as a pre filter in genome_wide screens reduces the number of binding_site candidates reported by mirna_target programs such as targetscans and miranda by up to likewise substantial filtering was performed on bacterial rnarna_interaction data non coding rna ncrna form an abundant class of genes involved in both regulation and housekeeping functions often in complexes with proteins and or through interactions with other rnas the potential for ncrnas is becoming apparent e g in the mammalian_genome where the protein_coding account for international human_genome while the majority of the genome is transcribed even in smaller genomes such as fungi strains of aspergillus only of the genome_encodes proteins leaving plenty of room for ncrnas which could hold the potential for improvements to microbial industrial_production such as has already been investigated in streptomyces d also in mammalian production_systems such as chinese_hamster cell_lines ncrnas receive increasing attention computational screens for structured rnas result in thousands of candidates on a genome_wide scale and it is of interest to predict possible rna interaction_partners of these sequences these candidates are predicted from sequence and structure based alignments by using a combination of thermodynamic and evolutionary_constraints such as compensating base_pair changes a principal problem however is to obtain experimental_data for each of these candidates such as the full_length rna_sequence and its function another factor is that many ncrnas are expressed at extremely_low levels for example the regulatory antisense_rna of the gal operon in yeast is functional and expressed as one copy per cells coping with such low expressed ncrnas on a high_throughput experimental scale is still an intractable task one approach toward functional analysis of ncrna candidates is to search for possible interactions with other rnas as a substantial class of ncrnas function by duplex formation with other rnas of which micrornas mirnas are a popular example however not only small ncrnas interact by base_pairing but also long ncrnas for example staufen mediated messenger_rna decay smd can be initiated by imperfect base_pairing between alu_elements in a lncrna and in the utr of an smd target translational regulation by short rnas srnas is also a common mechanism existing in bacteria a well known example is the micc ompc messenger_rna mrna interaction causing translational_repression to whom correspondence should be addressed the author s published_by this is an open_access the terms of

method to search for near complementary base_pairing in genomic_sequence by using a simplified energy_model in a runtime benchmark we show that risearch is at a minimum a factor of faster than rnaplex the currently fastest method for predicting near complementary duplexes and also has a lower memory_consumption remarkably our simplified model gives good energy estimates for complementary duplexes interspersed with small bulges and interior loops even though risearch systematically computes an energy differing by a small factor compared with the full turner energy_model the reported energies strongly correlate r with the energies computed by the full model in duplexfold when ranking random duplexes by their predicted energies risearch shows on average an overlap of with duplexfold and rnaplex within the highest ranking duplexes in our evaluation of prediction_accuracy on the srna mrna and mirnamrna datasets we show that risearch achieves a similar or better sensitivity and precision for predicted base_pairs as other compared methods however considering the accessibility of binding_sites with rnaplex can increase the recovery_rate of the verified srnamrna interactions other approaches such as intarna and rnaup also account for accessibility by computing intramolecular base_pair probabilities in both sequences this however comes at the expense of runtime in contrast the objective of risearch is the fast search for potential rnarna duplexes one application is pre filtering in genome_wide screens when risearch is used as a pre filter for specialized mirna_target predictors such as miranda and targetscans the number of target_site candidates can be significantly_reduced which in turn results in a better precision of the mirna_target problems with developing methods that should be applied on a genome_wide scale include reliable testing we face a lack of experimentally_verified interactions for many mirnas for example target_genes have been identified but the actual binding_site positions within their utr are unknown even for known target_sites the extent of the interactions is not clear for examples of bacterial srna target_sites see even though we could benchmark on a limited dataset benchmarking the accuracy of genome_wide searches for rnarna_interactions is currently hard given the limited amount of known interactions in particular it is not possible to reliably calculate the false_discovery unless follow_up experiments are carried_out another factor is the estimation of p values which requires a background model for rnarna_interaction to distinguish true_positives from random hits this however depends on incorporating reliable shuffling schemes e g based on dinucleotide composition similar to those for de_novo prediction of ncrna
