genome_analysis genome measures used for quality_control are dependent on gene function and ancestry motivation the transition transversion ti_tv and heterozygous nonreference homozygous het_nonref have been commonly computed in genetic_studies as a quality_control qc measurement additionally these two ratios are helpful in our understanding of the patterns of dna sequence_evolution results to thoroughly understand these two genomic measures we performed a study using genomes_project g released genotype data n an additional two datasets n and n were used to validate our findings from the g dataset we compared the two ratios among continental ancestry genome_regions and gene functionality we found that the ti_tv can be used as a quality_indicator for single_nucleotide inferred from high_throughput sequencing_data the ti_tv varies_greatly by genome region and functionality but not by ancestry the het_nonref varies_greatly by ancestry but not by genome_regions and functionality furthermore extreme guanine cytosine content either high or low is negatively associated with the ti_tv magnitude thus when performing qc assessment using these two measures care must be taken to apply the correct thresholds based on ancestry and genome region failure to take these considerations into account at the qc stage will bias any following analysis the maturity of high_throughput has greatly_enhanced our ability to study the human_genome the rise of high_throughput also raises various bioinformatics challenges one such challenge lies with the quality_control qc of the sequencing_data as high_throughput becomes more commonly used qc measures become more automatic and less obvious to the researcher this is particularly dangerous if these qc measures introduce biases into the sequencing_data that are not clear to the researcher using the data adenine a and guanine g are two ring purine based nucleotides and cytosine c and thymine t are one ring pyrimidine derived nucleotides in substitution mutations transitions are defined as the interchange of the purine based a g or pryimidine based c t transversions are defined as the interchange between two ring purine nucleobases and one ring pyrimidine bases the possible transversions are a c a t c g g t if substitution mutations occur randomly then the ti_tv the number of transition single_nucleotide snps divided by the number of transversionaveraged over a large enough number of substations should be because there are two possible transitions and four possible transversions however a transversion is considered to be a more drastic change than a transition because substitution of one ring to two ring chemical_structure or vice_versa transversions requires more energy than substitution without change in the ring_structure transitions thus in real sequencing_data the transition and transversion ratio is often greater than the ti_tv has been used as an important parameter in many studies such as phylogenetic_tree and estimation of divergence recently the transition tranversion ratio has also been used as a qc parameter in high_throughput studies for human exome_sequencing the ti_tv is generally around and about outside of exome regions the ti_tv is also different between synonymous and non synonymous snps the ti_tv for the haploid chromosomes x in males y mitochondria is different compared to the diploid chromosomes chromosomes much stronger bias toward transitions over transversions ti tv is between and in mitochondria has been observed in multiple studies it has been suggested to consider haploid and diploid chromosomes separately when computing ti_tv another useful ratio to compute for genetic_studies is the heterozygosity to non reference homozygosity ratio het nonrefhom there are three possible genotypes for a given diploid genomic_position aa ab and bb if a represents the reference then the het_nonref of a person is computed as the number of snps with ab genotype dived by the number of snp with bb genotype mathematically the assumptions of hardy_weinberg applied over a large set of multiple_snps in one individual instead of one snp in a large number of multiple_individuals as is the standard case for hardyweinberg equilibrium qc tests results in a het_nonref of thus for whole_genome the het_nonref can be used also as a qc parameter to whom correspondence should be addressed in this study we have performed in depth analyses of the ti tv and het_nonref to determine the range of variability in these measures we focused our analyses on three major aspects of these measures i genomic_region defined as exon intron intergenic micro_rna mirna and non coding rna lncrna ii snp type synonymous or non synonymous iii subject continental ancestry european asian african and american furthermore we also explored the reasons for the measured variations we observed among these three aspects we first compared the ti_tv of the five major regional categories even though the variations of ti_tv were statistically_significantly different due to high sample_size p supplementary there was not a visible substantial variation of the ti_tv among the four ancestry groups for exonic_regions the african group had the highest ti_tv median of and the asian group had the lowest median ti_tv of for intronic_regions all ancestry groups had similar median ti_tv of around the median ti_tv continued to drop to around for intergenic and lncrna regions for all four ancestry groups the median ti_tv for mirna regions are between and among the four ancestry groups higher variations were observed for ti_tv in mirna regions due to fewer snps reside in the short mirna regions based on these results the ti_tv can be used to distinguish between exonic and non exonic_regions and the ti_tv of lncrna behaves similarly to intergenic_regions next we examined the het_nonref of the five major regional categories and found there were no major differences supplementary between the het_nonref among the five regions however the het_nonref is strongly associated with continental ancestry among the four ancestry groups africans had the highest median het_nonref of around and asians had the lowest median het_nonref at the median het nonrefhom ratios for americans and europeans were around and from these results clearly the het_nonref isancestry dependent and the ti_tv is genome region dependent the next step after identifying snps from exome_sequencing involves annotation of the snps to assess their potential functionality for the ti_tv there is a visible difference between synonymous and non synonymous snps and little variation among ancestry groups synonymous snps had a higher ti_tv median ratio around compared with non synonymous snps median ratio around for all four ancestry groups for the het_nonref there was no difference between synonymous and non synonymous snps supplementary observed however the strong variation between ancestry groups was present regardless of how we divided the snps by regions or by functionality the het_nonref patterns across the ancestry groups remained the same because regions with extreme gc_content are rare in the human_genome supplementary to balance the denominator when computing ratios we defined six unequal gc_content bins and to give more gc_content range to regions with extreme high or low gc_content values the gc_content had a clear non linear effect on the ti_tv with high and low gc_content resulting in lower ti_tv a similar pattern has been used to describe the effect of gc_content on illumina sequencing_depth the regions with low gc_content and high_gc had relatively higher variation for het_nonref than exons with moderate gc_content due to fewer snps observed in extreme gc_content regions again the same ancestry variation described previously for the het_nonref was observed the difference of ti_tv observed among regions can be potentially explained by the differences of gc_content among these regions we computed gc_content of the five regions we defined and the results are as follow mirna exome intronic lncrna intergenic the gc_content is directly correlated with ti_tv spearmans correlation_coefficient r using the exome_sequencing from the sbcs study and whole_genome sequencing_data from the colorectal_cancer study we further validated our results because each of the two additional studies only contained a single ancestry group we could not divide the snps further by ancestry groups overall we observed similar results for the two datasets compared to the g dataset supplementary figures s and s for the ti_tv separated by region the exome regions had the highest value followed by intron regions intergenic_regions and lncrna regions had similar values lower than intron or exon regions divided by functionality synonymous snps had much higher ti_tv compared to non synonymous snps t test sbcs p colorectal_cancer p stronger variations of het_nonref among the regions and functionalities were observed in the sbcs dataset due to the limitation of sample_size n in the colorectal dataset it is difficult to draw_conclusions on the variation of the colorectal dataset for het_nonref compared to the g dataset the same conclusion can be reached regarding the gc_content evaluation extreme gc_content tends to produce lower ti_tv and relatively stable het_nonref were observed for regions with gc_content between and extreme gc_content produced a wider_range in het_nonref values finally we repeated our analyses of g dataset by categrizing the snp data by subancestry group supplementaryfigures s s and the results were consistent with combined ancestry group high_throughput allows researchers to examine the human_genome at the single_nucleotide instead of just the subset of previously known snps available on any genotyping array one of the consequences of applying highthroughput sequencing_technology is the ability to detect a much higher number of potential novel snps which are generally undetectable by array technology this advantage of high_throughput also brings the need for highly_efficient and accurate qc for the snps detected the qc of high_throughput sequencing_data has been an important topic in the field of bioinformatics for the last few years within the scope of qc for snps inferred from sequencing_data unlike other qc parameters such as depth genotype quality etc the ti tv and het_nonref cannot be used directly to filter individual snps but rather to measure the overall snp quality for a sequence for example from previous_studies we know that snps in exome regions should have a ti_tv of around the general rule is that a higher ti_tv usually indicates better quality snps as long as the ratio is not too high if we observe a ti_tv substantially lower than the expected value for exome snps we know that usually increasing other qc filters such as depth and genotype quality_score will cause the ti_tv to also increase from our study we conclude that the ti_tv is highly dependent on the genome region and functionality the exome regions tend to have the highest ti_tv for snps followed by intron regions intergenic_regions and lncrna regions have lower and similar ti_tv thus when using ti_tv as a qc measurement it is best to compute the ti_tv by region rather than as a whole the majority of dna highthroughput_sequencing studies focus on non synonymous rather than synonymous snps we found that synonymous snps have substantially_higher ti_tv than non synonymous snps the ti_tv of non synonymous snps is rather similar to the intergenic_regions the high ti_tv of synonymous snps compared to non synonymous snps can be explained through the probability of amino_acid changes using the amino_acid table out of all possible changes within the amino_acid table there are synonymous transition and synonymous transversions random ti_tv compared with non synonymous transition and nonsynonymous transversions random ti_tv thus it is also useful to categorize exome snps by their functionality before computing the ti_tv futhermore we found no association between the ti_tv and ancestry thus highthroughput_sequencing studies on subjects of any ancestry groups can use the reported ti_tv thresholds in this study as a qc guideline the het_nonref is not used as often as the ti_tv for qc because it has been suggested that the het nonrefhom ratio works best with whole_genome sequencing_data and the price of whole_genome remains high per sample through our analyses we found that the het_nonref is not dependent on genomic_regions thus it can be applied to exome regions alone and is also a reasonable qc measure for exome_sequencing the expected value for the het_nonref in a whole_genome snp data has been mathematically proposed to be however our results show the het_nonref is highly dependent on ancestry out of the four major continental ancestries we tested only the african group showed a het_nonref consistent with the expected value of the other three continental ancestry groups american asian and european all had different het_nonref lower than since the hardyweinberg equilibrium assumptions are used to calculate the expected value of perhaps the african samples match the expected value because these assumptions are more accurately achieved in that older_population while they may be violated even subtly in the other three continental populations that have undergone several major bottlenecks through global migrations whatever the cause our data show that it is important to evaluate the het_nonref separately by ancestry group last we studied the effect of the gc_content on both ratios and found that the het_nonref is not affected by gccontent and the ti_tv is negatively associated with both high and low extreme gc_content and thus when performing qc on a smaller region it is beneficial to compute the gc_content of that region and adjust your ti_tv expectation based on the regions gc_content two additional datasets were used to validate the results we found from the g dataset the majority of the results are in agreement among the three datasets with some minor variation among datasets these variations could be caused by the different sequencing_technology used the g dataset was generated using a combination of low pass whole_genome exome_sequencing target_region sequencing and imputation of the other two datasets the sbcs study used exome_sequencing and the colorectal_cancer study used whole_genome and no imputation was performed also the variation could result from sample_size and phenotype differences the g dataset contained significantly more subjects and is a population cohort while the other two datasets contained breast_cancer and colorectal_cancer patients at much smaller_sample nonetheless the two additional datasets provided supporting evidence for the conclusions we have drawn based on the g dataset analyses in conclusion the ti tv and het_nonref can both be used as qc assessment of snps inferred from high_throughput sequencing_data but care must be taken that the subject ancestry and the function of the dna sequenced if not whole_genome are taken into consideration when setting limits for the reasonable values of these ratios the ratio values provided in this study can serve as general_guidelines for future_studies
