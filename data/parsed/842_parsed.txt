genome_analysis cake a bioinformatics pipeline for the integrated analysis of somatic variants in cancer_genomes we have developed cake a bioinformatics software pipeline that integrates four publicly_available somatic variant_calling to identify single_nucleotide with higher sensitivity and accuracy than any one algorithm alone cake can be run on a high performance computer cluster or used as a stand alone application the development of next_generation has made it possible to generate more comprehensive catalogues of somatic alterations in cancer_genomes than ever before software_tools to find these variants deploy different mathematical approaches to interrogate the genome_sequences of tumour germline paired_samples for example the variant detectors bambino and varscan both identify somatic variants by comparing alternative allele_frequencies between tumour and normal sequences varscan uses a fishers_exact and bambino a bayesian scoring model to identify somatic variants in paired_samples other algorithms include caveman and samtools mpileup which compute the genotype likelihood of nucleotide positions in tumour and normal genome_sequences by use of an expectation_maximization method putative raw variant_calls made by these algorithms typically undergo further filtering for example known single_nucleotide snps present in dbsnp or in the genomes_project the genomes_project or sites with low mapping qualities are usually filtered from the final somatic call set validation rates ultimately depend on the stringency of this filtering of putative sites intriguingly applying different variant_calling to the same data often results in a set of only partially_overlapping somatic single_nucleotide snv calls to illustrate this phenomenon we deployed four publicly_available somatic variant_calling bambino caveman samtools mpileup and varscan on a dataset composed of human hepatocellular_carcinoma tumour germline exome pairs because this study reported validated somatic variants identified using the independent casava pipeline we used these data to gauge the performance of each algorithm this analysis revealed at best a overlap between snv calls made by any two of these widely used callers and at worst a overlap supplementary notable however was the fact that the majority of validated calls were identified by two or more algorithms suggesting that a merging approach may improve both the sensitivity and accuracy of somatic variant_calling see the supplementary_material for details in an effort to take advantage of existing software_tools and to improve variant detection we developed cake supplementary cake is a fully configurable bioinformatics pipeline that integrates four single nucleotide somatic variant_calling bambino caveman samtools mpileup and varscan and deploys an extensive collection of fully customizable post_processing filtering steps we show that the performance of cake exceeds any one algorithm for somatic snv detection making it an optimal tool for cancer genome_analysis the performance of each variant_calling algorithm was evaluated by running each one individually using their default_settings and filtering the results using the post_processing filters implemented in cake the results are summarized in
