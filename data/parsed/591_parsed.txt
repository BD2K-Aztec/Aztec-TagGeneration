systems_biology automated analysis of protein subcellular_location in time series images motivation image_analysis machine_learning and statistical_modeling have become well established for the automatic recognition and comparison of the subcellular_locations of proteins in microscope images by using a comprehensive set of features describing static images major subcellular patterns can be distinguished with near perfect accuracy we now extend this work to time series images which contain both spatial and temporal_information the goal is to use temporal_features to improve recognition of protein patterns that are not fully distinguishable by their static features alone results we have adopted and designed five sets of features for capturing temporal_behavior in d time series images based on object_tracking temporal texture normal flow fourier_transforms and autoregression classification_accuracy on an image collection for fluorescently_tagged proteins was increased when temporal_features were used in addition to static features temporal texture normal flow and fourier_transform features were most effective at increasing classification_accuracy we therefore extended these three feature_sets to d time series images but observed no significant_improvement over results for d images the methods for d and d temporal_pattern analysis do not require segmentation of images into single_cell regions and are suitable for automated high_throughput microscopy applications availability images source_code and results will be available upon publication atsubcellular distribution is an important characteristic of a protein because location is intimately_related to its function the most common method used to find a proteins subcellular_location is to fluorescently tag the protein take images by microscopy and then visually analyze the images previous work has shown that automatic image_analysis can outperform visual_examination providing higher to whom correspondence should be addressed sensitivity to subtle differences proteins from major subcellular_locations can be differentiated from each other with over accuracy however previous work has been done using static images and the challenge now is to extend these approaches to time series images that better reflect protein behavior in living_cells one objective is to distinguish proteins that have similar static but different temporal_patterns this is of obvious biological_importance since many proteins change their location over time in order to carry out their functions for example helicases localize to the nucleus during the g phase of the cell_cycle to repair endogenous dna_damage and exit the nucleus during s phase for automated analysis of protein subcellular_locations machine_learning tools for classification and clustering are well established a key_component is feature design good features are numerical representations of the patterns that capture the differences between classes or clusters the goal for temporal_pattern analysis is therefore to design good features from time series images that distinguish different protein movements automated analysis of biological time series images has received significant attention in recent_years but most movies are of low_resolution at the organ or cell level and only a few deal with high_resolution microscopy_images that record protein movement within a single_cell we have carefully_studied applicable theories and algorithms from the computer vision field and adopted designed five sets of temporal_features for application to subcellular pattern analysis for microscopy_images the first and perhaps most straightforward approach to characterizing temporal_behavior is to track individual objects in a cell and calculate features to describe these tracks for example speed the most common numerical description of movement requires measuring the total distance the object travels along its way however some proteins do not form rigid objects and it is therefore unclear what the targets for tracking should be the best example is cytoplasmic proteins even when they show changing fluorescence distributions there is typically no easily characterized movement of objects such complex and nonrigid motion that has statistical regularity was defined as temporal texture in that work the normal flow on each pixel was usedby comparing classification_accuracy using individual feature_sets and combinations of them we achieved two goals evaluating the power of each feature_set and finding the best way of differentiating our proteins of interest three_dimensional time series images are d images feature_sets we have acquired are based on d d static features of first center slice d across z d static features d across time d temporal_features of center slices and d images d temporal_features
