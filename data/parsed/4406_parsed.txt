sequence_analysis star ultrafast universal rna_seq aligner motivation accurate alignment of high_throughput rna_seq is a challenging and yet unsolved_problem because of the non contiguous transcript structure relatively short_read and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing_technologies currently available rna_seq aligners suffer from high mapping error_rates low mapping speed read_length limitation and mapping biases results to align our large billon reads encode transcriptome rna_seq dataset we developed the spliced transcripts alignment to a reference star software based on a previously_undescribed rna_seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum map pable seed search in uncompressed suffix_arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure star outperforms other aligners by a factor of in mapping speed aligning to the human_genome million bp paired_end per hour on a modest core server while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision in addition to unbiased de_novo detection of canonical junctions star can discover non canonical splices and chimeric fusion_transcripts and is also capable of mapping full_length rna_sequences using roche sequencing of reverse transcription poly merase chain reaction amplicons we experimentally_validated novel intergenic splice_junctions with an success_rate corroborating the high_precision of the star mapping strategy availability_and star is implemented as a standa lone c code star is free open_source distributed under gplv_license and can be downloaded fromalthough genomes are composed of linearly ordered sequences of nucleic_acids eukaryotic_cells generally reorganize the information in the transcriptome by splicing together non contiguous exons to create mature transcripts the detection and characterization of these spliced rnas have been a critical focus of functional_analyses of genomes in both the normal and disease cell states recent_advances have made transcriptome analyses at the single nucleotide level almost routine however hundreds of millions of short nt to medium nt length sequences reads generated by such high_throughput sequencing_experiments present_unique to detection and characterization of spliced transcripts two key tasks make these analyses computationally_intensive the first task is an accurate alignment of reads that contain mismatches insertions_and caused by genomic_variations and sequencing_errors the second task involves mapping sequences derived from non contiguous genomic_regions comprising spliced sequence modules that are joined together to form spliced rnas although the first task is shared with dna resequencing efforts the second task is specific and crucial to the rna_seq as it provides the connectivity_information needed to reconstruct the full extent of spliced rna_molecules these alignment challenges are further compounded by the presence of multiple copies of identical or related genomic_sequences that are themselves transcribed making precise mapping difficult various sequence_alignment have been recently_developed to tackle these challenges however application of these algorithms invokes compromises in the areas of mapping accuracy sensitivity and precision and computational_resources run time and disk_space with current_advances in sequencing_technologies the computational component is increasingly becoming a throughput bottleneck high mapping speed is especially important for large consortia efforts such as encode http www genome gov encode which continuously generate large_amounts of sequencing_data furthermore most of the cited algorithms were designed to deal with relatively short_reads typically bases and are ill suited for aligning long_read sequences generated by the emerging third_generation the longer read sequences ideally reaching full lengths of rna_molecules have a great_potential for enhancing transcriptome_studies by providing more complete rna connectivity_information this report describes an alignment algorithm entitled spliced transcripts alignment to a reference star which was designed to specifically address many of the challenges of rna_seq mapping and uses a novel strategy for spliced alignments we performed high_throughput validation experiments that corroborated stars precision for detection of novel splice_junctions stars high mapping speed and accuracy were crucial for analyzing the large encode transcriptome dataset billion illumina_reads we also demonstrated that star has a potential for accurately aligning long several kilobases reads that are emerging from the third_generation to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comdespite several years of ongoing improvements alignment of the non contiguous rna_seq to a reference_genome is not a solved problem yet owing both to its intrinsic complexity and rapid transformations of the sequencing_technologies several critical problems have been found to afflict previously_published approaches such as high mapping error_rate alignment biases low sensitivity for unannotated transcripts poor scalability with the read_length restrictions in the number of junctions mismatches indels per read inability to detect non linear transcripts such as chimeric rnas and crucially low mapping throughput in this work we described star a novel algorithm for aligning high_throughput long and short rna_seq to a reference_genome developed to overcome the aforementioned issues unlike many other rna_seq mappers star is not an extension of a short_read dna mapper but was developed as a stand alone c code star is capable of running parallel threads on multicore systems with close to linear scaling of productivity with the number of cores star is fast on a modern but not overly expensive core server it can align million nt reads per hour to the human_genome surpassing all other existing rna_seq aligners by a factor of at the same time star exhibits better alignment precision and sensitivity than other rna_seq aligners for both experimental and simulated_data one of the main inherent problems of all de_novo rna_seq aligners is the inability to accurately detect splicing_events that involve short nt sequence overhangs on the donor or acceptor sides of a junction this causes a significant underdetection of splicing_events and also increases significantly the misalignment rate as such reads are likely to be mapped with a few mismatches to a similar contiguous genomic_region in addition this effect also biases the alignments toward processed pseudogenes which are abundant in the human_genome similarly to other rna_seq aligners to mitigate this problem star has an option to obtain information about possible splice_junction loci from annotation databases supplementary section it is also possible to run a second mapping pass supplying it with splice_junction loci found in the first mapping pass in this case star will not discover any new junctions but will align spliced reads with short overhangs across the previously detected junctions to demonstrate stars ability to align long_reads we have mapped the long kb human mrna_sequences from genbank see supplementary section for details the accuracy of star alignments is similar or higher than that of blat a popular est mrna aligner at the same time star outperforms blat by more than two orders_of in the alignment speed which is important for high_throughput sequencing_applications the algorithm extensibility to long_reads shows that star has a potential to serve as a universal alignment_tool across a broad_spectrum of emerging sequencing_platforms star can align_reads in a continuous streaming mode which makes it compatible with novel sequencing_technologies such as the one recently announced by oxford nanopore technologies as the sequencing_technologies and protocols evolve new mapping strategies will have to be developed and star core algorithm can provide a flexible framework to address arising alignment challenges
