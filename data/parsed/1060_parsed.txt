comparative_analyses of population scale phenomic data in electronic_medical reveal race specific disease networks motivation underrepresentation of racial_groups represents an important challenge and major gap in phenomics research most of the current human phenomics research is based primarily on european_populations hence it is an important challenge to expand it to consider other population groups one approach is to utilize data from emr databases that contain patient data from diverse demographics and ancestries the implications of this racial underrepresentation of data can be profound regarding effects on the healthcare_delivery and actionability to the best of our knowledge our work is the first attempt to perform comparative population scale analyses of disease networks across three different populations namely caucasian ea african_american aa and hispanic latino hl results we compared susceptibility profiles and temporal connectivity patterns for diseases and disease pairs represented in a clinical population of patients accordingly we revealed appreciable_differences in disease_susceptibility temporal_patterns network_structure and underlying_disease connections between ea aa and hl populations we found significantly comorbid_diseases for the ea cohort for aa and for hl we further outlined key disease pair associations unique to each population as well as categorical enrichments of these pairs finally we identified key hub diseases that are the focal points in the race centric networks and of particular clinical importance incorporating race specific disease comorbidity patterns will produce a more accurate and complete picture of the disease landscape overall and could support more precise understanding of disease relationships and patient management towards improved clinical_outcomes contacts design comparison and analytics of disease networks can inform epidemiology and disease biology comparative network_analyses and network_inference have helped in understanding the relative_risk of various diseases and characterize their shared disease architectures global disease network_analyses utilizing biological_databases and patient data from electronic_medical emr have emerged as a powerful modality for understanding the complexity of disease relationships incorporating findings from disease networks has been used to inform disease repurposing develop therapeutics and improve patient_safety phenomics aim to map and understand the system of phenotypes and their interactions where in clinical studies a phenotype can include a trait e g height lab test e g cholesterol_levels or disease e g rheumatoid_arthritis the catalog of phenome wide associations which evaluate phenomic correlations of genotypes is rapidly_growing and currently being leveraged for drug_development and drug_repositioning we recently used emr wide phenomic information to identify shared_genetic architectures of various diseases sub types of type_diabetes drug_repurposing for various indications disease_progression patterns through data stream visualization disease risk estimations and genomics informed personalized_therapy similar to the current situation in genomics research racial_groups and related factors remain understudied in phenomics most of the current human phenomics research is based primarily on populations of european background thus compiling and analyzing data from emr databases that contains patient data from diverse demographics and racial_groups remains a priority it is clear that racial background represents an overt source of variability in disease risk and mortality traditionally clinicians are required to bridge the inferential gap or make clinical_decisions for one racial_group based on data from another due to lack of knowledge accordingly the implications of this racial underrepresentation of data can be profound with regard to healthcare_delivery and actionability for example a previous study found that african_american were twice as likely and hispanic_women were as likely to be readmitted to the hospital within days of vaginal or cesarean_delivery even when controlling for socioeconomic_status systematic analysis of phenomic data represented in a racially and demographically diverse patient population could reveal precise patterns and further understanding of disease relationships risk and comorbidity previous_studies put forth several approaches for the phenomic study of clinical_populations utilized data from the centers_for cms databases multiple hospitals across the united_states and the population registry of denmark n million to discover comorbidity patterns across complex and mendelian_diseases this work however was mainly focused comparing certain types of diseases i e mendelian and complex_diseases and did not fully investigate the disease space created a more expansive phenotype disease network cms data n million that incorporated demographic_factors such as sex and race into the analytics the authors revealed disparate disease patterns and network_connectivity that was due to race but only between caucasian and african_american populations extended the field of disease network research by using timescale data to define temporal disease trajectories in a danish clinical cohort n million the researchers were successfully able to identify clusters of diseases that consistently manifested in particular order i e disease trajectories these trajectories however were built specifically on european_population data and may not extend to other racial_groups these studies while powerful and pioneering did not sufficiently address the issue of racial diversity in their disease networks partially due to limitations of their datasets as such a particular concern is a lack of representation of mexican_americans and other hispanic americans in healthcare analytics l opez as indicated by hidalgo et_al there is a significant disparity in network_structure between racial populations however prior phenomic studies have not evaluated racially_diverse populations in depth in the current study we propose to combine many of the powerful approaches developed in the previous_studies and leverage a racially_diverse hospital population to compare disease network_structure and connectivity between caucasian african_american latino populations to the best of our knowledge our work is the first attempt to perform comparative population scale analyses of disease networks across three different populations within the same hospital cohort for the current study we calculated disease connectivity patterns for a diseases in a large ethnically_diverse emr cohort with well represented populations and compared across race specific networks the results from the current study provide illustrative_examples of the extent disease_susceptibility and connectivity patterns differ between race cohorts formalizing the need for race specific risk_assessment overall the cross race individual disease profiles are consistent with known data and expectations which is important for implications that can inform follow_up studies more importantly our results are in line with findings from related studies in particular our findings for the disease temporal patters in the ea cohort are consistent with the disease trajectories identified by direct comparison of results between our study and theirs is difficult however namely due to use of non identical statistical methodologies and ontological disease mappings icd versus icd regardless several similarities are apparent firstly the raw number of disease pairs with significant temporal directionality is consistent between the two studies there were disease pairs with significant temporal directionality in their study and in ours the small difference of which can partially be explained by sample_size discrepancies furthermore the authors identified related clusters of trajectories that are akin to hubs of the current study while there are discrepancies many focal disease points overlap type_diabetes t d for instance was involved in many trajectories in their study and was a central hub in our ea cohort with bonferroni_corrected sequellae outcome diseases in the jensen et_al t d network included retinal disorder which corresponds to many target diseases found in ours including dry_eye retinal drusen peripheral retinal_degeneration and retinal edema chronic_renal and unspecified renal_failure were also outcome diseases which overlap with target diseases such as impaired_renal disease benign hypertensive renal_disease and secondary_hyperparathyroidism of renal origin found in our network chronic_obstructive another cluster disease was found to have similar temporal_patterns as well including angina as a predictor disease angina_pectoris in our results and unspecified chronic_bronchitis as an outcome disease bronchitis in ours comparing our results to those of the hidalgo et_al study using network approaches to study human phenotype serves as a source to validate our aa and ea networks in their study they found certain disease combinations that were differentially comorbid in black aa and white ea populations many of which are validated in our findings they demonstrate that heart_diseases including mitral_valve disorders and mitral and aortic_valve were more comorbid in white males than black males similarly we found both aortic_valve and mitral_valve to be hubs in only the ea network interestingly they show that other peripheral_vascular was connected to diseases across networks for both races and we also identified that the same disease is a hub for both these populations hidalgo et_al further demonstrate that diabetes and hypertension were more comorbid in black males than white males while in our study both diseases were found to be hubs for both ea and aa networks they were more highly_connected diabetes_mellitus connections for ea versus for aa andfor each population we determined which temporally_related disease pairs had bonferroni_corrected significant connectivity p we present particular disease pairs of interest from among the top associations for each population ranked by effect_size effect_size or b can be interpreted as the odds_ratio of disease occurring given disease holding age_and constant population scale phenomic data in electronic_medical i hypertension connections for ea versus for aa in our aa cohort than the ea network respiratory abnormality was also more comorbid for black males in their study which can be seen as corresponding to asthma related disorder categorical enrichments in our identified aa hubs taken together the concordance of results between these two studies and ours is extremely encouraging and provides support for the methodologies employed in the current paper and the ensuing hl cohort network discovery
