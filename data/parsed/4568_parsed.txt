data_and the application of a novel 'rising activity multi level mixed effects indicator emphasis' rammie method for syndromic surveillance in england motivation syndromic surveillance is the real_time collection and interpretation of data to allow the early identification of public_health and their impact enabling public_health action the rising activity multi level mixed effects indicator emphasis method was developed to provide a single robust method enabling detection of unusual activity across a wide_range of syndromes nationally and locally results the method is shown here to have a high_sensitivity compared to previous methods whilst halving the time taken to detect increased activity to days availability_and the method has been applied successfully to syndromic surveillance_systems in england providing realistic models for baseline activity and utilizing prioritization rules to ensure a manageable number of alarms each day syndromic surveillance is the near real_time collection and interpretation of data to allow the early identification of potential public_health and their impact enabling public_health action syndromic surveillance fulfils part of public_health englands phe role to give early_warning of potential threats to public_health due to infectious_disease and to quantify any impact or reassure about the absence of impact on public_health during mass gathering or following major_environmental incidents within phe syndromic surveillance is co_ordinated by the realtime syndromic surveillance team resst resst monitors general_practitioner gp consultations using an in hours syndromic system gpihss currently covering about of the registered gp patient population in england and a gp out of hours and unscheduled care system gpoohss covering about of the provision in england gpihss replaced a previous weekly system hpa qsurveillance in april a sentinel emergency_department system edsss captures attendance data from sites in england and northern_ireland the nhs syndromic system analyses all calls to the national telephone health_service and replaced the existing nhs direct syndromic system in september data are anonymized and then aggregated from diagnostic symptom codes using code lists created by experienced epidemiologists for most systems the vast_majority over of patient_consultations receive a useable diagnostic code however coding rates can be very low less than for a few gpoohss providers used to capture activity associated with one or more illnesses of public_health e g acute_respiratory severe_asthma gastroenteritis impact of cold_weather bullet baselinethe expected activity estimated using statistical_methods for each signal bullet thresholdslimits estimated using statistical_methods with a known probability that a daily signal be within the thresholds bullet alarman indication that a signals value on one particular day exceeds its upper threshold e g gp in hours asthma attendances for birmingham have a baseline of and an upper_limit of signal was hence alarm each indicator has national regional and local signals regional signals use the boundaries of the phe centres local signals use the english upper tier local authority boundaries except for edsss which is a sentinel system and thus uses the sentinel emergency_department sites the combination of syndromes and locations means that there are over signals to be reviewed daily by the team a wide_range of statistical_techniques are used internationally for syndromic surveillance d previously a number of different statistical_methods were used by resst the nhs direct syndromic surveillance system used a regression_model utilizing the historical_data dating back to january hpa qsurveillance used a standardized_incidence that compared sub national with national incidence_rates the edsss and gpooh systems introduced prior to the olympics used control chart methods the rising activity multi level mixed effects indicator emphasis rammie method was developed to provide a single robust method for all systems including any future new data_sources having a single method improves interpretation of signals with rammie designed to combine the strengths of the existing_methods the rammie method incorporates the benefits of two types of previously used methods using historical_data and regression_models to identify whether activity is unusual for the time of year and a control chart type approach to identify significant recent rises in activity the combination of these two types of alarm historical and spike for each signal gives more information to interpret potential public_health in application the rammie method needed to be robust and computationally fast able to review over signals daily and cope with the following data quality_issues bullet the scale of signal counts varies_greatly a national signal may have tens_of of counts per day whilst many local signals for less common indicators like meningitis will most days have a zero count bullet many syndromic indicators e g influenza_like have a strong seasonal_pattern but peaks can vary unpredictably year on year bullet the volume of people accessing health_care varies_greatly by day of the week due to the closure of gp in hours surgeries during weekends and bank holidays bullet syndromic systems use data that are collected for other purposes and are subject to unforeseen changes in the relevant health_care system which can affect the volume of data or the coding many syndromic systems grow over time e g as new emergency_department sites are added bullet syndromic surveillance is required to identify a wide_range of unforeseen events varying from gradual changes in disease_incidence e g national pertussis outbreak in england during www hpa org uk newscentre that may last over a year to oneday spikes in syndromes caused by e g air_pollution whilst primarily concerned with events of a national importance it is necessary to identify regional differences during an outbreak and increasingly help is sought in identifying the impact of regional or local incidents e g flooding this paper_outlines how the rammie method has been developed and applied as a robust method for analysing and interpreting syndromic surveillance data across a range of data_sources and describing initial validation work the formula for the three level models was expressed algebraically as follows logl ijk logtotal ijk b b x ijk u k v jk for phe centre k location local authority or emergency_department site j on day i total is the offset as described above and b x ijk represents a vector for all the independent_variables and their coefficients u k represents the phe centre level specific random effect and v jk represents the specific random error for each local_area within a phe centre coverage varied by signal and where data were very sparse models failed to converge a pragmatic_approach was applied signals were only included where they had at least days of non zero counts therefore some indicators were only modelled at a national or regional_level all modelling and analysis described below was carried_out using stata version statacorp lp in the seven months from september to march the rammie method was used over million times to assess signals creating nearly prioritized alarms by april nearly different signals were being assessed each weekday generating on average alarms a day in october the rammie method was applied to the new remote advice service nhs incorporating local signals for the first time to telephone call data in england the alarms were used to supplement the interpretation of surveillance data published in weekly syndromic surveillance reports to highlight trends and any findings of public_health rammie alarms have highlighted a number of increases in activity that have led to alerting a potential public health_impact to colleagues within phe including bullet a rise in asthma indicators in september bullet increases in respiratory indicators at the beginning of april that coincided with national reports of poor air_quality associated with pollution and dust from the sahara
