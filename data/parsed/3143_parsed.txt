systems_biology multifunctional proteins revealed by overlapping clustering in protein_interaction motivation multifunctional proteins perform several functions they are expected to interact specifically with distinct sets of partners simultaneously or not depending on the function performed current graph clustering_methods usually allow a protein to belong to only one cluster therefore impeding a realistic assignment of multifunctional proteins to clusters results here we present overlapping cluster generator ocg a novel clustering method which decomposes a network into overlapping clusters and which is therefore capable of correct assignment of multifunctional proteins the principle of ocg is to cover the graph with initial overlapping classes that are iteratively fused into a hierarchy according to an extension of newmans modularity function by applying ocg to a human proteinprotein_interaction we show that multifunctional proteins are revealed at the intersection of clusters and demonstrate that the method outperforms other existing_methods on simulated graphs and ppi_networks availability this software can be downloaded fromprotein protein interaction ppi_networks highlight the modularity of cellular_processes and allow deciphering protein functions at the cellular_level since ppi_networks can be represented as simple graphs where a vertex corresponds to a protein and an edge to a direct_physical graph partitioning methods have been proposed to highlight groups of densely_connected vertices or aittokallio and schwikowski for a review identified clusters are usually designated as functional_modules i e groups of proteins involved in the same pathway or the same cellular_process although successful in predicting the function of uncharacterized_proteins these methods lead to strict partitions in which each vertex protein belongs to exactly one cluster functional module clearly the logic of strict partitions does not always represent the biological reality for instance some proteins perform different cellular_functions and consequently contribute to pleiotropic phenotypes when mutated such multifunctional proteins are expected to specifically interact with distinct sets of partners either simultaneously or not depending on the function performed strict partitions however do not allow a protein to belong to several clusters another limitation is encountered with protein_complexes whose composition and function may vary according to the context and conditions addressing some biological_questions therefore requires methods leading to overlapping clusters that allow vertices to be multi clustered overlapping clustering first appeared three decades_ago with theoretical_studies on distance analyses or for an extensive review these methods have not been intensively developed and consequently have not been as successful as hierarchical and partitioning methods with respect to biological_networks although the overlapping nature of biological communities has been recognized only few methods leading to overlapping clusters have been proposed none of these methods however has been extensively used to answer biological_questions cfinder contributed to the identification of protein_complexes from ap ms data and link communities helped predict a set of prostate cancer_genes in this work we present ocg overlapping cluster generator a novel method to cover a ppi_network with relevant overlapping clusters by applying our method to the human ppi_network we show that multifunctional proteins are revealed at the intersection of clusters finally we show that our method outperforms other existing_methods both on simulated graphs and on ppi_networks graph partitioning can lead to ambiguous results where a node is assigned to one particular cluster but could just as well have been assigned to another this situation is often due to the structure of the graph under study and is particularly encountered during analyses of ppi_networks indeed although the modularity of these networks allowed identifying clusters of proteins acting together in particular biological_processes using appropriate graph partitioning the uniqueness of node classification impedes revealing the involvement of some proteins in multiple processes the reality of ppi_networks therefore is more accurately described by allowing modules clusters to overlap to deal with this dual nature of ppi graphs both modular and overlapping we have developed the ocg algorithm described herein a method to cover graphs with overlapping clusters based on the optimization of the modularity we propose covering the graph with centred cliques that we iteratively fuse this initial class system outperforms the recently_developed link communities algorithm which aims at capturing the overlapping structure of the graph by grouping similar edges into a hierarchy ocg therefore appears better at grasping the overlapping nature of graphs with low_density of edges such as ppi_networks currently available ppi_networks represent only a subset of all ppis in a given cell therefore the topological_structure of the entire interactome is still unknown and under debate a direct consequence of this uncertainty is the lack of real partitions against which we could test the efficacy of our methods therefore simulations have been performed using several models of random_graphs in this context we chose to i design a graph with overlapping communities to be recovered ii build simulated graphs corresponding to this system according to three different models and iii apply the methods mentioned here on each of the simulated graphs this approach allowed us to test the performance of each method on a difficult problem in which each cluster to be found shares nodes with two other clusters since the simulated graphs with overlapping communities might not faithfully reflect the biological reality i e proteins may be involved in more than two processes we verified that multiclustered nodes in simulated and biological graphs have similar characteristics indeed multiclustered nodes have higher average degree and betweenness than monoclustered in both types of graphs data not shown when ocg is used to cluster a ppi_network multifunctional proteins are identified at the intersections of the overlapping clusters interestingly the top most multiclustered proteins are important transcriptional_regulators and signaling proteins which are integral parts of most cellular_processes this emphasizes the fact that functional_modules can be interconnected through the regulators they share it therefore appears that ocg could represent a valuable_tool to investigate cross_talk between processes
