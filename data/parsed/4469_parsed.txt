super focus a tool for agile functional analysis of shotgun metagenomic_data analyzing the functional profile of a microbial_community from unannotated shotgun sequencing_reads is one of the important goals in metagenomics functional profiling has valuable applications in biological_research because it identifies the abundances of the functional_genes of the organisms present in the original_sample answering the question what they can do currently available tools do not scale well with increasing data_volumes which is important because both the number and lengths of the reads produced by sequencing_platforms keep increasing here we introduce super focus subsystems profile by database reduction using focus an agile hom ology based_approach using a reduced reference_database to report the subsystems present in metagenomic_datasets and profile their abundances super focus was tested with over real metagenomes the results showing that it accurately_predicts the subsystems present in the profiled microbial_communities and is up to times_faster than other tools availability_and super focus was implemented in python and its source_code and the tool website are freely_available at https edwards sdsu edu superfocus contact prokaryotes and the viruses that infect them are the most abundant organisms on earth and it is important to understand both who they are and what they are doing in many environments the majority of the microbes cannot be cultured by using standard laboratory_techniques and metagenomics is the preferred way to study them as a whole community next_generation ngs_technologies have sped up the sequencing_process reduced the cost increased the sampling resolution and opened new horizons in the biological_sciences understanding microbial_communities is important in many areas of biology for example metagenomes can distinguish taxonomic and functional signatures of microbes associated with humans sponges red seaweed and diseased and healthy states of corals
