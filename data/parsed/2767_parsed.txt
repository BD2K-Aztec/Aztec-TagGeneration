genome_analysis m d a kernel_based test for spatially_correlated changes in methylation profiles motivation dna_methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark implicated in many biological_processes of direct clinical_relevance although sequencing based_technologies are increasingly allowing high_resolution measurements of dna_methylation statistical modelling of such data is still challenging in particular statistical identification of differentially_methylated across different conditions poses unresolved challenges in accounting for spatial correlations within the statistical_testing procedure results we propose a non parametric kernel_based method m d to detect higher_order changes in methylation profiles such as shape across pre defined regions the test_statistic explicitly accounts for differences in coverage levels between samples thus handling in a principled way a major confounder in the analysis of methylation data empirical tests on real and simulated_data show an increased power compared to established methods as well as considerable robust ness with respect to coverage and replication levels availability_and r bioconductordna methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with many fundamental biological_processes of direct clinical_relevance such as imprinting retrotransposon silencing and cell_differentiation methylation occurs when a methyl_group is attached to a cytosine in mammals methylation is observed predominantly in the cpg context and consequently studies tend to focus on these loci the canonical understanding is that methylation of cpg regions in promoter_regions cgis is associated with gene_silencing however recent_studies that cpg_methylation correlates with gene_expression in a more complex and context dependent_manner methylation profiles are altered in many diseases most notably cancer and as such epigenetic therapies are being developed which specifically target methylation bisulfite_treatment of dna followed by next_generation provides quantitative methylation data with base_pair resolution unmethylated_cytosines are deaminated into uracils which amplify as thymines during pcr reads are then aligned to a reference_genome permitting changes of c to t the resulting counts of cytosine and thymine at registered cytosine loci form the basis of further analysis this general procedure has been adapted in various ways with reduced_representation rrbs being one of the most widely used rrbs involves using a restriction_enzyme such as mspi or taqi to cleave the dna at ccgg or tcga loci and selecting short_reads for sequencing this results in greater coverage of cpg dense regions at lower cost several methods have been proposed to statistically test for differentially_methylated region dmrs almost all these methods perform a search for dmrs by testing individual cytosines followed by v c the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work bsmooth one of the most widely used methods performs local likelihood smoothing to generate methylation profiles for each sample before testing individual locations in the profiles to identify dmcs more recent methods such as biseq and methylsig also employ local smoothing together with a beta_binomial model of methylation at individual cytosines both of these methods then aggregate the results of tests at individual_loci to compute a measure of significance for dmrs the beta_binomial method models biological_variability at each cytosine location and hence requires a high replication level to achieve power coverage can also be problematic as low coverage precludes statistical_significance and high coverage can lead to over confidence in calling dmrs although the latter effect can be ameliorated by having a larger number of replicates for instance methylsig requires a minimum of three replicates per group and ignores loci which are covered by fewer than reads by default a recent method magi takes a different approach by testing directly for dmrs rather than computing regionwide measures of significance from tests of individual cytosines magi assumes the availability of genome_wide decision boundary methylation_levels which can be determined either from annotation or in a data_driven fashion methylation_levels at each cytosine are then given a binary representation based on whether they exceed the decision boundary and a single fet is performed over each region by counting how many cytosines have changed state although these methods can be highly_effective no current method explicitly accounts for spatial covariation magi implicitly assumes spatial homogeneity across a region dna methylation_levels are often strongly spatially_correlated accounting for such correlations in a testing procedure could then lead to considerable increases in statistical_power some examples of spatially_correlated changes in the encode data analysed in section are shown_inand supplementary notice that in all these examples the change at individual cytosines is modest and hence these regions would not be called as dmrs by currently existing_methods we remark that although local smoothing methods like bsmooth attempt to capture spatial_coherence the local coherence is not an integral part of the testing procedure smoothing in this setting serves the dual purposes of filtering noise and highlighting large_scale changes in the methylation profile moreover the shape of the methylation profile has been suggested as an important factor in predicting gene_expression leading to a potentially functional role for methylation patterns to our knowledge there are no methods that test higher_order properties such as shape of the methylation profiles over a region here we present maximum mean methylation discrepancy m d a non parametric statistical_test for identifying dmrs from pre defined regions explicitly accounting for shape changes in methylation profiles our method is based on the maximum mean discrepancy mmd a recent technique from the machine_learning literature which tests whether two samples have been generated from the same probability_distribution similar non parametric tests have already been applied to chip_seq and rna_seq our contribution is to adapt the method for the specific challenges of bisulfite sequencing_data introducing an explicit control for confounding changes in coverage levels our method is used to test for changes in methylation profiles across regions as opposed to individual cytosines and we call as dmrs those regions whose variation cannot be explained by inter replicate variability we demonstrate the performance of m d against existing_methods on real and simulated_data showing a considerable increase in power and improved robustness against reduced replication and coverage levels we proposed the first kernel_based test for dmrs which exploits higher_order spatial features of methylation profiles empirical comparisons on simulated_and show a considerable increase in statistical_power in comparison with the widely used bsmooth method as well as considerable robustness to low coverage and low replication the m d method also outperforms magi in our simulations as well as calling more dmrs in the real_dataset though this comes at a computational_cost the increased power of the m d approach is due to a number of factors firstly the method is sensitive to spatially_correlated changes in methylation profiles methylation profiles are known to be highly spatially_correlated in general and the results of our experiments imply that spatial_correlation is also a feature of differences in methylation profiles between conditions at least in the datasets considered secondly the method explicitly accounts for differences in the coverage profiles between conditions a confounding_factor for other methods as demonstrated in thirdly the method models inter replicate variability on a regional basis along the whole_genome each regional cross group methylation change is compared with this distribution and test_statistics for each region represent how well the change in methylation profiles can be explained by inter replicate variability at present other methods that consider inter replicate variability do so on a cpg_site by site basis which lacks power with low replication and coverage and does not consider regional spatial changes when testing the method with different strengths of methylation change at cpg loci we saw a sharp_decrease in the number of regions being called as the methylation profile change over the regions became comparable to inter replicate variability other methods experienced a less pronounced change in this regard other studies have suggested that changes in shape of methylation profiles are important in predicting gene_expression to test whether our method is able to capture functionally_important changes in methylation profiles we performed gene_expression analysis with human data and showed a link between methylation changes called by the m d method and gene_expression changes between conditions further the results support the hypothesis that gene_expression is more closely_linked to methylation in the first exon of a gene than to methylation in promoter_regions go analysis of first exon and whole gene methylation changes both revealed links to cell function despite none of the exons overlapping the gene regions a result that was not apparent for promoter_methylation changes although our findings confirm a potential role for methylation profile shape as a predictor of gene_expression they do not provide biological_mechanisms for linking methylation shape to gene_expression and regulation although sequence_variants and protein binding have been shown to be predictive of epigenetic variability we believe that further investigation of the mechanistic underpinnings of changes in methylation shape could be a valuable direction for research the m d method provides a considerable increase in power over existing_methods yet it comes at the cost of computational intensity in this study we have restricted comparisons to datasets of low replication as beta_binomial methods should prove_effective with higher replication we have also focused on sub megabase scale changes for two reasons firstly such an analysis is likely to be exploratory in the sense that testing regions are not pre defined a key venn_diagram of calls with reduced coverage three hundred eightytwo calls are consistent at all coverage levels the method misses clusters at lower coverage levels yet it does not call many dmrs that were not identified at higher_coverage levels venn_diagram of calls with fewer replicates for the case of four three and two replicates for esc cell control_group requirement for our method and secondly because bsmooth has proved adept at identifying large_scale changes in this setting and is computationally cheaper the m d framework was developed with rrbs data in mind yet given its robustness to lower coverage we expect that it may also be well suited for wgbs data in the future it will be interesting to develop models that explain the predictive_power of methylation profiles in terms of other epigenetic_marks
