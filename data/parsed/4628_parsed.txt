the qdrec web_server determining dose response characteristics of complex macroparasites in phenotypic drug screens neglected_tropical ntds caused by helminths constitute some of the most common infections of the worlds poorest people the etiological_agents are complex and recalci trant to standard techniques of molecular_biology drug_screening against helminths has often been phenotypic and typically involves manual description of drug effect and efficacy a key challenge is to develop automated quantitative_approaches to drug_screening against helminth diseases the quantal doseresponse calculator qdrec constitutes a significant step in this direction it can be used to automatically_determine quantitative doseresponse characteristics and half_maximal effective_concentration ec values using image_based readouts from phenotypic screens thereby allowing rigorous comparisons of the efficacies of drug_compounds qdrec has been developed and validated in the context of drug_screening for schistosomiasis one of the most important ntds however it is equally applicable to general phenotypic screening involving helminths and other complex parasites availability_and qdrec is publically available at neglected_tropical caused by helminths such as schistosomiasis lymphatic_filariasis and onchocerciasis constitute some of the most common infections of the worlds poorest people schistosomiasis in particular has been identified as the second most socioeconomically devastating illness after malaria it afflicts over million people worldwide and its severe symptoms have been implicated as prime factors depriving the affected populations of their health and economic potential few drugs are available for treatment of helminth diseases for instance just one praziquantel is available for treatment of schistosomiasis emergence of drug_resistance is therefore a concern and there is an urgent need for discovery of new therapies against helminthic illnesses drug_screening against helminths poses_unique unlike model_organisms like caenorhabditis_elegans clones or lines of worms are not available the parasites tend to be non amenable to target_identification using gene_knockouts or rnai and fewmolecular mechanisms of hostparasite interactions are well elucidated consequently lead identification typically involves phenotypic screening where the parasites are exposed to compounds and leads identified by analyzing the ensuing effects such analysis is non trivial drug_action typically elicits multiple complex phenotypes that can overlap and vary over both time and concentration see therefore analysis of phenotypic screening has tended to employ manual examination making the process lowthroughput subjective and non quantitative
