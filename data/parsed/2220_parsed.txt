genome_analysis hmcan a method for detecting chromatin_modifications in cancer samples using chip_seq motivation cancer_cells are often characterized by epigenetic changes which include aberrant histone_modifications in particular local or regional epigenetic_silencing is a common mechanism in cancer for silencing expression of tumor_suppressor though several tools have been created to enable detection of histone_marks in chip_seq from normal samples it is unclear whether these tools can be efficiently applied to chip_seq generated from cancer samples indeed cancer_genomes are often characterized by frequent copy_number gains_and of large regions of chromosomal material copy_number may create a substantial statistical bias in the evaluation of histone mark signal enrichment and result in underdetection of the signal in the regions of loss and overdetection of the signal in the regions of gain results we present hmcan histone_modifications in cancer a tool specially_designed to analyze histone_modification chip_seq produced from cancer_genomes hmcan corrects for the gc_content and copy_number bias and then applies hidden_markov to detect the signal from the corrected data on simulated_data hmcan out performed several commonly used tools developed to analyze histone_modification data produced from genomes without copy_number hmcan also showed superior results on a chip_seq data_set generated for the repressive histone mark h_k in a bladder_cancer cell_line hmcan predictions matched well with experimental_data qpcr validated regions and included for example the previously detected h_k mark in the promoter of the dlec gene missed by other tools we tested availability source_code can be downloaded at http www cbrc kaust edu sa hmcan implemented in c chip_seq is a combination of chromatin_immunoprecipitation and next_generation of extracted dna_fragments the chip_seq technique is now widely used for identification of epigenetic_marks such as histone variants and different covalent_modifications of histone_tails common histone_modifications include lysine_acetylation methylation ubiquitylation and sumoylation serine and threonine phosphorylation and arginine methylation histone_marks help partitioning the genome into euchromatin which is accessible for transcription and heterochromatin for instance trimethylation of lysine of histone h_k and trimethylation of lysine of histone h_k are marks associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin and regions of polycomb mediated_repression also histone_modifications and histone variants are often associated with distinct biological_functions for instance trimethylation of lysine of histone h_k is a mark of transcription_elongation trimethylation of lysine of histone h_k marks active or poised promoters monomethylation of lysine of histone h_k together with acetylation of lysine of histone correlates with active enhancers some marks are narrow and cover consecutive nucleosomes e g h_k or h_k whereas others e g h_k and h_k can cover large_genomic from tens to hundreds of kilobases in length although genetic_modifications remain the main cause of cancer development epigenetic_modifications may also play a role in cancer_development dna_methylation and or histone_methylation and deacetylation can be observed either as local modifications or along large_genomic when regional these modifications may cause chromatin_remodeling and silence expression of most genes in these regions this phenomenon is often called regional epigenetic_silencing res or long_range epigenetic_silencing lres res lres has been shown to affect_gene in many cancer_types including bladder_cancer colorectal_cancer breast_cancer and prostate_cancer because of the reversible nature of epigenetic_modifications a substantial effort is being made to develop anticancer_drugs able to interfere with the activity of enzymes involved in histone_modification many tools have been developed to facilitate the analysis of histone_modification data obtained with the chip_seq technique some tools are designed to detect narrow peaks of type of h_k other methods are able to identify epigenetic_marks covering large_genomic this is mostly done through clustering gene by gene quantification hidden_markov hmms and linear signalnoise models however there is no tool specifically developed to detect histone_modifications in cancer_genomes that takes_into copy_number as we show later most of the tools tend to detect more signals in the regions of gain and less signal in the regions of loss gc_content is known to influence read_depth in both illuminaand solid generated datasets a possible difference in gc_content dependencies between chip and control datasets can result in false predictions of enrichment in histone_modification marks here we present a tool designed to identify histone_modifications in genomes with large copy_number hmcan histone_modifications in cancer corrects for copy_number bias and for gc_content bias it then uses hmms to detect regions rich in histone_modifications we chose to compare hmcan with three tools commonly used to detect histone_modifications with chip_seq ccat macs and sicer we show that hmcan is able to detect signal enrichment in simulated cancer_genomes better than these three tools only hmcan and ccat did not show copy_number bias separately on an experimental chip_seq dataset of h_k in a bladder_cancer cell_line hmcan provided better results than ccat we have developed hmcan a tool for detection of histone_modifications in cancer samples using chip_seq on simulated_data hmcan demonstrated better accuracy of prediction compared with the other tools we tested hmcan was originally developed to identify broad signals such as h_k or h_k however it can be also applied to a class of histone_modifications with narrow signal e g h_k the output of hmcan includes information about peak maxima to facilitate functional_annotation of peaks the output also includes normalized density_profiles top which is convenient for inspecting predicted regions with histone_marks and can be also used for producing figures for publication the run time of hmcan is significantly_longer than for the majority of other tools e g macs ccat or sicer and may require up to h on a standard pc supplementary running iterative hmms is the most time consuming step however we believe that the greater_accuracy of hmcan demonstrated in this study compensates for a longer run time in some cases it might be interesting to detect differential histone_modifications using two chip_seq generated for two different conditions hmcan does not as yet contain such a function and we advise users to apply standard_tools such as deseq to the output from hmcan hmcan was specifically developed to analyze histone_modification data obtained for cancer_genomes cancer_genomes are
