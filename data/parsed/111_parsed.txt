databases_and adam automated data management for research datasets existing repositories for experimental_datasets typically capture snapshots of data acquired using a single experimental technique and often require manual population and continual curation we present a storage system for heterogeneous research data that performs dynamic automated indexing to provide powerful search discovery and collaboration features without the restrictions of a structured repository adam is able to index many commonly used file_formats generated by laboratory_assays and therefore offers specific advantages to the experimental biology community however it is not domain specific and can promote sharing and re use of working data across scientific_disciplines availability_and adam is implemented using java and supported on linux it is open_source under the gnu_general v installation_instructions binary code a demo system and virtual_machine image and are available atresearch studies often require the collation of large_quantities of working data of varied types typically stored in the file system of a researchers computer use of such an unstructured repository has advantages over specialized data silos or a generic document management system in terms of familiarity support for heterogeneous file types and ease of data modification further benefits such as data security scalability and remote access can be gained by using a centrally managed networked file system however as data_volumes increase over the lifetime of a project it can be increasingly hard to track the origin status and location of datasets in such systems the use of private repositories in collaborative projects does not encourage data_sharing meaning that files are often unnecessarily duplicated standard file systems also do not provide any intelligence to project coordinators or infrastructure providers as to the nature of data being acquired adam is a software_tool designed to address_these and has been developed in consultation with researchers involved in cross discipline systems_biology studies it is designed to automatically classify annotate and index data_files without disrupting a users typical workflow the researcher can choose to consult the additional metadata when necessary to retrieve or share data items and can provide further annotation as desired as a centralized system it can enable data_sharing assist researchers in finding potential collaborators and can provide aggregated statistics indicating data type prevalence and instrument usage amongst others producing a url that can be distributed to users without an account on the system this link can be revoked at any time thus enabling ad_hoc data_sharing with minimal effort importantly the use of the web_interface is entirely optional and no manual steps are required to import data into the adam repository beyond copying files to the server the interface can be used whenever a user wishes to take advantage of the features that the system provides over and above a traditional networked drive in addition to the features designed for end_users there are also clear benefits to infrastructure providers in having access to aggregated resource of data and the associated systematically derived metadata it enables for example the determination of the most widely used file_formats and by deduction the kinds of experimental_techniques and high_throughput assays being performed and which instruments were used for acquisition this should enable better planning including targeted use of hardware resources and development of analysis software to satisfy demand it would also allow with user consent for alerts to be provided if researchers have uploaded similar datasets or articles as a means to initiate collaboration adam is designed to encourage the usage of centralized storage in preference to potentially unreliable local facilities it achieves this by providing access to valuable additional features without restricting researchers in how they organize their working data it is not an alternative to established public_repositories for publishing data associated with peer_reviewed research nor does it eliminate the need for the types of manual_annotation that facilitate data_integration it does however assist researchers in dealing with increasingly overwhelming digital data_volumes by providing a powerful search interface and promotes data re use by making it easy to share datasets with collaborators long before publication it can additionally provide administrators with a means to analyse the nature and quantity of data being generated by users of the system and so ultimately benefit researchers and their supervisors too
