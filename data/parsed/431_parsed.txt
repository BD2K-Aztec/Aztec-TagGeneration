gene_expression a powerful bayesian meta_analysis method to integrate_multiple gene_set studies motivation much research_effort has been devoted to the identification of enriched_gene for microarray_experiments however identified gene_sets are often found to be inconsistent among independent studies this is probably owing to the noisy_data of microarray_experiments coupled with small_sample of individual studies therefore combining information from multiple studies is likely to improve the detection of truly enriched gene classes as more and more data become available it calls for statistical_methods to integrate_information from multiple studies also known as meta_analysis to improve the power of identifying enriched_gene results we propose a bayesian_model that provides a coherent framework for joint modeling of both gene_set information and gene_expression data from multiple studies to improve the detection of enriched_gene by leveraging information from different sources available one distinct feature of our method is that it directly models the gene_expression data instead of using summary_statistics when synthesizing studies besides the proposed model is flexible and offers an appropriate treatment of between study heterogeneities that frequently arise in the meta_analysis of microarray_experiments we show that under our bayesian_model the full posterior conditionals all have known distributions which greatly_facilitates the mcmc computation simulation_results show that the proposed method can improve the power of gene_set meta_analysis as opposed to existing_methods developed by shen and tseng bioinformatics and it is not sensitive to mild or moderate deviations from the distributional assumption for gene_expression data we illustrate the proposed method through an application of combining eight lung_cancer datasets for gene_set which demonstrates the usefulness of the method although microarray_analysis initially focused on identifying differentially_expressed de genes increased attention has been paid to pathway or gene_set which aims to detect altered biological_pathways or other pre defined gene classes rather than individual genes e g gene_sets are usually defined based on gene_functions ontology information chromosomal proximity or known regulatory_relationships gene_sets that are altered in responding to changes in phenotypes or treatments may provide_important molecular_functions and gene regulatory_relationships underlying biological_processes also it has been reported that gene_set tends to yield more reproducible and interpretable results than single gene analysis a major type of the gene_set is to determine_whether a pre defined category of genes is enriched i e over represented by de genes often referred to as gene_set or pathway_enrichment a gene_set is claimed to be enriched if it contains more de genes than would be expected by chance many methods have been developed in gene_set for a single genomic study for recent_reviews seeand the references therein although plenty of gene_expression data are publicly_available now it is challenging to integrate_information of gene_set from multiple genomic studies targeting the same biological problem often sample_sizes of individual studies are not large and microarray_data are noisy making estimation and inference highly_variable this often leads to inconsistent conclusions across studies integrative_analysis of independent studies may facilitate information_sharing and improve the power of detecting truly enriched gene classes as well as increase reproducibility and interpretability however direct combination of multiple microarray_datasets such as stacking them into one is extremely_difficult owing to the incompatibility of data generated from various microarray_platforms and different versions within the same platform therefore meta_analysis a systematic statistical synthesis of data from multiple studies has been widely used to aggregate evidence from related studies most meta_analyses currently target_gene level analysis with the exception of shen andwho for the first time systematically developed and evaluated meta_analysis for pathway_enrichment in to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the

distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work microarray_studies they proposed three methods namely meta_analysis for pathway enrichment at gene level mape g meta_analysis for pathway enrichment at pathway level mape p and meta_analysis for pathway enrichment integrated mape i all based on the popular method gsea for enrichment_analysis all these methods consist of two key_stages the first is to conduct differential_expression to obtain gene level statistics for each individual study the second stage is to conduct pathway_enrichment and meta_analysis in either order where the order distinguishes mape g from mape p mape g first conducts meta_analysis to combine the gene level results over all the studies and then conduct pathway_enrichment just once using the combined gene level statistics by contrast mape p conducts pathway_enrichment for each individual study and then combines the gene_set level results to get the overall gene_set statistics for a final conclusion the third method mape i further combines the end results from mape g and mape p for potential improvement in performance see the top two panels offor the mape diagrams undoubtedly by formalizing these simple and natural ideas shen and tseng made an initial but important attempt in meta_analysis of gene_set however such sequential approaches in analysis might cause information_loss by just focusing on summary results from the previous steps without using all the expression data available further when there exist various sources of heterogeneities among different datasets these methods may lack power in detection without explicitly modeling the phenomena when data from component studies are available using all data in a fully integrated model based framework is in general more efficient than a sequential approach using summary_statistics only specifically the model should be able to account for between study heterogeneities that are widely present in microarray_data heterogeneities include among others varying experiment designs that lead to non uniform inclusion of genes unequal sample_sizes and data qualities moreover the gene_expression measures in component studies may have different means and variances depending on platforms and pre_processing procedures in this article we propose a flexible bayesian_model that can offer an appropriate treatment of these problems when aggregating multiple studies to identify enriched_gene our bayesian_method provides a natural way for data synthesis by incorporating model and parameter uncertainties involved in all studies more importantly it furnishes an integrated bayesian_framework for jointly modeling gene_expression data from multiple studies and gene_set information this will allow researchers to conduct differential_expression gene_set and meta_analysis simultaneously all based on objective bayesian posterior inference which may yield more reliable scientific_findings than the existing sequential approaches seefor comparison with the mape methods
