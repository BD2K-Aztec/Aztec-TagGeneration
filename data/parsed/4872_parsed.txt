sequence_analysis visualization of protein sequence_features using javascript and svg with pviz js pviz js is a visualization library for displaying protein sequence_features in a web_browser by simply providing a sequence and the locations of its features this lightweight yet versatile javascript_library renders an interactive view of the protein features interactive_exploration of protein sequence_features over the web is a common need in bioinformatics although many web_sites have developed viewers to display these features their implementations are usually focused on data from a specific source or use case some of these viewers can be adapted to fit other use cases but are not designed to be reusable pviz makes it easy to display features as boxes aligned to a protein_sequence with zooming functionality but also includes predefined renderings for secondary_structure and post_translational the library is designed to further customize this view we demonstrate such applications of pviz using two examples a proteomic_data visualization_tool with an embedded viewer for displaying features on protein_structure and a tool to visualize the results of the variant effect predictor tool from ensembl availability_and pviz js is a javascript_library available on github at https github com genentech pviz this site includes examples and functional applications installation_instructions and usage documentation a readme file which explains how to use pviz with examples is available as supplementary_material a visualization of protein features such as protein_domains posttranslational_modifications or sequence_polymorphisms is critical for interpretation and analysis of proteomic_data interactive_visualization of multiple sources of protein features allows for integrated data analysis and hypothesis_generation a number of tools have previously been developed that enable visualization of protein features some web_sites include custom views that are tightly integrated with the web_site ex nextprot interpro pfam protein_data pdb and jalview offer limited flexibility to customize the view or data_sources as data needs to be served by a das server or uploaded by the user most others tools like protter are java tools that have dependency on a particular version of java require servers for hosting the application and are not designed to be customized or incorporated into a third_party web_site tools for customizing the data_sources user interactions or styling of protein features are limited for developers of web_based visualizations pviz js pviz makes it easy to display protein sequence_features on a web_page knowledge of html and basic javascript is all that is required to use the library basic usage involves including the library within a script tag in html and writing a few lines of code given a sequence and a list of positioned features the library displays the sequence and the features aligned to it features are laid out so as not to overlap each other allowing zoom interaction and customization developing pviz as a core library allows it to be used as a component of other third_party libraries or web_pages allowing for application specific customization there has been a lack of tools for developing interactive protein feature visualizations that are easy to embed in a web_page pviz is an open_source library that addresses this problem and makes it easy to integrate within larger applications by using javascript it renders visualization on the client side thereby avoiding the need for a separate server or a dependency on java the library provides basic interactivity like zoom and mouse over information out of the box with additional hooks for interactions for the developer to implement multiple working examples of these ranging from simple features to highly customized visualizations are available on github
