databases_and kgvdb a population_based genomic map of cnvs tagged by snps in koreans despite a growing interest in a correlation between copy_number cnvs and flanking single nucleotide polymorph isms few databases provide such information in particular most information on cnv available so_far was obtained in caucasian and yoruba populations and little is known about cnv in asian_populations this article_presents a database that provides cnv regions tagged by single_nucleotide in about koreans which were detected under strict quality_control manually_curated and experimentally_validated availability kgvdb is freely_available use atto date single marker association analysis in genome_wide gwas has identified a large number of single_nucleotide snps that are highly associated with complex_diseases but only a small portion of genetic heritability is explained by these variants a copy_number cnv is a physical change of genomic segment ranging from a kilobase to several megabases cnv may influence disease_susceptibility and has been proposed to be one potential source of missing_heritability a recent study also found a strong functional_relevance of cnv with complex_diseases however the extent to which cnv impacts disease_susceptibility and underlies complex_traits has yet to be fully determined the cnv association study conducted by the wellcome_trust wtccc reported that common cnvs typed on existing platforms are unlikely to contribute to the genetic_basis of common diseases wellcome_trust however only about of the identified cnvs multi class cnvs were well separated enough to be genotyped in contrast of the cnvs could not be tested for association supplementary moreover well defined polymorphic cnvs tagged by snps are more likely to affect multiple expression traits than frequency matched variants cnvs encompassing single genes or a set of genes may be more likely to be the causative variants of a given genetic disease than tagged snps therefore snps correlated with cnvs are a valuable resource for gwas most cnv databases do not consider multi copy_number classes the scan database is an exception in that it includes the latter but it only contains data from caucasian and yoruban populations and asian_populations are completely_absent owing to the difference in cnvs between distinct ethnic_groups providing polymorphic cnvs and allele_frequency of each genotype in asian_populations will help investigate cnv association with diseases and ethnic_differences recently we developed a database called korean genomic variant database kgvdb which provides multi class cnv regions and well tagged snp information the data were obtained from individuals using two different genotyping_platforms and publicly_available cnv data the large dataset of kgvdb will provide a rich public resource for the study of cnv and snp we constructed a database called kgvdb which provides polymorphic cnvs tagged with snps the major features of kgvdb that are different from others include the following i polymorphic cnv regions identified under strict quality_controls and manual_curation ii cnv information from korean populations to supplement currently biased ethnic information iii large dataset of cnvs tagged with snps from individuals using two different genotyping_platforms snp_array and cgh array iv rich_information on tagging_snps including frequencies in hapmap populations and v copy_number states of the reference_sample using log ratios from two kinds of cgh data and the depth of coverage from whole_genome sequencing_data in conclusion kgvdb is a rich resource of the genomic_variants which will complement the lack of asian cnv data in particular correlation data like rs tagging the
