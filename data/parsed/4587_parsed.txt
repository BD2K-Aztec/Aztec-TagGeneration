databases_and the cofactor database organic cofactors in enzyme catalysis motivation organic enzyme cofactors are involved in many enzyme_reactions therefore the analysis of cofactors is crucial to gain a better understanding of enzyme catalysis to aid this we have created the cofactor database results cofactor provides a web_interface to access hand curated_data extracted from the literature on organic enzyme cofactors in biocatalysis as well as automatically collected information cofactor includes information on the conformational and solvent_accessibility variation of the enzyme_bound cofactors as well as mechanistic and structural_information about the hosting enzymes availability the database is publicly_available and can be accessed atenzymes are proteins that catalyze the repertoire of chemical_reactions found in nature and as such are vitally_important molecules they are generally composed of the common amino_acid but many also require small_molecules in addition for the catalysis to occur in some cases these molecules are involved in regulation or in ensuring the correct folding remote from the active_site however many are termed cofactors as they are required in the active_site and are directly involved in catalysis these cofactors may be either metal_ions whose involvement in catalysis we handle in metal macie or small_organic which are described here in both cases these cofactors extend and enhance the basic catalytic toolkit of enzymes to date there has been little collation of information on organic cofactors and their functions outside of the primary literature cofactor has been designed to remedy this as macie and metal macie were designed to collate data on enzyme mechanisms and metal_ions in catalysis respectively
