gene_expression a turing test for artificial expression data motivation the lack of reliable comprehensive gold_standards complicates the development of many bioinformatics_tools particularly for the analysis of expression data and biological_networks simulation_approaches can provide provisional gold_standards such as regulatory_networks for the assessment of network_inference however this just defers the problem as it is difficult to assess how closely simulators emulate the properties of real_data results in analogy to turings test discriminating humans and computers based on responses to questions we systematically compare real and artificial_systems based on their gene_expression output different expression data analysis techniques such as clustering are applied to both types of datasets we define and extract distributions of properties from the results for instance distributions of cluster quality_measures or transcription_factor activity patterns distributions of properties are represented as histograms to enable the comparison of artificial and real_datasets we examine three frequently used simu lators that generate expression data from parameterized regulatory_networks we identify features distinguishing real from artificial data_sets that suggest how simulators could be adapted to better emulate real_datasets and thus become more suitable for the evaluation of data analysis tools availability see http www bio ifi lmu de kueffner attfad and the supplement for precomputed analyses other compendia can be analyzed via the cran package attfad the full datasets can be obtained fromthe analysis of expression data involves a range of bioinformatics_tools they are used for outlier removal and normalization for clustering for finding relevant biological_processes as well as for the inference and modeling of gene regulatory_interactions gris the improvement of such tools frequently depends on insights into properties of transcriptional_regulation to better understand such properties and to facilitate further tool development several simulators have been developed for various areas of expression analysis another reason for conducting simulation_studies is to provide gold_standards that are not available for real_data in case of clustering the number of gene_clusters and the clustergene associations are usually not known for real_data but can be defined easily within an in silico framework for the assessment of tools it is important that simulators generate realistic expression_patterns similar techniques are applied to analyze whether gene_sets associated with biological_processes exhibit a significant_enrichment of differential_expression the assessment of enrichment tests on real_data is difficult as the genes or processes that exhibit differential activity between experimental_conditions are usually not known before the actual experiment as a remedy enrichment tests can be assessed based on simulations of gene_sets and their differential expression_patterns furthermore generated realistic data and noise distributions to examine data_normalization approaches for two dye arrays simulators are also used to examine specific theoretical assumptions e g expression data distributions single_cell data and theoretical_properties of gris simulators devised for studying gri inference approaches are again motivated by the need for complete gold_standard networks unlike the specific simulators network simulators claim to more generally satisfy the mentioned requirements they imitate experimentally_determined gris and their dynamical_properties and emulate other properties of real_data such as data and noise distributions network simulators have been applied successfully to assess algorithms that reconstruct gris from expression data e g via community_wide blind assessments therefore simulators implement elaborate experimental_settings for instance by dealing with biological and technical_replicates and by generating data for gene_knockouts various perturbations and time series data some simulators also take into account sequence_variations in promoter_regions and coding_sequences instead of random topologies many simulators use realistic topologies such as scale_free or networks of experimentally_determined gris algorithms can be benchmarked using simulators in a meaningful way if generated and real_data are sufficiently_similar as this is difficult to show in silico models are sometimes considered insufficient evidence for method enhancements this is owing to our lack of a good understanding of the distribution of expression levels across the to whom correspondence should be addressed various biological_states and the correlation between biological_replicates the present_study to which extent current state_ofthe simulators are able to generate realistic datasets and gold_standards we propose characteristic histograms to compare artificial and real expression compendia the histograms are derived by applying a range of expression data analysis approaches we provide data on our web_site and r software to apply the suggested analyses on the compendia examined in this article or defined by the user the properties of real and artificial datasets thus become amenable to a mutual pairwise_comparison for the generation of artificial datasets we focus on network simulators as they are most frequently used in practice and most general in their scope we compare various properties between real and artificial datasets and find strong deviations heatmap properties and their deviations are discussed below in detail each subsection presents one type of property histogram and is exemplified in detail based on the data from one of the three simulators results on the other simulators are briefly_summarized at the end of each section see availability for additional figures simulated_datasets aim to bridge the gap to dependable gold_standards that are required for the development and validation of tools across many expression data analysis steps for the application to algorithm benchmarks simulators should be able to emulate the properties of real_data to test this ability we applied several important_steps in gene_expression ranging from clustering to the inference of gris the results of these analyses were represented as property histograms for the comparison of real and artificial datasets data generated by three gene network simulators were compared with four expression compendia measured in e coli and s cerevisiae we showed that property histograms facilitate the characterization and comparison of expression compendia most importantly histograms were highly_consistent across different real expression compendia and even between different organisms in contrast simulated_data exhibited markedly different ranges of values and shapes the captured properties thus clearly separated real and simulated_data in analogy to turings test we observed strong deviations even in basic intensity and noise histograms these are likely due to simplified simulation_models omitting steps that play a role in real measurements such as the modeling of mrna concentrations and their quantification by optical detectors we constructed further histograms from clustering_approaches to compare resulting clusters of genes and experimental_conditions artificial co regulation patterns as detected by clustering are exclusively generated by transcriptional_regulation as this is typically the only regulatory_mechanism implemented in current simulators however the most striking and reproducible i e found in all examined simulators deviations were observed for properties derived from gene_regulatory this is surprising as the examined simulators were particularly devised for the assessment of network_inference approaches many simulators aim to use realistic gene_regulatory topologies e g sampled from experimentally_derived gris instead of random networks however other important layers of regulation such as different cellular_states or signal_transduction are neglected that in real_data contribute to the complexity of expression_patterns furthermore executable models are constructed by arbitrarily selecting model_parameters for the dynamic simulation of gris datasets generated in such a setup will differ substantially from real measurements even if realistic gri topologies are used indeed none of the different topologies b we examine to what extent tftg interactions and pairs of tgs regulated by the same tfs respectively can be identified based on correlation positive_or differences in density ordinate non continuous in a indicate that the chances to detect true tftg or tg tg relationships in the given correlation intervals are increased or decreased respectively interactions were also analyzed for a yeast and an alternative e coli dataset in c the activity of tfs is inferred from the levels of differential_expression exhibited by their tgs shown is the density ordinate of tfs active in a given fraction of the available chips the leftmost histogram bin corresponds to a fraction of and thus denotes tfs that are never found active implemented by the three simulators substantially_reduced the observed differences to real_data realistic data simulation requires a careful analysis of properties of network_topologies dynamic parameters and their relationship to the generated expression data our results suggest several improvements i the expression model should be improved to produce normally distributed data in the range of typical expression measurement platforms so that for instance fold changes have a similar meaning as in real_datasets the simulation of noise is important but excessive noise levels should be avoided ii the generation of realistic co regulation patterns requires the emulation of groups of tfs their combinatorial_effects and the conditions for becoming active iii as a related topic we note that random parameterization gnw grendel or random mapping of experimentally_determined parameters onto the network syntren is not adequate instead an iterative_optimization of model_parameters could preserve dataset properties such as those that we described here iv simulators should implement regulation on the protein level currently the simulation of just transcriptional_regulation over simplifies network_inference as all regulatory_events become visible at the level of gene_expression v finally simulators should account for the diversity of genes for instance regarding the number of regulatory states instead of assuming that one model is sufficient to generate all data this would help to reproduce the broader distributions of properties derived from real_data our approach see availability for web_site and software offers a detailed comparative_analysis of expression data generated by real and artificial gene_regulatory our assessment is based on typical data_processing and analysis_pipelines we thereby provided an important layer of assessment on top of data simulators that are essential tools for both data analysis and network_inference when no reliable gold_standards are available the analysis suggested several ways for improving current simulators to generate more realistic datasets
