genome_analysis pileup js a javascript_library for interactive and in browser visualization of genomic_data pileup js is a new browser_based genome viewer it is designed to facilitate the investigation of evidence for genomic_variants within larger web_applications it takes_advantage of recent_developments in the javascript ecosystem to provide a modular reliable and easily embedded library as sequencing has become increasingly ubiquitous there has been a proliferation of variant_calling programs before a physician or researcher takes action on a variant however it remains essential to inspect the evidence for it manually track viewer visualizations such as those provided by ucsc university of california santa_cruz igv integrative_genomics and dalliance have long been the preferred way to do this as data and workflow management systems move to the browser it becomes increasingly appealing to embed these visualizations directly within larger web_applications this results in reduced latency allows extensive customization and avoids the cognitive overhead of context switching between applications here we describe pileup js a javascript_library for interactive and in browser visualization of genomic_data pileup js is extensively tested uses a modern code base that is oriented towards re usability and performance and is well documented for easier customization and usability by other developers the latest_version v the most recent version supports visualization of genomic tracks for reference_sequences mapped_reads paired or unpaired read_depth variants and gene_annotations pileup js was initially_developed to be embedded within the cycledash variant inspector but it can be used within any web_application https github com hammerlab cycledash
