systems_biology a computational_method to preclude multistationarity in networks of interacting_species motivation modeling and analysis of complex systems are important aspects of understanding systemic behavior in the lack of detailed knowledge about a system we often choose modeling equations out of convenience and search the high_dimensional parameter_space randomly to learn about model properties qualitative modeling side steps the issue of choosing specific modeling equations and frees the inference from specific properties of the equations we consider classes of ordinary_differential ode_models arising from interactions of species entities such as bio chemical reaction_networks or ecosystems a class is defined by imposing mild assumptions on the interaction rates in this framework we investigate whether there can be multiple positive steady_states in some ode_models in a given class results we have developed and implemented a method to decide whether any ode model in a given class cannot have multiple steady_states the method runs efficiently on models of moderate_size we tested the method on a large set of models for gene_silencing by srna interference and on two publicly_available databases of biological_models kegg and biomodels we recommend that this method is used as i a pre screening step for selecting an appropriate model and ii for investigating the robustness of non existence of multiple steady_state for a given ode model with respect to variation in interaction rates systems of interacting_species are ubiquitous in many areas of science from biology and ecology to epidemiology and sociology the dynamics of a system are typically specified by a system of ordinary_differential odes potentially depending on many unknown_parameters the variables of the system are the concentrations or abundances of species such as chemical or molecular_species in systems_biology animal_species in ecology or infected and susceptible individuals in epidemiology specifying the modeling equations is rarely trivial for example in systems_biology the species concentrations change according to the molecular reactions that take place but the precise reaction_mechanisms and rates are typically unknown for example choosing between mass action power_law or hill type kinetics might be a matter of tradition or convenience rather than biological_knowledge mass action kinetics has a simpler functional_form than the other two kinetics and only one parameter these on the other hand are more adaptable to systems in biologically constrained environments such as cellular_systems the choice of kinetics might thus affect the biological validity of a conclusion derived from the odes this remains true even if we are comfortable with a particular system of odes the parameter_space is generally high_dimensional and it is standard to explore it numerically or by choosing parameters randomly however this is difficult to do efficiently when the number of parameters is large consequently we can only investigate a small part of the parameter_space these concerns have lead to an increased interest in qualitative properties in the context of this article qualitative properties refer to properties of dynamical_systems with a common underlying_structure we focus on a particular qualitative property namely the capacity for multiple steady_states or multistationarity the common structure is defined by an interaction_network defined in section multistationarity underlies the emergence of hysteresis and switch like behavior that is the transformation of a gradual input into a steep change in the response it plays an important role in understanding systemic behavior we have developed and implemented a computationally simple and efficient criterion to determine if a class of dynamical_systems compatible with the same underlying interaction_network cannot have multiple steady_states the reaction interaction rates are constrained by how they vary with the species concentrations the criterion can be refined to preclude multistationarity for particular classes of kinetics such as mass action kinetics and more generally power_law kinetics both of these are used widely outside systems_biology and biochemistry but without the biochemical labeling e g the method is well suited to screen large sets of networks for the possible emergence of switch behavior the applicability of our approach is demonstrated by studying a series of small motifs in gene_silencing by rna_interference and by analysis of models from the kegg and biomodels databases in the to whom correspondence should be addressed discussion we relate our method to other methods to preclude multistationarity a matrix y with symbolic entries y is called signnon singular if the determinant of y is a non zero homogeneous polynomial in y with all coefficients being positive or all being negative for the matrices considered here y is signnon singular if its determinant has constant non zero sign for positive values of y we have developed and implemented a computationally_efficient and simple method to qualitatively assert whether a network the number of reactions is plotted against the number of species for the analyzed models in kegg and analyzed models in biomodels loglog scale ma refers to mass action kinetics and q to the qualitative influence see main text for details one hundred three models were used from kegg in both analyses three hundred sixty five models were used from biomodels for the ma analysis q analysis blue injective orange non injective with identically zero determinant green non injective with non identically zero determinant gray analysis failed the data used in the figure is provided in the supplementary data s cannot exhibit multistationarity the approach embraces a broad class of dynamical_systems by allowing for conservation laws and arbitrary influences our method decides whether an interaction_network is injective or not if it is injective it can at most have one positive steady_state within each stoichiometric class qualitative inference relies solely on the structure of the interaction_network this approach to inference has the particular strength of freeing the analysis from any specific ode system and to highlight the generality of a conclusion or property in our context it is surprising that the exclusion of multistationarity can be so strongly encoded in the network_structure reactions and influences alone and be independent of the specific form of the rate functions even if these involve complicated and nonlinear terms an overview of different methods to preclude and or assert multistationarity is provided in our algorithm is in the class of injectivity based criteria to preclude multistationarity in the context of chemical_reaction network_theory these criteria generally fall in two groups jacobian based_methods and graphical methods soule soule these apply to different specializations of networks and rate functions such as mass action kinetics or specific influences and can be seen as specializations of our method the graphical conditions are derived from conditions on the jacobian and would therefore preclude multistationarity in fewer cases than a corresponding jacobianbased method a different criterion a sign condition to characterize injective networks is given in shinar and feinberg for some specific influences their definition of a compatible rate function is less restrictive than ours and corresponds in our setting to treat classes of influences together if the kinetics is restricted to mass action there exist methods that complement injectivity based_methods in that multistationarity not only can be precluded but also asserted the main methods in this class are given in other methods include an injectivity based method applicable to weakly reversible networks and a study of embedded networks we applied our method to a large class of models of gene_silencing by rna_interference the method ran efficiently on this set further we observed that the non existence of multistationarity reported for some of the motifs for specific choices of rate functions has a qualitative origin subsequently we applied our method to two databases of biological_models and showed that the method could decide on injectivity for a large fraction of the models it is remarkable that a large proportion of the networks is injective and hence cannot exhibit multistationarity existence of multistationarity is often asserted from random parameter search assuming the rate functions take a generic form however exclusion of multistationarity cannot be decided from a finite number of sampled parameter_values alone further the result might depend strongly on how the parameters are sampled our method provides an automatized procedure to assert that multistationarity cannot occur it provides an additional tool to various other available softwares to address multistationarity most methods are developed in several references or apply to certain specializations only the most general or a representative one is given in the table in total there are and networks in each category respectively biom refers to biomodels ma refers to mass action kinetics and q to the qualitative influence see main text for details non injectivity is a necessary condition for an interaction_network to exhibit multiple positive steady_states hence it is possible that a network is non injective without being multistationary in practice however we have observed that a noninjective interaction_network generally enables a choice of rate functions and parameters for which multistationarity occurs prospective work will focus on investigating under what conditions this is true and if it is the case how the rate functions and parameters can be constructed typical ode_models such as sir models and the lotka volterra model can be put in the framework of an interaction_network even though the model is derived from a different perspective interpretation of ode_models as interaction networks with potential non realistic hypothetical reactions might seem artificial however it highlights an important aspect namely that of freeing the system from a specific choice of odes bearing in mind the difficulties in choosing the correct system of odes we see this aspect as a strong advantage of our method and encourage the modeling community to consider qualitative inference broadly with the aim of separating model specificities from structural_properties
