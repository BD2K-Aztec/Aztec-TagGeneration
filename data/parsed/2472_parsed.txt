influence maximization in time bounded network identifies transcription factors_regulating perturbed pathways motivation to understand the dynamic nature of the biological_process it is crucial to identify perturbed pathways in an altered environment and also to infer regulators that trigger the response current time series analysis methods however are not powerful enough to identify perturbed pathways and regulators simultaneously widely used methods include methods to determine gene_sets such as differentially_expressed or gene_clusters and these genes sets need to be further interpreted in terms of biological_pathways using other tools most pathway analysis methods are not designed for time series data and they do not consider gene gene influence on the time dimension results in this article we propose a novel time series analysis method timetp for determining transcription_factors tfs regulating pathway perturbation which narrows the focus to perturbed sub pathways and utilizes the gene_regulatory and proteinprotein_interaction to locate tfs triggering the perturbation timetp first identifies perturbed sub pathways that propagate the expression changes along the time starting points of the perturbed sub pathways are mapped into the network and the most influential tfs are determined by influence maximization technique the analysis result is visually summarized in tf pathway map in time clock timetp was applied to pik_ca knock in dataset and found significant sub pathways and their regulators relevant to the pip signaling_pathway availability_and timetp is implemented in python and available at http bio health snu ac kr software timetp our goal in this article is to develop a computational_method to perform analysis of time series transcriptome_data in terms of biological_pathways and also to determine regulators for differentially_expressed gene deg sets or perturbed pathways analyzing transcriptome_data can be done in many different ways for different purposes thus there are numerous computational_methods and we begin by surveying the literature in the categories such as i methods for determining perturbed pathways ii methods for analyzing time series transcriptome_data iii methods for the pathway based analysis of time series data and iv methods for identifying regulators while analyzing time series data analysis of time series omics_data is very difficult and there are only a few tools available in addition it is desirable to identify regulators such as tf that are likely to induce changes in transcriptome over time however on top of the complexity of analyzing time series data considering regulators such as tf makes the complexity of the time series data analysis task dramatically high in this study we propose a novel bioinformatics method for analyzing time series omics_data to identify both perturbed pathways and regulating tfs two main ideas are i we start the analysis by identifying perturbed pathways in comparison of control vs treatment group and then focusing on tfs that are relevant to the perturbed pathways in this way much smaller number of tfs and pathways are considered thus the complexity of the analysis task is significantly_reduced ii to systematically analyze the effect of tfs over time we adopt and further develop the influence maximization technique in the bounded time with these two main ideas we designed and implemented a time series analysis method of finding tfs regulating perturbed subpathways timetp the key_properties of timetp are as follows i timetp identifies perturbed sub pathways that propagate their expression levels along time and also identifies tfs triggering that pathway perturbation by our four step approach ii timetp adopts two well established computational_methods crosscorrelation and influence maximization from the fields of signal_processing and social_network iii the novel framework of timetp produces the tf pathway map in time clock to trace the pathway perturbation triggered from tf to pathway as well as the effective visualization of tf pathway map timetp provides user_friendly interface by handling a diverse range of input_data in terms of type of dataset rna_seq or microarray and type of condition single time series or control treatment the rest of the article is organized as follows the process of perturbed sub pathway mining in timetp will be described in sections sections and explain the time bounded network construction and the influence maximization algorithm for finding tfs timetp is tested by using the biological dataset and the result is compared with other pathway sub pathway mining tools and regulator analysis algorithms in section timetp is tested with a genome_wide rna_seq dataset of nontransformed human_breast mcf a starved overnight and stimulated with ng_ml egf for and min in wt and pik_ca knock in samples to test the power of influence maximization we need to choose datasets with many time points and also with sequencing_data to accurately model influence of tfs note that many datasets with onlyprofitv leninfsett g end for end for newseed t t with maximum inf t round s s fnewseedg seedinfset seedinfset infsetnewseed t tnfnewseedg end for influence maximization in time bounded network i two time points are not meaningful for this analysis in addition to test the performance of the proposed approach data should have replicates to determine differential_expression accurately and the interval between time points should be short to model signaling effects the mcf a data were the only one to meet the criteria pik_ca knock in samples referred to as pik_ca h r contains a mutated gene that encodes the p a catalytic_subunit pik_ca pik_ca is a component gene of class ia phosphoinositide_kinases pi ks and the mutated form of pik_ca is expected to exhibit chronic activation of phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate pip signaling pi k pip signaling_pathway plays_a in cell_growth and migration in addition several driver_mutations in pi k pip pathway have been found in multiple types of cancer especially oncogenic mutations of pik_ca gene are discovered in up to of human breast_cancer samples thus this experiment is designed to trigger long_term activation of pip signaling by the modification of pik_ca and track its downstream effect analysis result of timetp is composed of the tf pathway map in time clock and the whole list of perturbed pathways as shown inandis the map of influence path from the tfs selected by the influence maximization algorithm to perturbed sub pathways pathways perturbed but not affected by tfs are excluded in the tfpathway map for example timetp detected perturbation of the pi_k but it was not included the tf pathway map in time clock because pi_k is directly activated by the modification of pik_ca in the experiment as in foxo is on the top of the tf pathway map and propagates its effect to all of the downstream pathways and foxo signaling_pathway itself the forkhead_box foxo tfs are known as targets of the serine_threonine pkb_akt that is directly_affected by pip generation specifically akt inhibits foxos and causes consequent inactivation of foxo signaling_pathway which can be clearly shown in the tf pathway map of pik_ca h r samples wnt_signaling is one of the activated pathways in pik_ca h r samples timetp estimated that differential_expression of the tf foxo and srebf in the early time points is propagated through the path and activated wnt_signaling although the first gene gsk b of the perturbed sub pathway is down_regulated consequently it made ctnnb that encodes b catenin activated to further transduce the signal to other cytoplasmic regions or into the nucleus interaction of foxos with b catenin has an inhibitory_effect on b catenin activity while timetp inferred a devious route that has the same consequence as for the cooperation between pi_k and wnt_signaling several studies provide the logical underpinnings the activation process of erbb signaling_pathway and regulation of actin_cytoskeleton is more complicated albeit both perturbed subpathways themselves are seemingly down_regulated first the path from tf to the first genes of the sub pathway actb actg hbegf is activated and finally three genes are activated in the last time point forecasting the late activation of two pathways beyond the observed time points as in the previous_studies erbb signaling_pathway encompasses the pi_k the perturbed sub pathway that timetp detected in the erbb signaling_pathway includes the cell_surface egfr which is the upstream part of pi_k taken together the effect of akt_signaling activation attributes the delayed activation of the erbb signaling which can be the positive feedback_loop of the akt_signaling detection of a transcriptional feedback_loop of pip signaling is the major_contribution of the original article of the dataset and the analysis result of timetp can be a parallel contribution of the study moreover tf pathway path to the regulation of actin_cytoskeleton pathway found in timetp result suggests for further research in addition to the previously_suggested path fc_gamma r mediated phagocytosis is one of the activated pathways in pik_ca knock in samples mammary_epithelial can act as phagocytes during phagocytosis ligated fc_gamma r on plasma_membranes induces recruitment of pi k and increased synthesis of pip timetp found the perturbation of phagocytosis pathway starting from pi k receptor and its downstream_genes one of the tfs expected to trigger the perturbation is atf down_regulated in the early time points which is a key_regulator that inhibits the immune_response of macrophage our analysis correctly suggested that atf would function similarly in mcf a cells timetp detected the same sub pathway in oocyte meiosis and oxytoxin signaling in both pathways calcium calmodulin calm signaling_pathway is included and its sub pathway was found as perturbed previous_studies of mammary_carcinoma cells report that calmodulin mediates akt_activity suggesting that the increased pip not only recruited akt by itself but also induced calmodulin dependent activation of akt_signaling we presented timetp a four step approach to locate perturbed sub pathways and their regulators from time series transcriptome_data timetp has two novel contributions estimation of delay between two expression_vectors that leads to the construction of a time bounded sub graph and introduction of the influence maximization technique into the analysis of times series data in search of tfs that are involved in perturbed pathways timetp is the firstsub pathway mining tool for time series data that analyzes and visualizes the explicit expression pattern providing a holistic picture of the pathway perturbation dynamics in particular tf pathway map in time clock enables user to navigate the perturbation propagation route along time analysis of the pik_ca knock in dataset shows that timetp can capture the perturbation in pi_k confirming the main objective of the biological experiment and re producing consequent changes in the downstream pathways especially foxo is expected to be the master_regulator of the perturbation of five pathways in tf pathway map which is in an agreement with the fact that foxo tfs are the known targets of akt as well as the perturbation in foxo and wnt_signaling directly_affected by foxos timetp suggests the late activation of erbb pathway that highlights the same assumption of previous study a positive feedback_loop of the akt_signaling in addition tfs predicted and ranked by timetp include three important tfs from the original article of the dataset while mra or drem failed to discover any tf in the list timetp supports various types of dataset with flexible parameters that can be adjusted for the search of regulators we believe that timetp will be a very valuable_tool to identify both perturbed pathways and their regulators especially in analysis of time series sequencing_data
