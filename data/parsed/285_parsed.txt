genetics_and analysis of latino populations from gala and mec studies reveals genomic_loci with biased local_ancestry estimation motivation local_ancestry analysis of genotype data from recently admixed_populations e g latinos african_americans provides key insights into population history and disease genetics although methods for local_ancestry have been extensively validated in simulations under many unrealistic assumptions no empirical study of local_ancestry accuracy in latinos exists to date hence interpreting findings that rely on local_ancestry in latinos is challenging results here we use nuclear families from the mainland usa puerto_rico and mexico in conjunction with unrelated latinos from the multiethnic cohort_study to provide the first empirical characterization of local_ancestry accuracy in latinos our approach for identifying errors does not rely on simulations but on the observation that local_ancestry in families follows mendelian_inheritance we measure the rate of local_ancestry assignments that lead to mendelian inconsistencies in local_ancestry in trios milanc which provides a lower_bound on errors in the local_ancestry estimates we show that milanc rates observed in simulations underestimate the rate observed in real_data and that milanc varies_substantially across the genome second across a wide_range of methods we observe that loci with large deviations in local_ancestry also show enrichment in milanc rates therefore local_ancestry estimates at such loci should be interpreted with caution finally we reconstruct ancestral haplotype panels to be used as reference_panels in local_ancestry and show that ancestry_inference is significantly_improved by incoroprating these reference_panels availability_and we provide the reconstructed reference_panels together with the maps of milanc rates as a public resource for researchers analyzing local_ancestry in latinos at http bogdanlab during the past_decade studies of recently admixed_populations e g latinos african_americans have been used to detect associations of genomic_regions with disease risk and for the inference of population_genetic parameters these populations emerge from the mixing of genetically diverged ancestral_populations for a relatively small number of generations typically owing to crossover recombination_events the chromosome of any admixed individual is a mosaic of chromosomal_regions originating from the ancestral_populations identifying the ancestral origin of each of these regions is the goal of local_ancestry local_ancestry has proven to be an extremely_valuable resource for medical_genetics in detecting genes associated with disease through admixture_mapping or through a combination of genome_wide association admixture_mapping and resequencing studies to whom correspondence should be addressed accurate local_ancestry in latinos forms an important component of disease and population genetic_studies in these populations biases in local_ancestry estimation would lead to false_positive associations thereby invalidating the scientific results reported in these analyses in this work we quantified the accuracy of local_ancestry at each location in the genome using real genotype data over latino individuals our study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of local_ancestry methods using external_information taken from family data and thereby overcomes the simplifying assumptions of simulation based assessments we provide a direct analytic relation between the sample_size the milanc and the error_rates of ancestry_inference we estimated the milanc rates for a number of state of the art local_ancestry methodsalloy lamp ld pcadmix and winpop all methods exhibit qualitatively_similar behavior first we observe that the milanc rates associated with each of these methods vary_considerably across the genome we construct genomic maps of milanc rates for different local_ancestry methods that can be used to aid researchers in interpreting the results of studies of local_ancestry in latinos second we find that loci with increased deviation in local_ancestry show increased mendelian inconsistency rates in local_ancestry in latinos our results strongly suggest that local_ancestry estimates at these loci are biased this is important for studies of local_ancestry in latinos such as case only admixture_mapping or studies of natural_selection that aim at identifying loci with large deviations in local_ancestry the genomic maps of milanc rates could serve as a valuable_tool to distinguish true signals from loci where the local_ancestry estimates are inaccurate for example we find loci as putative for natural_selection in the gala mexican data more than standard_deviations increase in the eur local_ancestry we observe an average milanc rate of at these loci significantly_higher than the average genomic rate of this suggests that an alternate explanation for part of the enrichment of eur ancestry at these loci is error bias of local_ancestry as future work we propose to incorporate the newly inferred error_rates in robust association_statistics that model the variation in error_rates across the genome in addition to unbiased local_ancestry methods our results also show that currently available genotype data from latinos can be used to build better reference_panels to be used as proxies for local_ancestry in latinos this motivates the need for improved methodologies for recovery of ancestral haplotypes from admixed_populations in practice to obtain high_resolution map of the locus specific error_rates our analysis should be replicated with a considerably larger_sample however even with the current sample_size we show a significant correlation between the milanc results and the average ancestry as well as a statistically_significant reduction in milanc rates when an improved reference_panel is available we observe this phenomenon when using a denser set of snps as a reference_panel as well as when using a closer population e g spanish instead of ceu it is therefore crucial to construct highly_accurate reference_panels and as a first step toward this goal we show that a reference_panel can be reconstructed by extracting the ancestral haplotypes from an admixed population clearly another potentially viable_approach may be to sequence a large number of nam eur and afr samples and use those as a reference
