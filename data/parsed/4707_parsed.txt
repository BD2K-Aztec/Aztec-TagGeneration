towards a pirna prediction using multiple kernel fusion and support_vector motivation piwi interacting rna pirna is the most recently_discovered and the least investigated class of argonaute piwi protein interacting small_non the pirnas are mostly known to be involved in protecting the genome from invasive transposable_elements but recent_discoveries suggest their involvement in the pathophysiology of diseases such as cancer their identification is therefore an important task and computational_methods are needed however the lack of conserved pirna sequences and structural_elements makes this identification challenging and difficult results in the present study we propose a new modular and exten sible machine_learning based on multiple kernels and a support_vector svm classifier for pirna identification very few pirna features are known to date the use of a multiple kernels approach allows editing adding or removing pirna features that can be heterogeneous in a modular manner according to their relevance in a given species our algorithm is based on a combination of the previously_identified features sequence_features k_mer motifs and a uri dine at the first position and pirnas cluster feature and a new telomere centromere vicinity feature these features are heterogeneous and the kernels allow to unify their representation the proposed algorithm named pirpred gives promising results on drosophila and human data and outscores previously_published pirna identification algorithms availability_and pirpred is freely_available to non commercial users on our web_server evryrna http evryrna ibisc using computational_approaches is a practical manner to identify potential non_coding ncrnas which can be experimentally_studied further many methods have been developed for the in silico prediction of several types of ncrnas such as micrornas mirnas the piwi protein interacting rna pirna is the most recently_discovered and the least characterized class of argonaute ago piwi protein interacting small ncrna unlike the broad expression of mirna in most cells and tissue_types pirna expression is highly_enriched in the germline like mirna pirna molecules are associated with proteins of the ago piwi family to execute sequence specific gene_silencing additionally pirna molecules may fine_tune gene_expression by mediating epigenetic_modifications of heterochromatin the germline enriched expression pattern and the finding that mutating the pirna biogenesis pathway resulted in sterility demonstrated the critical impact of the piwipirna pathway exert on germline development and function in addition to their activity in the germline accumulating recent data have suggested pirna expression and biological_activity in somatic_cells as well and recent_discoveries suggest the involvement of pirnas in diseases such as cancer therefore an updated vision suggests a wider definition of pirna expression and biological_function in both germline and somatic_cells the pirnas are the largest and most heterogeneous class of the small ncrna family exceeding million distinct pirna species in the mouse initial identification and characterization of mammalian pirnas were achieved by experimental_approaches that combined the isolation of piwi protein interacting sequences and or deep_sequencing of germline enriched short rna_sequences although this methodology appeared productive it could not exhaustively cover the entire repertoire of pirna molecules in a specific organism in particular tissue_specific and low copy_number expressed pirna could not be fully detected using this methodology unlike mirnas pirnas lack clear secondary_structure motifs and primary sequence_conservation except for enrichment for the presence of a uridine nucleotide at the first position of the transcript le one hallmark characteristic of pirna sequences that are of nt of length is that most of them are encoded in genome clusters ranging from to kb_long there are both monodirectional clusters encoding pirnas on one strand and bidirectional clusters whose halves encode pirnas on opposite strands and whose transcription starts in the opposite_direction from a centrally_located promoter brennecke et_al have also reported that in drosophila pirnas have the tendency to be expressed near telomere and centromere regions on the chromosome the lack of conserved characteristics makes the identification of pirnas by computational_methods a difficult challenge only a few methods have been developed to predict pirnas these methods can be classified into two classes the first one uses a linear classification algorithm to predict individual pirnas and the second one is based on clustering_approaches to predict pirna clusters from rnaseq sequences zhang et_al group proposed a method based on the use of k_mer strings for the identification of motifs in pirna sequences all the nt strings are considered including mer strings a c g and t to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com mer strings mer strings mer strings and mer strings a total of strings are obtained and used for classifying pirna and non pirna sequences two algorithms have been proposed for predicting pirna clusters from rnaseq_data protrac and piclust the protrac algorithm is based on a statistical probabilistic analysis it analyzes mapped sequence_reads and identifies clusters based on significant_deviations from a uniform pirna distribution using different types of information including the density of mapped_reads strand asymmetry frequency of putative pirna loci with u at the first position of the sequence or a at position on the other hand the piclust algorithm uses a density_based approach without assuming any parametric distribution and considers the actual interdistance between mapped_reads for the determination of clustering with results that were claimed to outperform the protrac algorithm taken together previous pirna prediction_algorithms were based on the following features i transcript length of nt ii nucleotide bias at position of g expression iii localization in clusters and iv differential frequencies of certain k_mer sequences to the best of our knowledge however none of the previous publications have attempted to combine all of these features together exploiting all these features could improve the results obtained by the existing algorithms in this article we propose a computational_approach to combine heterogeneous types of pirna features we developed a machine_learning based on the fusion of multiple kernels and support_vector svms a wellknown machine_learning that has been widely used in diverse areas of bioinformatics svm is a kernel_based learner which can find non liner boundaries between data classes by using kernels using kernel methods makes it possible to represent the original data by using a matrix representation called a kernel_matrix symmetric positive definite kernel matrices encode the similarity between sequences in their respective input space this implies that the heterogeneous features can all be replaced by appropriately kernel matrices this allows the elimination of the data heterogeneity constructing the same representation for all datasets and integrating these representations is the main intuition behind kernel fusion methods in recent_years several machine_learning have been proposed to exploit different information_sources using kernels g onen and alpayd research in multiple_kernel mkl has focused on both developing new formulations as well as optimizing them different formulations are required to address the needs of different applications most of the methods using these formulations propose to learn the combined kernels by tuning automatically the kernel weights g onen and early work focused on learning the kernel as a linear combination of given base kernels non linear kernel combinations such as products of kernels and mixtures of polynomials have also been shown to be appropriate in certain domains many of these formulations can be easily cast in the generalized mkl gmkl framework proposed in in the pirna prediction_problem the use of multiple kernels makes it possible to propose a modular and extensible method thus new kernels representing newly_discovered pirna characteristics can easily be added because the research on pirnas is at its beginning it is important to have methods that can integrate new knowledge about this rna the multiple kernel method also has the advantage of allowing exploration of characteristics even when these are not yet validated which is helpful in this context thus it could be possible to ignore an implemented kernel if it turns out not to be useful and or corresponds to a false knowledge our method is therefore adaptive the user being able to consider the appropriate kernels according to the data type and studied species to summarize we have developed an extensible and adaptive classification_method for pirna prediction which is distinct from the existing_methods in several aspects i several kernels that represent heterogeneous feature_sets are built and used ii a new type of feature is explored iii the characteristic of pirnas to occur in clusters on the chromosome is coded in a kernel to use it in a supervised way and iv a non linear classifier approach is used which is more suitable for real_world data here we describe our multiple kernel_based svm algorithm called pirpred and we report the results that we have obtained that are promising the present study aimed at the development of a novel algorithm for the identification of pirna sequences we propose a multiple kernel fusion and an svm based_approach that allows to use heterogeneous features each kernel implementing a class of features our approach is therefore modular extensible and adaptive allowing the implementation of new features or the use of more appropriate ones depending on the species in the context of pirnas which have not been studied as extensively as mirnas for instance it is appreciable to be able to take into account new knowledge and discoveries on these rnas because of the lack of known conserved characteristics of pirna sequences except the occurrence of a uridine base at the first position and structure there is no known structure for pirnas their identification by computational_methods is a difficult_task to our knowledge only one computational_method based on k_mer motifs has been reported in the literature for pirna prediction two other methods have been reported based on the characteristic of pirnas to occur in clusters in the genome which identify pirna clusters from deep sequencing_data in the present study we have provided a few new elements we have suggested and confirmed a new feature for pirna identification which is the distance to telomere centromere regions which was reported on drosophila we then tested this feature in combination with previously_published features in the context of a modular algorithm and surprisingly we were able to identify its utility not only in drosophila but also in human last we provide a computational_tool for pirna identification that gives better results than the previously_published zhang et_al method one of our further perspectives is to continue our investigation by finding other characteristics of pirnas that would allow us to define new kernels and thus to improve the prediction results we plan for instance to consider a characteristic of pirna clusters highlighted by a computational_analysis performed in the mouse by who suggest that of pirna clusters are bracketed by inverted_repeats of varying length one of our other perspectives for improving our classification results is to perform the training step on all known pirnas i e on pirna sequences of pirnabank and to build kernels with all these sequences for this classification_problem with large training_dataset accuracy training and testing speed andnote tp true_positive
