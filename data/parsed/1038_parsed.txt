co expression analysis of high_throughput transcriptome sequencing_data with poisson mixture models_motivation in recent_years gene_expression studies have increasingly made use of high through put sequencing_technology in turn research concerning the appropriate statistical_methods for the analysis of digital gene_expression dge has flourished primarily in the context of normalization and differential analysis results in this work we focus on the question of clustering dge profiles as a means to discover groups of co expressed genes we propose a poisson_mixture using a rigorous framework for parameter_estimation as well as the choice of the appropriate number of clusters we illustrate co expression analyses using our approach on two real rna_seq a set of simulation_studies also compares the performance of the proposed model with that of several related approaches developed to cluster rna_seq or serial_analysis data availability and and implementation the proposed method is implemented in the open_source r package htscluster available on cran the application of high_throughput hts to the study of gene_expression has revolutionized the scope and depth of understanding of the genome epigenome and transcriptome of dozens of organisms in particular the recent use of hts technologies to sequence ribonucleic_acid content rna_seq has rivaled the use of microarrays for transcriptomic studies as it offers a way to quantify gene_expression without prior_knowledge of the genome_sequence by providing counts of transcripts although both technologies seem to be complementary rna_seq can provide information about the transcriptome at a level of detail not possible with microarrays including allele_specific and transcript discovery although a variety of different protocols exist for hts studies the same broad preprocessing_steps are followed namely if an appropriate genome_sequence reference is available reads are mapped to the genome or transcriptome otherwise de_novo may be used after alignment or assembly read_coverage for a given biological entity e g a gene is subsequently calculated the quantification of gene_expression in rna_seq remains an v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com active area of research and in this work we focus on measures of digital gene_expression dge counts these count_based measures of gene_expression differ substantially from data produced with microarrays for example rna_seq are discrete positive and highly_skewed with a very large_dynamic in addition due to the sampling nature of sequencing low precision tends to be observed for weakly to moderately expressed genes finally sequencing_depth i e the library size and coverage vary between experiments and read_counts are known to be correlated with gene length to date most developments concerning the statistical_analysis of rna_seq have dealt with the issues of experimental_design normalization and the analysis of differential_expression in this work we focus on the question of co expression analyses for rna_seq identifying biological_entities that share similar profiles across several treatment conditions such as coexpressed genes may help identify groups of genes that are involved in the same biological_processes clustering analyses based on metric criteria such as the k means algorithm and hierarchical_clustering have been used to cluster microarray_based measures of gene_expression as they are rapid simple and stable however such methods require both the choice of metric and criterion to be optimized as well as the selection of the number of clusters an alternative to such methods are probabilistic clustering models where the objects to be classified genes are considered to be a sample of a random vector and a clustering of the data is obtained by analyzing the density of this vector presently most proposals for clustering rna_seq have focused on grouping together biological_samples rather than biological_entities e g genes for example anders and huber perform a hierarchical_clustering with a euclidean_distance of samples following a variance stabilizing transformation andcluster fourteen diverse tissues of soybean using hierarchical_clustering with pearson_correlation after normalizing the data using a variation of the reads per kilobase per_million rpkm measure discussed the clustering of samples using hierarchical_clustering with a modified loglikelihood ratio statistic as distance measure based on a poisson loglinear model this model is similar to that offor the clustering of serial_analysis sage gene profiles using a k means algorithm and a poisson loglinear model more recently considered poisson and negative_binomial mixture_models to develop a modelbased hybrid hierarchical clustering_algorithm in this work like we focus on the use of poisson loglinear models for the clustering of countbased hts expression_profiles however rather than using such a model to define a distance_metric to be used in a k means or hierarchical clustering_algorithm we make use of finite mixtures of poisson loglinear models this framework has the advantage of providing a straightforward procedure for parameter_estimation and model_selection as well as a per gene conditional_probability of belonging to each cluster for each simulated dataset in the two settings fly and human liver htscluster and the methods described in section were fit over a range of possible numbers of clusters k with model_selection performed using the slope heuristics htscluster poisl or the ch index witten si nb si pois in addition for all competing approaches the model with the true number of clusters k was also included models were subsequently compared using the adjusted rand index ari and the estimated number of clusters k shown in tables and respectively the oracle ari is also included for comparison based on the assignment of observations to components maximizing the conditional_probability using the true parameter_values in the poisson_mixture in both simulation_settings considered here we note that a major_difficulty for the alternative_methods is the choice of the number of clusters to be included the witten si pois and si nb methods all exhibit significantly_lower ari values when model_selection is performed using the ch index as compared to when the true number of clusters is fixed this difficulty appears to be especially pronounced for the witten approach where ari values for the model selected using the ch index is less than in both simulation_settings and the selected number of clusters is significantly_underestimated for the si pois and si nb methods the ch index also tends to underestimate the number of clusters present in the data although this trend is less marked than for the witten approach particularly in the human simulated_data in the case of the poisl approach although the slope heuristics approach appears to generally yield an appropriate estimate of k in both simulation_settings the corresponding ari values tend to be lower than those attained by thehtscluster approach even when the number of clusters is fixed to the true value the competiting methods tend to have equivalent or smaller ari values than the models selected via slope heuristics for the proposed htscluster approach in spite of the fact that all approaches with the exception of si nb and k means also make use of an underlying poisson_model in other words if the true number of clusters is known the performance of the si pois and si nb approaches is quite good and very nearly attains that of the oracle model however when the number of clusters must be estimated from the data as is typically the case in real applications htscluster has much stronger performance than the competing_methods on these simulated_data model_selection via the slope heuristics for the htscluster approach leads to a slight overestimation of the number of clusters but these slightly more complex models have ari values close to those found using the oracle poisson_mixture finally we note that the clustering task in the human liver setting where only two conditions are present appears to bein this work we have proposed a method and associated r package htscluster to cluster count_based dge profiles based on a poisson_mixture that enables the use of a rigorous framework for parameter_estimation through the em_algorithm and model_selection through the slope heuristics the model is parameterized to account for several characteristics of rna_seq including i a set of normalization factors s jl to account for systematic_differences in library size among biological_replicates ii a per gene offset parameter w i to account for differences among genes due to overall expression_level and iii a condition specific cluster effect k jk as the marginal sums of each gene are fixed in the model variations in expression among experimental_conditions may be modeled throughout the extremely large_dynamic of dge typical of rna_seq in particular this parameterization enables a straightforward interpretation of the model as k jk s j corresponds to the proportion of reads attributed to condition j in cluster k a co expression analysis on two sets of real rna_seq highlighted the functionality of htscluster in practice in particular with respect to model_selection and visualization of overall cluster behavior finally the processing time and memory_requirements ofhtscluster reflect the fact that parameter_estimation must be performed over a large set of models to enable model_selection one run of htscluster version took about minutes and used about mb of memory for the human liver data k and about h with mb of memory for the fly developmental data k all analyses were run on a dell latitude e quad core ghz intel r core tm with gb ram running a bit version of windows professional as previously mentioned htscluster shares some similarities with other related approaches although there are several key differences first we note that both poisl and witten also make use of an underlying poisson_model however rather than using a finite mixture_model the former uses a k means algorithm based on the loglikelihood and the latter applies a hierarchical_clustering procedure based on a pairwise dissimilarity matrix of dimension n n on the other hand suggest the construction of a hierarchical tree of either poisson si pois or negative_binomial si nb mixture_models with an alternative parameterization to that proposed here contrary to all of these alternative related approaches the htscluster approach provides a straightforward and robust way to choose the number of clusters present in a given dataset a set of simulation_studies with parameters selected based on two real_datasets allowed a comparison of htscluster with the aforementioned related approaches in a controlled scenario these simulations highlighted the importance of an appropriate procedure to perform model_selection as well as the satisfactory_performance of htscluster in the objective of clustering and estimating the number of clusters in addition even when the number of clusters was fixed to the true value we found that the alternative_methods were generally observed to have similar or lower ari values than htscluster however conclusions from these simulations should be drawn with some caution particularly as the data were simulated based on a mixture of poisson distributions a great_deal of discussion has focused on the most appropriate way to simulate rna_seq in the context of differential_expression and for the time being this remains_an for co expression analyses finally we note that in the context of differential_expression the scientific_community has generally focused on the use of negative_binomial due to the large_variability typically observed among replicates for a fixed gene this so_called overdispersion is modeled via the inclusion of a common dispersion parameter or a per gene dispersion parameter i typically estimated using a shrinkage approach or a parametric regression fit across all genes the si nb approach recently attempted to apply a similar approach to the task of co expression analysis through a finite_mixture of negative_binomial where i is estimated from the data using a quasi likelihood approach and treated as fixed in the mixture however for co expression analyses it is difficult to estimate these per gene dispersion parameters in practice due to the small number of replicates typically available in experiments concerning multiple conditions a useful direction for future_research may be to define a mixture of negative_binomial in which information about this dispersion parameter is shared among genes belonging to the same cluster
