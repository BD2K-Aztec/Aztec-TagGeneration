systems_biology spnconverter a new link between static and dynamic complex network_analysis the signaling petri_net spn simulator designed to provide insights into the trends of molecules activity levels in response to an external stimulus contributes to the systems_biology necessity of analyzing the dynamics of large_scale cellular_networks implemented into the freely_available software biolayout express d the simulator is publicly_available and easy to use provided the input_files are prepared in the graphml format typically using the network editing software yed and standards specific to the software however analysis of complex_networks represented using other systems_biology formatting languages on which popular software such as celldesigner and cytoscape are based requires manual manipulation a step that is prone to error and limits the use of the spn simulator in biolayout express d to overcome this we present a cytoscape plug in that enables users to automatically convert networks for analysis with the spn simulator from the standard systems_biology the automation of this step opens the spn simulator to a far larger user group than has previously been possible there are typically two approaches with respect to the analysis of biological_networks the first is to analyze the network in its static form determining key features of the network the second concerns analysis of the network_dynamics which due to the computationally heavy process involved in quantifying kinetic_parameters is typically restricted to small_scale networks however petri_nets pns allow for the study of dynamics without the need to have detailed information on the kinetics in this direction the signaling petri_net spn simulator first described in overcomes the aforementioned problem by adapting pns to biological simulations characterizing the dynamics of signal flow through a signaling_network using token distribution and sampling spns allow one to analyze the dynamics of large_scale networks by providing insights into the trends of molecules activity levels in response to an external stimulus by representing a complex network as a pn the spn method models signal flow as the pattern of token accumulation at places proteins over time transitions in the network represent directed protein interactions where each transition models the effect of a source protein on a target protein by allowing tokens to pass through transition gates the number of tokens assigned to the target called token count varies thus modeling the way that signals propagate through protein interactions in cellular signaling_networks the described spn simulator has since been adopted and adapted for use in biolayout express d a powerful_tool for the visualization and analysis of network graphs within biolayout express d the user has the option to run the spn simulator over biological_networks strictly input in graphml format and drawn as bipartite graphs comprising places transitions and edges currently the network editing software yed http www yworks com is one of the few that recognizes graphs in standard formats xml xls gml and xgml compatible with sbml friendly software such as cytoscape and thus celldesigner however this preparation stage requires manual insertion of transition gates between molecules a step that particularly for the large maps that spn is designed to run on is both cumbersome and prone to error to overcome_this we have developed spnconverter a new application for cytoscape which prepares molecular_networks for analysis in the spn simulator in biolayout express d as the cytoscape plug in binom transforms celldesigner networks into cytoscape ones spnconverter can be efficiently used on both widespread standards filling in the missing_link between analysis of complex_networks in their static form and analysis of the dynamics of large_scale networks
