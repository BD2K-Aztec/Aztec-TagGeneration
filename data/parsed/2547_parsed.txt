genetics_and interrogating local population_structure for fine_mapping in genome_wide adjustment for population_structure is necessary to avoid bias in genetic_association of susceptibility variants for complex_diseases population_structure may differ from one genomic_region to another due to the variability of individual ancestry associated with migration random genetic_drift or natural_selection current association methods for correcting population_stratification usually involve adjustment of global ancestry between study subjects results we suggest interrogating local population_structure for fine_mapping to more accurately locate true casual genes by better adjusting the confounding_effect due to local_ancestry by extensive simulations on genome_wide datasets we show that adjusting global ancestry may lead to false_positives when local population_structure is an important confounding_factor in contrast adjusting local_ancestry can effectively prevent false_positives due to local population_structure and thus can improve fine_mapping for disease gene localization we applied the local and global adjustments to the analysis of datasets from three genome_wide including european_americans african_americans and nigerians both european_americans and african_americans demonstrate greater_variability in local_ancestry than nigerians adjusting local_ancestry successfully eliminated the known spurious association between snps in the lct gene and height due to the population_structure existed in european_americans unrecognized population_structure can potentially lead to both false_positive findings in genetic_association current statistical_method used to adjust population to whom correspondence should be addressed stratification in genetic_association often focus on adjusting global population_structure which is mainly caused by recent migration and genetic random drift global population_structure can be characterized as an individuals global ancestry calculated as the proportion of the individuals genome inherited from a given ancestral population in contrast local population_structure can be characterized in a similar way but in local genomic_region or at a locus a popular procedure to eliminate the effect of population_structure is the genomic control gc approach which assumes that the variance inflation_factor of a test_statistic is a constant across the genome however variance inflation can also be due to locus specific attributes for example the imprint of natural_selection has recently been identified in many regions across the genome and can create substantial variation in f st which in turn affects the degree of variance inflation for specific_loci thus the gc approach will eliminate the effect due to the global population_structure but may not be effective in eliminating the effect due to local population_structure an alternative method to correct population_structure is based on the principal_components pcs of the genotypes in which the pcs of the genotype score matrix of many markers across the entire_genome referred to as global pcs hereafter are used to represent individual ancestry background and used as covariates in association analysis various studies have shown that the global pcs can effectively represent human demographic_history cavalli however local genomic_regions harboring functional_variants may be subject to subtle forms of population_structure not only as a result of demographic_history but natural_selection and local random fluctuations of admixture in genome_wide numerous markers are usually tested one at a time the test of a non causal maker locus which is dependent of a causal gene may be confounded by a pathway leading through both global and local ancestries the dependence between a non causal marker and a causal gene may due to short range or long_range ld short range ld may exist when two loci are nearby long_range ld might exist between two genes in different chromosomes i e due to co evolution page the pathways which confound the relationship between a non causative marker g and phenotype y a single arrowed line indicates correlation which is possibly directive i e d to y and a double arrowed line indicates correlation only population history determines local ancestries g d and their correlation i e g and d can be correlated if markers g and d are close to each other population admixture or co evolution occurred on both regions local ancestries impact the variations of and the allele_frequencies of g and d and d and directly impact phenotypic_variation therefore both global and local ancestries may confound gy relationship g may impact phenotypic_variation either indirectly a due to correlation or directly b due to natural_selection adjusting g can effectively control the type_i due to the confounding by both g and adjusting alone may not well control type_i especially when g directly confounds the gy association
