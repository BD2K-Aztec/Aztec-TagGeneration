genome_analysis chimerascan a tool for identifying chimeric transcription in sequencing_data next_generation ngs_technologies have enabled de_novo gene_fusion discovery that could reveal candidates with therapeutic_significance in cancer here we present an open_source software_package chimerascan for the discovery of chimeric transcription between two independent transcripts in high_throughput transcriptome sequencing_data high_throughput rna_seq facilitates detection of aberrant chimeric rnas methods for chimera detection have already uncovered recurrent classes of clinically_relevant gene_fusions in prostate and lymphoid cancers therefore the continued development of accurate and efficient software_tools for chimera discovery is of major clinical_significance to this end we have developed a chimera discovery methodology or chimerascan and offer it as open_source software_package for the community to utilize for their own sequencing_efforts chimerascan includes features such as the ability to process long bp paired_end processing of ambiguously mapping reads detection of reads spanning a fusion junction integration with the popular bowtie aligner supports the standardized sam format and generation of html reports for easy investigation of results overall we believe that the chimerascan will facilitate the discovery of additional gene_fusions that may serve as clinically_relevant targets in cancer to evaluate the results from chimerascan we applied it to three well characterized cancer_cell known to harbor multiple chimeric_transcripts vcap prostate_cancer bp lncap prostate_cancer bp and mcf breast_cancer bp sequence_data are deposited in genbank under the accession_number gse we aligned to human_genome vr hg and ucsc known transcripts allowing for up to two mismatches and no alignments per read the trimmed alignment step was performed with bp segments as our initial benchmark we confirmed that chimerascan was able to recapitulate experimentally_validated candidates our gold_standard supplementary chimerascan was able to detect and chimeras from vcap lncap and mcf respectively in addition to recapitulating previously_reported results we have identified novel candidates that demonstrate chimerascans ability to identify and prioritize high_quality chimeras overall chimerascan nominated novel chimeras in vcap in lncap and in mcf from the three cell_lines supplementary interestingly we detected an interchromosomal rearrangement tbl xr rgs detected in the mcf cell_line while not originally_reported within ngs_data tbl xr rgs was previously detected by a paired_end ditag approach and experimentally confirmed another novel candidate was the intrachromosomal rearrangement ndufaf mast in vcap that is supported by just two encompassing reads and one spanning reads the ability to identify a high_quality spanning read that uniquely confirms the fusion junction supplementary thereby increasing our confidence in ndufaf mast demonstrates the sensitivity of chimerascan we next compared chimerascan with publicly_available tools defuse shortfuse and mapsplice using the experimentally_validated vcap chimeras supplementary while defuse nominated the fewest chimeras it only detected of the true_positives in comparison chimerascan detected of the true_positives from predicted chimeras of the remaining programs mapsplice nominated chimeras while detecting of the true_positives and shortfuse nominated chimeras while confirming of the true_positives overall these results suggest that chimerascan is among the more stringent programs while enriching for true_positives here we present an optimized publicly_available chimera discovery methodology for identifying novel therapeutically targetable gene_fusions in human_cancers our results suggest that chimerascan produces a stringent list of predictions that are enriched with true_positives furthermore due to its trimmed alignment steps we believe chimerascan will be scalable when longer_reads are available to provide increased coverage of fusion junctions overall we feel that with the existing features chimerascan is a user_friendly that will enable other research groups to make discoveries within their own rna_seq collections
