sequence_analysis identification of hidden relationships from the coupling of hydrophobic cluster_analysis and domain_architecture information motivation describing domain_architecture is a critical step in the functional characterization of proteins however some orphan domains do not match any profile stored in dedicated domain databases and are thereby difficult to analyze results we present here an original novel approach called tremolo hca for the analysis of orphan domain_sequences and inspired from our experience in the use of hydrophobic cluster_analysis hca hidden relationships between protein_sequences can be more easily_identified from the psi_blast results using information on domain_architecture hca plots and the conservation degree of amino_acids that may participate in the protein core this can lead to reveal remote relationships with known families of domains as illustrated here with the identification of a hidden tudor tandem in the human bahcc protein and a hidden et domain in the saccharomyces_cerevisiae taf p and human af proteins the results obtained in such a way are consistent with those provided by hhpred based on pairwise_comparisons of hhms our approach can however be applied even in absence of domain profiles or known d structures for the identification of novel families of domains it can also be used in a reverse way for refining domain profiles by starting from known protein_domain and identifying highly_divergent members hitherto considered as orphan availability we provide a possible integration of this approach in an open tremolo hca package which is fully implemented in python v and is available on request instructions are available atorphan domains are segments of proteins forming autonomous folding units that cannot be assigned to a known domain_family as stored in dedicated domain databases they may be included in large unassigned regions which make up at least of the residues in a typical proteome these orphan domains have either evolved too far from the nearest_neighbors to be assigned to a domain or they have been created by some de_novo mechanisms most of the solved d structures of orphan domains however show structural_similarity to already known protein_domains suggesting that the fraction of orphan domains that have distant homologs is high this is consistent with earlier theoretical_studies which have suggested that protein_domains fall into a limited number of protein_folds and families the distant homolog theory is also supported by the identification of remote_homologs to orphan domains through sequences from environmental sequencing_projects although these metagenomics studies also revealed many novel orphans a lot of specific analyses led to link orphan domains to already known families or to identify new families of domains among these studies are those we performed using the fold signatures defined through the hydrophobic cluster_analysis hca approach e g for some examples hca is based on a bidimensional representation of the sequence in which hydrophobic amino_acids congregate into clusters which are statistically centered on regular secondary_structures hydrophobic clusters associated with core secondary_structures are stable relative to evolution offering a way to efficiently compare sequences at very low levels of sequence_identity see supplementary data s for a detailed_description of the method and its practical use here we wished to develop a methodology inspired from our experience in deciphering orphan domains which facilitates the detection of distant relationships with already known families of domains by automatic inference from the psi_blast results this methodology called tremolo hca after travel into remote homology with hca allows an easier exploitation of results from sequence similarity_search programs e g psiblast by providing contextual domain_architecture and structural conserved hydrophobic_core information it furnishes for each sequence aligned with the query the domain_architecture of the whole protein as well as indicates the conservation degree of amino_acids that may participate in the protein fold the interest of the methodology is illustrated with two examples of conserved_domain cdd orphan domains which were first delineated from the whole protein_sequence by using our experience in hca coupled with a home made program called seg hca our unpublished_data developed for to whom correspondence should be addressed the automatic hca based delineation of globular_domains from the analysis of single sequences the methodology_developed here for easier domain inference from the psi_blast results provides contextual domain_architecture and structural conserved hydrophobic_core information protein domain_architectures can indeed give useful information about the functional context in which the query_sequence can be present the remote relationships of orphan sequences to already known families of domains revealed here were also highlighted by the sensitive hhpred program based on pairwise_comparisons of hhms our approach can however be applied even in absence of cdd profiles or known d structures for identifying novel families of domains it can also be used in a reverse way for refining cdd profiles by starting from known protein_domain and identifying highly_divergent members hitherto considered as orphan hence starting with the tudor profile or with the sequence of the bdrd et domain for which the experimental d structure is known we were able to identify the remote relationships to human bahcc and yeast taf p revisiting systematically the cdd profiles using such an approach could thus lead to significant_enhancement of their sensitivity for detecting remote relationships information about positions of the alignment for which hydrophobicity is conserved in homologous_sequences is especially useful to get insight into the likelihood of structural_relationships for alignments that are reported with non significant e values in the psi_blast results which have generally to be further supported by other information the conservation of core secondary_structures over the whole domain and not limited to one or a few ones as assessed by considering these positions and comparing the corresponding hydrophobic clusters are thus an important factor for assessing the relevance of marginal similarities in this context hca can be rewarding for detecting similarities outside the first limits detected by psi_blast independently of the presence of variable indels that are generally difficult to handle by alignment procedures see supplementary data s and s for application examples of course the methodology described here and applied to the analysis of psi_blast results may also be adapted to process results coming from other methods for remote_homology such as hhpred hhblits or hmmer
