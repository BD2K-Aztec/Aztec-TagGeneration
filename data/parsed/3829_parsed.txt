structural_bioinformatics quality_assessment of protein model structures using evolutionary_conservation motivation programs that evaluate the quality of a protein structural model are important both for validating the structure_determination procedure and for guiding the model_building process such programs are based on properties of native structures that are generally not expected for faulty models one such property which is rarely used for automatic structure quality_assessment is the tendency for conserved_residues to be located at the structural core and for variable residues to be located at the surface results we present conquass a novel quality_assessment program based on the consistency between the model structure and the proteins conservation pattern we show that it can identify problematic structural_models and that the scores it assigns to the server models in casp correlate with the similarity of the models to the native_structure we also show that when the conservation information is reliable the methods performance is comparable and complementary to that of the other single structure quality_assessment methods that participated in casp and that do not use additional structural_information from homologs availability a perl implementation of the method as well as the various perl and r scripts used for the analysis are available atthe function of a protein is largely determined by its d structure therefore the determination of a proteins structure is an important step in understanding how the protein achieves its function and it can also aid in predicting protein_function or designing experiments however experimental structure_determination can be a long and difficult procedure and naturally errors may occur this was recently demonstrated when several protein_structures published in the protein_data pdb were discovered to be erroneous even when the structure_determination process is correct the determined structure may adopt a non physiological fold for example due to non physiological constraints imposed by the crystal in the case of x_ray such errors can cause confusion and to whom correspondence should be addressed mislead further research so it is important to be able to spot them before the structures are published errors are even more frequent in computationally derived structures which are built either by extrapolating from a homologous protein whose structure is already solved or by computer simulation in the latter case many alternative conformations might be generated during the simulation and differentiating between erroneous conformations and structures that are more likely to be correct could help guide the simulation and limit the search_space programs that try to numerically assess the correctness of a given structural model for a protein are called model_quality programs mqaps the need for such programs is widely_recognized by the structural_biology community as evidenced by the inclusion of a category for assessing mqap performance in the biennial critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp experiment starting from its seventh round casp the two pioneering mqaps still widely used today are verify d and prosa both methods check the compatibility between the proteins structure and its sequence verify d for example classifies each residue in the protein into one of the classes according to the residues structural environment in the input model the propensity of each amino_acid to exist in each such structural environment class is calculated according to statistics collected from structures in the pdb and the final score given to the protein_structure is the sum of propensities of the individual_residues newer mqaps were recently assessed in the blind experiments of casp and casp the models given as input to the mqaps were the server models which are generated by the various servers participating in casp shortly after the round starts and long before the native structures are published many of the participating mqaps including qmean and multicom refine functioned similarly to verify d and prosa receiving only one structure as input and assigning it a quality_score based on the compatibility of various features computed from the sequence with the predicted d structure however the most successful mqaps in casp were the consensus based_methods such as pcons and modfoldclust which used as input the entire decoy set instead of just coordinates of a given model and took a consensus approach to rate each model according to how similar it was to the other structures in the set this approach while clearly advantageous in the setting of the casp experiment is not applicable in many scenarios in whichpage here we have presented conquass a very simple mqap based directly on the compatibility between the conservation and accessibility patterns of a given structural model we studied the scores that conquass assigns to experimental_structures demonstrated its ability to discern erroneous models and checked the relation between the conquass scores given to different models and the models resemblance to the native_structure we have also shown that conquasss performance is comparable to that of other pure single structure mqaps despite being much simpler than most our approach is different from previous mqaps that used evolutionary_conservation which were based on the spatial clustering of the conserved_residues we feel our approach is more direct since this clustering is mostly an effect of the conserved_residues tendency to be buried in the structural core for a direct comparison with the method developed by mihalek and coworkers see supplementary section s conquass is also the first conservation based_approach to be rigorously compared with contemporary mqaps in addition our score is based on summation of information that is local in the structure the propensity of the conservation class of each residue for its accessibility class so it should be adaptable to provide a local quality_score for each residue of the structure as is done by local quality assessment_tools preliminary tests for a local mqap based on summing the propensities over a fixed width window on the sequence have yielded promising results data not shown in this study we have clearly shown that evolutionary_conservation is a powerful property for use in model_quality so it would be advantageous for new mqaps to integrate this property with other more commonly used properties evolutionary_conservation is currently not used directly by any mqap although some methods like qmean and multicom use it indirectly by comparing model surface accessibilities with the predicted accessibilities which are associated in part with the evolutionary_conservation however we have demonstrated that these methods do not use the conservation information to its full extent as their results improve when their scores are integrated with page
