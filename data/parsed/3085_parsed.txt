systems_biology mosaic making biological sense of complex_networks we present a cytoscape_plugin called mosaic to support interactive network annotation partitioning layout and coloring based on gene_ontology or other relevant annotations availability mosaic is distributed for free under the apache v open_source and can be downloaded via the cytoscape_plugin manager a detailed user_manual is available on the mosaic web_site nrnb org tools mosaic the increasing throughput and quality of molecular measurements in the domains of genomics proteomics and metabolomics continue to fuel the understanding of biological_processes collected per molecule the scope of these data extends to physical genetic and biochemical_interactions that in turn comprise extensive networks there are software_tools available to visualize and analyze dataderived biological_networks one challenge faced by these tools is how to make sense of such networks often represented as massive hairballs many network_analysis algorithms filter or partition networks based on topological_features optionally weighted by orthogonal node or edge data another approach is to mathematically model networks and rely on their statistical_properties to make associations with other networks phenotypes and drug effects sidestepping the issue of making sense of the network itself altogether acknowledging that there is still great value in engaging the minds of researchers in exploratory_data at the level of networks we have produced a cytoscape_plugin called mosaic to support interactive network annotation and visualization that includes partitioning layout and coloring based on biologically_relevant ontologies mosaic shows slices of a given network in the visual language of biological_pathways which are familiar to any biologist and are ideal frameworks for integrating knowledge cytoscape is a free_and network_visualization platform that actively supports independent plugin development for annotation mosaic relies primarily on the full gene_ontology go or simplified slim versions http to whom correspondence should be addressed www geneontology org go slims shtml the cellular layout of partitioned subnetworks strictly depends on the cellular_component branch of go but the other two functions partitioning and coloring can be driven by any annotation associated with a major gene or protein identifier system mosaic provides researchers with an interactive tool to evaluate biological_interactions within the context of well defined processes functions and cellular_localization while retaining all original network information use of additional ontologies is anticipated to provide further insights into the relevance of large_scale interaction datasets and will be supported in future versions
