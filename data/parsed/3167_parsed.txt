systems_biology multi_scale computational_modeling of developmental_biology motivation normal development of multicellular_organisms is regulated by a highly complex process in which a set of precursor_cells proliferate differentiate and move forming over time a functioning tissue to handle their complexity developmental systems can be studied over distinct scales the dynamics of each scale is determined by the collective_activity of entities at the scale below it results i describe a multi_scale computational_approach for modeling developmental systems and detail the methodology through a synthetic example of a developmental system that retains key features of real developmental systems i discuss the simulation of the system as it emerges from cross scale and intra scale interactions and describe how an in silico study can be carried_out by modifying these interactions in a way that mimics in vivo experiments i highlight biological_features of the results through a comparison with findings in caenorhabditis_elegans germline development and finally discuss about the applications of the approach in real developmental systems and propose future extensions availability_and the source_code of the model of the synthetic developmental system can be found in www wisdom weizmann ac il yaki multiscalemodel contact many developmental systems in multicellular_organisms are regulated by a small set of precursor_cells that proliferate differentiate and move to form a functioning tissue developmental systems embody a highly_dynamic and complex process which advances in numerous individual cells simultaneously molecular_interactions over a complex regulatory_network drive the development by orchestrating cell extrinsic cues and cell_intrinsic regulation however due to hurdles in in vivo experimentations data in developmental_biology are largely static and the granularity of knowledge about timing and function of cellular_mechanisms remains coarse analysis and study of developmental systems can be done over distinct scales organism tissue cell molecule gene etc to whom correspondence should be addressed these scales are not merely a matter of zooming in and out rather scales introduce the concept of emergent behavior the behavior at a specific scale that is not explicitly expressed in any of the elements at the lower scale and results from their collective_activity the activity of a tissue for example emerges from the collective_activity of the individual cells that comprise it similarly cell activity emerges from the collective molecular_interactions over the regulatory_network three hierarchical scales molecular cellular and tissue are important in the analysis of developmental systems at the molecular_scale an intracellular regulatory_network controls molecular_mechanisms such as gene_expression receptor activity and protein_degradation above the molecular_scale is the cellular scale where each individual cell decides on its next developmental step i e proliferation fate determination and motility further above is the tissue level where the cell_population acts in concert to develop its anatomy and function activity at each scale drives behaviors at the above and below scales for instance interactions in the regulatory_network at the molecular_scale determine at the cellular scale individual cell decision_making these in turn collectively stimulate anatomical formation at the tissue scale conversely the position of a cell in the tissue determines which cell extrinsic cues it detects and the decisions it makes a change in elements at one scale may significantly affect the activity at other scales resulting in an altered development multi_scale modeling is gaining increased focus in computational_biology it served to study various biological_systems including the electrical_activity of the heart the function of the lungs and the multi physical phenomena that govern cortical_bone behavior however most of these studies focus on function and physiology of the adult tissue and often do not handle dynamic aspects of the development the approach presented here tackles dynamics and emergence in the process of development the approach models developmental systems by structuring known biological_information in designated elements in each scale i molecular_mechanisms implicated in the regulatory_network are formalized at the molecular_scale ii proliferation fate determination and motility are defined as decisionmaking at the cellular scale and iii anatomic constraints and cell extrinsic cues are defined at the tissue scale in a grid that overlays the structure cross scale interactions are modeled as events that emanate from element in one scale and are translated to events at the other scales the collective intra and cross scale events
