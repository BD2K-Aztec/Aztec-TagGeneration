data_and cistromefinder for chip_seq data reuse chromatin_immunoprecipitation and dnase_i hypersensi tivity assays with high_throughput have greatly accelerated the understanding of transcriptional and epigenetic_regulation although data reuse for the community of experimental biologists has been challenging we created a data portal cistromefinder that can help query evaluate and visualize publicly_available chromatin_immunoprecipitation and dnase_i assays with high_throughput sequencing_data in human and mouse the database currently contains samples over datasets factors and cell_lines or cell_populations each dataset has gone through a consistent analysis and quality_control pipeline therefore users could evaluate the overall quality of each dataset before examining binding_sites near their genes of interest cistromefinder is integrated with ucsc_genome for visualization primer plus for chip qpcr primer_design and cistromemap for submitting newly available datasets it also allows users to leave comments to facilitate data evaluation and update availability http cistrome org finder contact genome_wide mapping of transcription_factor and chromatin regulator binding histone_modifications and chromatin_accessibility is essential for elucidating the regulatory_network of various biological_processes chromatin_immunoprecipitation and dnase_i assays with high_throughput chip_seq have become essential techniques for studying transcriptional and epigenetic gene_regulation most chip_seq studies have raw_data available from public_repositories such as ncbi sequence_read however the raw_sequencing are usually in the order of gigabyte size per sample and data analysis is not only timeconsuming but also technically inhibitive for most experimental biologists even if investigators only want to check a few specific binding_sites near their genes of interest they need the computational_resources and expertise to download the raw_data conduct data analysis such as read_alignment peak_calling nearby gene assignment and many others in addition these public datasets are often of variable quality and bioinformatics novices do not often have the expertise to evaluate and compare different datasets although projects like encode encode_project and epigenome roadmap provide processed data online they only cover data from these projects we developed a web_portal called cistromefinder which contains the most comprehensive collection to date of public chip_seq data in human and mouse that have gone through a uniform data analysis and quality_control pipeline it enables investigators to query evaluate visualize and compare public chip_seq data and select specific binding_sites near genes of interest for functional studies cistromefinder provides a comprehensive catalogue and uniform processing of published chip_seq datasets the web_interface provides flexibility to search and visualize the binding of specified factors in various conditions near genes of interest investigators can use cistromefinder to check whether a gene could be the potential target of a transcription or chromatin factor in a specific conditions and design chip qpcr primers to validate the binding in other conditions we also give the users options to leave comments to help us evaluate datasets and submit new data through cistromemap to help keep the database up to date we will continue to maintain and improve cistromefinder as more chip dnase_seq data become available to facilitate the community in their transcriptional and epigenetic gene_regulation studies we keep the raw_data and the pipeline script in case we need to rerun all the data with newest algorithms we also use a version system for the pipeline to reproduce legacy results in the future we plan to combine cistrome analysis_pipeline with our chip dnase_seq data_collection therefore users could conduct integrative_analysis of their own data and public data funding national basic_research program of china national natural_science of china and national_institutes conflict of interest none declared
