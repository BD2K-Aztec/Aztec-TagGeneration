team efficient two locus epistasis tests in human genome_wide as a promising tool for identifying genetic_markers underlying phenotypic_differences genome_wide gwas has been extensively investigated in recent_years in gwas detecting epistasis or genegene_interaction is preferable over single locus study since many diseases are known to be complex_traits a brute_force search is infeasible for epistasis detection in the genome_wide scale because of the intensive computational_burden existing epistasis detection_algorithms are designed for dataset consisting of homozygous markers and small_sample in human study however the genotype may be heterozygous and number of individuals can be up to thousands thus existing_methods are not readily_applicable to human datasets in this article we propose an efficient algorithm team which significantly speeds up epistasis detection for human gwas our algorithm is exhaustive i e it does not ignore any epistatic interaction utilizing the minimum_spanning structure the algorithm incrementally updates the contingency_tables for epistatic tests without scanning all individuals our algorithm has broader applicability and is more efficient than existing_methods for large sample study it supports any statistical_test that is based on contingency_tables and enables both family_wise and false_discovery controlling extensive experiments show that our algorithm only needs to examine a small portion of the individuals to update the contingency_tables and it achieves at least an order of magnitude speed up over the brute_force approach genetic_association examines the statistical_correlation between an organisms genotype with its phenotype with the development of high_throughput technologies genetic_variation of human and other model_organisms has been measured at genome_wide scale as the most abundant source of genetic_variation the number of single_nucleotide snps in public_databases dbgap jax is up to millions genome_wide gwas has been shown to be a promising tool to locate the genetic_factors that cause phenotypic_differences epistasis or genegene_interaction detection has_received in complex_trait different from singlelocus approach the goal of two locus epistasis detection is to identify interacting snp_pairs that have strong association with the phenotype please refer to hirschhorn and hoh and ott andfor reviews of current_progress and challenges in epistasis detection in gwas to whom correspondence should be addressed there are two grand challenges in epistasis detection the first is to develop statistical_tests that can effectively capture the interaction between snps various tests have been proposed for two locus association study such as the chi_square likelihood_ratio and entropy based test another crucial challenge in two locus association study is the intensive computational_burden imposed by the enormous search_space suppose that there are n snps for m individuals the overall search_space of pairwise interactions is mn n the large number of tests also causes the multiple_testing controlling the familywise error_rate fwer and false_discovery fdr are standard ways to control the error_rate in the fwer and fdr controlling permutation_test is preferred over simple bonferroni_correction since many snps are correlated the correlation_structure among genotype profiles is preserved across permutations and is incorporated into permutation p value estimation the idea of permutation_test is to randomly shuffle the phenotype values among the individuals and recalculate the test_statistics the distribution of these test values are used to estimate the null_distribution permutation_test dramatically increases the search_space with k permutations the entire search_space of two locus association_mapping is kmn n consider a moderate gwas setting in which m n and k the size of the search_space is about apparently a brute_force enumeration of the search_space is infeasible and thus efficient algorithms are in demand although the computational challenge of epistasis detection has been well recognized the algorithmic development is still very limited for a small number of snps e g from tens to a few hundreds exhaustive algorithms that explicitly enumerate all possible snp combinations have been developed these methods are not scalable for genome_wide computing genetic_algorithm has been proposed this approach is heuristic which does not guarantee to find the optimal_solution to avoid explicitly exploring the entire search_space a common heuristic used in epistasis detection is a two step approach first a subset of snps are selected according to certain criteria then the selected snps are used for subsequent epistatic analysis however the snp screening process suffers from the same problem as the single locus approach snps with strong epistasis but low marginal_effects are likely to be filtered out recently the approach based on search_space pruning has been shown to be able to dramatically speed up the process of epistasis detection without compromising the optimality of the results fastanova and fastchi are specifically_designed for anova test and chi_square respectively the coe algorithm is a more general approach that is applicable to all convex tests utilizing an upper_bound derived for the test being used these algorithms only need to examine a small number of promising snp_pairs and prune the snp_pairs that are proven to have no strong association with the phenotype unlike heuristic approaches these algorithms are guaranteed to find the optimal_solution although these methods provide promising alternatives for gwas there are two major_drawbacks that limit their applicability first they are designed for relatively small_sample and only consider homozygous markers i e each snp can be represented as a binary variable in human study however the sample_size is usually large and most snps contain heterozygous genotypes and are coded using these make existing_methods intractable second although the fwer and the fdr are both widely used for error controlling existing_methods are designed only to control the fwer from a computational point_of the difference in the fwer and the fdr controlling is that to estimate fwer for each permutation only the maximum two locus test value is needed to estimate the fdr on the other hand for each permutation all two locus test values must be computed further details of the fwer and the fdr controlling are described in section in this article we propose an exhaustive algorithm team tree based epistasis association_mapping for efficient epistasis detection in human gwas team has several advantages over previous methods bullet it supports to both homozygous and heterozygous data bullet by exhaustively computing all two locus test values in permutation_test it enables both fwer and fdr controlling bullet it is applicable to all statistics based on the contingency_table previous methods are either designed for specific tests or require the test_statistics to satisfy certain property bullet experimental_results demonstrate that team is more efficient than existing_methods for large sample study team incorporates permutation_test for proper error controlling the key idea is to incrementally update the contingency_tables of two locus tests we show that only four of the observed_frequencies in the contingency_table need to be updated to compute the test value in the algorithm we build a minimum_spanning on the snps the nodes of the tree are snps each edge represents the genotype difference between the two connected snps this tree_structure can be utilized to speed up updating process for the contingency_tables a majority of the individuals are pruned and only a small portion are scanned to update the contingency_tables this is advantageous in human study which usually involves thousands of individuals extensive experimental_results demonstrate the efficiency of the team algorithm
