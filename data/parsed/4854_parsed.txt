viewdock tdw high_throughput visualization of virtual_screening results viewdock tdw is a modification of the pre_existing viewdock chimera extension http www cgl ucsf edu chimera used to visualize results of virtual_screening experiments by combing tdw hardware and an enhanced viewdock interface dozens of ligandprotein complexes are rendered simultaneously to parallelize the analysis of candidate ligands the viewdock tdw gui allows the user to easily and interactively manipulate the molecules on the tdw as an entire set a selected subset or a single ligandprotein complex and preserves all chimera functionality availability_and viewdock tdw is an open_source freely_available on the web atas an alternative to costly high_throughput empirical screening of millions of compounds virtual_screening has led to tremendous success in drug_discovery by computationally identifying compounds with higher probability of strong binding_affinity to the target protein these data are used to make informed decisions in constructing a shorter list of compounds to purchase and test in the lab significantly_reducing the cost and time to discovery growing databases of small_molecules and rigorous virtual_screening methods demand greater computational_resources high_performance solutions such as grid computing have proved to be useful tools but visual_analysis of resulting data remains as a bottleneck in the workflow visualizing hundreds to thousands of ligandprotein complexes one at a time limits a researchers ability to compare and contrast candidate compounds identifying details of chemical binding poses recurring or unique chemical moieties and false_positives are more likely when multiple structures are analyzed simultaneously whether this be two side_by or more than structures a tiled display wall tdw is a computing cluster with one or more displays tiles connected to each computer node of the cluster they are typically dedicated for visualization of large
