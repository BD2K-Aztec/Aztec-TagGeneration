sequence_analysis srma an r package for resequencing array data analysis sequencing by hybridization to oligonucleotides has evolved into an inexpensive reliable and fast technology for targeted_sequencing hundreds of human genes can now be sequenced within a day using a single hybridization to a resequencing microarray however several issues inherent to these arrays e g cross_hybridization variable probe target affinity cause sequencing_errors and have prevented more widespread applications we developed an r package for resequencing microarray_data analysis that integrates a novel statistical algorithm sequence robust multi array analysis srma for rare_variant detection with high_sensitivity false_negative fnr and accuracy false_positive fpr the srma package consists of five modules for quality_control data_normalization single array analysis multi array analysis and output analysis the entire workflow is efficient and identifies rare dna single_nucleotide and structural changes such as gene_deletions with high_accuracy and sensitivity availability http cran r project org to understand the specific dna_variants that contribute to the inheritance of human_diseases is a major_goal of human_genetics medical resequencing has greatly accelerated the identification of disease related dna_variants resequencing array technology utilizes differential hybridization of target dna to oligonucleotide_probes to decode individual dna_sequences it has been successful in identifying novel and very rare_variants in disease candidate_genes however low variant frequency bp variable data_quality as well as technical and experimental limitations have the potential to create sequencing_errors there is a need for improved statistical_methods for arraybased resequencing we have recently_developed sequence robust multi array analysis srma for resequencing array data analysis to whom correspondence should be addressed by improving preprocessing procedures borrowing strength across samples and targeting unique features of rare variations srma achieved a false_discovery of fpr fnr which is comparable to that of nextgeneration_sequencing here we have established an r package r development core called srma that fully implements these methods and provides an automated analysis_pipeline for medical resequencing array data with high_accuracy of calling rare_variants system requirements file structure package installation and a description of the analysis of resequencing array data are provided in the supplementary_material
