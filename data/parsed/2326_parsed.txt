identifying functional_modules in interaction networks through overlapping markov_clustering motivation in recent_years markov_clustering mcl has emerged as an effective algorithm for clustering biological networksfor instance clustering proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks to identify functional_modules however a limitation of mcl and its variants e g regularized mcl is that it only supports hard clustering often leading to an impedance mismatch given that there is often a significant_overlap of proteins across functional_modules results in this article we seek to redress this limitation we propose a soft variation of regularized mcl r mcl based on the idea of iteratively re executing r mcl while ensuring that multiple executions do not always converge to the same clustering result thus allowing for highly overlapped clusters the resulting algorithm denoted soft regularized markov_clustering is shown to outperform a range of extant state of the art approaches in terms of accuracy of identifying functional_modules on three real ppi_networks advances in technology have enabled scientists to determine identify and validate pairwise protein interactions through a range of experimental_approaches recently several highthroughput approaches have produced a large_scale of protein_protein ppi datasets these approaches include yeast_two protein co immunoprecipitation followed by mass_spectrometry ms protein chip technologies and tandem_affinity tap with ms such data have led researchers to discover protein functions through ppi_networks in which a node represents a protein and an edge mimics an interaction between two proteins a fundamental goal here is to discover functional_modules or protein_complexes in order to predict the function of unannotated proteins the fundamental concept of identifying functional_modules is that a pair of proteins interacting with each other has higher probability of sharing the same function than two proteins not interacting with each other the dense sub networks in a ppi_network can therefore be identified as functional_modules thus identifying functional_modules is similar to detecting communities clusters in a network graph however traditional community detection_algorithms are usually hard clustering_algorithms i e they produces non overlapped clusters whereas functional_modules are highly overlapped as a result a number of to whom correspondence should be addressed soft clustering_algorithms have been recently_proposed to identify functional_modules in a ppi_network and they can be grouped into three categories the first category includes algorithms such as peacock hub duplication and decaff these algorithms identify the bridge nodes at the beginning i e nodes belong to multiple clusters and then either duplicate or remove the bridge nodes from the network a hard clustering_algorithm is then applied on the modified network the problem with this approach is that only the identified bridge nodes can belong to multiple clusters and it is conflicted with the literature that a large fraction of proteins belong to multiple functional_modules for example in the yeast network in biogrid database there are proteins annotated by low_level gene_ontology go terms whose information content see sec is higher than and of proteins are annotated by at least two of these go terms algorithms in the second category adopt line graph transformation these algorithms first transform the input network into a line graph in which a node represents an edge in the original network then a hard clustering_algorithm is applied on the line graph so edges are clustered instead of nodes a node in the original network belongs to multiple clusters if its incident edges are clustered into different clusters it has been pointed_out in the literature that clustering edges has a similar issue as clustering nodes a bridge edge that connects nodes of different clusters can only be clustered into one cluster by the line graph technique furthermore while functional_modules are so highly overlapped that an interaction might belong to multiple modules these algorithms cannot successfully_identify all overlapped functional_modules algorithms in the third category aim to find local dense subnetworks instead of globally clustering a graph each node forms a singleton cluster at the beginning and then each cluster iteratively adds a neighbor node according to different criteria algorithms in this category include mcode cfinder dpclus ipca monet core coach dme rrw nwe spici hunter and hc pin although the resulting clusters could be highly overlapped one main_drawback of those algorithms is that the criterion for adding a node usually considers relatively local topology given that ppi_networks are estimated to be quite noisy these algorithms could add several nodes connected by noisy edges
