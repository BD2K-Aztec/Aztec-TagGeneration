the rna newton polytope and learnability of energy parameters motivation computational rna_structure is a mature important problem that has received a new wave of attention with the discovery of regulatory non_coding and the advent_of transcriptome_sequencing despite nearly two score years of research on rna_secondary and rnarna_interaction prediction the accuracy of the state of the art algorithms are still far from satisfactory so_far researchers have proposed increasingly_complex energy models and improved parameter_estimation methods experimental and or computational in anticipation of endowing their methods with enough power to solve the problem the output has disappointingly been only modest_improvements not matching the expectations even recent massively featured machine_learning were not able to break the barrier why is that approach the first step toward high_accuracy structure_prediction is to pick an energy_model that is inherently capable of predicting each and every one of known structures to date in this article we introduce the notion of learnability of the parameters of an energy_model as a measure of such an inherent capability we say that the parameters of an energy_model are learnable iff there exists at least one set of such parameters that renders every known rna_structure to date the minimum_free we derive a necessary condition for the learnability and give a dynamic_programming to assess it our algorithm computes the convex_hull of the feature_vectors of all feasible structures in the ensemble of a given input_sequence interestingly that convex_hull coincides with the newton polytope of the partition_function as a polynomial in energy parameters to the best of our knowledge this is the first approach toward computing the rna newton polytope and a systematic_assessment of the inherent capabilities of an energy_model the worst_case complexity of our algorithm is exponential in the number of features however dimen sionality reduction techniques can provide approximate solutions to avoid the curse of dimensionality results we demonstrated the application of our theory to a simple energy_model consisting of a weighted count of a u c g and g u base_pairs our results show that this simple energy_model satisfies the necessary condition for more than half of the input unpseudo knotted sequencestructure pairs chosen from the rna strand v database and severely violates the condition for which provide a set of hard cases that require further investigation from rna strands the observed d feature_vector for strands is on the surface of the computed polytope for rna strands the observed feature_vector is not on the boundary of the polytope but its distance from the boundary is not more than one a distance of one essentially means one base_pair difference between the observed structure and the closest point on the boundary of the polytope which need not be the feature_vector of a structure for sequences this distance is larger than two and for only sequences this distance is larger than five availability the source_code is available on http compbio cs wayne edu software rna newton polytope computational rna_structure and rnarna_interaction prediction have always been important problems particularly now that rna has been shown to have key regulatory_roles in the cell furthermore with the advent of synthetic_biology at the whole organism level high_throughput accurate rna engineering algorithms are required for both in vivo and in vitro applications since the dawn of rna_secondary nearly two score years_ago the research_community has proposed increasingly_complex models and algorithms hoping that refined features together with better methods to estimate their parameters would solve the problem early approaches considered mere base_pair counting followed by the turner thermodynamics model which was a significant leap forward recently massively feature rich models empowered by parameter_estimation algorithms have been proposed but they provide only modest_improvements despite significant progress in the last three decades made possible by the work ofon measuring rna thermodynamic energy parameters and the work of several groups on novel algorithms and machine_learning the rna_structure prediction_accuracy has not reached a satisfactory level yet why is it so up to now human intuition and computational convenience have led the way we believe that human intuition has to be equipped with systematic methods to assess the suitability of a given energy_model surprisingly there is not a single method to assess whether the parameters of an energy_model are learnable we say that the parameters of an energy_model are learnable iff there exists at least one set of such parameters that renders every known rna_structure to date determined through radiograph or nmr the minimum_free equivalently we say that the parameters of an energy_model are learnable iff structure prediction_accuracy can be achieved when the training and test_sets are identical the first step toward high_accuracy structure_prediction is to make sure that the to whom

provide a necessary condition for the learnability and an algorithm to verify it the problem of learnability was previously studied for sequence_alignment using similar methods to the best of our knowledge this is the first approach toward a systematic_assessment of the suitability of an energy_model for rna_structure note that a successful rna_folding algorithm needs to have the generalization power to predict unseen structures as well however if an energy_model is inherently incapable of predicting known structures correctly then it does not matter if it has the generalization power we leave analysis of the generalization power for future work for each strand of rna the distance between cx y the real feature_vector of the secondary_structure and the computed convex_hull n x is calculated using we denote this distance by r x here the necessary condition for the learnability is satisfied if rx for all x in the dataset which shows that the observed feature_vector lies on the boundary of n x illustrates the secondary_structure of a ribosomal_rna and its d and d newton polytopes this rna is nt_long and the distance between the polytope and the observed feature_vector for this rna is in the d au cg model this distance is the observed feature_vector has moved closer to the boundary going from d to d as gu pairs are accounted for in the d model shows a shorter hiv_rna with the length of nt the distance between the d polytope and the observed feature_vector for this rna is while there is a distance of in the d model in this case also the observed feature_vector has moved closer to the boundary going from d to d because there is no gu pair in this observed structure the observed feature_vector lies on the c x y face which is on the boundary of the polytope illustrates escherichia_coli s ribosomal_rna which is nt_long and the distance between the feature_vector and the polytope is in this case the distance has not changed in the d model demonstrates the histogram of r x for the input dataset out of strands of rna the observed feature_vector is on the surface of the d newton polytope for sequences the distance r is not zero but not more than one for sequences distance is between and and for strands it is more than and just for sequences this distance is above as it is clear from the largest r is bp in the d model the second plot inshows the normalized distance histogram the third root of the polytopes volume is used as the normalization factor for the same set of strands the observed feature_vector of only strands lies on the boundary of the d newton polygon for sequence this distance is larger than as you can see in the maximum distance between an observed feature_vector and the polygon is in the d model the second plot inshows the normalized distance histogram the square_root of the polygons area is used as the normalization factor
