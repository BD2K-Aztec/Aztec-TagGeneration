systems_biology causal analysis approaches in ingenuity_pathway motivation prior_biological greatly_facilitates the meaningful interpretation of gene_expression data causal networks constructed from individual relationships curated from the literature are particularly suited for this task since they create mechanistic hypotheses that explain the expression changes observed in datasets results we present and discuss a suite of algorithms and tools for inferring and scoring regulator networks upstream of gene_expression data based on a large_scale causal network derived from the ingenuity knowledge_base we extend the method to predict downstream_effects on biological_functions and diseases and demonstrate the validity of our approach by applying it to example datasets the interpretation of high_throughput is greatly_facilitated by the consideration of prior_biological traditionally this has been done using statistical gene_set enrichment_methods where differentially_expressed are intersected with sets of genes that are associated with a particular biological_function or pathway one more recent approach involves the application of causal networks that integrate previously observed causeeffect relationships reported in the literature while still depending on statistics this is more powerful than gene_set since it leverages knowledge about the direction of effects rather than mere associations in this article we describe causal analysis approaches that have been implemented in ingenuity_pathway ipa with particular focus on the details of the underlying algorithms and the application to a number of real_world use cases ipa is a commercial software_package and is described in the supplementary_material given a gene_expression dataset our main goals are to elucidate the upstream biological causes and probable downstream_effects on cellular and organismal biology it is critical to infer the identity of upstream regulatory_molecules and associated mechanisms to provide biological_insight to the observed expression changes we also aim to predict whether such regulators are activated or inhibited based on the distinct up and downregulation pattern of the expressed genes and determine which causal_relationships previously_reported in the literature are likely relevant for the biological_mechanisms the data upstream_regulators are not limited to transcription_factors they can be any gene or small_molecule that has been observed_experimentally to affect_gene in some direct_or way a similar approach relying on the same methodology is also used to predict downstream functional effects and phenotypes apart from generating likely mechanistic hypotheses causal_inference can also be used to find potential upstream_regulators with a response opposite to the observed expression pattern which is useful for the prediction of therapeutic compound effects this application is similar to the approach taken by the connectivity_map tool except that here we rely on the wide_range of literaturecurated biological findings about compounds and their interactions instead of a gene_expression database derived from in vitro tested compounds the causal network underlying our algorithms is based on the ingenuity knowledge_base a large structured collection of observations in various experimental contexts with nearly million findings manually_curated from the biomedical_literature or integrated from third_party databases the network contains nodes that represent mammalian genes and their products chemical_compounds microrna molecules and biological_functions nodes are connected by edges representing experimentally_observed causeeffect relationships that relate to expression transcription activation molecular modification and transport as well as binding_events network edges are also associated with a direction of the causal_effect i e either activating or inhibiting we describe four causal analytics algorithms that are available in ipa i upstream_regulator analysis ura determines likely upstream_regulators that are connected to dataset genes through a set of direct_or relationships ii mechanistic networks mn builds on ura by connecting regulators that are likely part of the same signaling or causal mechanism in hypothesis networks iii causal network_analysis cna is a generalization of ura that connects upstream_regulators to dataset molecules but takes_advantage of paths that involve more than one link i e through intermediate regulators and can be used to generate a more complete picture of possible root causes for the observed expression changes and iv downstream_effects to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work analysis dea applies the methodology of ura to the inference of and impact on biological_functions and diseases that are downstream of the genes whose expression has been altered in a dataset using several examples we show how these tools are applied to gene_expression data in practice this article_describes algorithms tools and visualizations recently added to ipa that enable scientists to combine the directional information_encoded in their gene_expression with knowledge extracted from the literature to infer the underlying causes of their observed transcriptional changes and to predict likely outcomes this is a significant advance compared to tools that just look for statistical enrichment in overlap to sets of genes an aspect of upstream analysis that makes it especially powerful is that it is essentially an activity based prediction in that the measurement of the activity of a transcriptional_regulator is via the measurement of genes known to be differentially_expressed by it in a defined direction the data being analyzed cna result for sost see section sost is the master_regulator or root regulator of a small causal network containing five intermediate regulators that may explain the up and down_regulation of the dataset molecules shown in the bottom row red indicates up regulation and green down_regulation the regulators are colored by their predicted activation state activated orange or inhibited blue darker colors indicate higher absolute z scores the edges connecting the nodes are colored orange when leading to activation of the downstream node blue when leading to its inhibition and yellow if the findings underlying the relationship are inconsistent with the state of the downstream node pointed arrowheads indicate that the downstream node is expected to be activated if the upstream node connected to it is activated while blunt arrowheads indicate that the downstream node is expected to be inhibited if the upstream node that connects to it is activated causal analysis in ipa has measured that differential_expression this can be contrasted with for example pathway overlap prediction where in general there is no guarantee that the members of the pathway are differentially_expressed upon pathway activation or inhibition as described above the algorithms operate over a large_scale causal graph assembled from individual literature supported relationships between molecules diseases and biological_processes in the ingenuity knowledge_base these relationships are derived from a myriad of experimental_systems in mouse rat and human though possibly counter intuitive to mix relationships derived from a variety of contexts to analyze data from a particular context the results are generally valid due to the conserved activity of most genes and proteins across tissues and cell_types that being said it may be possible in the future to automatically infer a context based on the expression data and to filter accordingly to only relevant relationships for a particular analysis there are at least papers that have already made use of these new causal tools in ipa one of the first to use ura demonstrated how transcription_factor activation differs between mouse macaque and swine in response to infection by the pandemic h n influenza_virus another used both ura and dea to help characterize the mechanisms that provide breast_cancer protection during pregnancy meier there are certain to be additional applications of these powerful analytics as scientists discover and adopt them in their research
