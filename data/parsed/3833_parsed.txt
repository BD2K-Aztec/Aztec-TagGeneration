data_and quantifying the complexity of medical_research motivation a crucial phenomenon of our times is the diminishing marginal returns of investments in pharmaceutical_research and development a potential reason is that research into diseases is becoming increasingly_complex and thus more burdensome for humans to handle we sought to investigate whether we could measure research complexity by analyzing the published_literature results through the text_mining of the publication record of multiple_diseases we have found that the complexity and novelty of disease research has been increasing over the years surprisingly we have also found that research on diseases with higher publication_rate does not possess greater complexity or novelty than that on less studied diseases we have also shown that the research produced about a disease can be seen as a differentiated area of knowledge within the wider biomedical_research for our analysis we have conceptualized disease research as a parallel multi agent search in which each scientific agent a scientist follows a search path based on a model of a disease we have looked at trends in facts published for diseases measured their diversity and turnover using the entropy measure and found similar patterns across disease areas diseases are complex problems investigated by myriads of scientists working in parallel most of these scientists work on narrow niches to produce pieces of knowledge that contribute to our overall understanding of diseases this understanding then enables the test of therapeutic_interventions that might be better alternatives to existing treatments to investigate this process we have used the analogy of a multi agent system throughout this study we compare disease research with a search performed by a multi agent system in which the agents scientists explore a space a disease to enable the selection of the best solutions interventions to a problem this analogy has limitations but it aids in delving into the intrinsic_properties of the problem the metaproblem there are similar motivations in intra human modeling that can be seen in projects such as the virtual physiological human or apinatomy the search agents in our multi agent system use models of reality to guide their path these models represent the models that scientists use to guide their research an important part of disease research involves building models that recapitulate some of the main properties of diseases the best known of these models are in vitro and in vivo proxies that are lower cost lower risk alternatives to clinical studies e g the unilateral_ureteral mouse is an animal_model for human kidney_disease there are also disease_models of a mathematical nature that represent diseases at the systems or epidemiological level another type of model is based on the knowledge available for a disease such as the models used in knowledge based clinical_decision biomedical_researchers use knowledge models of diseases based on knowledge_acquired from textbooks scientific_literature and experimental and clinical_experience they are made up of multiple elements which can be clinical cellular molecular and public_health relatedto name a few these models are the focus of this study for each disease researchers pay more attention to different sets of elements for example clinicians may use a patients symptoms demographics clinical_history and laboratory_reports to evaluate disease_progression biologists on the other hand may use genes pathways organelles and other elements to generate hypotheses about the mechanism of action of a drug or the activity of signaling_pathways in a disease such as psoriasis a clinician may focus on the relationship between psoriasis_area pasi scores and different immunosuppressive_drugs whereas a biologist may investigate the interplay of cutaneous and immune_cells in diabetic_nephropathy on the other hand the interest may fall on the biology of podocytes and myofibroblast proliferation or on a patients glomerular_filtration and arterial_blood thus different elements are combined by each scientist to construct a model of reality that enables reasoning about the disease we incorporate such scientific models in our multi agent system analogy by postulating that each scientific agent has a model of a disease built into its internal_state this model helps the agent navigate its path and is based on inputs produced by other agents such as scientific_publications compounds or tools these models are crucial because the agents cannot perform their search through brute_force exploration they need to choose a path based on the likelihood of success thus disease_models facilitate decision_making we were interested in learning how the structure of these disease_models can affect the task of the search agents we started with the hypothesis that some disease_models might be more complex than others for several reasons one of the reasons could come from the number of articles_published about a disease per year as scientific publishing has been increasing exponentially across many areas of medical_research another reason could come from anatomy for example psoriasis is a fairly localized disease of the skin to whom correspondence should be addressed however a disease such as diabetes involves multiple_organs and tissues yet another reason could come from the multiplicity of signaling_pathways involved in a disease thus a greater multiplicity of elements in a disease could mean a greater search_space to investigate a theoretical disease model can further illustrate this latter point this theoretical_model involves a non existent animal_species called bigenes which has two genes in its genome a and b bigenes suffers a species specific disease called x which is known to be driven by a mutation in a up to the year t the literature on x comprised five articles focused on gene a the publication record about x at time t could be represented as x t aaaaa thus x t is a simplified representation of what was known about x up to time t the genes belonging to x t may not be disease genes in a traditional sense but they represent the scientific conversation taking_place about x even in cases when negative results are reported which may be contradicted later on defining disease genes is in itself a complicated task as the relationship between a gene and a disease can range from strong and firmly_established to tenuous depending on the weight of the existing_evidence a breakthrough in the research of x occurred in the year t when a mutation in b was newly associated with x new articles appeared investigating this association however other articles still focused on a leading to x t aaaaababba where the subsequence babba corresponds to publications for the year t thus the discovery of a mutation in b made the scientific model of the disease x more complex and this is reflected in the publication record this change in complexity can be quantified using the entropy measure from information_theory which is a common measure of statistical complexity used in biomedical_applications such as monitoring heart_rates perkiomakiperkioma and brain electrical_activity or in evolutionary_biology the entropy for x t is h x t but the introduction of b in year t leads to h x t see section h x t h x t reflects the increase in complexity over time a number of works have been devoted to analyzing the growth and evolution of publications on gene and protein interactions outside the context of disease by analyzing the accumulated published record however there is a divergence between the published record and the focus of active research as older works fade in influence on average we believe that practical disease_models do not involve every piece of knowledge published about a disease defining boundaries nonetheless is not straightforward in the case of the disease x publications were initially only about gene a but that changed after an important discovery realizing this requires specific knowledge of the disease and a scientific consensus that may not be found to generalize we have used a time window a model containing the state of the art in year t for a year time window would be x t babba we call this a fading memory model and it reflects that the older a finding is the less relevant it becomesjust like a fading memory this decay can be observed in the evolution of citation counts of published_literature over time one shortcoming of the fading memory approach is that some diseases have much higher publication_rate than others however memories may fade faster for diseases with higher publication_rate owing to the finite memory of the scientists that study them a finite memory approach would consider the latest n publications rather than a time window in the case of x this would mean a disease model x t ba for a memory size of n we have centered our analysis on the finite memory approach because publication_rates change widely over time and between diseasesand thus comparing fixed time windows would require some type of normalization which could introduce distortions nonetheless the fading memory approach is also discussed as will be shown later in the text another important aspect of disease_models is their evolution in time a rapid pace of change may signify for example that the principles of a disease are not properly defined a disease model whose elements have a high turnover_rate requires a greater_effort at understanding and leaves less time to devote to its details in the case of the disease x the appearance of b in the publication record was unexpected which in bayesian probability terms can be expressed as p b x t j x t on the other hand articles about a were fully anticipated p a x t j x t thus conditional_probabilities can be used to gauge the rate of change in a disease model and the novelty of a finding the bigenes example is about an organism with only two genes like some simple viruses but a similar case could have been made about an organism with only two cell_types because research emphasis on cell_types also changes over time for example much immunological research has been focused on the t cell_subsets th and th but recently there has been increased emphasis on th and t reg cells whereas new cell_types such as th and th are regularly proposed in this analysis we have considered disease_models not only involving genes as in the bigenes example but also cell_types drugs and chemicals and we have looked at how they influence each other the complexity of disease_models made of genes has been increasing over time as can be seen in this is reflected in the r and the multiple_linear coefficients in to test the robustness of the result we changed the value of the time window originally n to n f g and found that the relation persisted and even became stronger with increasing n the r fit increased with the size n of the window r ln n as did the coefficients for time r ln n and publication_rate r ln n choosing the value of n is a trade_off between resolution and coverage as diseases with less than n published facts are not included in the analysis we also looked within disease groups and found similar patterns seeand with for example cardiovascular_diseases and nervous_system diseases increasing in complexity at a faster pace over the period involved and neoplasms and substance related_disorders growing slower an illustrative example is the disease retinitis_pigmentosa rp a retinal degenerative_disease the entropy of its disease model over time fits a linear_regression with r and a positive slope of indicating that its complexity has been increasing over time see the lower early entropy is illustrated by one of the main genes studied in rp rhodopsin owing to the early discovery of a rhodopsin mutation associated to rp rhodopsin was important in publications about rp leading to initial low entropy in the rp disease model however rhodopsin has faded relatively in importance as many other mutations and genes have been associated to rp in recent times the current multiplicity of genes studied has led to higher entropy in the disease model of rp for disease_models of chemicals and drugs we can see a milder increase in complexity see section thus the increase incomplexity is not homogeneous across all categories of elements this is seen in models of rp as well the linear_regression for the disease model of chemicals has r of and slope of and for drugs r of and slope of the low entropy in chemical models in the earlier_studies of rp is illustrated by the relatively higher prominence of fluorescein whose use tended to be highlighted in the abstract e g a practice which has faded since fluorescein is counted both as a chemical and as a drug fda_approved in this case thus the drug and chemical categories overlap the control disease_models created by random permutation of disease annotations see section do not show any of these properties see moreover control disease_models do not show the heterogeneity of entropy values seen in actual disease_models suggesting that entropy differences are significant between disease_models for example the linear_regression that fits the control gene disease model for rp has r and slope close to and does not show dependence with time moreover the entropy values are high and close to what a discrete uniform_distribution with sufficient cardinality would produce actual disease_models have lower entropy than control disease_models because they are concentrated around certain elements such as popular genes or drugs and form differentiated areas of knowledge as the rp example shows an implication is that randomly_selected articles about a disease should on average cover less unique facts e g genes than articles picked at random from the overall literature this means that the focus of a diseases research is narrower and there is more repetition which gives it more coherence and makes it more understandable to humans when the focus of a disease becomes too broad it could be an indication that the disease definition has become too inclusive as seen in the disease_models of rp the slope of the linear_regression between entropy and time tends to be positive all diseases we found these values to be unrelated to the average publication_rate showing that disease_models with high average publication_rates are no more complex than those of diseases with low average publication_rates this is similarly reflected in where we show that a small fraction of the increase in complexity is driven by higher publication_rates for example in gene disease_models the linear regression_coefficients indicate that a fold publication_rate increase would increase the complexity as little as year of time would by looking at the rp example alone we could not have known whether the increase in entropy of its disease_models was somehow related to the increase in the rate of publications about rp that happened over the same time period our analysis however allows us to say that these two variables are generally unrelated instead diseases with high publication_rates would seem to have a fast forward behavior in which findings are brought up faster but without an increase in associated complexity thus the finite memory approach chosen here as described in section seems more appropriate to study this phenomenon than the fading memory approach as can be seen inand the novelty in disease_models made of genes has been increasing over time as well this can be seen in the negative relation between time and the probability of a publication mentioning a gene that is already in a disease model for chemicals this relationship is barely significant and for drugs it is not significant the linear_regression for disease_models of genes has a median slope of and an interquartile_range of here negative slope means increased novelty increased novelty could be one of the main drivers of increased entropy as they are related in the gene disease model of rp novelty increases noticeably with time and fits a linear_regression of slope and r of from the complexity and novelty of the disease_models of rp we postulate that rp has become harder to study over time rp is not a unique case as can be seen infor two disease groups and multiple_sclerosis as shown in we found that publication_rates do not correlate with novelty thus a slower pace of publication does not entail a lower appetite for novelty in less explored diseases control disease_models show a more stable and much higher rate of novelty as would be expected from a randomly shuffled set to further study the drivers of complexity in disease_models we measured the correlations between the entropies of disease_models for genes chemicals and drugs see section these correlations were found to be positive seeand meaning that increases in one category were correlated with increases in another category even controlling for the common increase of entropy over time already described in the case of rp for example the entropies for the disease_models of genes and chemicals were correlated with a slope of and r of this shows that changes in complexity of disease_models are not independent for each category and that it would be reasonable to consider disease_models in a multidimensional fashion with different categories of elements interacting with each other rather than studying them separately it should also be noted that variations in complexity for each category may have different practical impact for example an increase in cell_type complexity could be more relevant than an increase in gene complexity because a gene can be associated to different functions in different cell_types
