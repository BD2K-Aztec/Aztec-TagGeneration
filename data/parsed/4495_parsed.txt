genetics_and sweepfinder increased sensitivity robustness and flexibility sweepfinder is a widely used program that implements a powerful likelihood_based method for detecting recent positive_selection or selective_sweeps here we present sweepfinder an extension of sweepfinder with increased sensitivity and robustness to the confounding_effects of mutation_rate variation and background selection moreover sweepfinder has increased flexibility that enables the user to specify test sites set the distance between test sites and utilize a recombin ation map availability_and sweepfinder is a freely_available www personal psu edu mxd sf html software_package that is written in c and can be run from a unix command_line polymorphism frequency_spectra provide sensitive statistics for identifying signatures of positive_selection sweepfinder is a widely used program that uses an empirical background frequency_spectrum for identifying genomic_sites affected by recent positive_selection specifically sweepfinder performs a composite likelihood_ratio for positive_selection in which the likelihood of the null_hypothesis is calculated from the neutral or genome_wide frequency_spectrum and the likelihood of the alternative hypothesis is calculated from a model in which the neutral spectrum was altered by a recent selective_sweep footprints of positive_selection can be confounded by other evolutionary_forces one important confounding_factor that is rarely considered in the studies of positive_selection is background selection which is a loss of neutral variation due to purging of linked deleterious alleles by negative_selection recent_studies that background selection is ubiquitous in humans with estimates of mean reductions in genetic_diversity due to background selection ranging from to and to on autosomes and the x chromosome respectively thus the influence of background selection on genetic_diversity has important ramifications for making inferences about past adaptive_processes from patterns of diversity in particular when a beneficial allele is carried to fixation by positive_selection there is a substantial decrease in diversity locally in the genome and a reduction in diversity relative to divergence with other species both of which can span megabases in length maynard background selection can similarly affect diversity levels particularly in regions of low recombination v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com
