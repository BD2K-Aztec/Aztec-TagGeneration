comparative visualization of genetic and physical_maps with strudel data visualization can play_a in comparative_genomics for example underpinning the investigation of conserved synteny patterns strudel is a desktop_application that allows users to easily compare both genetic and physical_maps interactively and efficiently it can handle large_datasets from several genomes simultaneously and allows all by all comparisons between these availability_and installers for strudel are available for windows linux solaris and mac os x atcrop genetics is still dominated by species for which fully_sequenced and well annotated genomes are unavailable comparative_genomics is an important means of annotating unfinished genomes and requires powerful visualization_tools that elucidate the relationships with already annotated genomes there are a number of tools in this area which range from webbased applications with database back ends to standalone desktop applications the challenges_faced by any comparative visualization application are the increasing volume of data fast delivery of these to users efficient on screen rendering of a large amount of information and layout constraints here we present strudel a standalone java desktop_application that aims to combine ease of installation with ease of use and allows the simultaneous multi way comparison of several genomes usability has been a major design criterion for strudel and in early acceptance testing users were able to start generating insights into their data within minutes of downloading the application without having to first consult the manual strudels graphical_interface has been designed to reduce visual clutter as much as possible and a critical condition for this is that homologies between two chromosomes are never drawn across other genomes to whom correspondence should be addressed
