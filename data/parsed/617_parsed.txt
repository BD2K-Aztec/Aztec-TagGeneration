data_and automatic extraction of angiogenesis bioprocess from text motivation understanding key_biological bioprocesses and their relationships with constituent biological_entities and pharmaceutical agents is crucial for drug_design and discovery one way to harvest such information is searching the literature however bioprocesses are difficult to capture because they may occur in text in a variety of textual expressions moreover a bioprocess is often composed of a series of bioevents where a bioevent denotes changes to one or a group of cells involved in the bioprocess such bioevents are often used to refer to bioprocesses in text which current_techniques relying solely on specialized lexicons struggle to find results this article_presents a range of methods for finding bioprocess terms and events to facilitate the study we built a gold_standard corpus in which terms and events related to angiogenesis a key biological_process of the growth of new blood_vessels were annotated statistics of the annotated corpus revealed that over of the text expressions that referred to angiogenesis appeared as events the proposed methods respectively employed domain specific vocabularies a manually_annotated corpus and unstructured domain specific documents evaluation results showed that while a supervised machine_learning model yielded the best precision recall and f scores the other methods achieved reasonable performance and less cost to develop availability the angiogenesis vocabularies gold_standard corpus annotation guidelines and software described in this article are available at
