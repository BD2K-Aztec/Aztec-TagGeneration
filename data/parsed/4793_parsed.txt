sequence_analysis uninovo a universal tool for de_novo peptide_sequencing motivation mass_spectrometry ms instruments and experimental_protocols are rapidly_advancing but de_novo peptide_sequencing algorithms to analyze tandem mass ms_ms are lagging behind although existing de_novo sequencing tools perform well on certain types of spectra e g collision_induced cid spectra of tryptic_peptides their performance often deteriorates on other types of spectra such as electron_transfer etd higher_energy collisional dissociation hcd spectra or spectra of non tryptic_digests thus rather than developing a new algorithm for each type of spectra we develop a universal de_novo sequencing algorithm called uninovo that works well for all types of spectra or even for spectral pairs e g cid etd spectral pairs uninovo uses an improved scoring_function that captures the dependences between different ion types where such dependencies are learned automatically using a modified offset frequency function results the performance of uninovo is compared with pepnovo peaks and pnovo using various types of spectra the results show that the performance of uninovo is superior to other tools for etd spectra and superior or comparable with others for cid and hcd spectra uninovo also estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training_dataset we demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra including cid hcd etd cid etd and hcd etd spectra of trypsin lysc or aspn digested peptides availability uninovo is implemented_in and tested on windows ubuntu and os x machines uninovo is available at http proteomics ucsd edu software uninovo html along with the manual de_novo peptide_sequencing by tandem mass ms_ms spectrometry is a valuable alternative to ms_ms database_search in contrast to the database_search approach that utilizes the information from proteome the de_novo sequencing approach attempts to identify peptides only using the information from the input spectrum hence most de_novo sequencing algorithms are based on the prior_knowledge of the fragmentation characteristics e g ion types and their propensities of ms_ms the fragmentation characteristics are highly dependent on the fragmentation method used to generate the spectrum among several fragmentation methods available the collision_induced cid is the most commonly used method accordingly the fragmentation characteristics of cid have been well studied compared with recently_introduced fragmentation methods such as electron_transfer etd and higher_energy collisional dissociation hcd as a result many de_novo sequencing algorithms have been introduced for cid spectra for example peaks and pepnovo are the state of the art de_novo sequencing tools for cid spectra other fragmentation methods like etd and hcd have a great_potential for de_novo sequencing for example for highly_charged spectra etd provides better fragmentation and thus is better suited for de_novo sequencing than cid also more complete fragmentation of peptide ions especially in low mass regions in hcd provides a better chance to obtain more accurate de_novo reconstructions than cid furthermore modern mass_spectrometers e g ltq_orbitrap velos allow the generation of paired spectra e g cid etd or hcd etd spectral pairs since cid or hcd and etd spectra provide_complementary for peptide_sequencing such spectral pairs or even triplets enable more accurate de_novo sequencing several de_novo sequencing algorithms were recently presented to take advantage of those new fragmentation methods for instance proposed a de_novo sequencing algorithm for etd spectra which is used by peaks for hcd spectra introduced a de_novo sequencing tool pnovo that not only takes_advantage of the high_precision peaks in hcd spectra but also uses the information of abundant immonium and internal ions in case of spectral pairs proposed a greedy_algorithm for cid ecd spectral pairs that significantly boosts the performance of de_novo sequencing datta andpresented spectrum fusion a de_novo sequencing algorithm for cid etd spectral pairs spectrum fusion constructs a combined spectrum from the input cid etd spectral pair using a bayesian_network it generates multiple de_novo sequences using the combined spectrum and score them by the scoring_function in byonic this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com algorithm adepts for cid etd spectral pairs given a cid etd spectral pair adepts first finds candidate de_novo sequences from each spectrum using peaks the total candidate_sequences are then rescored against the input spectral pair and the best scoring peptide is reported while the above tools perform well for the spectra generated from the fragmentation method s that each tool targeted they often generate inferior results for the spectra from other fragmentation methods moreover if alternative proteases e g lysc or aspn are used for protein_digestion these tools may produce suboptimal results because different proteases often generate peptides with different fragmentation characteristics in case of the database_search approach recently_introduced a universal algorithm ms gfdb that shows a significantly better peptide identification_performance than other existing database_search such as mascot percolator however a universal de_novo sequencing tool is still missing we present uninovo a universal de_novo sequencing tool that can be generalized for various types i e the combinations of the fragmentation method and the protease used to digest sample proteins of spectra the scoring_function of uninovo is easily trainable using a training_dataset consisting of thousands of annotated spectra all information needed for de_novo sequencing are learned from the training_dataset and the running time for training is h in a typical desktop environment currently uninovo is trained for cid hcd and etd spectra of trypsin lysc or aspn digested peptides we show that the performance of uninovo is better than or comparable with pepnovo peaks and pnovo for various types of spectra one of the biggest challenges in de_novo sequencing is to estimate the error_rate of the resulting de_novo reconstructions unlike ms_ms database_search that commonly uses the target_decoy approach to estimate the statistical_significance of the peptide_identifications de_novo reconstructions have rarely been subjected to a statistical_significance analysis in the past several de_novo sequencing tools report the error_rate of amino_acid predictions e g confidence_scores in peaks but this is often not sufficient because the overall quality of the sequence cannot be easily determined by the error_rates of individual amino_acid predictions to our knowledge only pepnovo reports the empirical probability that the output peptide is correct pepnovo predicts the probabilities using logistic_regression with multiple features of the reconstructions such as length and score which are extracted from a training_dataset consisting of hundreds of thousands of annotated spectra however pepnovo does not include an automated training_procedure that would allow to easily extend pepnovo for newly_emerging mass_spectrometry approaches and is currently trained only for cid extending pepnovo beyond cid spectra requires training complex boosting based re ranking models for predicting peak ranks and rescoring peptide candidates pepnovo training includes several manual steps and the availability of a very large corpus of training spectra thus in case of non cid fragmentation methods it remains_unclear how to obtain accurate error_rate estimation for de_novo reconstructions uninovo estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training_dataset we demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra including cid hcd etd cid etd and hcd etd spectra of trypsin lysc or aspn digested peptides this allows uninovo to automatically filter out low quality spectra we presented a universal de_novo sequencing tool uninovo that works well for various types of spectra uninovo can be easily trained for different types of spectra using only thousands of psms that typically can be obtained from a single ms_ms run the experimental_results show that uninovo generates accurate and long de_novo reconstructions from spectra of cid etd hcd and cid etd fragmentation methods and spectra of trypsin lysc or aspn digested peptides we also showed that uninovo is better than or comparable with other state of the art tools as pointed_out by ma and johnson de_novo sequences not only are valuable for the analysis of the novel peptides that are not present in proteome databases but also can facilitate the homology_based database_searches since the reconstructions reported by uninovo contain mass gaps representing the total mass of multiple amino_acids termed gapped peptides ms bpm algorithm can be used for fast exact or homology_searches uninovoms bpm ms bpm enables searches against a sequence database using gapped peptides as queries currently msbpm takes gapped peptides generated by ms gappeddictionary ms gappeddictionaryms bpm however the reconstructions from uninovo are usually longer than those from ms gappeddictionary versus since the search time of ms bpm strongly depends on the length of gapped peptidesthe longer gapped peptides the shorter search timethe running time of uninovoms bpm is smaller than ms gappeddictionaryms bpm by an order of magnitude in a blind search against the ipi human_proteome database ver data not shown de_novo sequencing with qualify filtering of spectra given a spectrum if the parameter setaccuracythreshold is set uninovo attempts to achieve set accuracy an estimated probability of the spectrum being correctly sequenced exceeding setaccuracythreshold if it fails to generate such a set the spectrum is filtered out an unfiltered spectrum is called a qualified spectrum we set setaccuracythreshold a the number of qualified spectrum b the percentage of qualified spectra that were correctly sequenced c the average length of correct reconstructions
