sequence_analysis further steps in tango improved taxonomic_assignment in metagenomics motivation tango is one of the most accurate tools for the taxo nomic assignment of sequence_reads however because of the differences in the taxonomy structures performing a taxonomic_assignment on different reference taxonomies will produce divergent results results we have improved the tango pipeline to be able to perform the taxonomic_assignment of a metagenomic sample using alternative reference taxonomies coming from different sources we highlight the novel pre_processing necessary to accomplish this task and describe the improvements in the assignment process we present the new tango pipeline in details and finally we show its performance on four real metagenomic_datasets and also on synthetic datasets availability the new version of tango including implementation improvements and novel developments to perform the assignment on different reference taxonomies is freely_available source forge net_projects taxoassignment analysis of microbial_communities has been until recently a complicated task because of the high_diversity and the fact that a large number of these organisms cannot be cultured current next_generation have provided an opportunity for doing this analysis routinely however the unprecedented amount of generated data represents_a for computational_analysis which has become an essential tool for microbial genomics indeed computational_methods for high_throughput genomic analysis have become the bottleneck of microbial genomics a number of computational_methods have been recently_proposed to solve the issue of species identification within microbial_communities most of them based on sequence_similarity and phylogeny droge nevertheless with the growing number of sequenced samples the improvement of sequencing_technologies in terms of read_length and the improvement of reference_genome libraries computational_complexity of handling the metagenomic_data lags behind the needs of current analyses hence further reducing the computational_complexity becomes a central challenge for metagenomic_analysis methods in this article we improve on the previously_proposed tango algorithm tango is among the most accurate of all the recently_proposed tools for the assignment of reads to organisms based on the computation of the lowest_common lca see for a recent survey more precisely the tango algorithm starts from a reference taxonomy and a set of sequence read_alignments and looks for the assignment of sequence_reads at the best possible taxonomic rank this procedure allows one to better understand the composition of a metagenomic sample tango is particularly suited to the taxonomic_assignment of ambiguous sequence_reads that is sequence_reads with more than one candidate match to organisms for instance with the same e value as the top blast hit starting with a set of sequence_reads it assigns each of them to ancestral taxons by computing the best suited of the least common taxonomic ancestors for all possible subsets of the set of sequence_reads it relies on an efficient evaluation of the number of mismatches between the sequence_read and the reference taxonomy to balance the relevance of precision and recall in the assignment assignment of reads to reference_sequences is a necessary step in s ribosomal_rna gene based identification the s gene is crucial in bacterial_species identification because it is conserved among organisms within a species while diverging across species the obtained matches are further used for microbial_identification by relying on a specific taxonomic scheme as taxonomic read assignment provides more accurate identification than comparing reads from s ribosomal_rna with known databases by using clustering_methods anyway as different taxonomies can differ in both the topology and the adopted names used to label the nodes the taxonomic_assignment process could produce divergent results when using different reference taxonomies moreover to our knowledge there is no tool that allows one to perform taxonomic_assignments on different reference taxonomies to whom correspondence should be addressed for this reason we have designed a novel pipeline of the tango software that addresses specific issues in sequence_read assignment because of characteristics of the input_data namely taxonomies coming from different database sources contracting heterogeneous taxonomies to a common set of taxonomic ranks and then efficiently switching the sequence_read assignment from one taxonomy equalizing phase to another one are two main novel features of tango more precisely we have realized a pre_processing of the input taxonomies which makes the assignment of tango more flexible to process data in this article we address the aforementioned issues that are relevant for speeding up and improving the quality of sequence_read assignment by two novel phases in the tango pipeline that aim to pre process the input_data contraction and equalizing contracting taxonomies means to reduce each tree from a collection of heterogeneous taxonomies to a standard set of common taxonomic ranks that is the number of levels of the tree are the same for all trees in the collection as trees from the previous phase are still different in the number of nodes for each level the equalizing phase produces a correspondence between leaves and nodes of the contracted taxonomies the mapping will allow an automatic translation of the sequence read_alignments or matches from one taxonomy to the other one of the advantages of this new pipeline and in particular of the pre_processing is that it is preformed only once independently from the set of input reads in this work we have considered the most used reference taxonomies that are ncbi rdp and greengenes as anticipated before the differences among taxonomies have a direct impact on the bacterial_identification results for example there are phyla in the rdp database in ncbi and in greengenes and a number of attempts at taxonomy reconciliation have been undertaken such as by however no consensus taxonomy exists at this day consequently being able to compare assignments based on different taxonomies is particularly interesting as well as being able to switch between taxonomies as a final remark we want to observe that the first available implementation of the tango method was straightforward and did not aim at any particular data_structure or computational optimizations therefore the new version of the tango software in addition to the novel functions mentioned before provides an improvement in computational_efficiency that is achieved thanks to the adoption of compact data_structures and sound programmatic practices in the rest of the article we will also illustrate the contributions of these improvements on real and synthetic data on the aforementioned reference taxonomies analysis of microbial_communities and the possibility of their characterization by the ngs metagenomic approaches depend on the availability of reference_databases and taxonomies up to date major efforts have been deployed for the development of algorithmic approaches for taxonomic_assignment the taxonomic information for this assignment can be obtained from various and often discordant sources further steps in tango method address this limitation by providing means for contracting heterogeneous taxonomies to a common set of taxonomic ranks and then efficiently switching the sequence_read assignment from one taxonomy equalizing phase to another indeed despite the tremendous effort spent in classifying bacteria and archaea even today not enough is known about evolutionary_relationships to establish clearly defined taxonomic classes and orders for many of them databases such as the ncbi rdp and greengenes provide access to sets of ribosomal_rna sequence_databases necessary for the identification of microbes in a culture independent analysis of microbial_communities however one of the hurdles is the fact that these taxonomies do not contain all of the taxonomic_levels attached to the published names of the bacterial and archaeal sequences and moreover that there are major topological differences among them consequently taxonomic_assignment will produce divergent results when using different reference taxonomies and there was no tool up to now to freely move between taxonomic_assignments that rely on different reference taxonomies in this article we improve on our tango method for taxonomic_classification of microbial_communities the pre requisite to using tangoas well as other taxonomic_assignment toolsis to perform an alignment of the input sequence_reads against reference s ribosomal rna_sequences and collecting positive hits a metagenomic sequence_read is then classified by computing the lca of the species in the set of hits for this sequence_read tango improves classification_accuracy by balancing the true and false_positive assignments depending on different taxonomic_levels furthermore tango now allows freely_moving between different taxonomies and enables easy comparison of taxonomic_assignments that rely on competing classifications the general_problem of reconciling different reference taxonomies is still open and we have only provided in this article a partial answer as lca preserving mapping which does not provide much information when the taxonomies have conflicting classifications future work also includes providing an efficient web_service for taxonomic_assignment of microbial_communities with tango using heterogeneous reference taxonomies the new version of tango including implementation improvements and taxonomy contraction and equalization as well as the accompanying software are freely_available tango can be downloaded from http sourceforge
