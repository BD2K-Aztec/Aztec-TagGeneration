structural_bioinformatics aida ab_initio domain assembly for automated multi domain protein_structure and domain domain interaction prediction motivation most proteins consist of multiple domains independent structural and evolutionary units that are often reshuffled in genomic_rearrangements to form new protein architectures template_based methods can often detect homologous templates for individual_domains but templates that could be used to model the entire query_protein are often not available results we have developed a fast docking algorithm ab_initio domain assembly aida for assembling multi domain protein_structures guided by the ab_initio potential this approach can be extended to discontinuous domains i e domains with inserted domains when tested on experimentally solved structures of multi_domain the relative domain positions were accurately found among top models in of cases aida server can use domain assignments provided by the user or predict them from the provided sequence the latter approach is particularly useful for automated protein_structure servers the blind_test consisting of casp_targets shows that domain boundaries could be successfully determined for of targets availability_and the aida package as well as the benchmark sets used here are available for download at http ffas burnham org aida domains are evolutionarily structurally and functionally independent units in proteins proteins especially large eukaryotic ones are often composed of multiple domains mostly due to the duplications and recombinations of the coding_regions during evolution average eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins have and domains respectively a low estimate as only known pfam domains were used in the count and new domains are continuously being discovered domains usually have compact d shapes and specific functions that are at least to some extent conserved between homologous domains in different proteins the same domains are often found in proteins with different domain_architectures including standalone single domain ones moreover structures of many domains are solved only as single domain constructs as a result domain assembly is a necessary step for structure predictions of full_length proteins correctly arranged domain structures are often crucial for full understanding of the function of multi_domain residues within each domain usually have strong interactions with each other stabilizing the conserved domain structure while only a fraction of all residues are involved in the interactions with other domains this increases the difficulty of accurate determination of the relative domain positions and orientations the interactions involved in domaindomain interactions and those between different protein_chains are very similar therefore the domaindomain and proteinprotein_docking pose exactly the same challenges and could be approached with the same tools however due to the restriction of polypeptide_chain connectivity the search_space for domain position and orientation is much smaller than that for proteinprotein_docking the problem of domain assembly could also be regarded as a special_case of the folding_process in which only the conformation of the linker_region is changing and domain structures are rigid hence potentials and algorithms for single domain protein_structure such as rosetta could be applied to this problem in this article we describe a fast energy_minimization method for domain assembly guided by the ab_initio potential this method is implemented in the first publicly_available server in the field aida ab_initio domain assembly available at http ffas burnham org aida this server also provides access to a recursive protocol which combines template_based with domain assembly in an iterative_method suitable for automated domain assignment modeling and assembly for a one stop structure_prediction of multi_domain
