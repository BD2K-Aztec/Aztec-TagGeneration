learning hmms for nucleotide_sequences from amino_acid alignments profile_hidden profile_hmms are known to efficiently predict whether an amino_acid aa sequence belongs to a specific protein_family profile_hmms can also be used to search for protein_domains in genome_sequences in this case hmms are typically learned from aa sequences and then used to search on the six frame translation of nucleotide nt sequences however this approach demands additional processing of the original data and search results here we propose an alternative and more direct method which converts an aa alignment into an nt one after which an nt based hmm is trained to be applied directly on a genome the identification of protein_coding is an important step in genome_annotation profile_hidden profile_hmms are probabilistic_models that can efficiently search for characteristic domains of protein_families in databases for this purpose profile_hmms can be trained from alignments of amino_acid aa sequences called here aa hmms as nucleotide nt sequences degrade more rapidly than the aa sequences they encode aa alignments are generally more accurate than their corresponding nt ones moreover aa alignments can be more easily_obtained than nt alignments databases like pfam and cdd make available aa alignments related to many protein_domains therefore aa hmms have also been used for searching for protein_domains in genomes the usual way of doing this is to translate the genome_sequence into six aa sequences according to the reading frames and apply the hmms on each one however this approach demands additional treatment of both the original data and the search results such as translating the whole_genome into six aa sequences furthermore depending on the tool to run the hmms it is necessary to cut each aa sequence into small windows and create overlapping windows to prevent loss of regions of interest leading to a lot of overhead the length of the windows and the overlapping regions depend on the hmm to be used which becomes worse when using several hmms with very different numbers of states moreover the relative positions of the hmms predictions have to be mapped onto the real positions in the genome in this work we propose a method that converts aa alignments into nt ones to learn hmms from nt called here nt hmms for searching directly on nt sequences this method is an alternative in order to avoid all the additional data and results processing previously described we tested our method searching for different types of protein domain in several organisms the method was developed for using with the program hmmer v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup comin this section we verify whether hmms built on converted nt alignments are able to retrieve genome_sequences related to the tested domains we compare the results produced by corresponding nt hmms and aa hmms with each other and also compare them with domain annotations for the genomes if they are available details can be found in the supplementary_material
