misassembly detection using paired_end sequence_reads and optical mapping data motivation a crucial problem in genome_assembly is the discovery and correction of misassembly errors in draft_genomes we develop a method called missequel that enhances the quality of draft_genomes by identifying misassembly errors and their breakpoints using paired_end sequence_reads and optical mapping data our method also fulfills the critical need for open_source computational_methods for analyzing optical mapping data we apply our method to various assemblies of the loblolly pine francisella_tularensis rice and budgerigar genomes we generated and used stimulated optical mapping data for loblolly pine and f tularensis and used real optical mapping data for rice and budgerigar results our results demonstrate that we detect more than of extensively misassembled con tigs and more than of locally misassembled contigs in assemblies of f tularensis and between and of extensively misassembled contigs and between and of locally misas sembled contigs in assemblies of loblolly pine using the real optical mapping data we correctly_identified of extensively misassembled contigs and of locally misassembled contigs in rice and of extensively misassembled contigs and of locally misassembled contigs in budgerigar availability_and missequel can be used as a post_processing step in combination with any genome assembler and is freely_available atcomparing genetic_variation between and within a species is a fundamental activity in biological_research for example there is currently a major effort to sequence entire genomes of agriculturally_important plant_species to identify parts of the genome variable in a given breeding program and ultimately create superior plant varieties robust genome_assembly methods are imperative to these large sequencing initiatives and other scientific projects because scientific analyses frequently use those genomes to determine genetic_variation and associated biological_traits at present the majority of assembly programs are based on the eulerian assembly paradigm where a de_bruijn is constructed with a vertex v for every k_mer present in a set of reads and an edge v v for every observed k_mer in the reads with k_mer prefix v and k_mer suffix v a contig corresponds to a non branching path through this graph we refer the reader tofor a more thorough explanation of de_bruijn and their use in assembly spades idba euler sr velvet zerbino and birney soapdenovo abyss and allpaths all use this paradigm and follow the same general outline extract k_mers from the reads construct a de_bruijn from the set k_mers simplify the graph and construct contigs one crucial problem that persists in eulerian assembly and genome_assembly in general is the discovery and correction of misassembly errors in draft_genomes we define a misassembly error as
