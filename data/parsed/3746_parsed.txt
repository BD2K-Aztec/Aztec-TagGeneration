structural_bioinformatics protein ligand_binding recognition using complementary binding specific substructure comparison and sequence_profile alignment motivation identification of proteinligand binding_sites is critical to protein_function and drug_discovery however there is no method that could generate optimal binding_site for different protein types combination of complementary predictions is probably the most reliable solution to the problem results we develop two new methods one based on binding specific substructure comparison tm site and another on sequence_profile alignment s site for complementary binding_site predictions the methods are tested on a set of non redundant proteins harboring natural drug like and metal_ion molecules starting from low_resolution protein_structure predictions the methods successfully recognize of binding residues with average matthews correlation_coefficient mcc significantly_higher with p value in student_t than other state of the art methods including cofactor findsite and concavity when combining tm site and s site with other structure based programs a consensus approach coach can increase mcc by over the best individual predictions coach was examined in the recent community_wide comeo experiment and consistently ranked as the best method in last individual_datasets with the area under the curve score higher than the second best method these data demonstrate a new robust approach to proteinligand binding_site recognition which is ready for genome_wide structure based function_annotations proteins perform the biological_functions through interactions with other molecules called ligands the identification of specific_ligand binding_site lbs on proteins is often the first important step toward understanding the function of protein molecules or for rational_design of new therapeutic_compounds to modulate the protein functions due to the technical_difficulties and high_cost associated with experimental determination however the structural details for proteinligand_interactions are unknown for most proteins even for the proteins with experimentally solved d structure there are nearly of proteins i e out of in the pdb which lack biologically_relevant ligand_binding information as shown in biolip accurate prediction of ligandprotein binding is therefore required for both biological and therapeutic studies a variety of methods have been developed for computational_prediction of protein lbss these methods can be generally categorized into two groups i e sequence_based or d structure based_methods most of the sequence_based rely on the residue conservation analyses under the assumption that the ligand_binding residues are functionally_important and therefore conserved in evolutionary_process this approach has the advantage of generating prediction from sequence alone but the precision of predictions is low typically around at recall because many non binding residues can also be of high degree of conservation due to the diverse roles e g to keep the fold stable for the structure based_methods two different approaches prevail in the first approach the ligand_binding is identified by recognizing the surface cavities on the d structural model of the target protein it has the advantages of ab_initio modeling of the lbss as predictions are made without using templates but the false_positive can be high especially for the low_resolution models generated from protein_structure predictions the second structure based_approach is to infer ligand_binding information from the known template proteins which have similar global and or local structure to the query as shown in the recent community_wide casp experiments this type of template based_approaches represent by far the most accurate methods especially for targets which have close homologs in the ligandprotein complex structure databases nevertheless no individual methods can generate sufficiently accurate_predictions for different targets for instance the template based_methods do not outperform ab_initio pocket identification methods for distant homologous targets and the to whom correspondence should be addressed performance of pocket based_methods can be significantly degraded in the targets without high_resolution models where sequence_based may have their advantage in this work we aim to develop a reliable approach which could generate highly_accurate ligand_binding predictions for different categories of protein targets we first design a new structure based algorithm tm site which derives lbss from structure related templates with the alignments built on binding specific substructures matches second a new binding specific sequence_profile alignment_method s site is developed for evolution based lbs recognition finally we design coach to combine the prediction results of tm site and ssite with other available lbs tools by the support_vector svm training because one of the major objectives in this work is for genome_wide function_annotation following the sequence to structure to function paradigm we will examine and test our methods on low_resolution structure models generated by the state of the art protein_structure predictions all the algorithms and data developed in this work are freely_accessible at our website
