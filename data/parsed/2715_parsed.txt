likelihood_based complex_trait association testing for arbitrary depth sequencing_data in next_generation ngs based genetic_studies researchers typically perform genotype_calling first and then apply standard genotype based_methods for association testing however such a two step approach ignores genotype_calling uncertainty in the association testing step and may incur power_loss and or inflated_type in the recent_literature a few robust and efficient likelihood based_methods including both likelihood_ratio lrt and score test have been proposed to carry out association testing without intermediate genotype_calling these methods take genotype_calling uncertainty into account by directly incorporating genotype likelihood_function glf of ngs_data into association analysis however existing lrt methods are computationally_demanding or do not allow covariate_adjustment while existing score tests are not applicable to markers with low minor_allele maf we provide an lrt allowing flexible covariate_adjustment develop a statistically more powerful score test and propose a combination strategy unc combo to leverage the advantages of both tests we have carried_out extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our proposed lrt and score test simulations and real_data analysis demonstrate the advantages of our proposed combination strategy it offers a satisfactory trade_off in terms_of applicability accommo dating both common_variants and variants with low maf and statistical_power particularly for the analysis of quantitative_trait where the power gain can be up to when the causal_variant is of low_frequency maf next_generation ngs_technologies have transformed genomic studies since their appearance in in the past_few ngs_technologies have extended genome_wide gwas from common_variants minor_allele to low_frequency variants maf and provided a powerful_tool to identify less common_genetic associated with both mendelian and complex_traits most association testing methods are designed for genotypes which are not directly available from ngs_data thus to perform association testing on ngs_data researchers typically perform genotype_calling first there are multiple sources of non negligible error in ngs_data such as basecalling error and assembly or alignment error each of which can cause considerable uncertainty in genotype_calling to take these various sources of error into account many existing genotype_calling adopt a probabilistic_framework and generate genotype likelihood functions glf currently accurate genotype_calling can be achieved from glf data either with high depth sequencing or with low depth sequencing if a large number of individuals are sequenced however genotype_calling can incur a number of problems particularly when served as an intermediate step for association testing or inference in population_genetics first uncertainty in genotype_calls is ultimately lost in subsequent inference leading to possible power_loss second for low_coverage data multi sample lineage disequilibrium ld aware methods can be rather computationally_intensive third the dependence of genotype_calling on ld pattern may lead to potential_bias in population_genetics inference lastly both uncertainty particularly differential uncertainty across varying values of phenotypic_traits and inconsistencies in called genotypes may result in inflated_type in association testing particularly when combined from multiple datasets of varying sequencing_depths in the literature as an attractive alternative to the two step testing approach i e genotype_calling in the first step and association testing based on called genotypes in the second step computationally_efficient one step methods have been proposed for association analysis that directly model sequencing_data for association testing without the intermediate genotype_calling step these one step methods test association by incorporating glf into the association testing likelihood_function and carrying out likelihood_based association inference focusing primarily on testing without explicitly calling genotypes among them and li test allele_frequency difference between cases and controls via likelihood_ratio lrt however lrt requires numerical optimization under both the null and the alternative hypothesis and is therefore computationally_demanding for large_scale datasets furthermore existing lrt methods are designed only for binary_traits and do not allow covariates adjustment adopt a generalized_linear glm framework to accommodate both quantitative and binary_traits and to allow covariates with a motivation conceptually similar to the one proposed for haplotype association testing sketch the possibility of an lrt where they envision a two step approach that first estimates maf based on a partial likelihood without phenotype information and then plugs the estimated maf into the likelihood_function to carry out association testing however the maximum_likelihood mle of maf in the two step approach is not the oracle estimator details to follow and thus may incur power_loss in subsequent association testing develop a computationally_efficient score test abbreviated as ska score test hereafter within the glm framework however the information matrix used for the construction of the ska score test ignores the correlation between the maf estimator and estimators for the regression parameters likely causing the ska score test statistically underpowered moreover the score test is generally not applicable when maf is low because the minimal degree of variation in log likelihood_function required for numerical stability of score test_statistic cannot be reached type_i inflation was reported in the original work for maf under for the same reason a variation of the ska score test developed particularly for accommodating publicly_available control_groups also adopts as maf threshold in this paper we first provide an lrt for association analysis of ngs_data unc lrt which allows covariate_adjustment and handles both quantitative and binary phenotypic_traits in our lrt the statistically efficient mle of maf is obtained in one unified_framework that simultaneously estimates maf and association parameters second we improve upon the work of skotte et_al by considering the correlation between maf estimator and regression parameter estimators in the information matrix and develop a statistically more powerful score test unc score test third although lrt and score test are asymptomatically equivalent it is well known that their performance can differ_considerably in practice we evaluate the performance of our proposed lrt and score test by simulations and propose a combination strategy to take advantage of both tests hereafter referred to as unc combo extensive simulations and real_data based analysis are carried_out to examine the robustness computational_efficiency and statistical_power of ska score test unc score test unc lrt and unc combo our results suggest advantages of unc combo in practice when genetic_architecture in particular maf of associated or causal genetic_variant s is unknown particularly for quantitative_traits in our simulations we observe gains in power up to with losses of less than across a wide_range of scenarios considered when using unc combo in our real_data based simulations unc combo is able to identify all causal_snps while other methods miss at least one association testing using ngs_data without genotype_calling is an appealing approach this approach not only avoids the potentially computationally_intensive genotype_calling step but also carries all of the information from sequencing into association in contrast toat least some information_loss with an intermediate genotype_calling step population_structure and other potential_confounding are almost inevitable in gwas_studies and need to be adjusted for in this article we develop unc score test and unc lrt to allow covariate_adjustment in association testing based on glfs both unc score test and unc lrt directly incorporate the uncertainty of the observed sequencing_data into analysis by constructing likelihood_function based on glfs and do not require explicit genotype_calling instead of a two step approach unc lrt produces mle of maf together with mles of regression parameters in one step and thus is theoretically more powerful the unc score test improves upon the previous work of skotte et_al by taking_into the correlation between regression parameter estimators and maf estimator using simulations we have demonstrated that unc score test is generally statistically more powerful than or at least comparable to ska score test unc score test is computationally faster than unc lrt because score test only involves the model under the null_hypothesis and does not require time consuming optimization on the other hand in practice unc lrt can be applied to snps over the entire maf spectrum while unc score test can only be applied to snps with mafs greater than certain threshold p threshold because type i errors of score tests are inflated without maf filtering we therefore propose a combination strategy unc combo to take advantage of the strengths of our two tests as shown in simulation_results for quantitative_trait unc combo improves upon the two unc tests in three aspects i it can be applied to all snps across the entire maf spectrum a desirable feature inherited from unc lrt ii it is computationally more efficient than unc lrt because lrt is calculated only for snps with maf below p threshold iii it manifests higher statistical_power than at least one of the two unc tests in the real_data analysis unc combo outperforms bothunc lrt and unc score test for simulated quantitative_traits for the reasons above we recommend unc combo when the trait s of interest is are quantitative for binary_traits unc score test outperforms other methods and is thus recommended maf and variation in log likelihood_function are two factors potentially correlated with the inflation of type_i of the score test we fit regression_models to investigate the relationship among them we use the determinant of the information matrix as a measure of variation in the log likelihood_function a linear_regression shows that unc score test_statistic is negatively associated with the determinant of information matrix p value e moreover another linear_regression indicates that the determinant of the information matrix is positively associated with maf p value e consequently the lower the maf of a snp the more ill conditioned the information matrix becomes and the more likely to result in inflated_type for a simulated binary trait we also evaluate an alternative approach to filter out snps for the score tests namely estimating mafs using only controls and filtering snps based on control maf estimation simulation_results show that this approach may lead to inflated_type e g type_i is for unc score test and for ska score test with p threshold d and n this is because mafs of rare_variants tent to be overestimated when only controls are used in estimation for example the maf estimate of ascertained singletons in controls would be double of its true value assuming equal numbers of cases and controls if only controls were used to estimate the maf these unwarrantedly retained rare_variants consequently lead to numerical instability and eventually to inflated type i errors in appendix f we introduce correlation between maf estimator and association parameter estimators by letting the effect of the causal snp depend on covariates in real_data this can be observed due to gene_environment under the scenario unc score test outperforms ska score test by up to in practice non negligible correlation between maf and association parameters estimators can arise in various and unknown ways it is thus desirable to have a theoretically more powerful score test unc score test to guard against such scenarios where correlation among maf and regression parameters is non negligible the optimal maf threshold depends on the genetic_architecture number mafs and effect_sizes of the causal_snps which is generally unknown this threshold also depends on the sample_size n and sequencing_depth to err on the conservative side we choose p threshold n as adopted in the literature and as supported by our own simulation_results in the future an optimal threshold might be derived by taking sequencing_depth into account moreover differential sequencing_depths between cases and controls introduce additional biases leading to inflated_type of ska as shown in future work is desired to study the impact of differential sequencing_depths on our proposed unc tests lastly while the current work focuses on single_variant association extension to rare_variant testing is highly warranted given the higher_level of uncertainty in genotype_calling for rarer variants
