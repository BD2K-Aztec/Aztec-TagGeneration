sequence_analysis tmbb db a transmembrane b barrel proteome database motivation we previously_reported the development of a highly_accurate statistical algorithm for identifying barrel outer_membrane or transmembrane barrels tmbbs from genomic sequence_data of gram_negative freeman t c and wimley w c bioinformatics we have now applied this identification algorithm to all available gram_negative bacterial_genomes over chromosomes and have constructed a publicly_available searchable up to date database of all proteins in these genomes results for each protein in the database there is information on i barrel membrane_protein probability for identification of barrels ii strand and hairpin propensity for structure and topology prediction iii signal_sequence score because most tmbbs are secreted through the inner membrane translocon and thus have a signal_sequence and iv transmembrane_helix predictions for reducing false_positive this information is sufficient for the accurate identification of most barrel membrane_proteins in these genomes in the database there are nearly predicted tmbbs out of million total putative proteins of those more than are hypothetical or putative proteins not previously_identified as tmbbs this wealth of genomic_information is not available anywhere else availability the tmbb genomic database is available at http betathe transmembrane barrel tmbb is the dominant architecture of the membrane_spanning proteins found in the outer_membranes of gram_negative although it has been estimated that approximately of the proteins in gram_negative encode tmbbs freeman fewer than unique structures have been determined_experimentally the relatively slow progress in tmbb structural_characterization is partially a consequence of the hydrophobic nature of membrane_proteins which makes standard techniques for purification and crystallization or structure_determination by nuclear_magnetic nmr more difficult while structural_information is scarce genome_sequencing is advancing and accelerating rapidly thus computational_approaches that can utilize the available structural data to predict and identify tmbbs even in the absence of efficient structure_determination are needed the complete genomic_sequences of thousands of organisms have become available in recent_years and a variety of computational_tools have been developed to sift through the abundance of genomic_data toward the goal of identifying the structures and functions of the genes that are expressed as proteins since this process relies strongly on homology to known structures the resultant genomic database annotations for tmbbs are noticeably sparse in the last decade many computational prediction_tools have proven at least partially successful in using the information from the limited examples of tmbbs to distinguish between tmbbs and non tmbbs or to predict the structure and topology of tmbbs among the various approaches are statistical_models neural_networks hidden_markov k nearest_neighbor and support_vector we recently_published a prediction method freeman based on the statistical prevalence of the amino_acids in the transmembrane_segments of known structures which was shown to accurately discriminate tmbbs from non tmbbs here we describe a comprehensive bioinformatics database tmbb db the transmembrane beta_barrel database http beta_barrel tulane edu generated by using the freeman wimley prediction method freeman to analyze the protein_coding of all bacterial chromosomes belonging to gram_negative currently over for each of the million proteins in the database we provide an overall barrel score that can be used to predict if a sequence is likely to encode a tmbb we also provide the freemanwimley strand and hairpin score profiles which are useful for structure and topology prediction furthermore the sequences were analyzed for the presence of an n_terminal signal_sequence because most known tmbb precursors encode export signals at the n terminus that allow translocon dependent transport across the inner membrane finally we have also included a prediction for transmembrane_helices this helps to eliminate false_positives because tmbbs generally do not also have tm helices the information in the database is sufficient for accurate identification of most barrel membrane_proteins in known gram_negative genomes there are to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by for permissions please_e journals permissions com more than hypothetical or putative proteins in the database which are almost certainly barrel membrane_proteins this wealth of genomic_information is not available anywhere else
