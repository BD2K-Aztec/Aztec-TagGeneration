genome_analysis cnanova a new approach for finding recurrent copy_number abnormalities in cancer snp microarray_data motivation the current_generation of single_nucleotide snp_arrays allows measurement of copy_number cnas in cancer at more than one million locations in the genome in hundreds of tumour_samples most research has focused on single sample cna discovery the so_called segmentation problem the availability of high_density large_sample snp_array datasets makes the identification of recurrent copy_number changes in cancer an important issue that can be addressed using the cross sample information results we present a novel approach for finding regions of recurrent copy_number called cnanova from affymetrix snp array data the method derives its statistical_properties from a control dataset composed of normal samples and in contrast to previous methods does not require segmentation and permutation steps for rigorous testing of the algorithm and comparison to existing_methods we developed a simulation scheme that uses the noise distribution present in affymetrix arrays application of the method to acute_lymphoblastic samples shows that cnanova achieves lower error_rate than a popular alternative approach we also describe an extension of the cnanova framework to identify recurrent cna regions with intra tumour heterogeneity present in either primary or relapsed samples from the same patients availability the cnanova package and synthetic datasets are available atdifferent genetic and epigenetic_alterations can lead to the development of cancer by activating oncogenes or inactivating tumour_suppressor copy_number changes are one example of such alterations where amplifications or deletions of genes implicated in cancer_progression can cause abnormal cell_growth and proliferation in the past_decade single_nucleotide snp_arrays have become a de facto standard for detecting copy_number cnas in cancer to whom correspondence should be addressed genomes the latest versions of snp_arrays manufactured by affymetrix and illumina have more than a million polymorphic and non polymorphic np probes for instance the affymetrix snp array has million probes with roughly equal_proportions of snp and np probes the high_density of snp_arrays and the availability of np probes has made snp_arrays the technology of choice for identifying cnas in some recently_published large_scale oncogenomic studies in addition to high_density arrays these studies include a large number of samples both the number of probes and samples create novel data analysis challenges the most common problem is the transformation of normalized logratio values into accurate copy_number calls at the highest possible resolution this so_called single sample segmentation problem has received much attention with numerous methods developed for this task a discussion of segmentation_algorithms for snp_array platforms is available in the supplementary_material cancer_cells usually harbour two types of chromosomal_abnormalities large_scale alterations such as gains_and of whole chromosome_arms and more focal amplifications and deletions given the high rate of genomic_instability found in cancer_cells large_scale copy_number changes usually represent passenger_mutations and due to their large size do not facilitate discovery of functional driver events that lead to malignancy on the other hand due to their smaller_size and recurrence detection of focal cnas could lead to the identification of new genes implicated in cancer_progression this can be facilitated by the availability of high_density large samplesize snp_array datasets where cross sample frequency information can be used to identify driver cnas and distinguish them from random_mutations and probe intensity artefacts several methods for finding regions of recurrent_cnas using acgh and snp microarray_data have been described in the literature a review and qualitative comparison of different methods can be found in shah a common_theme in these methods is that they require a preliminary segmentation step to find regions of interest for each sample for example significance testing for aberrant copy_number stac starts by creating a binary matrix from the normalized log ratios with zeros designating no change and ones designating losses and gains it then utilizes two complementary statistics footprint and frequency to define recurrent cna regions based on their length and the number of samples they occur in a potential problem with this approach is thewe have presented a novel framework cnanova for using unsegmented snp microarray_data to identify recurrent copy_number in cancer it uses pseudo replication to increase_statistical and in contrast to segmentation based_methods does not require permutations to estimate the null_distribution of test_statistics instead this distribution is approximated using samples from a control set representing normal samples cnanova circumvents the need to specify a threshold on segmented log ratios for calling probes with copy_number changes this threshold could be sample region dataset and platform dependent which makes it hard to determine an optimal value and can increase the error_rate of segmentation based_methods this is especially true for the current_generation of the snp_arrays such as affymetrix snp that often exhibit wave patterns and other artefacts another advantage of cnanova stems from decoupling the process of identifying cross sample boundaries of the regions of recurrent_cnas and pinpointing the actual samples with copy_number changes this insures that copy_number changes with extreme probe intensity values do not influence cna detectability in other samples high probe intensity values fed into permutationbased methods such as gistic may increase the false_negative by increasing the g score for gistic in the permuted dataset and therefore the overall threshold for calling significant cnas in its later implementation gistic has introduced capping of segmented log ratios with extreme probe intensities the comparison with gistic suggests that it tends to have higher_error than cnanova when using affymetrix snp arrays in addition to the dataset dependent thresholds derived from the permutation_based estimation of the null_distribution the higher_error could be explained by the fact that gistic was originally adapted for use with lower_density arrays and a more robust probe set design at the same time dependence on the control dataset requires noise in the cancer and normal samples to follow approximately identical distributions in addition the number of normal samples should be sufficient to capture different probe intensity artefacts and patterns of noise in the often larger cancer dataset further simulations showed supplementary section results that the algorithm is typically robust against sample_size and noise properties of the control dataset only in cases of extremely_low control sample_sizes of the size of the cancer dataset the impact on the error_rate becomes significant some conceptual ideas relating to different steps of the cnanova framework have been discussed in the literature derived a parametric mathematical_model for protein based assays which was then used to simulate additional data_points to better capture dependencies between variables within the decision_tree such an approach resembles our pseudo replication strategy the use of normal control samples to control fdr was proposed byto correct the fp signals in chip_seq arising from the open chromatin conformation at pol_ii sites decomposition of the variance has been recently_proposed in the context of acgh data analysis by where cnas were associated with cancer tissue_types the statistical_framework of cnanova can be extended by incorporating more complex models as we exemplified with a two factor nested anova design for identifying cnas with intrapatient heterogeneity a useful extension could be developed to identify recurrent_cnas prevalent in a particular tumour subtype or progression stage in contrast to clustering such an approach can provide an association of individual cnas with a specific tumour phenotype focus on individual regions rather than clusters could facilitate the discovery and testing of new candidate_genes similarly additional data and biological annotation such as gene_expression data or pathway centred gene_sets could be used to discover functionally_related sets of recurrent_cnas
