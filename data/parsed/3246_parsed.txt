sequence_analysis neuropid a predictor for identifying neuropeptide precursors from metazoan proteomes motivation the evolution of multicellular_organisms is associated with increasing variability of molecules governing behavioral and physiological_states this is often achieved by neuropeptides nps that are produced in neurons from a longer protein named neuropeptide precursor npp the maturation of nps occurs through a sequence of proteolytic cleavages the difficulty in identifying npps is a consequence of their diversity and the lack of applicable sequence_similarity among the short functionally_related nps results herein we describe neuropeptide precursor identifier neuropid a machine_learning scheme that predicts metazoan npps neuropid was trained on hundreds of identified npps from the uniprotkb database some features were extracted from the primary sequences and processed using support_vector svm and ensemble decision_tree classifiers these features combined biophysical chemical and informationalstatistical properties of nps and npps other features were guided by the defining characteristics of the dibasic cleavage_sites motif neuropid reached accuracy and precision in cross_validation blind tests against known npps with an emphasis on chordata and arthropoda neuropid also identified npp like proteins from extensively_studied model_organisms as well as from poorly_annotated proteomes we then focused on the most significant sets of features that contribute to the success of the classifiers we propose that npps are attractive targets for investigating and modulating behavior metabolism and homeostasis and that a rich repertoire of nps remains to be identified availability neuropid source_code is freely_available atpeptides are known to be key modulators in behavior sensation and homeostasis biologically_active that are produced and secreted from neurons and act to modulate their function are collectively called peptide modulators or neuropeptides nps nps represent a widespread mode of communication that is found from cnidarians to bilaterians including mammals np precursors npps are subjected to regulated cleavages that result in the production of functionally_active nps the processing of nps occurs along the secretory_pathway in most instances nps locally modulate presynaptic or postsynaptic cell activity from a functional perspective known effects of nps include stress control pain_perception social_behaviors and sleepwake cycle nps also regulate food uptake maintaining appetite and body_weight the peripheral nps that act outside the central_nervous regulate gastrointestinal and immunological functions for example some nps induce chemotactic response in attracting immature_dendritic to the site of inflammation in this context substances p and k two extensively_studied nps induce the production and release of inflammatory_cytokines from blood_monocytes social nps such as oxytocin and arginine_vasopressin regulate complex social_cognition and behavior including pair bonding social recognition and maternal_behavior the immense diversity among nps contributes to the wide_range of behavioral tasks that are carried_out a common_feature for the majority of nps is their production from a larger precursor npp the production of short bioactive_peptides is a result of a series of cleavages and maturation events npp can produce multiple copies of different nps notably a cluster of basic_residues specifies these cleavage_sites the occurrence of dibasic residues specifies the canonical sites for intracellular endopeptidases such as furin however some nps that act in cellcell communication e g cathepsin l do not obey the dibasic residues specificity rule the identity and regulation of the key peptidases that are responsible for the processing of the npp remains an active research field nps typically bind cell_surface g proteins coupled receptors gpcrs that initiate a signaling_cascade an evolutionary_analysis of npps and their cognate gpcrs suggested a diversification that occurred in certain taxonomical branches the nps and their receptors are attractive targets for drug_development and translational_medicine based on their role in feeding sexual_behavior and cellular_homeostasis the goal of this research is to enable systematic identification of npps and nps at a genome_wide scale the difficulty in identifying nps and classifying genes as potential nps stems from the following i current gene_annotation tools mostly rely on sequence_conservation traits however nps that exhibit the same function may share minimal sequence_similarity additionally homologous npps may still produce nps that are species specific ii structural inference tools fail when applied to short_peptides consequently assigning functions to known npps and identifying previously overlooked related genes call for developing an alternative strategy furthermore the shortage of experimental validated sequences is large and growing thus methods that are primarily based on rules extracted from the limited number of known examples lack the ability to generalize to unseen instances in this research we applied a supervised machine_learning ml model based on extracting features directly from the primary sequence importantly our method for identifying npp candidates is alignment_free statistical support_vector svm models and decision_tree based_classifiers e g random_forests were chosen as the preferred strategy we present neuropeptide precursor identifier neuropid a predicting machine that was trained on a curated set of npps the high_accuracy of neuropid was confirmed based on cross_validation cv tests furthermore we selected a sparse set of features that contributed maximally to the successful classification by neuropid finally we provide a candidate list of npp related proteins a list of filtered npp predictions from the_fruit the worm caenorhabditis_elegans the
