shrimp sensitive yet practical short_read we report on a major update version of the original short_read program shrimp shrimp primarily targets mapping sensitivity and is able to achieve high_accuracy at a very reasonable speed shrimp supports both letter space and color_space ab solid reads enables for direct alignment of paired_reads and uses parallel computation to fully utilize multi core architectures high_throughput hts machines produce datasets of million_reads of base_pairs bp per run the first step in the analysis of hts datasets is mapping the reads to a reference_genome which is followed by specialized processing_tools that aim to identify signals e g genomic_variants or high coverage peaks from the mappings mapping hts reads to a large reference_genome is a non trivial computational task and the various read_mapping programs that have been developed in recent_years target different speed accuracy trade_offs programs that primarily target speed are typically based on near exact string matching methods whereas programs that primarily target sensitivity alignment of reads with high polymorphism or to a distant reference are often based on projections with spaced seeds for a recent survey of the current read_mapping programs see here we report on a major update version of the short_read program shrimp primarily targets mapping accuracy enabling the alignment of reads with extensive polymorphism and sequencing_errors while featuring a significant speedup over previous versions shrimp supports fasta and fastq input sam output illumina solexa roche and ab solid reads a paired mapping mode parameters for mirna mapping and parallel computation
