coregnet reconstruction and integrated analysis of co regulatory_networks coregnet is an r bioconductor_package to analyze large_scale transcriptomic_data by highlighting sets of co regulators based on a transcriptomic dataset coregnet can be used to reconstruct a large_scale co regulatory_network integrate regulation evidences such as transcription_factor and chip data estimate sample specific regulator activity identify cooperative transcription_factors and analyze the sample specific combinations of active regulators through an interactive visualization_tool in this study coregnet was used to identify driver regulators of bladder_cancer availability coregnet is available at http bioconductor org_packages coregnetrecent advances in genomics enabled the profiling of thousands of tumors by large consortia and individual laboratories while the amount of data holds_great for our understanding of tumorigenesis these datasets necessitate efficient methodologies to extract valuable knowledge from them transcriptomics is the most commonly available type of tumor large_scale data the transcriptome reflects the genetic epigenetic and environmental states of a tumor_tissue and determines a great extent the phenotype of cells therefore one of the first step towards the construction of a mechanistic_model underlying cancer is the identification of the sets of transcription_factors tf that actively maintain a malignant phenotype this requires methodologies to model the tissue_specificity of gene_regulation by inferring trustful context specific networks more importantly these models must take into account the complexity of mammalian gene_regulation often involving the coordinated action of several tf to identify tumor driving active regulatory_circuits we propose a bioconductor_package named coregnet to i reconstruct a large_scale co regulatory_network from gene_expression data and by integrating additional regulatory evidences such as tf_binding and chip data ii estimate the activity of each tf of the network in any given sample iii predict sets of cooperative tf and iv identify sample specific combination of active and driver tf using an interactive visualization_tool integrating genomic_aberrations the proposed methods can be used as independent modules with alternative inputs such as networks inferred by other methods experimentally defined networks or a different transcriptomic_data for tf_activity prediction and visualization e g cell_lines of same tissue the following sections outline the functions of the coregnet package and its application to the characterization of the driver regulators of bladder cancer_subtypes
