haplotype synthesis analysis reveals functional_variants underlying known genome_wide associated susceptibility_loci motivation the functional mechanisms underlying_disease association remain_unknown for genome_wide gwas susceptibility variants located outside coding_regions synthesis of effects from multiple surrounding functional_variants has been suggested as an explanation of hard to interpret findings we define filter criteria based on linkage_disequilibrium measures and allele_frequencies which reflect expected properties of synthesizing variant sets for eligible candidate sets we search for haplotype markers that are highly_correlated with associated variants results via simulations we assess the performance of our approach and suggest parameter_settings which guarantee sensitivity at fold reduced computational_cost we apply our method to genomes data and confirmed crohns_disease cd and type_diabetes t d variants a proportion of allowed explanation by three variant haplotypes carrying at least two functional_variants as compared to for random variants p association could be explained by missense_variants for muc per cd and hmg a t d in a cd gwas imputed using haplotype reference consortium data haplotypes we could confirm the syntheses of muc and per and identified synthesis by missense_variants for further genes zgpaz gpr cln npipb loc rs gckr in all instances the odds_ratios of the synthesizing haplotypes were virtually_identical to that of the index snp in summary we demonstrate the potential of synthesis analysis to guide functional follow_up of gwas findings availability_and all methods are implemented in the c c toolkit getsynth available at http sourceforge net_projects getsynth genome_wide gwas see e g and detected a multitude of genetic risk_variants associated with complex_diseases and phenotypes for a great portion of these variants the underlying_biological are still unknown while in public_databases the gene closest to the strongest association_signal is provisionally listed as the susceptibility_gene other genes nearby might embody the true functional origin and cause the association_signal via more or less complicated patterns of linkage_disequilibrium ld as pointedthere is no guarantee that causal_variants are in particular high_ld with the top association_signal we will call the tag variant throughout this work for instance interaction between multiple_variants may interfere with the ability to find either of them separately but create a signal at a distantly linked marker see also suggested that an association of a common_variant with a complex disease can be synthetically created by multiple rarer functional_variants from a surrounding genomic_region in this case the rarer variants occur more often or exclusively on a haplotype branch carrying a specific allele of the tag variant generating in this way the strongest association_signal at this locus this situation is depicted inof the idea can be quantified by checking whether the ld measures between tag variant and candidate variants yield jd j while r need not be large examples for such synthetic associations have been reported from gwas and sequencing studies a statistical_method to test a given set of variants for synthetic association with a quantitative_trait has been described by the concept of synthetic association has also given rise to some debate some authors considered the ubiquity of synthetic associations to be unlikely while others discussed whether synthetic associations should have already been detected by linkage_analysis and whether a rare only model is applicable to a lot of gwas findings in addition the expected properties of synthetic associations were empirically assessed via simulation_studies with partially contradictory results the authors ofstated that rarer variants that contribute to a synthetic association might be as far as megabases mb away whereas the authors ofreported that in of their simulations at least one rare causal_variant was already captured within a window of size kilobases kb in any case it can be stated that until now there is no complete understanding of which role synthetic associations actually play in the etiology of complex_diseases and how frequent the phenomenon of synthesis really is in view of the lacking consensus we started an empirical evaluation of the frequency of the phenomenon until now no methods have been provided to systematically search for sets of variants that synthesize the association of a common_variant a major reason for this is the computational load already within a kb region_surrounding a susceptibility locus typically variants are to be expected with n eligible variants in an identified trait related susceptibility region there are n variant sets to be investigated even when only sets with for instance up to variants shall be tested for potential synthesis different sets have to be investigated in view of the large number an efficient search_engine is prerequisite for the detection of synthetic associations identification of such variant sets is highly_relevant for the follow_up of association_signals that were produced by gwas or next_generation ngs association studies in order to come closer disease_relevant biological_function
