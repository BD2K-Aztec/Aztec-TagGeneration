databases_and mychembl a virtual_machine implementation of open data and cheminformatics tools mychembl is a completely open platform which combines public_domain bioactivity data with open_source database and cheminformatics technologies mychembl consists of a linux ubuntu virtual_machine featuring a postgresql schema with the latest_version of the chembl database as well as the latest rdkit cheminformatics libraries in addition a self contained web_interface is available which can be modified and improved according to user specifications availability_and the vm is available at the past_decade has seen a dramatic_increase in the number of informatics tools enabling the efficient analysis of the large chemical biological and clinical datasets currently being produced by both academic_institutions and pharmaceutical_companies in the context of drug_discovery this was partly catalyzed by the development of freely_accessible repositories containing expertly curated and annotated medicinal_chemistry and chemical_biology data for example the chembl database is a public_domain chemogenomics resource which provides experimental_data about the interactions between small_molecules including approved drugs and clinical candidates and specific biological_targets reported in the primary medicinal_chemistry literature to facilitate the manipulation of such structureactivity relationship data the integration of chemical_information tools is required these tools could then be a part of larger data_mining protocols currently a limited number of open_source cheminformatics packages are available while more importantly few of them incorporate chemical searching functionality using relational_database architectures i e a chemistry cartridge rdkit offers such functionality within a postgresql environment based on the easy integration of these open tools and data a virtual_machine was configured and is ready to be used by both expert users who can write and execute custom sql queries and new users who can take advantage of a self contained and user_friendly interface
