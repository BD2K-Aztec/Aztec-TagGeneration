sequence_analysis interactive_exploration of rna microrna target predictions microrna mirna_target is an important problem given an mirna sequence the task is to determine the identity of the messenger_rnas targeted by it the locations within them where the interactions happen and the specifics of the formed heterodu plexes here we describe a web_based application rna gui which we have designed and implemented for the interactive_exploration and in context visualization of predictions by rna one of the popular mirna_target prediction_algorithms central to our design has been the requirement to provide informative and comprehensive visu_alization that is integrated with interactive search capabilities and permits one to selectively isolate and focus on relevant_information that is distilled on the fly from a large repository of pre compiled predictions rna gui is currently available for homo_sapiens mus_musculus drosophila_melanogaster and caenorhabditis_elegans microrna mirnas are non_coding nucleotides in length that regulate messenger_rna mrna_expression in a sequence dependent_manner efforts during the past_decade have shown the importance of mirna based regulation in diverse contexts and in health and disease thus the ability to predict mirna_targets has attracted a lot of attention and several algorithms have been proposed for a review see despite progress the problem of mirna_target has proven to be a vexing one and improved solutions continue to be sought rna differs from other algorithms in several ways it is trained with known mirnas not with experimentally_validated heteroduplexes it permits combinations of g u wobbles and bulges in the seed_region of a heteroduplex and it neither relies on nor requires a targets conservation across genomes rna has successfully predicted non canonical targets as well as targets beyond the untranslated_region utr also independent studies have shown that rna exhibits a high signal_to to facilitate work with rna_targets we implemented a pre populated link to facta allows the generation of term associations for the genes function other links allow one to view the most accessed transcripts and to submit questions comments through email
