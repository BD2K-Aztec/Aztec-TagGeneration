gene_expression a model for the expression of gap genes based on the jeffreys type equation motivation we propose the third order model equation of the jeffreys type for concentrations of gap gene proteins in order to take into account particle inertia gap genes are responsible for formation of body_segments in drosophila_melanogaster embryo during its early development usually the expression of the genes is described by the model of protein transport based on conventional diffusion_equation however the model is known to govern the brownian non inertial motion of particles hence it is hardly applicable to the description of protein transport results analysis of the jeffreys type equation results in the necessary condition for the problem to be well posed application of the jeffreys type equation with non linear terms to description of the dynamics of gap gene network demonstrates better fitting to experimental_data than the conventional model availability_and implementation of solver algorithms and the software are freely_available from https github com wswgg solver for the jeffreys type equations system contact segmentation genes play crucial_role in early development of drosophila_melanogaster being responsible for formation and positioning of body_segments nusslein the segmentation genes are divided_into four classes maternal genes gap genes pair rule genes and segment polarity genesaccording to their mutant phenotype for details see nusslein at present gap genes have become popular investigation object in particular for system biologists due to the following reasons first the gap gene system is the most upstream regulatory layer among zygotic genes controlling d melanogaster embryogenesis and determining both the position and the identities of body_segments second availability of big amount of experimental_data on gene_expression enable to model mathematically and reconstruct the gap gene network in silico usually the gene_expression is described by means of conventional model based on the parabolic reaction diffusion_equation written for an unknown protein concentration function u x t as u t d u xx rx t ux t where x is space coordinate t is time d is the diffusion_coefficient and rx t ux t is a reaction term representing protein production and its degradation equation was proposed in for description of the dynamics of internal_state of nuclei in blastoderm of d melanogaster embryo and originally contained the diffusion term in discrete form the model took into account three major processes essential for embryo_development synthesis of proteins their to explain the dynamics of the bicoid maternal protein in d melanogaster embryo it is known as the synthesis diffusion degradation model the model equation with diffusion term in continuous or in discrete form have been widely used in the last two decades for description of diffusive transport of proteins e g synthesized by maternal gene bicoid or gap genes in d melanogaster embryo blastoderm during early embryogenesis however has a crucial drawback it is based on the phenomenological fick law for mass flux which was formulated for brownian_motion of non inertial particles and therefore it is applicable only for description of light particles motion for example in an ideal gas proteins are heavy complex organic_molecules and for this reason the classical_approach is hardly applicable for modelling of protein transfer mathematically non inertial description of inertial particle transport leads to an infinite velocity of disturbances propagation defined by for example when rx t and with initial condition ux dx where dx is the dirac delta function the fundamental solution to has the form and it is positive for any finite values of x therefore a sudden change of a substance concentration somewhere will immediately transfer to any arbitrary point the profile of at certain time moment is shown in see e g and we call this phenomenon of an infinite velocity as the diffusion paradox for brevity immediate disturbances propagation contradicts with experiments in which proteins move in an embryo very slow with the velocities about mm s see in cattaneo proposed the telegraph equation containing additional relaxation time and therefore free from the diffusion paradox to model mass heat_transfer the fundamental solution to the equation describes propagation of disturbances with finite velocity but due to the wave like behaviour it may reach negative_values inappropriate from biological viewpoint furthermore the fundamental solution to the telegraph equation with the dirac delta function as an initial condition contains two discontinuous wave fronts propagating in opposite_directions in joseph and preziosi proposed the description of heat_transfer based on the refined model for flux of rheological fluid in the earth crust introduced in by h jeffreys similarly one can obtain an equation for determination of mass_transfer via elimination of the flux function from the mass_balance equation u t x t j x x t rx t ux t and the jeffreys refined formula for flux jx t s j t x t d d u x x t s d u xt x t the resulting jeffreys type equation s u tt u t sd u xxt d d u xx rx t s r t x t contains two additional parameters as compared with namely the relaxation time s and the second diffusion_coefficient d thus taking_into the particle inertia the particular solution to at certain time moment under the assumptions rx t ux dx u t x is shown in it can be seen that a small amount of particles occurs at infinity and the diffusion paradox for the dirac delta function as an initial condition is not completely_eliminated by the proposed model however even in this case the jeffreystype equation describes formation of a smooth wave front from an initial sharp discontinuity that is always positive and its propagation with finite velocity applications of the jeffreys type equation to different physical_problems can be found in joseph and preziosi a b due to similarity between heat and mass_transfer both the telegraph equation and the jeffreys type equation are of interest for description of protein transport in biological_systems nevertheless the maternal and gap genes expression in d melanogaster embryo is often modelled by means of the parabolic reaction diffusion_equation which limited applicability has been widely_discussed see the conventional model is still popular due to simplicity and similarity at large time scales of the fundamental solutions to all parabolic the telegraph and the jeffreys type equations as shown in in this article we apply the mathematical_model consisting of the coupled jeffreys type equations with non linear reaction terms to study the dynamics of protein concentrations in gene network of four gap genes the equations are solved numerically and the results will be compared with experimental_data and with numerical solution to the model based on the conventional diffusion_equation we compared the results of numerical_simulation in the framework of the new model based on the coupled jeffreys type equations with the experimental_data from the flyex database in the bounded region from to of el along the anteriorposterior ap axis the model_parameters were obtained via fitting the numerical solution to data the value of residual mean square rms moments therefore the other boundary values required for the numerical scheme with the dirichlet boundary_conditions were obtained by linear_interpolation these modifications resulted in decrease the value of rms and lowest value is rms results of modified numerical_simulations are presented in the values of the regulation matrix coefficients are presented inel with boundary_conditions of the dirichlet type the lowest rms demonstrates substantially better fit to experimental_data in comparison to the neumann boundary_conditions therefore we conclude that the dirichlet boundary_conditions provide better results for modelling the gap genes expression than the conditions of the neumann type the values of the regulation matrix coefficients presented in are also in good agreement with experiments and with results for conventional model as well as for the model with the neumann boundary_conditions from the graphs init can be seen that the modelled concentration_profiles are similar to those for the model with the neumann boundary_conditions in nevertheless is should be noted that the usage of the dirichlet boundary_conditions allows us to predict the expression of all genes very close to the experimental_data near the computational domain boundaries for both genotypes however the narrower expression domain of gt protein its sharp maximum and the shifted hb expression maximum in kr mutant require further study
