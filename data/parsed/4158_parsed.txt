data_and sdrs an algorithm for analyzing large_scale dose_response doseresponse information is critical to understanding drug effects yet analytical_methods for doseresponse assays cannot cope with the dimensionality of large_scale screening data such as the microarray profiling data to overcome_this we developed and implemented the sigmoidal dose response search sdrs algorithm a grid_search based method designed to handle large_scale doseresponse data this method not only calculates the pharmacological parameters for every assay but also provides built in statistic that enables downstream systematic_analyses such as characterizing dose response at the transcriptome level availability bio sdrs is freely_available from cpan www cpan org contacts doseresponse assays are routinely used in todays pharmaceutical_development mechanistically compound target binding occurs at a single site and follows the law of mass action that is reflected by the sigmoidal doseresponse pattern seen in many assays in statistics sigmoidal dose responses can be identified by non linear_regression a form of regression_analysis where the model function is a non linear combination of the model_parameters non linear regression_methods such as the well known levenbergmarquardt algorithm involve successive approximations that aim at minimizing an error function despite the general applicability of the iterative non linear regression_methods there are a couple of limitations in their application to large_scale doseresponse screening data first the iterative methods do not impose a boundary on the model parameter_values and thus the output model may contain unrealistic or uninterpretable values such as a negative ec second these methods only calculate the parameter_values and fitting statistic for the best model but do not provide a means that can be integrated in downstream_analyses such as the characterization of transcriptome response to whom correspondence should be addressed recently described a grid_search based algorithm sigmoidal dose response search sdrs for identifying transcripts that exhibited sigmoidal dose response to the treatments of kinase_inhibitors since the sdrs algorithm is generic and can be expanded to identify other doseresponse patterns in different sources of quantitative data we have implemented the method as a perl module with c inline codes bio sdrs we demonstrated the general_utility of the method using a dataset from high_content hcs
