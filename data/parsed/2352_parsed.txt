imbalanced multi_label for identifying antimicrobial_peptides and their functional types motivation with the rapid increase of infection resistance to antibiotics it is urgent to find novel infection therapeutics in recent_years antimicrobial_peptides amps have been utilized as potential alternatives for infection therapeutics amps are key components of the innate_immune system and can protect the host from various pathogenic_bacteria identifying amps and their functional types has led to many studies and various predictors using machine_learning have been developed however there is room for improvement in particular no predictor takes_into the lack of balance among different functional amps results in this paper a new synthetic minority over sampling technique on imbalanced and multi_label data_sets referred to as ml smote was designed for processing and identifying amps functional families a novel multi_label classifier mlamp was also developed using ml smote and grey pseudo amino_acid the classifier obtained subset accuracy and hamming loss availability a user_friendly web_server for mlamp was established at http www jci bioinfo cn mlamp with rapid increase in the infection resistance of antibiotics it is urgent to find novel infection therapeutics over the past_decade antimicrobial_peptides amps have been utilized as potential alternatives for fighting infectious_diseases amps are key components of the innate_immune system and can protect the host from various pathogenic_bacteria in invertebrates and vertebrates amps have dual roles rapid microbial killing and subsequent immune_modulation these effects result from amp inducing multiple damages in bacteria by disrupting bacteria membranes by inhibiting proteins dna and rna_synthesis or by interacting with certain intracellular targets therefore amps were developed increasingly for new drugs some examples of using amps in therapeutics have been reported popovic et_al found that peptides with antimicrobial and antiinflammatory activities had therapeutic_potential for treatment of acne_vulgaris yancheva et_al synthesized a novel didepsipeptide with antimicrobial_activity against four of five tested bacterial strains_of conlon et_al demonstrated that peptides with antimicrobial_activity from frog_skin could stimulate insulin_release and hence had potential as an incretinbased therapy for type_diabetes in addition amps have been used as anticancer peptides in cancer_therapy a surge in research on amps has promoted the development of various databases and prediction_tools apd is a system dedicated to establishing a glossary nomenclature classification information search prediction design and statistics of amps it gathered amps from the literature camp holds antimicrobial sequences and d structures of amps together with prediction and sequence_analysis tested all subsequences ranging from to amino_acids of the plant proteins in associate editor dr john hancock uniprokb swiss_prot and constructed an amp database for plant_species named c pamp zhao et_al developed lamp a database used to aid the discovery and design of amps as new antimicrobial_agents the database contains natural amps and synthetic_peptides dbaasp was a manually_curated database built by gogoladze et_al and it collected those peptides for which antimicrobial_activities against particular targets have been evaluated experimentally generally amps are short_peptides with amino_acids and have very low_sequence to one another so it is challenging to identify amps and its activities by automatic tools researchers made considerable efforts in this regard in these studies the support_vector svm was usually used as prediction engine besides nearest_neighbor or k nearest_neighbor algorithm random_forests rfs decision_tree model and hidden_markov hmms were also applied as classifiers some predictors were only used to identify whether novel peptides are amps in addition to these simple binary classifiers there were some multi class classifiers created a decision_tree model to classify the antimicrobial_activities of synthetic_peptides into four classes none low medium and high joseph developed classamp to predict the propensity of a peptide_sequence to have antibacterial antifungal or antiviral_activity khamis et_al studied amp families and sub families they selected a specific description of amp amino_acid and identified compositional and physicochemical_properties of amino_acids to distinguish each amp family furthermore xiao et_al proposed a two level multi_label classifier iamp l which identifies not only whether a peptide is an amp but also its functional activities although these methods have their own advantages and did play_an in the research they have following problems firstly most models only identified whether a new sequence is amp but not its type secondly it is hard to search short_peptides in the database because amps usually have only amino_acids methods based on blast_search and gene_ontology are often ineffective last but not least classifying amps functions is a multi_label mlc especially when the number of amps with different activities does not distribute evenly from apd it is seen that antibacterial peptides occupy more than of all amps which is a highly unbalanced mlc none of aforementioned automatic models considered the unbalanced amounts among various activities in the past_two the topic of learning from multi_label data_sets mlds has drawn significant attention from researchers moreover mlc methods are increasingly_applied in various fields such as semantic annotation of images categorization and bioinformatics the existing mlc methods can be grouped into two categories problem transformation methods which transform mlc either into one or more single label classification or regression_problem and algorithm adaptation methods which extend specific learning algorithms in order to handle mlds directly numerous mlc algorithms were proposed such as adaboost mh and adaboost mr ml knn classifier chains and multi_label nave_bayes mlc often has serious issues of unbalanced data_sets in which the numbers of samples from minority classes are substantially fewer than from majority classes for example in subcellular_localization prediction the number of the cytoplasm proteins is times the number of the melanosome proteins a similar situation occurs in many studies standard machine_learning often cannot achieve ideal performance when trained on unbalanced data_set one approach to address_this is to adapt existing classifier learning algorithms to strengthen learning with regard to the minority class another approach is to artificially sample the class distribution combining both approaches can also achieve strong classifiers unquestionably the sampling_approach continues to be popular various over and under sampling methods have been proposed among them smote synthetic minority oversampling techinque is a state of art over sampling methods chawla argued that smote creates effective regions for learning the minority class rather than being subsumed by the majority class samples around them in bioinformatics some studies have applied smote to balance the skewing benchmark_datasets in addition similar approaches have been recently_introduced to handle the unbalanced datasets such as monte_carlo sampling and fusion ensemble approach although the aforementioned methods have some success in addressing unbalanced data_sets they have not achieved a satisfactory result in processing multi labeled and imbalanced datasets simultaneously few works address the imbalance problem in mlc took into account the imbalance in predicting subcellular_localization of human proteins built an undersampling and oversampling algorithm on mlds those studies improved the multi_label classification_performance however they have some drawbacks in how to address the multi_label character of the new synthetic instance in this paper we tackle the imbalanced problem by a novel oversampling model referred to as ml smote which is a synthetic minority oversampling on mlds we developed a new tool as a two level amp predictor based on ml smote for a peptides sequence we first identify whether it is an amp if yes we then predict what potential activities it has the first level is a binary predictor and the second level predictor is an unbalanced and multi labeled multiclasses predictor the result shows ml smote can adjust the label set distribution to improve the performance of the predictor after the sequence feature retrieval and ml smote preprocessing as described above a two level amp predictor named mlamp was constructed in which the ensemble of classifier chains ecc algorithm was adopted as the prediction method we used the canonical implementation of ecc provided by the mulan multi_label in the library and for ecc the binary and multiclass learners are implemented on the weka platform using the random_forest rf algorithm breiman mlamp is a two level prediction engine see the first level of mlamp predicts a query peptide as amp or non amp by using the rf algorithm it belongs to the case of single label classification the following four measures were used for examining the performance of a single label predictor they are overall accuracy or acc mathews correlation_coefficient or mcc sensitivity or sn and specificity or sp where tp represents the true_positive tn the true negative fp the false_positive fn the false_negative although eq was often used in the literature to measure the prediction quality of a method they often lack intuitiveness especially to biologists particularly the mcc according to chous formulation these four measures can be expressed as where n stands for the total number of amp samples investigated whereas n for the number of amp samples incorrectly predicted to be of non amp n for the total number of non amp samples investigated whereas n for the number of non amp samples incorrectly predicted to be of amp with such a formulation as given in eq the meanings of sensitivity specificity overall accuracy and mathews correlation_coefficient and their scopes would become more intuitive and easier tounderstand particularly for the mathews correlation_coefficient as concurred by a series of studies published very recently if a query peptide is predicted as amp the second level of mlamp will start to classify its functional families this process belongs to the case of multi_label hamming loss subset accuracy accuracy precision and recall are the mostly used evaluation metrics for the performance of a multi_label classifier suppose is the subset that contains all the labels for the kth sample p is the subset that contains all the predicted labels for the kth sample p n is the total number of samples and m is the total number of labels in this study n and m the five metrics have been clearly defined as follows where is the operator acting on the set therein to count the number of its elements andwhen assessing a predictor the following three cross_validation methods are often used in the literature independent data_set test subsampling k fold_cross test and jackknife test however as elaborated in among the three cross_validation methods the jackknife test is deemed the least arbitrary and most objective because it can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark data_set hence the jackknife test was adopted in this study to examine the anticipated success_rates of the current predictor the process of jackknife test can be explained as follows input multi_label dataset t pi i n output predicted label set for i n t is divided_into testing dataset ts pi and training_dataset tr t ts generate new training_dataset tr by using ml somte on tr train model on tr by using ecc algorithm predict the label set of pi by the model trained above end forcompares the performance of mlamp with an existing method iamp l in the first level result on the benchmark eq where overall accuracy acc and mcc achieved by mlamp are higher than those achieved by iamp l to further demonstrate the power of the mlamp predictor we compared it with other classical predictors on an independent dataset containing amps and non amps this comparison was used for independent testing in the results listed inwere obtained by mlamp iamp l and camp on as shown in the performances achieved by mlamp is remarkably_higher than the performances reported by iamp l and camp in all metrics sn sp acc and mcc furthermore in the second level prediction mlamp also obtained better performance than iamp l some different metrics were used from single label classification in particular hamming loss accuracy precision recall and subset accuracy were commonly_applied in mlc gives the detailed jackknife test results on the amp dataset eq especially mlamp gained a success_rate in the strict assessment of subset accuracy and this performance was higher than that by iamp l why can these metrics be improved so remarkably by using mlamp there are two key reasons the first reason is probably the new peptide feature coding model see eq sorts the features in decreasing order after analyzing the benchmark data_set by the feature_selection tool minimal redundancy maximalrelevance mrmr as shown in those features generated by the grey model include more information than amino_acids frequency especially their biochemical_properties and one can draw a conclusion that some physicochemical_properties of amino_acids may play_an in amp such as molecular_weight pi and pk the second reason points to the new ml smote model the amp dataset is an imbalance mld and previous_studies did not take it into account after processing the training_dataset by the mlsmote model the balance property of the new synthetic training data_set was improved which can help the machine_learning obtained a better performance due to increasing antibiotic_resistance amps which are key components of innate_immune system are becoming more and more important in drug_development efficiently and effectively identifying amps and their functional types has become an urgent research_topic the results reported in this study indicate that the novel predictor mlamp provides an accurate and useful tool for researchers to find new infection therapeutics mlamp obtained a better prediction_performance than that of a previous method the primary reason for our good performance is our formulation models peptide extraction features since amps usually have amino_acids our model eq is good for formulating short_peptides it includes the internal relationship of amino_acids sequence in various physical_chemical the second reason is the mlsmote model which does a good job of handling the lack of balance problem in multi_label data_sets compared with other methods the sample synthetized by using ml smote retains the multi_label distributions it not only accumulates minority samples but also keeps the label density of mld in the future the mlsmote model can be extended to assist with imbalance and multi_label data_sets for other problems for practical_applications a user_friendly web_server for mlamp has been established at http www jci bioinfo cn mlamp which allows users to easily obtain their desired results without the need to follow the complicated mathematical equations involved in developing the predictor users can submit a peptide_sequence to the webserver and subsequently the webserver will return the predicted result in real_time alternatively users can choose the batch prediction by entering their e mail address and their batch input_file of many peptide_sequences they will quickly receive an email showing the predicted results from seconds to hours depending on the number of sequences
