mpea metabolite pathway_enrichment we present metabolite pathway_enrichment mpea for the visualization and biological_interpretation of metabolite data at the system level our tool follows the concept of gene_set gsea and tests whether metabolites involved in some predefined pathway occur towards the top or bottom of a ranked query compound list in particular mpea is designed to handle many to many relationships that may occur between the query compounds and metabolite annotations for a demonstration we analysed metabolite profiles of twin_pairs with differing body_weights mpea found significant pathways from data that had no significant individual query compounds its results were congruent with those discovered from transcriptomics_data and it detected more pathways than the competing metabolic_pathway method did availability the web_server and source_code of mpea are available atmetabolite profiling refers to a set of techniques by which a wide_range of metabolites can be detected and quantified from biological extracts such experiments are often conducted to discover biomarkers and data resulting from these studies are analyzed using complex multivariate_statistical recently tools for analysing metabolite data in the context of predefined biological metabolite sets have however been reported instead of discovering specific metabolites that discriminate sample groups the aim of these methods is to discover predefined metabolic_pathways or biological_networks that are co ordinately altered in the experiment such changes are often assessed by employing the gene_set gsea procedure to test whether the elements of some predefined biological group are enriched towards the top or bottom of a ranked_list here we describe the metabolite pathway_enrichment mpea for the visualization and functional analysis of metabolite data at the system level mpea tests whether metabolites in predefined pathways occur towards the top or bottom of a ranked to whom correspondence should be addressed list it can be applied either to pre annotated compounds or gas_chromatography coupled_with gc_ms data consisting of mass_spectral tags msts if msts are provided they are characterized using gmd this feature was included to facilitate the analysis of data generated by gcmsa popular analytical tool for metabolite_profiling furthermore as it is unlikely that all query compounds are unambiguously resolved mpea has been developed to handle ambiguously identified compounds we tested mpea on a study in which adipose_tissue transcriptome and metabolome were studied in twin_pairs body_weight mpea revealed more significantly altered pathways in acquired obesity based on metabolite data than the competing method did and its results corresponded with the pathways that gsea found from transcriptomics_data
