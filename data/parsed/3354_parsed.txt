openbis eln lims an open_source database for academic laboratories the open_source platform openbis open biology information system offers an electronic laboratory notebook and a laboratory_information eln lims solution suitable for the academic life_science laboratories openbis eln lims allows researchers to efficiently document their work to describe materials and methods and to collect raw and analyzed data the system comes with a_user where data can be added edited browsed and searched availability_and the openbis software a user guide and a demo instance are available at https openbis eln lims ethz ch the demo instance contains some data from our laboratory as an example to demonstrate the possibilities of the eln lims ottoz et_al for rapid local testing a virtualbox image of the eln lims is also available scientific recording is an essential part of research as progress in science depends among other factors on existing knowledge and reproducibility recording is the process by which the scientific question the choice of an experimental_procedure materials and methods data analysis and interpretation of the results are gathered traditionally all these details were kept in paper notebooks in todays academic life_science laboratories most raw_data analyzed data and scripts are stored electronically while the experimental details are often recorded in paper notebooks this makes linking and retrieving experimental details and results problematic moreover the large amount of data produced by todays readout machines adds a level of complexity as the devices the data are stored on might soon be outdated databases represent a solution to store all the necessary information together because i they ensure long_lasting data storage by being independent of the operating environment ii they are installed on a dedicated server enabling long_term data storage and regular backups iii they allow storage of large_amounts of data iv they are easily_accessible via a local_area network or the internet v custom applications can be easily added several commercial database solutions for elns are available but they are not commonly adopted by academia an internal evaluation among the research groups of the departments of biosystems science and engineering and biology of eth zurich found that the options affordable to academic labs had either unsuitable user_interfaces ui or lack of features the combination of an easy to use ui flexible adaptation to a labs needs support of an audit trail physical support of the data server support for managing large_amounts of data and for integrating new measurement devices was only available at very high_costs on the other hand the available open_source platforms lack many of the above features and as they often originate from a v c the author published_by
