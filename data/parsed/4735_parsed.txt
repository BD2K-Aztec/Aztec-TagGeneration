treegl reverse_engineering tree evolving gene_networks underlying developing biological lineages motivation estimating gene_regulatory over biological lineages is central to a deeper_understanding of how cells evolve during development and differentiation however one challenge in estimating such evolving networks is that their host_cells not only contiguously evolve but also branch over time for example a stem_cell evolves into two more specialized daughter_cells at each division forming a tree of networks another example is in a laboratory setting a biologist may apply several different drugs individually to malignant cancer_cells to analyze the effects of each drug on the cells the cells treated by one drug may not be intrinsically similar to those treated by another but rather to the malignant cancer_cells they were derived from results we propose a novel algorithm treegl an plus total_variation penalized linear regression_method to effectively estimate multiple gene_networks corresponding to cell_types related by a tree genealogy based on only a few samples from each cell_type treegl takes_advantage of the similarity between related networks along the biological lineage while at the same time exposing sharp differences between the networks we demonstrate that our algorithm performs significantly better than existing_methods via simulation furthermore we explore an application to a breast_cancer dataset and show that our algorithm is able to produce biologically valid results that provide insight into the progression and reversion of breast cancer_cells availability software will be available ata major_challenge in systems_biology is to quantitatively understand and model the topological and functional properties of cellular_networks such as the transcriptional_regulatory circuitries and signal_transduction that control cell_behavior in complex biological_processes in complex organisms biological_processes such as differentiation and development are often controlled by a large number of molecules that exchange information in a spatialtemporally specific and context dependent_manner these cellular to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as networks are inevitably changing to take on different functions and reacting to changing environments this necessitates studying different networks for each condition such as each different developmental_stage tissue subtype and cell_lineage most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular_networks based on high_throughput data ignore the intricate dependencies between networks of closely_related biological subjects for example when studying cancer development it is common to infer gene_networks based on microarray_data from different cancer specimens or cell_lines separately and independently despite that these biomaterials are usually collected over a contiguous disease_progression course as we discuss in detail such an isolationist strategy can compromise both the statistical_power and biological_insight of the inferred networks in this article we present a new methodology called treegl which adopts a statistically more powerful and biologically more natural connectionist principle treegl reconstructs gene_networks in related biological subjects via an inter dependent approach such that the inferred networks directly embody and exploit the relationships of the biological subjects they represent as a result this reveals deeper insight on how the structure function and behavior of such networks evolve during evolution differentiation and environmental perturbation to better understand our rationale take the analysis of stem_cell as an example it is well known that all organ and tissue_specific cells in a multicellular_organism are differentiated from a stem_cell following a well known genealogy to date gene_networks from many of these organs and tissues have been derived using a variety of computational or experimental_technologies however knowledge about the cell_lineage has rarely been utilized in constructing these networks for example according to the genealogy in the platelets are more closely_related to the red_blood than to the lymphoblasts the gene_networks present in the platelets and red_blood are thus expected to be more similar microarray_data from red_blood should reflect the topology of a platelets network to a greater extent than that of a lymphoblast network is it therefore legitimate and possible to use the red_blood microarray in addition to the platelets microarray to infer the platelets network and if yes how essentially what one needs to handle is a network of networks in this article we focus on the class of tree shaped biological genealogies this class of genealogies can be naturally found in crop and animal breeding species evolution cell_line lineage construction and carcinogenesis a tree evolving network in the blood stem_cell genealogy http www siteman wustl edu cancerdetails aspx id xml cdr xml at the root is the blood stem_cell over time it differentiates into more specialized cells along the genealogy eventually becoming red_blood platelets or white_blood cell_types closer together in the genealogy e g lymphoblasts and white_blood are expected to have more similar gene_regulatory than those far apart in the genealogy e g red_blood and white_blood
