a generalized model for multi marker analysis of cell_cycle in synchrony experiments motivation to advance understanding of eukaryotic cell_division it is important to observe the process precisely to this end researchers monitor changes in dividing_cells as they traverse the cell_cycle with the presence_or of morphological or genetic_markers indicating a cells position in a particular interval of the cell_cycle a wide_variety of marker data is available including information rich cellular_imaging data however few formal statistical_methods have been developed to use these valuable data_sources in estimating how a population of cells progresses through the cell_cycle furthermore existing_methods are designed to handle only a single binary marker of cell_cycle at a time consequently they cannot facilitate comparison of experiments involving different sets of markers results here we develop a new sampling model to accommodate an arbitrary number of different binary markers that characterize the progression of a population of dividing_cells along a branching process we engineer a strain of saccharomyces_cerevisiae with fluorescently_labeled markers of cell_cycle and apply our new model to two image datasets we collected from the strain as well as an independent dataset of different markers we use our model to estimate the duration of post cytokinetic attachment between a s cerevisiae mother and daughter_cell the java implementation is fast and extensible and includes a graphical_user our model provides a powerful and flexible cell_cycle tool suitable to any type or combination of binary markers cell_division is a process fundamental to the growth development and reproduction of every living organism in the case of the budding_yeast saccharomyces_cerevisiae cell_division entails a complex and highly_regulated series of morphological and genetic changes to better understand these changesand thereby the nature of budding_yeast cell_cycle progressionresearchers track the status of certain cellular features that mark progress through the cell_division one way to monitor cell_cycle is with populations of dividing_cells such approaches entail synchronizing a population of cells in culture at some discrete cell_cycle releasing the to whom correspondence should be addressed population into the cell_division and collecting independent samples from the culture after release under such an approach marker status for a sample of cells can then be quantified at each time point fluorescent_microscope images provide a rich source of marker data and have become increasingly common microscope images provide the means to track large_numbers of cellular features fluorescence_images for example can reveal the localization and status of organelles protein_complexes and single proteins in a cell_cycle context microscope images permit the visualization and quantitation of multiple cell_cycle regulated markers offering a more detailed view of the relationships and dependencies between subprocesses of cell_division however few methods currently exist to extract from these image data reliable estimates of cell_cycle event timing or of cell_cycle dynamics in the population furthermore the types and combinations of markersimagederived or otherwisecan vary across studies in the case of budding_yeast many groups look for the presence of a bud the precursor of the soon to be formed daughter_cell however additional marker data can run the gamut from flow_cytometric measurements of dna_content to the aforementioned features derived from microscopy_images this lack of consensus in the markers under observation complicates the comparison of cell_cycle analyses across studies thus new general methods are required to jointly_model marker data especially when the type or combination of markers changes from one study to another we present a powerful general model of cell_cycle in a population of cells estimated from any number or combination of binary valued markers we build on a branching process framework called cloccs characterizing loss of cell_cycle synchrony previously_developed in our lab for the purpose of describing populations undergoing cell_division however in this article we develop a completely new sampling model that is suited to estimating parameters from any experiment involving some combination of binary markers of progression in addition our sampling model is designed to address subtle aspects of observed data that crop up in real experiments for instance some small but non negligible number of cells may be dead or halted during the experiment and thus not progressing through the cell_cycle like the other cells our sampling model is capable of estimating the number of such cells we demonstrate the utility of our new sampling model on two datasets of differential_interference dic and fluorescenceusing a multimodal_imaging platform we collected dic and fluorescence microscopy_images of four markers of budding_yeast cell_cycle namely myosin rings buds short mitotic spindles and long mitotic spindles we used the dic images to measure budding and the fluorescence_images to detect the other markers see section we processed the images visually counting cells with each marker across all fields of view at each time point we compiled two such image datasets on populations of budding yeast_cells synchronized either by treatment with the mating pheromone factor or by centrifugal_elutriation in the former method of synchronization cells arrest at the point of cell_cycle entry in late g known as start centrifugal_elutriation on the other hand selects cells based on their size isolating the smallest cells one obvious extension of the model framework would be to obtain a joint measurement of the marker status of each cell rather than independently assaying the presence of each marker as we are now knowing the joint marker status of each cell would permit the modeling of markers as a multivariate binomial random variable and thus allow us to assess correlations between the presence of different markers which might be particularly important when i shown are fits with the factor treated cells using a model not accounting either for cells with visible markers during synchronization recovery or for dead cells shown in b and c are fits with a model accounting only for dead cells or for early cells respectively the model fits in d accounted for both early and dead cells
