structural_bioinformatics pairwise rna_secondary alignment with conserved stem pattern motivation the regulatory_functions performed by non_coding are related to their d structures which are in turn determined by their secondary_structures pairwise secondary_structure alignment gives insight into the functional_similarity between a pair of rna_sequences numerous exact or heuristic approaches have been proposed for computational alignment however the alignment becomes intractable when arbitrary pseudoknots are allowed also since non_coding are in general more conserved in structures than sequences it is more effective to perform alignment based on the common structural_motifs discovered results we devised a method to approximate the true conserved stem pattern for a secondary_structure pair and constructed the alignment from it experimental_results suggest that our method identified similar rna_secondary better than the existing_tools especially for large structures it also successfully indicated the conservation of some pseudoknot features with biological_significance more importantly even for large structures with arbitrary pseudoknots the alignment can usually be obtained efficiently availability_and our algorithm has been implemented in a tool called psmalign the source_code of psmalign is freely_available atthe interest in rna research was reinvigorated after discovering its regulatory and catalytic roles in many biological_processes those rnas with such roles are called the noncoding_rnas ncrnas they perform a diverse range of functions such as regulating gene_expression modifying ribosomal_rna and controlling muscle_differentiation it is believed that a specific function of an ncrna molecule is related to its structure strong evidence is that ncrnas are more evolutionarily_conserved in their structures than their sequences therefore the two main studies in this area are the structure_determination and the comparison among different structures the former can be subdivided into experimental analysis and computational_prediction using experimentally_determined thermodynamics parameters on the other hand structure comparison is purely computational moreover since the structure is critical to the function rna_molecules are compared with both structures and constituent base sequences in this article we are interested in the pairwise rna_secondary comparison problem this problem can be further classified into the edit problem and the alignment problem the edit problem computes the minimum cost distance of modifying a given structure r to another given structure r that the total edition cost from r and r to r c is minimized early approaches model the rna_secondary as trees and consider the edit_distance or similarity_score among them afterwards various tools were developed of which some produce optimal solutions while the others are heuristics rna align rnaforester and gardenia are some examples that belong to the exact solution category the average time complexity for the last two methods is o n where n is the length of the longer structure and the worst_case complexity is o n migal and rnastrat belong to the heuristics category there are still two shortcomings impacting the usefulness and efficiency of these approaches firstly most of them do not support pseudoknots since aligning structures with arbitrary pseudoknots is np_hard but pseudoknots have already been known to perform diverse functions in many biological_processes significant comparison results could be obtained when such crossing motifs can be aligned because they are usually highly_conserved an approach allowing arbitrary pseudoknots for exact alignment has its time complexity dependent on the complexity of the input structures on the other hand the polynomial time alignment algorithm is possible for a restricted set of pseudoknots however both of them are still inadequate to compare the complex crossing motifs that have already been identified more importantly none of them are available as a tool second since ncrnas often exhibit better conservation in their structures exact alignment_methods might not indicate some biologically_significant structural_features this is because they consider both base sequences and structures equally and hence some conserved structural_motifs that are dissimilar in their sequences are difficult to align conversely some motifs are spuriously aligned disrupting the overall alignment to overcome_these we devised a heuristics targeting the pairwise_alignment of large rna_secondary with arbitrary pseudoknots we have demonstrated the ability of the conserved stem pattern in performing pairwise_alignment between rna_secondary it serves as a heuristics to align structures with relatively higher accuracy it enables biologists to perform computational structure alignment that could not be done previously such as aligning those consisting of arbitrary pseudoknots sample alignments revealed some highly_conserved structural_features which can be further investigated for a better understanding of their biological_significance conflict of interest none declared
