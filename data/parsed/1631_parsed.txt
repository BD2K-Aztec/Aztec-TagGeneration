genetics_and estimating population_diversity with catchall motivation the massive data produced by next_generation require advanced statistical_tools we address estimating the total diversity or species_richness in a population to date only relatively simple methods have been implemented in available software there is a need for software employing modern computationally_intensive statistical_analyses including error goodness_of and robustness assessments results we present catchall a fast easy to use platform independent program that computes maximum_likelihood for finite mixture_models weighted linear regression_based analyses and coverage based non parametric methods along with outlier diagnostics given sample frequency count_data catchall computes different diversity estimates and applies a model selection_algorithm catchall also derives discounted diversity estimates to adjust for possibly uncertain low_frequency counts it is accompanied by an excel based graphics program availability free executable downloads for linux windows and mac os with manual and source_code at www northeastern edu catchall the field of microbial_ecology is bursting with data from nextgeneration_sequencing but analysis remains a challenge estimating the diversity of a microbial_community is especially important to model this statistically assume that the population can be divided_into a finite number of classes the simplest definition of diversity is the number of classes c a sample drawn from such a population will typically have repeated observations of the various classes some may be observed once only others twice and so on while many classes may not appear in the sample at all the frequency count_data is i f i i where f i is the number of sample classes of size i for example the dataset has singletons four doubletons and one class occurring seven times in the sample for bacterial and phage diversity the counts are derived from the frequencies of s rrna_genes and contig spectra to whom correspondence should be addressed statistical estimation of diversity from frequency count_data goes back to but so_far only coverage based non parametric methods have been implemented in widely available software because they do not require numerical optimization we improve upon previous methods by i implementing parametric finite mixture_models and a new weighted linear regression_approach in addition to existing non parametric methods ii providing a way to statistically discount large_numbers of potentially artifactual rare_species and iii applying our analyses to highly_diverse phage metagenomes
