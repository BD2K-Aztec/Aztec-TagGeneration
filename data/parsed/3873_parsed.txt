rapid and powerful detection of subtle allelic_imbalance from exome_sequencing with haplohseq motivation the detection of subtle genomic allelic_imbalance events has many potential applications for example identifying cancer associated allelic imbalanced regions in low tumor cellularity samples or in low proportion tumor subclones can be used for early_cancer prognostic_assessment and therapeutic selection in cancer patients we developed haplohseq for the detection of subtle allelic_imbalance events from next_generation data results our method identified events of megabases or greater occurring in as little as of the sample in exome_sequencing at and in whole_genome sequencing_data at far exceeding the capabilities of existing software we also found haplohseq to be superior at detecting large chromosomal changes across a series of pancreatic samples from tcga availability_and haplohseq is available at scheet org software distributed under an open_source mita critical mechanism by which cancer_cells operate is through activation of oncogenes or inactivation_of this may happen via acquired chromosomal alterations such as amplification deletion or copy_neutral cn loh that result in allelic_imbalance ai because ai provides insights into the progression towards malignancy and metastasis ai detection can be applied to help in cancer_prognosis and therapeutic_decision in the last decade array_comparative acgh and single_nucleotide snp_array based_approaches have become popular technologies for ai detection more recently the advent_of ngs_technologies for studies of cancer genomic_variation has brought the potential for finer resolution detection and boundary refinement due to a denser marker set and arbitrarily high coverage however costs limit depth of coverage through whole_genome wgs and therefore whole_exome wes is often preferred for genomic studies wes presents a particular challenge for inferring ai since coverage is variable across regions and the target is limited to of the genome several tools model expected coverage based on summaries from a wes reference_panel to account for technical variability in v c the author published_by
