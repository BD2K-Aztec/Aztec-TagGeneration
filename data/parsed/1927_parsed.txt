genetics_and gapit genome association and prediction integrated tool software programs that conduct genome_wide and genomic prediction and selection need to use methodol ogies that maximize statistical_power provide high_prediction and run in a computationally_efficient manner we developed an r package called genome association and prediction integrated tool gapit that implements advanced statistical_methods including the compressed mixed_linear cmlm and cmlm based genomic prediction and selection the gapit package can handle large_data in excess of individuals and million single_nucleotide with minimal computational time while providing user_friendly access and concise tables and graphs to interpret results advances in high_throughput single_nucleotide snp_genotyping are enabling powerful genome_wide gwas thereby enhancing the ability to identify causal_mutations that underlie human_diseases and agriculturally_important traits the resulting snps are also valuable for genomic prediction and selection gs which provides criteria for disease risk management in humans and expedited selection in animal and plant breeding before the full potential of gwas and gs are realized inflated false_positive extensive computational requirements and suboptimal prediction_accuracies need to be addressed newly_developed gwas statistical_methods based on the mixed_linear mlm hold_great to overcome these challenges they are flexible because they incorporate fixed and random_effects to address the spurious_associations that arise from population_structure covariates from either structure or principal_components pcs can be included as fixed_effects the cryptic relationships between individuals are accounted for through a kinship matrix in the unified mlm the more computationally_efficient and powerful compressed mlm cmlm uses a group kinship matrix calculated from clustered individuals because the typical number of genotypic data_points is exceeding hundreds of millions solving mlms using the traditional restricted_maximum approach is computationally_intensive therefore the efficient mixed model association emma algorithm was developed to reduce this computational_burden by reparameterizing the mlm likelihood functions emma expedited emmax and population parameters previously determined p d were independently developed to further reduce computing time by eliminating the need to re estimate variance components at each marker most gs methods make predictions with the sum of the effects from all available snps or genomic best linear unbiased prediction gblup based on a kinship matrix derived from these snps the former approach offers higher prediction_accuracies for simpler traits while the latter approach is more accurate for complex_traits our work implements an improved gblup method that increases accuracy especially for simple traits most software_packages were developed for a particular gwas or gs approach for example packages were written exclusively for the emma and emmax algorithms other software such as the trait analysis by association evolution and linkage tassel and plink make multiple gwas approaches available in one package we continue these software_development efforts by creating genome association and prediction integrated tool gapit which integrates the most powerful accurate and computationally_efficient gwas and gs methods into a single r package
