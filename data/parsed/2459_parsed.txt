genome_analysis inferring nucleosome_positions with their histone mark annotation from chip data motivation the nucleosome is the basic repeating_unit of chromatin it contains two copies each of the four core_histones h a h b h and h and about bp of dna the residues of the histone_proteins are subject to numerous post_translational such as methylation or acetylation chromatin immunoprecipitiation followed by sequencing chip_seq is a technique that provides genome_wide occupancy data of these modified histone_proteins and it requires appropriate computational_methods results we present nuchunter an algorithm that uses the data from chip_seq directed against many histone_modifications to infer positioned nucleosomes nuchunter annotates each of these nucleosomes with the intensities of the histone_modifications we demonstrate that these annotations can be used to infer nucleosomal states with distinct correlations to underlying genomic_features and chromatin related processes such as transcriptional_start enhancers elongation by rna_polymerase and chromatin mediated_repression thus nuchunter is a versatile_tool that can be used to predict positioned nucleosomes from a panel of histone_modification chip_seq and infer distinct histone_modification patterns associated to different chromatin_states availability the software is available atthe genome of eukaryotes is packaged into a macromolecular structure called chromatin the basic repeating_unit of chromatin is the nucleosome which contains two copies each of the four core_histones h a h b h and h around which a bp stretch of dna is wrapped in a flat left_handed superhelix nucleosomes form approximately every bp along the genome to package the underlying dna apart from the packaging function nucleosomes may serve as a signaling module that is integrated into biological_processes acting with and on chromatin this signaling function depends on post_translational of the histone_proteins such as acetylation and methylation of lysine_residues these histone_modifications may serve as a binding platform for non histone_proteins whose activities change chromatin_structure and function when nucleosomes tend to form at the same or nearby genomic positions in different cells they are called well positioned positioned nucleosomes are important for the hypothesis that nucleosomes constitute a signaling module because gross movements of modified nucleosomes along the chromatin fibers may lead to a loss of coherence between the modifications and the genomic_features and or functions the binding locations of modified histone_proteins can be determined by a technique called chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq the immunoprecipitation step enriches for chromatin fragments containing a histone_modification of interest whereas the sequencing step is used to quantify the abundance of the underlying dna because the core histone_proteins are part of a stable protein_dna it is natural to assume that the localization of modified histone_proteins corresponds to the position of the nucleosomes this suggests that histone_modification chip_seq can be used to infer nucleosome_positions however this is far from being a trivial task for a number of reasons i histone binding does not seem to be as sequence specific as for many transcription_factors ii nucleosome_positions can change considerably with time and across cells and iii the data are affected by sparse sampling and high noise nucleosome calling algorithms such as the one presented here aim at detecting positioned nucleosomes to obtain a comprehensive and reliable set of predictions one should combine the information contained in as many chip_seq as possible and allow for some plasticity in the shape of the signal however modified histones tend to be mixed source factors which means that the degree of positioning can vary_considerably across the genome in regions where nucleosomes occupy different positions in different cells e g within the body of actively_transcribed nucleosome calling algorithms are less suitable than segmentation approaches song and smith which aim at detecting domains of high nucleosome abundance a number of tools for the inference of nucleosome_positions have already been developed most of them apply signal_processing such as fourier_transforms wavelet_decomposition and ad_hoc filters to smooth the enrichment profile followed by the detection of local maxima others are based on bayesian modeling of the nucleosome to whom correspondence should be addressed the

provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com enrichment pattern these methods do not allow one to control for systematic_biases by comparing the nucleosome calls with data from control experiments furthermore they cannot integrate data from multiple histone_marks in a straightforward manner finally because of the large size of the problem e g the human_genome and the potentially high number of histone_modifications the runtime and memory_consumption of these tools may limit their applicability our tool can use information from a control sample to correct for systematic_biases inherent in this high_throughput technology it is designed to integrate_multiple histone_marks to broaden the range of nucleosome_positions that can be detected it annotates each identified nucleosome with the contributing histone_modifications we will demonstrate that these annotations can be used to cluster nucleosomes by their histone_modification patterns this clustering yields patterns of modifications that can be correlated to the function of the chromatin such as transcriptional_start and enhancers or to the underlying process such as transcriptional elongation by rna_polymerase these results support the assumption that nucleosomes serve as signal modules for biological_process and that the corresponding histone_modification patterns are a reflection of the signaling taking_place on these modules the fast paced development of chromatin immunoprecipitationbased techniques is heading toward an increased spatial_resolution for dnaprotein interactions in line with this trend we developed nuchunter a software for base_pair resolution nucleosome identification in chip_seq the innovative aspects of this tool reside in a more accurate and efficient signal_processing an improved statistical_analysis of the peaks the possibility of integrating data from a control sample and to consider multiple histone_modifications at once we put forward a nucleosome centric view because if we view the modifications either sequentially or in a combinatorial pattern as a reflection of a signaling activity then nucleosomes can be viewed as signaling modules in agreement with this idea we found that nucleosomes can be clustered into distinct subgroups these subgroups either mark certain functional_regions of the genome such as promoters and enhancers or are related to biological_processes such as elongation or chromatin mediated_repression although this is not a new finding see ernst and we think that our approach has the benefit of assigning the data to a physical entity that carries the information the nucleosome thus separation of different histone_modification patterns into distinct subgroups becomes much more meaningful than by arbitrarily binning the genome into non overlapping windows where two nucleosomes with different modification patterns could be present in summary we developed a new tool called nuchunter that is able to identify positioned nucleosomes along the genome using chip_seq of histone_modifications and annotates each nucleosome with i a flag indicating presence_or of a certain histone_modification and ii the number of contributing reads if one is interested in a more quantitative view we demonstrated that nuchunter performs better than currently available tools and has some features not present in any of them by focusing on the nucleosome as information carrier charting the epigenome will become much more meaningful and will in the long_run allow for unraveling novel chromatin mediated mechanisms
