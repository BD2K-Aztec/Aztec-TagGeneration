asbench benchmarking sets for allosteric discovery allostery allows for the fine_tuning of protein_function targeting allosteric_sites is gaining increasing_recognition as a novel strategy in drug_design the key challenge in the discovery of allosteric_sites has strongly motivated the development of computational_methods and thus high_quality publicly_accessible standard data have become indispensable here we report benchmarking_data for experimentally_determined allosteric_sites through a complex process including a core_set with unique allosteric_sites and a core diversity set with structurally_diverse allosteric_sites these benchmarking sets can be exploited to develop efficient computational_methods to predict unknown allosteric_sites in proteins and reveal unique allosteric ligandprotein interactions to guide allosteric drug_design availability_and the benchmarking sets are freely_available allostery is a major regulatory_mechanism that is of fundamental_importance in a wide_variety of biological_phenomena the propagation of allosteric signals from allosteric_sites induced by effectors binding to different often distant functional sites allows for exquisite control of protein functional activity the structural_diversity of allosteric_sites endows allosteric effectors with the benefits of higher_selectivity and lower toxicity targeting allosteric_sites as a novel tactic in drug_design has therefore prompted intense interest in the development of allosteric drugs despite the enticing advantages of allosteric_regulation modern allosteric drug_discovery faces considerable challenges in particular the vast_majority of allosteric_sites in proteins are as yet undiscovered as a result of the difficulty in identifying such sites experimentally this difficulty has led to a paucity of structural and mechanistic_insights into the characterization of allosteric_sites and it has also impeded computational development for the identification of allosteric_sites to address_this we recently constructed the allosteric database asd which is a collection of experimentally_determined allosteric proteins and modulators to provide a platform for the application and discovery of allosteric_sites nevertheless the collection of raw allosteric_sites suffers from redundancy and the inclusion of low quality sites it is therefore imperative to offer a more stringent set of allosteric_sites for the development of viable computational_approaches for allosteric site prediction and to reveal the unique characteristics of allosteric ligandprotein interactions for drug_design to this end two benchmarking sets of allosteric_sites were compiled through a complex process designated as a core_set and a core diversity set the former totally contains unique allosteric site and the latter encompasses structurally_diverse allosteric_sites these high_quality benchmarking sets can be and they contain representative specific allosteric ligandprotein interactions that can guide structure based allosteric drug_discovery the benchmarking sets in asbench provide the high_quality data of allosteric_sites for the development of efficient computational_methods on the prediction of unknown allosteric_sites and the exploration of unique allosteric ligandprotein interactions it is thus expected to provide valuable avenues for allosteric drug_discovery
