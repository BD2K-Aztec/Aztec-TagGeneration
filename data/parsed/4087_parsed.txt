rtcr a pipeline for complete and accurate recovery of t cell repertoires from high_throughput high_throughput hts has enabled researchers to probe the human t cell receptor tcr repertoire which consists of many rare sequences distinguishing between true but rare tcr sequences and variants generated by polymerase_chain pcr and sequenc ing errors remains a formidable challenge the conventional approach to handle errors is to remove low quality reads and or rare tcr sequences such filtering discards a large number of true and often rare tcr sequences however accurate identification and quantification of rare tcr sequences is essential for repertoire diversity estimation results we devised a pipeline called recover tcr rtcr that accurately recovers tcr sequences including rare tcr sequences from hts_data including barcoded data even at low coverage rtcr employs a data_driven statistical_model to rectify pcr and sequencing_errors in an adaptive manner using simulations we demonstrate that rtcr can easily adapt to the error profiles of different types of sequencers and exhibits consistently_high recall and high_precision even at low coverages where other pipelines perform poorly using published real_data we show that rtcr accurately resolves sequencing_errors and outperforms all other pipelines availability_and the rtcr pipeline is implemented in python v and c and is freely_available uubram github io rtcr along with documentation and examples of typical usage t cells are crucial to the adaptive_immune enabling it to recognize almost any pathogen that infects the host while remaining tolerant to many self antigens the recognition of antigens by t cells is mediated by the t cell receptor tcr through random genetic_recombination the immune system can potentially equip every t cell with a different tcr allowing it to bind different antigens than other t cells the different t cells together form a t cell repertoire which due to its pivotal_role in the immune_response is studied extensively in areas such as infectious_diseases cancer autoimmunity and ageing classical tcrs are heterodimers consisting of ab protein_chains the genes_encoding the a and b chains are generated via somatic stochastic dna rearrangements in which germline variable v diversity d and joining j gene_segments recombine random deletions and non templated nucleotide insertions occur at the v d j junctions which together with the random_selection of gene_segments is responsible for generating a full repertoire of tcrs theoretically different tcr b chains are possible which together with the tcra chains can result in more than distinct tcrs because humans have t cells every individual harbors at most only a small but diverse fraction of this potential repertoire high_throughput hts is often used to probe the tcr repertoire analysing the repertoire is challenging because of its high_diversity and many rare clonotypes pushing the boundaries of sequencing_technologies some of the important confounding_factors in quantification and identification of the repertoire are short read_length e g bp reads whereas the vdj region of the tcr is bp unequal polymerase_chain pcr_amplification sequencing_errors and sampling_biases despite the improvements in sequencing_technologies quantification of true tcr repertoire diversity remains_elusive because the repertoire is heavily undersampled and sequencing_errors artificially skew the repertoire to analyse hts_data from tcr repertoires multiple pipelines have been developed some of these are imgt which provides a web_interface and detailed annotations issake which assembles immune_receptors from very short_reads irmap designed for sequencing_data decombinator designed for fast annotation mitcr mixcr and imseq focusing on error_correction presto vander and migec handling reads with unique_molecular identifiers barcoded data and tcrklass annotating all reads including those that lack the complementarity_determining cdr of the tcr most of these pipelines filter out low quality reads and or remove rare tcr sequences since most unique tcr sequences are rare such filtering can cause a massive loss of true tcr sequences we developed a pipeline called recover tcr rtcr that attempts to accurately recover tcr sequences at varying coverage including rare tcr sequences while maintaining high_precision and high recall accurate quantification of tcr repertoires is especially important in clinical_settings where low coverage tcr sequencing can be used for cost_effectiveness there are multiple_ways to identify sequence errors in hts_data some of these are i base_quality i e a low quality base is more likely to be false than a high_quality base and ii similarity i e true tcr sequences tend to be surrounded by similar erroneous variants due to pcr and sequencing_errors in rtcr these strategies are translated into a simple binomial model together with several heuristics to rationally eliminate pcr and sequencing_errors rtcr automatically sets its parameters based on the data relieving the user from setting arbitrary parameters rtcr supports barcoded hts_data combining barcode based error_correction with its regular error_correction to measure the performance of rtcr we compared it to tcrklass mitcr mixcr imseq and migec using simulated and real hts datasets we demonstrate that rtcr can easily adapt to error profiles of different types of sequencers and exhibits consistently_high recall and high_precision even at low coverage we benchmark different pipelines using several synthetic tcr hts datasets generated via realistic pcr and sequencing simulations we find that rtcr outperforms all other pipelines on recall and matches the high_precision of mitcr mixcr and imseq using real_data we then show that rtcr can accurately resolve apparent sequencing_errors which are incompletely resolved by other pipelines tcrs exhibit enormous diversity due to somatic recombination the advent of hts has enabled us to sequence large number of tcr sequences from an individual however hts is marred by errors and given the tcr diversity it becomes difficult to distinguish between true tcr sequence and erroneous variants we here present rtcr a pipeline designed to accurately recover tcr sequences from errorprone hts_data rtcr performs error_correction using a statistical_model and estimates the model_parameters from the data relieving the user from setting arbitrary parameters using simulations and experimental_data we demonstrate that rtcr can identify and correct pcr and sequencing_errors exhibiting consistently high_precision and recall the high_accuracy of rtcr makes it well suited for estimation of repertoire diversity and for disease profiling especially in the lower coverage and simulated_datasets rtcr outperformed all other pipelines this means that rtcr has the potential to make the analysis of repertoire sequencing_data more
