sequence_analysis cpppred prediction of cell_penetrating cell_penetrating cpps are attracting much attention as a means of overcoming the inherently poor cellular_uptake of various bioactive_molecules here we introduce cpppred a web_server for the prediction of cpps using a n to neural_network the server takes one or more peptide_sequences between and amino_acids in length as input and returns a prediction of how likely each peptide is to be cell penetrating cpppred was developed with redundancy reduced training and test_sets offering an advantage over the only other currently available cpp prediction method availability_and cpppred is freely_available to non commercial users atcell penetrating peptides cpps demonstrate the ability to pass through cellular_membranes accordingly cpps are emerging as potential tools for aiding the transport of therapeutic_molecules that are not inherently bioavailable and moreover as possible bioactive agents in their own right although a number of broad classification_systems for cpps have been proposed in general cpps are typified by a length of amino_acids an enrichment in basic_residues therefore a net_positive and are hydrophobic in part several in silico cpp prediction_algorithms have been developed to facilitate high_throughput of peptides initially methods focused on the use of scales of chemical_properties known as z descriptors for the prediction of cpps other approaches applied to cpp prediction include quantitative structureactivity relationship models and support_vector although only one of these methods cellppd is publicly_available here we present cpppred a cpp prediction method that uses a neural_network nn approach although others have previously applied nn techniques to the prediction of cpps cpppred represents the only publicly_available nn based method
