batchqc interactive software for evaluating sample and batch_effects in genomic_data sequencing and microarray samples often are collected or processed in multiple batches or at different times this often produces technical biases that can lead to incorrect results in the downstream_analysis there are several existing batch adjustment tools for omics_data but they do not indicate a priori whether adjustment needs to be conducted or how correction should be applied we present a software pipeline batchqc which addresses these issues using interactive_visualizations and statistics that evaluate the impact of batch_effects in a genomic dataset batchqc can also apply existing adjustment tools and allow users to evaluate their benefits interactively we used the batchqc pipeline on both simulated_and to demonstrate the effectiveness of this software toolkit non biological_variation including batch_effects is commonly present across multiple batches of omics_data of the same type e g microarray rna_seq dna_methylation proteomics and can be caused by technical_factors such as differences in profiling platform lab protocol experimenter processing procedures or reagent batch these data can be affected by technical variation attributable to both observed and unobserved factors batch_effects can act as a confounder and produce technical biases that lead to incorrect downstream_analyses akey j
