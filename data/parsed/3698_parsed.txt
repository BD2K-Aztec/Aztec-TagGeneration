principal network_analysis identification of subnetworks representing major dynamics using gene_expression data motivation systems_biology attempts to describe complex systems behaviors in terms of dynamic operations of biological_networks however there is lack of tools that can effectively decode complex network_dynamics over multiple conditions results we present principal network_analysis pna that can automatically capture major dynamic activation patterns over multiple conditions and then generate protein and metabolic subnetworks for the captured patterns we first demonstrated the utility of this method by applying it to a synthetic dataset the results showed that pna correctly captured the subnetworks representing dynamics in the data we further applied pna to two time course gene_expression collected from i mcf_cells after treatments of hrg at multiple_doses and ii brain samples of four strains of mice infected with two prion strains the resulting subnetworks and their interactions revealed network_dynamics associated with hrg dose_dependent regulation of cell_proliferation and early prp sc accumulation during prion_infection availability the web_based software is available at systems_biology attempts to describe systems behaviors in terms of dynamic operations of biological_networks a number of gene_expression studies have been performed to understand network_dynamics over multiple conditions however it is challenging to decode network_dynamics from the multi conditional gene_expression data due to i diverse activation patterns of nodes over multiple conditions ii dense interactions edges among the nodes and iii the large size of the global network to whom correspondence should be addressed to understand complex network_dynamics it is common in systems approaches to extract major subnetworks the common tasks for generation of such subnetworks include i identification_of degs between various conditions ii clustering of the degs based on their differential expression_patterns and iii reconstruction of subnetworks using the genes belonging to major clusters and their interaction_partners from the global interactome however as the numbers of both time points and conditions increase the generation of major subnetworks using this approach often becomes intractable due to the complexity in the above tasks there have been several methods for automatically generating active subnetworks ass that are composed of i active nodes showing significant changes over conditions node based_methods or ii active edges having the interacting nodes whose gene_expression levels were co varied over conditions edge based_methods most of node based_methods generate ass by identifying subnetworks including mainly the active nodes but they do not consider the correlation between activation patterns of the interacting nodes an edge based method results in a subnetwork composed of the active edges for which the interacting nodes are co varied in their gene_expression levels however both node and edge based_methods generate the subnetworks with a mixture of different activation patterns which makes it inefficient to sort out complex network_dynamics in terms of the resulting subnetworks we propose a new concept of principal subnetwork for analyzing complex network_dynamics we define a principal subnetwork ps by an as including both nodes and edges that share a particular major or principal activation pattern several pss showing a number of major activation patterns can be generated from a single dataset thus analyzing the individual pss and their interactions can allow us to efficiently sort out complex network_dynamics in this study we developed principal network_analysis pna that can automatically i capture principal activation patterns over multiple conditions and ii generate the corresponding protein and metabolic subnetworks pss to the captured patterns based on the orthogonal non_negative onmf we demonstrated the utility of pna by applying it to three datasets the results showed that the collective analysis of pss and their interactions can effectively generate network driven hypotheses for given problems page
