data_and retrieval of enterobacteriaceae drug_targets using singular_value motivation the identification of potential drug target_proteins in bacteria is important in pharmaceutical_research for the development of new antibiotics to combat bacterial agents that cause diseases results a new model that combines the singular_value svd technique with biological filters composed of a set of protein properties associated with bacterial drug_targets and similarity to protein_coding essential genes of escherichia_coli strain k has been created to predict potential antibiotic drug_targets in the enterobacteriaceae family this model identified potential drug target_proteins in the studied family which exhibit eight different functions and are protein_coding essential genes or similar to protein_coding essential genes of e coli strain k indicating that the disruption of the activities of these proteins is critical for cells proteins from bacteria with described drug_resistance were found among the retrieved candidates these candidates have no similarity to the human_proteome therefore exhibiting the advantage of causing no adverse_effects or at least no known adverse_effects on humans contact members of the enterobacteriaceae family are globally ubiquitous organisms found in soil water and vegetation and are part of the normal gut_microbiota of many animals including humans these gram_negative include a large number of genera e g klebsiella proteus serratia enterobacter and escherichia are among the most abundant commensal microorganisms in humans are the most frequent cause of invasive diseases in patients of all ages and acquire drug_resistance at a concerning rate their ubiquity and frequent acquisition of mobile_genetic that give them a selective_advantage drives human_hosts to be regularly exposed to new bacteria strains with novel genetic repertoires including antibiotic_resistance resistant gram_negative are responsible for many nosocomial_infections and healthy non hospitalized patient infections and are a major_concern due to the severity of the infections they cause the ease of developing multi resistance and the absence of new therapeutic_agents active against this group of pathogens the development of antibiotic_resistance in bacteria is a growing phenomenon in the twenty_first and is one of the worlds most pressing public_health recent_reports have described the spread of carbapenem_resistant or carbapenemase producing enterobacteriaceae as being associated with high mortality_rates and having the potential to spread widely the first report of a carbapenem resistant_strain of klebsiella_pneumoniae was in in the united_states in europe the first case of infection which was of us origin was reported in in france and in a case was first reported in colombia and then in brazil and v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com argentina new antibiotics are needed as drug_resistance continues to grow but little progress has been observed in the development of new antibiotics to combat bacterial_infections mainly because many pharmaceutical_companies are withdrawing from antibacterial research and development likely due to the scientific challenges associated with manufacturing a novel antibacterial_drug the low return_on that currently affects most pharmaceuticals and the difficulties associated with the discovery of new drug_targets in bacteria typically a drug_target is a molecular_structure such as a protein or a nucleic_acid through which a drug modulates its therapeutic activity and it can be a molecule in the human_body that causes disease for some reason or a molecule from a disease_causing microorganism in this study we will focus only on drug_targets that are proteins from species of the enterobacteriaceae family different approaches can be applied for selection of a good candidate to therapeutic_target like models based on sequence to function comparative_genomics metabolic_pathways structure to function and data_mining the most common approach to assist new drug target_identification has been based on the determination of high_sequence using the blast algorithm which is a good initial starting_point but structure similarities are also important along with other explicit or hidden correlations even for proteins with low sequence_similarities new drug_targets can also be identified by establishing correlations between known protein signatures with contiguous patterns of to residue long amino_acids associated with a particular structure or function in proteins as annotated on public resources such as interpro the model that we are proposing here in one of the only few methods that is able to predict the existence of potential_drug based on the biological_function the domain and functional sites of a protein identified interpro entries to be sufficient for the prediction of all of the human druggable proteome herein we propose a model to identify potential antibiotic drug_targets of the enterobacteriaceae family by exploring semantic similarities across interpro entries annotated to known enterobacteriaceae drug_targets in this model we first specified a drug_target vector space model vsm using the known enterobacteriaceae drug_targets and their associated interpro entries and applied the singular_value svd technique to this dataset to create a reduced drug_target space that reveals latent correlations between the known drug_targets that are impossible to perceive by strictly direct queries onto relational databases through the projection of the enterobacteriaceae proteome vectors onto the reduced drug_target space and the application of the cosine metric to the vectors angles we were able to retrieve a set of potential antibiotic drug_targets that incorporate the latent structural and functional correlations between the known drug_targets the final_set of enterobacteriaceae specific antibiotic drug_target candidates was defined by filtering some of the protein properties associated with bacterial drug_targets and determining the similarity to proteincoding essential genes of escherichia_coli strain k and with the human_proteome
