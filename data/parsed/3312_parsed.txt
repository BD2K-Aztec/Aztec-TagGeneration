data_and obtaining better quality final clustering by merging a collection of clusterings motivation clustering_methods including k means som upgma daa click genecluster cast dhc pmetis and kmetis have been widely used in biological studies for gene_expression protein_localization sequence recognition and more all these clustering_methods have some benefits and drawbacks we propose a novel graph_based clustering software called comusa for combining the benefits of a collection of clusterings into a final clustering having better overall quality results comusa implementation is compared with pmetis kmetis and k means experimental_results on artificial real and biological_datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method comusa produces very good quality clusters in a short amount of time clustering is the process of organizing objects into groups which have similar members a distance_metric is used for evaluating the similarity clustering is also known as unsupervised classification in the literature clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields taxonomists social scientists psychologists biologists statisticians mathematicians engineers computer scientists medical researchers and others who collect and process real_data have all contributed to clustering methodology there are many well known clustering_algorithms as stated earlier each clustering method provides some benefits therefore multiple clusterings can be obtained for the same dataset and these benefits can be combined into a final clustering comusa takes a collection of clusterings as input and it creates a final clustering with better overall quality in other words comusa combines the benefits of multiple clusterings into a final clustering comusa is a general_purpose software it can be used on biological and non biological_datasets however in this article we will evaluate comusas performance on biological_datasets to whom correspondence should be addressed
