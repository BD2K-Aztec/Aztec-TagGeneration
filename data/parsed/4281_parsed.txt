structural_bioinformatics skempi a structural kinetic and energetic database of mutant protein interactions and its use in empirical models_motivation empirical_models for the prediction of how changes in sequence alter proteinprotein binding_kinetics and thermodynamics can garner insights into many aspects of molecular_biology however such models require empirical training data and proper validation before they can be widely_applied previous databases contained few stabilizing mutations and no discussion of their inherent biases or how this impacts model construction or validation results we present skempi a database of binding_free changes upon mutation assembled from the scientific_literature for proteinprotein heterodimeric complexes with experimentally_determined structures this represents over four times more data than previously collected changes in association and dissociation_rates and enthalpies and entropies were also recorded the existence of biases towards specific mutations residues interfaces proteins and protein_families is discussed in the context of how the data can be used to construct predictive_models finally a cross_validation scheme is presented which is capable of estimating the efficacy of derived models on future data in which these biases are not present availability the database is available online atascertaining how the alteration of protein_sequence influences the thermodynamics and kinetics of binding is of fundamental_importance to many disparate areas of biomedical_research among others its application is central to antibody engineering interaction design locating binding hotspots determining the energetics of specific moiety contacts for instance uncovering binding mechanisms characterizing transitions states for instance determining the diversity of affinities and specificities of extant proteins as well as ascertaining the functional consequences of potentially pathological mutations for instance should it become possible to estimate how single or multiple mutations influence the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein binding on a much greater scale many further investigations would materialize for instance determining the consequences of polymorphisms and mutations from initiatives such as the genomes_project the cancer genome_project http www sanger ac uk genetics cgp or the cancer_genome http cancergenome nih gov promises to yield significant insights into the mechanisms of disease on a systemic level yet the amount of data being produced is staggering applied to genetic data obtained in a clinical_setting such methods could find use in personalized_medicine used to characterize sequence function landscapes these methods could test theoretical_models regarding the relationship between mutational robustness and evolvability applied to orthologs and paralogs this would indicate how affinities and specificities vary across phylogenetic_trees giving insights in how organisms have adapted to their niches at the interaction_network level furthermore a more widespread application of de_novo interface design could be used to rewire interaction networks incisive and large_scale experimental_studies have illuminated many aspects of protein binding whereby the binding of mutants is typically characterized using surface_plasmon isothermal_titration or spectroscopic_techniques however these approaches are resource_intensive which prohibits their use in the high_throughput characterization of sequence function landscapes in many systems recourse can be made in combinatorial methods that circumvent the need for direct_physical measurement however these methods can suffer from challenges arising from library generation display selection and sequencing currently it is unlikely that any of these methods alone will be able to keep up with the abundance of data generated by modern genomics initiatives in light of this and ever increasing computational_resources computational_models are an attractive option where structural data are available methods such as mm pbsa and mm gbsa can be used to derive free_energies from structural ensembles generated using monte_carlo sampling or molecular_dynamics to whom correspondence should be addressed however errors can arise from force_field approximations and insufficient conformational_sampling and the production of trajectories can be costly promisingly it is possible to produce empirically parameterized functions for the physical modelling or statistical_inference of g or even h s k on and k off such empirical functions have the potential to be highly_efficient and where the role of conformational_flexibility is limited highly_accurate these methods are limited by the availability of training data with greater data finer inferences can be made and a broader range of phenomena investigated however special_care must be taken to avoid subtle ways of overfitting or deriving overly optimistic estimates of the generalisation error in this article we present skempi structural database of kinetics and energetics of mutant protein interactions skempi is a large manually_curated database of experimentally_measured changes in binding_free entropy enthalpy and rate_constants upon mutation the data may be used to investigate the structural principles_governing the influence of mutations upon binding for the evaluation of theoretical or experimental_techniques as well as for the training of empirical functions as the kinetic and thermodynamic changes reported in the literature are not systematic and reflect the interests of the experimentalists who determine them the data have specific_biases towards certain residues types of mutation spatial_locations binding_sites proteins and protein_families these biases are reviewed and discussed in the context of how they can be accounted for in the construction and evaluation of empirical_models specifically a cross_validation framework is presented within which empirically trained models of arbitrary complexity can be evaluated such that the resultant cross_validation error is not lowered by these biases and can thus be used to give an indication of how well the model is likely to perform when applied to mutations that are not necessarily of the same type as those overrepresented in the training_set in total g measurements of unique mutations or sets of mutations were found for structures of protein protein_complexes for comparison the available databases asedb and pint respectively contain and binding_affinity data cross_referenced to dimer structures in the protein databank covering and systems respectively the g values collected range from to kcal_mol these extreme values_correspond to the conversion between the wild_type p lys bpti trypsin complex which has femtomolar affinity and the micromolar p gly variant both of which have crystal_structures available kinetic rate_constants were available for the wild_type forms of mutations covering a range of log k on of to and log k off of to with k on and k off units of m s and s respectively furthermore changes in entropies and enthalpies were available for mutations with h ranging from to kcal_mol and s from to cal mol k in total the database contains single_mutants double_mutants triple mutants and values corresponding to between and mutations with many examples of additive and non additive_effects the data come from many studies including site directed experiments systematic mutation scans homolog scanning mutagenesis cognate non cognate pairs and interface engineering studies the majority of the data were measured using surface_plasmon isothermal_titration and spectroscopic_methods such as stopped_flow fluorescence some of the data were reported as inhibition constants and thus enzyme mutants that reduce catalytic turnover could result in the overestimation of binding_strength such as may be the case for the tissue_factor fab k a k a mutant this is however not common in the dataset in agreement with a previous work the reported standard_errors in k d for the wild_type affinities are typically up to around corresponding to around kcal_mol while binding_energies for interactions that appear more than once tend to vary by around kcal_mol with differences rarely exceeding kcal_mol these figures therefore give a more accurate picture of the experimental uncertainties in the data many different types of mutations are present including mutations that destroy intramolecular disulfide_bridges mutations corresponding to structural changes such as mutations to and from proline and mutations accompanied by the recruitment and burial of ions to compensate for charges introduced at the interface due to the large number of mutations derived from alanine_scanning experiments around a third of the data correspond to mutations to alanine when these are removed and amino_acids are classified as hydrophobic a v i l m f y and w polar s t n and q positive r k and h negative d and e or other c g and p of the mutations are within the same category are from hydrophobic amino_acids to polar or charged are from polar to hydrophobic or charged correspond to a charge swap to a mutation from a charged residue to a polar or hydrophobic and the remaining correspond to mutations to or from the other category a summary of the database is shown in the complete database is available at the website_http life bsc es pid mutation database the crystal_structures were checked for unknown and modified residues most of which were away from the binding_site cpa btf ftl dan s q although a modified residue does covalently attach the subunits of the ubiquitin uch l complex xd the complexes were also checked for co factors at the binding_interface by searching for chemical_species with at least one atom within a of both binding_partners these

monomers grn b pcc or agents associated with the buffer or protein_precipitation purification o b tmg bn wpt nps none of these species was found intercalated between the subunits of the complex one of the motivating forces behind assembling this dataset is that a major_obstacle to gaining a deep_understanding of the binding process and to efficiently engineering protein interfaces is the lack of structural and affinity data such affinity data can be used to train appropriate g models ideally with some form of overfitting avoidance bias complexity commensurate to the number of training examples and accounting for the biases in the training_set a number of g functions have been developed previously although with very few stabilizing mutations present in the data used for parameterization furthermore a large proportion of the data have come from alanine_scanning experiments as such models have been trained to estimate the influence of clashes or the removal of stabilising contacts the most common_goal of interface engineering however is affinity optimization the data presented here include mutations that stabilize the interaction by at least kcal_mol and up to kcal_mol this is in part due to a number of crystal_structures that have been solved for lower_affinity mutant complexes notably bpti trypsin sgb omtky colicin e im barnase barstar hemagglutinin igg subtilisin bnp ci cytochrome_c peroxidase hew lysozyme antibody lactamase blip cyclophilinthe specific_residues or complexes in the dataset thus instead of using leave_one leave residue out or better still leave complex out cross_validation should be used to estimate the efficacy of the model when applied to residues or proteins other than those in the database however even doing this neglects biases towards certain protein_families or interfaces this can sometimes be desirable the large number of antibody antigen_complexes would be favourable for those looking to apply models to antibody_affinity optimization we may wish to estimate the performance of a model specifically on this class of mutations and leave complex out cross_validation would suffice however to avoid overestimating the general predictive_power of a model on any future unspecified protein complex this must be accounted for in the validation_process for instance by removing entire classes of complexes together when performing cross_validation however in order to do this one must carefully specify how classes are defined as we have attempted to do below care should be made not to aggregate complexes that need not be put together as this will reduce the number of cases in the cross_validation training_sets and can lead to overestimation of the generalisation error when defining classes to be simultaneously held out during cross_validation we wanted to hold out pairs of interactions where at least one protein in each pair was using the same or a homologous binding_site we did not wish to simultaneously hold out interactions at sites distal to each other such as the factor_viia tissue_factor site where binding is antipodal to the inhibitor binding_site furthermore we wanted to capture common binding_modes that may not be reflected by sequence_homology in serine_protease interactions which are highly represented in the benchmark inhibition is achieved by a loop that adopts a canonical conformation the convergent_evolution of this local loop structure in unrelated protein_families of different global structure and sequence prevents some complexes involving this loop from being classified together using structural or sequence_alignment however the change in binding_energy of mutations within this loop is often independent of the inhibitor family as shown by interscaffolding additivity cycles in light of this we propose a scheme based on the grouping together of interactions based on cross_reactive and homologous binding_sites supplementaryshows the homologies andinteractions between the proteins in the database for all pairs of proteins with a shared binding_partner or homologous binding_partners we checked whether the interactions took_place at the same binding_site see section shows pairs of proteins that bind to the same binding_site on a third protein red or that bind to the same binding_site on two homologous_proteins blue for more than half of the proteins binding is to a unique site for many of the rest the site is shared in one or two other interactions for instance the binding_site on the lactamase inhibitory_protein blip is shared by both tem and shv lactamase and thus these interactions should be simultaneously held out during cross_validation the remainder fall into three groups the first is the protease_inhibitors including the inhibitory_antibodies e and s which share protease binding_sites the second is the antigens which bind to the same region of their respective antibodies the third group is the proteases which share a common binding_site on the inhibitors thus all protease_inhibitor interactions should also be simultaneously held out as should all the antibodyantigen interactions for the membrane type serine_protease the active_site is shared by both protease_inhibitors and the s and e inhibitory_antibodies thus interactions involving this protein should be either ignored during evaluation or both classes of interaction should be held out the classes as well as all the complexes which should be omitted are outlined in the skempi database this scheme allows the evaluation of the generalization error with the minimal amount of grouping required to account for to the authors knowledge all biases arising from overrepresentation of specific types of mutation in the skempi database
