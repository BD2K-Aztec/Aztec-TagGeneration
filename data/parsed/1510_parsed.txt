sequence_analysis dysc software for greedy clustering of s rrna reads pyrosequencing technologies are frequently used for sequencing the s ribosomal_rna marker gene for profiling microbial_communities clustering of the produced reads is an important but time consuming task we present dynamic seed_based clustering dysc a new tool based on the greedy clustering approach that uses a dynamic seeding strategy evaluations based on the normalized_mutual nmi criterion show that dysc produces higher quality clusters than uclust and cd_hit at a comparable runtime availability_and dysc implemented in c is available atpyrosequencing technologies are frequently used for microbial sequencing studies based on sequencing of hyper variable_regions of the s ribosomal_rna rrna marker gene e g typical dataset sizes range from a few tens_of up to several million_reads the taxonomy independent approach to their computational_analysis typically performs a hierarchical_clustering and then bins the reads into operational_taxonomic otus based on a distance threshold clustering is usually computed on a pairwise distance_matrix that is derived either from an all against all read_alignment or a profilebased multiple_sequence however this approach has a high_complexity in terms of both time and space and thus does not scale up to several million_reads the classical greedy sequence_clustering method builds up clusters in an iterative incremental fashion each cluster is represented by one sequence called seed an unseen read is then aligned to all seeds if all alignments return distances above a given threshold the read is used as the seed of a new cluster otherwise the read is added to one of the clusters for which the distance is within the threshold examples of existing software used for read clustering based on the greedy approach are cd_hit and uclust although this approach is scalable and efficient it generally produces clusters of lower_quality than hierarchical_clustering in this article we present a new tool called dynamic seed_based clustering dysc that uses a dynamic seeding to whom correspondence should be addressed pending cluster conversion example using two neighboring clusters reaching the threshold size max pending left fixed seeds and the fixed cluster members are determined center and right after optimization the seed of the cluster can be shifted to another member of the original pending cluster see arrows strategy to achieve_higher while preserving scalability and efficiency
