bioinformatics_discovery gene_expression rrna mrna pairing alters the length and the symmetry of mrna protected fragments in ribosome_profiling experiments motivation ribosome_profiling is a new technique that allows monitoring locations of translating ribosomes on mrna at a whole tran scriptome level a recent ribosome_profiling study demonstrated that internal shinedalgarno sd sequences have a major global effect on translation rates in bacteria ribosomes pause at sd sites in mrna therefore it is important to understand how sd sites effect mrna movement through the ribosome and generation of ribosome footprints results here we provide evidence that in addition to pausing effect internal sd sequences induce a caterpillar like movement of mrna through the ribosome cavity once an sd site binds to the ribosome it remains attached to it while the ribosome decodes a few subsequent codons this leads to asymmetric progressive elongation of ribosome footprints at the end it is likely that internal sd sequences induce a pause not on a single but on several adjacent codons this finding is important for our understanding of mrna movement through the ribosome and also should facilitate interpretation of ribosome_profiling data contact brave oval translation_initiation sites in bacteria usually consist of a start_codon most frequently aug gug or uug and a purine reach region nt upstream termed a shinedalgarno sd sequence the sd sequence binds to the small_ribosomal through complementary interactions with an anti shinedalgarno asd sequence located at the end of s rrna auuccuccac the importance of sd sequences for translation_initiation is well known its presence is routinely verified in algorithms for start_codon prediction in bacteria until recently the known role of internal sd sequences was limited to its stimulatory_effect on ribosomal frameshifting inbacteria recent single_molecule studies revealed that internal sd sites can arrest ribosome movement along mrna application of the ribosome_profiling technique to the analysis of protein_synthesis in bacteria demonstrated that this effect is pervasive it was shown that ribosome density is positively correlated with the presence of strong sd sequences and strong sdasd interactions cause pausing of elongating ribosomes under conditions of fast growth the sd site effect on translation rates seems to be more significant than that of other known coding sequence_features such as codon_bias however the pausing effect of sd sequences on elongating ribosomes cannot explain all the empirical observations regarding its stimulation of ribosomal frameshifting indeed the effect of an sd site on frameshifting is strictly determined by its position relative to the frameshift site for stimulation of ribosomal frameshifting an sd site needs to be located just nt upstream of the p site codon whereas stimulation of frameshifting requires a distance of nt in bacterial release factor gene which has a programmed frameshift site not only the sd site but also its distance from the frameshift site is highly_conserved in addition to interference with a trna in the e site the position specificity of sd site effect on frameshifting could be due to tensions imposed on the bulk of mrna located between the decoding center and an sd asd duplex a simple analogy for such tensions is a spring effect illustrated on a short spacer is expected to produce a stretched spring effect promoting a movement of codons in the direction relative to trnas trnas move forward a long spacer is expected to produce the opposite compressed spring effect the model illustrated inrequires sd site to be able to interact with asd at a range of distances from the decoded codon such interactions would force mrna to move through a ribosome in a caterpillar like rippling fashion this could occur only if ribosomes are capable of accommodating variable amount of mrna between the sd asd duplex and the decoding center in this case ribosomes would remain bound to the same sd site while decoding several subsequent codons leading to asymmetric progressive extension of ribosome footprints as shown in in this work we analyzed ribosome_profiling data obtained for escherichia_coli and bacillus_subtilis and have shown that the length and distribution of ribosome footprints at sd site containing mrna regions is consistent with the caterpillar model of progressive footprint extension to whom correspondence should be addressed the author s published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work
