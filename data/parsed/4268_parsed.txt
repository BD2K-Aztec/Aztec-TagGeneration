single_cell transcriptional analysis to uncover regulatory_circuits driving cell_fate in early mouse development motivation transcriptional_regulatory controlling cell_fate in mammalian em bryonic development remain_elusive despite a long time of research the recent_emergence of single_cell rna_profiling technology raises hope for new discovery although experimental works have obtained intriguing insights into the mouse early development a holistic and systematic view is still missing mathematical_models of cell_fates tend to be concept based not designed to learn from real_data to elucidate the regulatory_mechanisms behind cell_fate it is highly_desirable to synthesize the data_driven and knowledge driven modeling_approaches results we propose a novel method that integrates the structure of a cell_lineage tree with tran scriptional patterns from single_cell data this method adopts probabilistic boolean_network pbn for network modeling and genetic_algorithm as search_strategy guided by the directionality of cell development along branches of the cell_lineage tree our method is able to accurately infer the regulatory_circuits from single_cell in a holistic way applied on the single_cell transcriptional data of mouse preimplantation_development our algorithm outperforms conventional methods of network_inference given the network_topology our method can also identify the operational interactions in the gene_regulatory grn corresponding to specific cell_fate this is one of the first attempts to infer grns from single_cell transcriptional data incorporating dynamics of cell development along a cell_lineage tree understanding gene_regulatory grns that control cell_fate is of paramount_importance in biology it can provide critical insights into many questions in developmental_biology stem_cell cancer synthetic_biology etc mouse preimplantation_development is a prominent example for the study of cell_fate starting from the cell fertilized zygote it proceeds to the cell blastocyst consisting of three for this classic developmental_process many results and insights have been obtained through decades of research however the regulatory_mechanism for differential_gene that leads to the formation of the three cell_types remains to be elucidated one hurdle lies in that many analyses were conducted on the average expression of a population of cells in mouse as well as other species ignoring the heterogeneity among individual cells which however is critical for the cell_lineage formation recently the technology of single_cell rna_profiling promises to overcome this hurdle and provides new insights in robson lab generated a single_cell rna_profiling dataset for the early development of mouse_embryo using statistical_analysis techniques on the dataset they identified intriguing patterns that shed light on the dynamics of cell_fate the results obtained from this dataset which we will refer to as robsons data hereafter demonstrated the power of single_cell expression analysis however the data_driven approach in was limited to descriptive statistical relations of gene_expression interpretation of which requires highly_specialized knowledge and experiences of researchers to gain a systematic and holistic understanding of the causal_mechanisms an integrative network model that is executable through computer simulations would be highly_desirable in conjunction with experimental works mathematical_models have been proposed for the study of cell_fate many models are based on the theory of dynamical_systems which represents a cell state by a vector of gene_expression levels s x x x n where x i is the expression value of the ith gene hence each cell state is a point in the n dimensional state_space in which a change of the cell state is represented as a movement along a trajectory constrained by the architecture of a grn cell states tend to move toward stable_states called attractors kauffman proposed that cell_types can be modeled as attractors over years_ago and he pioneered the use of boolean_networks among numerous applications boolean_networks have been applied to studies of cancer_cell and stem_cells in addition to the discrete model of boolean_network ordinary_differential based_approaches that include kinetic_models of molecular_interactions are popular for cell_fate modeling the continuous models can represent the physical_processes of gene_regulation precisely and quantitatively and they are amenable to theoretical_analysis of the underlying systems e g steady_state analysis for the inference and analysis of grns various differential_equation models have been developed however differential_equation models need accurate estimation of parameter_values which remains a challenge in many cases machine_learning have also been developed to elucidate gene_regulation in cell development for example in and cell_lineage trees were incorporated into machine_learning to infer gene_networks and expression programs respectively reverse_engineering of grn from gene_expression data is a challenging_problem in computational_biology although many methods have been proposed see and references therein they were mostly designed for the average expression in a population of cells and rely on local dependence among variables e g genes however single_cell expression data pose new challenges for grn_inference the heterogeneity among cells could make the average of expression levels misleading moreover many existing_methods of grn_inference require long and dense times series data of rna_profiling which are often unavailable especially when the experimental cost is high therefore alternative_strategies of grn_inference are needed for single_cell transcriptional data with short and sparse time series in this article we propose a novel approach to the inference of grn from single_cell expression data it takes_into the relative positions of cells on the cell_lineage tree our assumption is that grn provides the driving_force that pushes cells from ancestral states towards descendant states such directionality of cell development is imposed by the logical constraints of the underlying grn from robsons dataset of mouse early development we can observe which cell states belong to a certain node in the cell_lineage tree given a candidate grn we can simulate the dynamic trajectories of cells following the regulatory rules encoded in the grn if the simulated trajectories are compatible with the directed paths from the root towards leaves of the cell_lineage tree the grn is likely to be true conversely if a candidate grn drives cells from descendant states backward to ancestral states it is likely to be false to implement this strategy we choose the framework of boolean_network for its strength in state_transition analysis and genetic_algorithms gas for optimization see section for details a similar idea for grn_inference based on boolean_network was proposed in however pal et_al assumed that the expression data should be sampled from attractor states which may be too restrictive for single_cell data relying on the concordance of attractor states of the model with states of the data they did not consider fully the directionality of cell development along branches of a cell_lineage tree therefore although the method of pal et_al is very insightful it is not directly applicable to the single_cell expression data of mouse_embryonic running on the robsons dataset our method for grn structure inference achieved better performance than most of the other methods validated using a published benchmark grn constructed manually from experiments moreover given the structure of grn our method is able to predict operational regulatory_interactions responsible for a specific cell_lineage formation most of the predictions are consistent with literature of experimental_observations to the best of our knowledge the method proposed here is one of the first attempts to infer grn from single_cell expression data unlike existing_methods it does not rely on local dependence of variables which is difficult to detect from short and sparse time series data instead it is a holistic_approach that utilizes global information about a system e g network stability as more singlecell data become available in near future our method is promising to help decipher the mechanisms of cell_fate in this article we have proposed a novel method to uncover regulatory_circuits of cell_fate from single_cell transcriptional data we mapped the transcriptional dynamics of cell development to the stg generated by an asynchronous pbn and defined a score to evaluate how well a candidate network fits the data to learn the optimal network_structure a ga was employed to search for the network with the most natural cell state_transitions according to the cell_lineage tree applied to real single_cell expression data and validated against benchmark networks from biological_experiments our method outperformed most of the other methods for grn_inference through simple adaption our method could also be used to identify operational interactions in grn responsible for cell_fate as one of the first methods for network_analysis of single_cell data our method still needs to address several issues first it has been verified only on robsons dataset partly due to the dearth of publicly_available single_cell data and benchmark networks nevertheless we believe that the strategy of our method can be naturally applied to other single_cell datasets in many biological_contexts e g cancer stem_cell second although our method achieved good prediction_performance measured by precision sensitivity and f measure it is currently slower than the other methods partly because our method was implemented in matlab while others were in java or c also we used ga which is known to be computationally_intensive in future we will speed up our method by parallel_computing and other strategies e g third the procedure of cell lineage_commitment is often triggered by external stimulus e g signaling_events from neighboring_cells which has not been explicitly included in our current model in future this could be modeled as a perturbation that pushes a cell state to a different point in a state_space without following any internal regulatory rules
