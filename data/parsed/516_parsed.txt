assembly scaffolding with pe contaminated mate_pair motivation scaffolding is often an essential step in a genome_assembly process in which contigs are ordered and oriented using read_pairs from a combination of paired_end libraries and longer range mate_pair although a simple idea scaffolding is unfortunately hard to get right in practice one source of problems is so_called pe contamination in mate_pair in which a non negligible fraction of the read_pairs get the wrong orientation and a much smaller insert_size than what is expected this contamination has been discussed before in relation to integrated scaf folders but solutions rely on the orientation being observable e g by finding the junction adapter sequence in the reads this is not always possible making orientation and insert_size of a read_pair stochastic to our knowledge there is neither previous work on modeling pe contamination nor a study on the effect pe contamination has on scaffolding quality results we have addressed pe contamination in an update to our scaffolder besst we formulate the problem as an integer_linear which is solved using an efficient heuristic the new method shows significant_improvement over both integrated and stand alone scaffolders in our experiments the impact of modeling pe contamination is quantified by comparing with the previous besst model we also show how other scaffolders are vulnerable to pe contaminated libraries resulting in an increased number of misassemblies more conservative scaffolding and inflated assembly sizes availability_and the model is implemented in besst source_code and usage instructions are found at https github com ksahlin besst besst can also be downloaded using pypi genome_assembly is still a challenging process especially for large_genomes and scientists experiment with different combinations of data and tools to reduce errors improve contiguity and avoid ambiguity an important step in the assembly process is scaffolding in which contigs are ordered oriented and joined to form a larger scaffold unit the input is a set of contigs and one or several genome mappings of paired short_reads from either paired_end pe sequencing or mate_pair mp sequencing evaluations e g have shown that scaffolders make many mistakes perhaps more than one might expect from what could appear a straightforward computational_problem the input to a scaffolder is however both large and noisy and the data characteristics can vary a lot depending on the organism and v c the author published_by
