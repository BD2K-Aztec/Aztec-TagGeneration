genetics_and alphampsim flexible simulation of multi parent crosses multi parent crosses of recombinant_inbred exist in many species for fine_scale analysis of genome_structure and marker trait association these populations encompass a wide_range of crossing designs with varying potential alphampsim is a flexible simulation program that is efficiently designed for comparison of alternative designs for traits with varying genetic architectures and biallelic markers with densities up to full sequence a large_pool of founder haplotypes can be supplied by the user or generated via integration with external coalescent_simulation programs such as macs from these diverse founders for multi parent designs can be generated automatically and users can compare designs generated from diverse pedigrees full tracking of identity by descent status of alleles within the pedigree is undertaken and output_files are compatible with commonly available analysis packages in r availability_and executable versions of alphampsim for mac and linux and a user_manual are available atmulti parent recombinant_inbred ril crosses offer the ability to capture a wide_range of genetic_and in a controlled balanced family_structure with increased mapping resolution their advantages have led to their implementation in several species including mice maize arabidopsis wheat rice barley and oats developing these populations takes time and is expensive as differences in design will affect not only the resources_required for creation but also the eventual power and resolution optimization of the design is an important consideration in planning a multi parent study simulation is a powerful approach for comparing alternative designs software_packages in r for simulating multi parent ril crossesqtl and mpmap are available but have not been designed for simulation of sequence_data and application to polygenic traits controlled by large_numbers of quantitative_trait qtl in contrast we have developed alphampsim as a flexible simulation software_package for generating dense genotypes in large populations generated data can be easily linked to standard analysis software to answer_questions about design and power of future_studies this versatile software helps meet the urgent need for computationally_efficient flexible and easy touse tools capable of handling the complexities associated with multi parent inbred line crosses we have described a new computer package for the simulation of marker sequence and trait data from complex multi parent ril crosses the program is computationally_efficient flexible and easy to use it makes the simulation of large_datasets feasible for such populations genomic sequence_data and in particular lowcoverage sequencing_data will be increasingly used in multiparent crosses the computational_efficiency of alphampsim will enable researchers to evaluate the power of alternative low_coverage strategies in advance of investing in such data
