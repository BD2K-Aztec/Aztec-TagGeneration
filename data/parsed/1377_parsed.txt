gene_expression diana algorithmic improvements for analysis of data_independent ms data motivation data_independent mass_spectrometry has emerged as a reproducible and sensitive alternative in quantitative_proteomics where parsing the highly complex tandem_mass requires dedicated algorithms recently targeted data_extraction was proposed as a novel analysis strategy for this type of data but it is important to further develop these concepts to provide quality controlled interference adjusted and sensitive peptide quantification results we here present the algorithm diana and the classifier pyprophet which are based on new probabilistic sub scores to classify the chromatographic peaks in targeted data_independent data analysis the algorithm is capable of providing accurate quantitative values and increased recall at a controlled false_discovery in a complex gold_standard dataset importantly we further demonstrate increased confidence gained by the use of two complementary data_independent targeted analysis algorithms as well as increased numbers of quantified peptide precursors in complex biological_samples availability_and diana is implemented in scala and python and available as open_source apache license or pre compiled binaries from http quantitativeproteomics org diana pyprophet can be installed from pypi https pypi python org pypi pyprophet accurate and precise quantification of proteins is a critical component of life_science and systems_biology applications the prevailing method for quantification of complete proteomes was until recently data dependent acquisition dda also referred to as shotgun mass_spectrometry ms shotgun ms can provide_extensive maps of the measurable and expressed proteomes of a large_numbers of organisms tissues organs and organelles however of identified peptides are typically shared between two replicate shotgun ms injections requiring multiple_injections of the same sample to reproducibly measure peptides in all samples the limited analytical reproducibility observed in shotgun ms has fuelled the development of targeted ms strategies such as selected_reaction srm to increase reproducibility and specificity compared with shotgun ms to perform targeted ms strategies requires a priori determined information on how to target a given peptide_sequence such information typically consists of the peptide_sequence the preferred charge_state the empirical or predicted high_performance hplc elution time as well as the relative intensities and masses of the n most prominent fragments the construction of these ms assays requires a substantial effort which has resulted in the assembly of public_repositories of peptides and ms assays to simplify further studies although the targeted ms strategies such as srm provides reproducible and accurate protein quantification the throughput is normally limited to up to a few hundred peptides per injection limiting the technique for whole proteome studies data_independent ms dia ms was originally used to improve peptide_identification rates but lately workflows using dia ms combined with targeted data_extraction have been described in attempts to combine the reproducibility of srm with the throughput of shotgun ms data_acquisition in dia ms relies on deterministic splitting of the survey scan peptide ion mass_range into one or more subsets followed by cofragmentation of all precursor masses in one entire subset while leaving the de convolution of the peptide ions in these complex ms spectra to the post acquisition analysis the acquisition method yields complete ms retention time maps compared with the discontinuous maps of shotgun ms and can be seen as a complete digitization of the sample as seen by the mass_spectrometer targeted extraction dia ms has the sensitivity precision reproducibility and dynamic range to allow deep large_scale measurement of the proteomes of biological_systems to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com however the strategys data analysis needs further improvement and currently only a few tools exist that are capable of large_scale robust targeted extraction dia ms analysis the poor availability of data analysis tools limits robustness as users are blindly exposed to any potential error in the particular algorithm used and lowers sensitivity as parts of the proteome might be unreachable due to the potential preferences of a given algorithm for example the combination of multiple algorithms in shotgun ms has been shown to increase the amount of peptide_spectrum with up to compared with a single algorithm we have previously described algorithms for detection of the correct signals in srm chromatograms based on fragmentation_patterns and we hypothesized that these concepts can further improve the targeted data analysis in dia data and also provide complementarity towards existing_tools here we investigate this by combining the dia ms targeted analysis strategy with our previous_efforts in srm data analysis and present a new algorithm and software for automated analysis of dia ms data the algorithm called diana introduces a new function for computing chromatographic peak sub scores based on expected ratios between fragments as well as a new interferencecorrected measure of quantity these factors together with the new semi_supervised classification_tool pyprophet increase the amounts of peptide quantifications and enable more accurate quantifications in complex samples finally we also demonstrate that diana is complementary to the previously_published openswath software r ost et_al and that the combination of results from the two engines can further improve on the confidence in and number of peptide quantifications targeted data_extraction for the analysis of complex dia ms data was recently demonstrated as a promising data analysis strategy with the goal to further explore and improve this strategy we have designed a new peak_detection algorithm as well as four new peak sub scoresfmrp fcs imrp and ics analogous to previous published work on srm data analysis the sub scores consider the data channels in a pair_wise manner to provide robustness toward interfering signals from non targeted compounds all sub scores are used to calculate a q value which allows the user to determine the strength of the found evidence for a certain peptide and to filter the results at a target fdr to evaluate diana performance we used the gold_standard water and yeast background datasets from the openswath publication r ost et_al the gold_standard dataset consists of detectable stable_isotope peptides diluted in concentrations from to in water and yeast lysate backgrounds yielding separate samples analyzed in triplicates resulting in dia ms maps targeted extraction of the spiked in peptide traces from the dia ms maps generated extracted chromatograms which were analyzed manually in the openswath publication r ost et_al the presented work demonstrates three advancements in targeted extraction dia ms analysis first the invention of a probabilistic score for fragmentation_patterns is shown to give high analytical power in the complex bacterial and yeast backgrounds which should be considered the minimal expected sample complexity for in vivo or cell_line studies second the adopted interference corrected measure of quantity from our previous srm work is shown to provide increased accuracy in quantification in the noisy dia ms data third we demonstrate the advance of combining two analysis tools for dia ms data_processing the combined output from diana and openswath generated both an increased number of identifications and considerably_increased confidence in the peptides identified by both engines the diana algorithm is very reliant on the peptide fragmentation pattern both for scoring and interference correction this is both a strength and a weakness the advanced probabilistic score is very powerful as the probabilities are individually calculated based on the noise in each specific ratio channel and this allowed us to rely completely on extracted chromatograms for the analysis on the other hand the algorithm depends on conserved fragmentation and changes in instrument collision_energy tuning or mass dependent ion transmission could hinder detection of true peptides nevertheless we have demonstrated powerful classification auc and accurate quantification of peptides have r of the new scoring software diana and classifier pyprophet in a gold_standard dataset further dia ms analysis of four streptococcus_pyogenes lysates grown with or plasma supplement combined analysis using openswath and diana confirms close to peptide ion quantifications but each engine also quantifies over peptides exclusively less than peptide ions have conflicting quantifications from the two algorithms even if performance is largely similar diana is shown to improve performance in samples from bacterial whole cell_lysates with sufficient amounts of true_positives compared with openswath the structure of diana and openswath are conceptually similar the observed differences in performance between the engines can likely be explained by the detailed differences such as the different sub scores or the exact chromatogram extraction or peak_detection we believe that further improvement of diana could be achieved by including something similar to openswaths intensity and signal to noise sub scores as well as a preliminary score to initiate the semi_supervised better the lack of such sub scores could well explain dianas lower sensitivity in samples with very few true_positives in the performed gold_standard and streptococcal lysate analysis we demonstrate the usefulness of utilizing multiple analysis tools to increase the confidence and amounts of detected peptides increasing peptide_identification rates and confidence using a combination of search_engines is an attractive option as it only requires computer hardware investments that are minor compared with instrument investment and maintenance costs being standard procedure in shotgun ms data analysis we believe this study to validate the approach also in dia ms although shotgun ms data analysis is a mature field with tens of different tools available research on the analysis of targeted analysis dia data has only begun it can be anticipated that several powerful concepts for dia analysis remain to be discovered we believe diana demonstrates some such new analysis concepts and their successful application to the complex task of detecting and quantifying peptide ions
