kablammo an interactive web_based blast results visualizer motivation kablammo is a web_based application that produces interactive vector based visual izations of sequence_alignments generated by blast these visualizations can illustrate many features including shared protein_domains chromosome structural_modifications and genome misassembly availability_and kablammo can be used at http kablammo wasmuthlab org for a local installation the source_code and instructions are available under the mit_license at http the basic_local blast rapidly finds similar subsequences shared between a query and database sequences its uses include inferring homology from shared sequence_similarity identifying the species associated with an uncharacterized sequence and locating domains shared between proteins blasts ease of use and diverse applications have made it a ubiquitous tool in molecular_biology especially for researchers without extensive bioinformatics training however its output is predominantly text_based in our experience running training workshops non bioinformaticians often have difficulty finding features of interest restricting blast to serving as a mere tool for identifying genes or species various applications attempt to resolve this by providing graphical interpretations of the blast results but these suffer important shortcomings the ncbi_blast service http blast ncbi nlm nih gov provides a simple_visual summary of alignment results but works only for blast_searches performed through the web_service the blast output visualization_tool bov creates a static rather than interactive rendering of the blast alignments renders only one query at a time and works only with blast version or earlier which is almost four years out of date we have tried other methods reviewed by finding that no single tool satisfied our needs to remedy these issues we present kablammo an application that leverages modern web technologies to produce an expedient visual overview of blast results
