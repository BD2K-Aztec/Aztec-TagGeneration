prediction of human functional genetic_networks from heterogeneous data using rvm based ensemble learning motivation three major problems confront the construction of a human genetic network from heterogeneous genomics data using kernel based_approaches definition of a robust gold_standard negative set large_scale learning and massive missing_data values results the proposed graph based_approach generates a robust gsn for the training_process of genetic network construction the rvm based ensemble model that combines adaboost and reduced feature yields improved_performance on large_scale learning_problems with massive missing_values in comparison to nave_bayes biological_pathways that organize functional_associations between different genes proteins and small_molecules are central to understanding cellular function a variety of high_throughput experimental_data such as dna_microarray chip_chip technology and systematic two hybrid analysis have the potential to provide a systemlevel perspective of cellular_processes and may contribute to systematic drug_discovery moreover the broad availability of indirect biological data_sources such as gene_ontology and protein_localization information also contain information that can be used to understand cellular_processes understanding biological_pathways at the whole_genome level however remains_a several computational_approaches have been applied to construct biological_networks using different individual data_sources however the results are often contradictory and not super imposable in any obvious way due to the intrinsic error_rate of each data_set and limited coverage this limitation has motivated more recent work addressing the problems of integrating heterogeneous functional genomic and proteomic_data to construct biological_network results from these studies suggest that the combination of multiple sources can provide a more unified view of prediction with large coverage and high_reliability several rigorous statistical_models and machine to whom correspondence should be addressed learning approaches have been applied to generate reliable integrated predictions such as bayesian modeling decision_tree and random_forest bayesian modeling nave_bayes and fully connected bayes is the most popular method used to predict proteinprotein and genetic_interactions correlation among data_sets however can cause prediction bias in nave_bayes models fully connected bayes models in contrast can capture the interdependence among data_sources by directly calculating joint probabilities however it results in higher computational costs and requires bin size adjustment of each data dimension to obtain reasonable_results especially for high_dimension data moreover the model prior is generally arbitrarily set to be the proportion of total number of positive_and examples in the chosen benchmarks kernel_based models have demonstrated very competitive computational performance due to their ability to model non linear systems and high_dimension data the support_vector svm has recently been successfully_applied to predict protein_protein and protein complex relationships in yeast and escherichia_coli using heterogeneous data ben the relevance vector machine rvm approach another powerful kernel_based model uses a bayesian learning framework to produce sparse decision models rvm is similar to svm in many respects and has been reported to yield nearly identical performance but surpasses svm in several aspects including automatic prevention of over fitting and generation of much sparser models the rvm has been applied to several biological tasks including the classification and diagnosis of cancers and the identification of non coding_regions in genomes thus rvm may be a useful approach for integrating_multiple heterogeneous data for constructing genetic_networks three major problems however confront the use of rvm in constructing a human genetic network from diverse genomic_data first a robust gold_standard negative gsn set is needed for training a noisy gold_standard will impair training and cause prediction bias major methods reported in previous protein interaction studies to define gsn ben are not suitable for defining gsn for construction of a functional genetic network which is not only composed of physical_interactions butpage in this work a graph based_approach is first presented to construct a more robust gsn than previous methods through validations using old and new kegg_pathways as well as the gene_ontology it has been shown that a robust gsn can be constructed by choosing the n most distant kegg_pathway relationships the high values of f measure and g mean supplementary_material s in all our results also indicate that our models can yield good classification_performance on both positive_and examples this suggests that the proposed graph_based gsn is sufficiently robust that the overlap between gsp and gsn is small with moderate sampling size the rvm based model with only a few vectors is able to significantly reduce both training and prediction time it will be of interest to compare the performance of rvm adaboost with svm adaboost in future applications especially with respect to prediction time that is dominated by the number of vectors in the final assembled model this can clarify the advantage of rvmbased ensemble models on sparseness the kc kernel combination approach in section has been shown to be an effective kernel integration approach in rvm based model which can retain the semantic association within each dataset and subsequently sum up kernel values of each dataset to improve the performance progressively through this method it is observed that the model performance increases progressively as more datasets are integrated supplementary data s thus allowing the model to predict complementary pathway_information we have also addressed the ability of the rvm based models to classify the biological dataset with a large number of missing_values we find that the rvm based model can yield significant performance even with massive missing_data values as shown by comparison with the nave_bayes baseline model among the three model scenarios the double ensemble model m can generate a much lower generalization error than the others because it includes base models corresponding to training data with different patterns page
