ligand_binding of proteins based on known fragment fragment interactions motivation the identification of putative ligand_binding on proteins is important for the prediction of protein_function knowledge based_approaches using structure databases have become interesting because of the recent increase in structural_information approaches using binding_motif information are particularly effective however they can only be applied to well known ligands that frequently appear in the structure databases results we have developed a new method for predicting the binding_sites of chemically diverse ligands by using information about the interactions between fragments the selection of the fragment_size is important if the fragments are too small then the patterns derived from the binding_motifs cannot be used since they are many body interactions while using larger fragments limits the application to well known ligands in our method we used the main and side_chains for proteins and three successive atoms for ligands as fragments after superposition of the fragments our method builds the conformations of ligands and predicts the binding_sites as a result our method could accurately_predict the binding_sites of chemically diverse ligands even though the protein_data currently contains a large number of nucleotides moreover a further evaluation for the unbound forms of proteins revealed that our building up procedure was robust to conformational changes induced by ligand_binding availability our method named bumble is available atstructural information of proteins has been explosively increasing mainly due to structural_genomics on the other hand the to whom correspondence should be addressed molecular_functions of many proteins still remain uncharacterized therefore computational_methods that can predict the molecular_functions are required since many proteins conduct their molecular_functions through the specific recognition of small_molecules ligands information about the ligand_binding can provide insights into their molecular_functions currently the most successful prediction_methods adopt the similarity based_approach this approach searches databases for proteins that are similar to a query_protein in one or more properties such as sequence fold and physicochemical_properties and predicts the functions of the query_protein by transferring the annotations from similar proteins however this approach fails if there is no protein with any detectable similarities to overcome these intrinsic limitations several methods for binding_site that are based only on the d structure of the query_protein have been proposed most of these methods fall into two groups the geometry based and force_field based_approaches the former does not consider the physicochemical_properties of the protein surface because it focuses only on the shapes of the surface i e sizes and depths of clefts on the other hand the latter method which considers the stability of probes positioned around the protein surface does not adequately consider complicated effects such as solvent effects the knowledge based_approach is an appealing alternative this approach can include a wide_range of complicated effects by taking_advantage of the statistics of molecular_interactions obtained from structure databases such as the protein_data the potential of this approach is growing fast because of the recent rapid accumulation of structure data existing knowledgebased methods are based on interactions on one of two levels interatomic and fragment level interactions the approach based on the interatomic interactions uses pair_wise potential functions constructed from the statistics of interatomic contacts observed in the databases this approach has been mainly used for scoring_functions in molecular docking_studies we have proposed a new knowledge based method for predicting binding_sites by building the ligand conformations from the predicted interaction hotspots evaluations revealed that our method could reasonably predict the binding_sites not only for nucleotides but also for chemically diverse ligands although the background_knowledge dataset contained a large number of nucleotides in addition the robustness to the conformational changes of proteins was shown by a further evaluation with protein_structures in the unbound form an important point is that the predictions were accomplished by using the information about the patterns of fragment interactions that are common among various proteins as well as the binding_motifs our method is available on the web_server named bumble which means building up molecules for binding location estimation at the following address http bumble hgc jp
