genome_analysis mass meta_analysis of score statistics for sequencing studies mass is a command_line program to perform meta_analysis of sequencing studies by combining the score statistics from multiple studies it implements three types of multivariate tests that encompass all commonly used association tests for rare_variants the input_files can be generated from the accompanying software score seq this bundle of programs allows analysis of large sequencing studies in a time and memory_efficient manner availability_and mass and score seq including documentations and executables are available at http dlin web unc edu software meta_analysis of genome_wide gwas has led to the discoveries of common_genetic for virtually every complex human disease recent_advances have made it possible to extend association studies to rare_variants because larger_sample are required to detect rare_variants than common_variants with similar effect_sizes combining evidence from many sources is necessary for sequencing studies for ethical and logistical reasons it is strongly preferable to gather summary_statistics than collecting original data for association testing with rare_variants it is customary to aggregate information across several variant sites within a gene to enrich association_signals and to reduce the penalty of multiple testing the simplest approach is the burden test which creates a burden score for each subject by taking a weighted linear combination of the mutation counts within a gene or indicating whether there is any mutation within a gene a second approach is the variable threshold vt test which performs a burden test for variants with minor_allele mafs below a certain threshold and minimizes the p value over the observed maf thresholds a third approach is the variance_component test which is aimed at detecting variants with opposite effects within a gene after creating a burden score for each subject one may carry out the burden test by performing a standard regression_analysis and combine the wald statistics of multiple studies through the inverse variance formula however this strategy is problematic for rare_variants because the effect_estimates may be unstable or even undefined when only a small number of subjects carry any mutation indeed the log odds_ratio is undefined if the burden scores are zero for all cases or all controls we recommend to use score statistics which are statistically more accurate and numerically more stable than wald and likelihood_ratio statistics especially for binary_traits currently there is no meta_analysis software for combining score statistics thus we developed the meta_analysis of score statistics mass software which performs an overall burden test by combining the score statistics of multiple studies in addition mass performs an overall vt test for multiple studies based on score statistics finally mass performs an overall variancecomponent test also based on score statistics the meta_analysis performed by mass is statistically as efficient as joint analysis of individual_level data the software is extremely easy to use because score statistics are not available in existing software_packages we developed score seq which takes the standard input format of sequencing_data and outputs score statistics which can then be meta_analyzed in mass protection of human subjects and other study policies make it difficult to share individual_level data even in well organized consortia thus meta_analysis is strongly preferable to joint analysis the mass software enables one to perform meta_analysis of score statistics for sequencing studies which is statistically as efficient as and indeed numerically equivalent to joint analysis of individual_level data this software can also be used to combine results from other types of genetic_studies as well as non genetic_studies in meta_analysis of sequencing_data the participating studies should use the same annotation file so that the summary_statistics are generated in a consistent_manner across studies this does not mean that the variants have to be the same among studies if a genetic variable is missing in one study then zero can be used as a placeholder in the summary_statistics and mass will combine all available information the calculation of the burden scores requires specification of the mafs the mafs may be estimated separately in each study or jointly across all studies they may also be determined from an external_source we recommend that the same mafs be used by all participating studies in this way the same variants are included in the calculations of the burden scores among the studies and the maf thresholds for the vt test are consistent across the studies for studies that use different exome capturing kits or studies in which some have exome_sequencing while others have exome chip data the input variants are different if the genetic variable pertains to the genotype of a variant and that variant is not measured in the kth study then we simply set the corresponding entries in u k and v k to zero so that mass will combine all available data if the genetic variable pertains to a burden score then a variant that is absent in a study will not contribute to the calculation of the burden score for that study the score statistics from such studies can still be combined in mass although the results need to be interpreted with extra care if the burden score is a weighted linear combination of the genotype values e g the total number of mutations or a weighted_sum of the mutation counts then the score statistics for the burden and vt tests are weighted linear_combinations of the score statistic for testing_the that the genotypes of individual variants are not associated with the trait of interest in that case it would be sufficient to input only the score vector and information matrix for individual variants because they can be used to create the score statistics and information matrices for the burden vt and skat tests we did not take this approach because it requires the burden scores to be calculated under the additive mode of inheritance indeed it has become a common practice to define the burden score as the presence_or of any mutation within a gene rather than the total number or weighted linear combination of the mutations score seq allows burden scores to be calculated under the additive dominant or recessive mode of inheritance by asking the user to input the score statistics and information matrices for each specific test mass can accommodate any mode of inheritance mass adopts the fixed_effect which assumes that the genetic effects are the same among the participating studies this approach will have reasonable power as long as the effects are in the same direction across studies an alternative approach is the random_effect under which the effects in different studies follow a normal distribution the random_effect tends to be less powerful than the fixed_effect even when the effects are heterogeneous and thus has rarely been used in genetic_association
