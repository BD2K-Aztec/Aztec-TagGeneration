microarray r based analysis of complex lysate experiments with miracle motivation reverse_phase protein arrays rppas allow sensitive quantification of relative protein_abundance in thousands of samples in parallel typical challenges involved in this technology are antibody selection sample_preparation and optimization of staining conditions the issue of combining effective sample management and data analysis however has been widely neglected results this motivated us to develop miracle a comprehensive and user_friendly web_application bridging the gap between spotting and array analysis by conveniently keeping track of sample information data_processing includes correction of staining bias estimation of protein concentration from response curves normalization for total protein amount per sample and statistical_evaluation established analysis methods have been integrated with miracle offering experimental scientists an end_to solution for sample management and for carrying out data analysis in addition experienced users have the possibility to export data to r for more complex analyses miracle thus has the potential to further spread utilization of rppas as an emerging technology for high_throughput protein analysis availability project url http www nanocan org miracle reverse_phase protein arrays are typically nitrocellulose covered glass_slides on which crude lysates of tissue_samples or treated cell_lines are spotted each single slide can carry several thousand spots only small amounts of lysate in the range of a few cell equivalents are required for each spot consequently several hundred slide copies can be created at minimal sample consumption each of which can be interrogated with a different proteinspecific antibody this allows high_throughput measurement of the relative_abundance of proteins in up to several thousand samples parallel processing of large sample numbers discerns rppas from forward phase arrays where probes are immobilized on a slide and mass_spectrometry which are suitable for analysis of many proteins in small sample numbers the field of rppas has shown steady growth since its introduction in several studies applied this technology successfully to protein and signaling_pathway analyses in cancer as well as for cancer subtype classification and prognosis of disease_progression the relevance of rppa data for multiomics and high_throughput projects is also highlighted by its inclusion into the cancer_genome where for instance measurements of antibodies for samples of breast_cancer patients are available atlas rppas are a promising technology that finds growing application in both basic_and while many of the challenges of this technology are similar to those of traditional microarrays rppa specific challenges arise and have to be addressed in our efforts to adapt this technology as secondary readout to high_throughput genome_wide rnai screens we identified a lack of a comprehensive tool incorporating all necessary tasks such as experimental_design sample tracking and data analysis to fill this gap we developed miracle a web_based with deep integration of r for efficient data analysis using a database driven web_application such as miracle for sample management offers a number of advantages due to relational tables all data are kept in a concise and consistent format where changes and updates are automatically propagated in contrast to file based storage solutions no experimental information is lost upon turnover of laboratory staff and no problems arise from cryptic and inconsistent sample terminology collaboratively creating experimental_data is significantly more convenient in web_based applications as concurrency issues such as file locks can be avoided in addition all information can be located quickly using full text search which additionally increases efficiency with regards to sample management both the supercurve package and rims provide a graphical_user for specifying slide layouts but it does not address sample tracking from plate to slide level and does not allow for multiple levels of sample information moreover they lack the virtual spotting and layout editing features of miracle that enable researchers to enter all sample related information already on the plate level and before the complexity of the layout is increased by the array generation this saves a significant amount of time and effectively avoids mistakes due to manual data_processing the r packages supercurve and rppanalyzer provide experienced r users with a wealth of options to analyse rppa data the results of these methods are relative protein concentration estimates a logical next step could be to investigate how significant relative differences in protein levels are and how well results correlate e g between slides used for normalization or between individual slides and plate based readout only rppanalyzer reports on slide to slide correlation significance analysis is not part of any existing solution moreover replicates are typically merged during data_processing to increase confidence of the results but thereby making them unavailable for subsequent significance analysis in contrast rmiracle processes replicates individually and offers a comprehensive evaluation of significance and correlation a number of analysis methods such as serial_dilution curve have been published as r code but have not been adapted to a user_friendly format thereby limiting their application for experimental researchers experienced r users on the other hand need the flexibility of the r environment to perform deeper analysis of the data rmiracle strives to serve both target groups by incorporating a broad number of published_methods on rppa data analysis in both command_line and web_interface additionally rmiracle can be used completely independently of the miracle web_application requiring only a local installation of r notably the web_application rims followed similar goals as miracle but did not include scenarios where more sophisticated data_processing e g quantification and normalization of the signal_intensities is necessary moreover rims is not actively developed or available at the moment stressing the need for a solution like miracle in recent_years the application of rppa technology has matured considerably along with this progress suitable computational_methods have been developed to address issues in data_processing to further promote acceptance of this technology fully integrated tools like miracle are indispensable furthermore it can be expected that standardization of rppa data in a common framework can substantially aid the development of novel algorithms and allow better integration at the level of network biology and other multi omics_data it is our hope that miracle will attract contributions from both users and developers which will help to strengthen the entire field to this end we have established a github repository https github com nanocan miracle and established a demo application http www nanocan org miracle demo containing biological_sample data further documentation and a stepby step user guide are available online supplementary_file
