sequence_analysis mutascope sensitive detection of somatic_mutations from deep amplicon_sequencing we present mutascope a sequencing analysis_pipeline specifically developed for the identification of somatic variants present at low allelic fraction from high_throughput of amplicons from matched tumor normal specimen using datasets reproducing tumor genetic_heterogeneity we demonstrate that mutascope has a higher sensitivity and generates fewer false_positive calls than tools designed for shotgun_sequencing or diploid genomes availability freely_available on the web atthe accurate detection of somatic_mutations in tumors is critical for precise diagnostic and selection of targeted_therapies but the low allelic fraction frequently_encountered in heterogeneous or poor cellularity clinical_specimens renders this task challenging in current clinical assays amplicons covering the exons of cancer_genes are amplified via polymerase_chain based or analogous approaches and sequenced at high depth to identify mutations present in of a dna_sample despite high coverage depth the error_rate resulting from systematic sequencing bias can hinder the detection of mutations although experimental or analytical_methods or comparison with the normal dna can mitigate this effect most analysis strategies were developed for sequencing of random shotgun dna_fragments and thus do not take into account systematic errors specific to amplicon_sequencing in amplicon_sequencing loci are covered by reads with identical genomic starting positions and because the error_rate increases along the length of the read a variable consensus error_rate exists over the target analytical strategies specifically_designed for amplicon_sequencing have the potential to enhance the mutation detection_accuracy of current clinical assays especially at low allelic fraction here we present mutascope a software dedicated to the detection of mutations at low allelic fraction from amplicon_sequencing of matched tumor normal samples pairs mutascope determines the amplicon of origin for each read and measures the specific experimental error_rate from sequencing the normal dna the mutations in the tumor are then identified by comparison with the error_rate using a binomial statistics and classified as germ_line or somatic by comparison with the normal dna a set of filters adapted to amplicon_sequencing then eliminates false_positive calls we used two experimental_datasets a mixture of normal dna mix and a set of tumor normal spiked in tns pairs derived from different normal germ_line dna samples to measure the performance of the approach in comparison with other mutation callers we benchmarked mutascope against other mutation callers using sequencing_data generated from a mixture of normal dna samples with known genotypes mix sample resulting in somatic_mutations at variable allelic fraction the classification of the somatic_mutations at low allelic fraction by mutascope was more accurate than other standard_tools area under the curve fig c not surprisingly tools designed to identify heterozygotes in diploid genomes were missing most mutations gatk whereas tools dedicated to tumor normal pairs performed better varscan and mutect to estimate the impact of coverage depth we selected reads from the mix sample down to or and respectively of the maximum as expected the sensitivity decreased equally for all the tools considered to expand the performance evaluation to additional_mutations and experimental_conditions we prepared a set of tns pairs by mixing reads obtained from sequencing normal dna using these we interrogated unique somatic_mutations between and per pair at an allelic fraction of or pairs each mutascope was more accurate to detect mutations at an allelic fraction of rather than and in the former case its performance was comparable with mutect and superior to varscan or lofreq finally we tested the effect of the empirical filters applied by each tool after the classification these filters are important to eliminate false_positives resulting from unpredictable sources of error and not accounted for by the statistical_model although mutascopes filters such as the read group bias and non specific amplification are specifically compatible with amplicons sequencing we adjusted the parameters of the other tools to ensure a fair comparison such as strand bias and minimum alternate allele_frequency filters when applied to the mutations at low allelic fraction in the mix samples these filters increase the sensitivity and positive_predictive and supplementary discussion the set of high_confidence filters from mutect affects the sensitivity the most this observation highlights synergies between mutascopes two core statistical components the experimentally driven mutation detection binomial_test and tumornormal comparison fisher test resulting in a superior_performance therefore by design mutascope specifically optimizes the mutation detection and filtering for deep amplicon_sequencing the resulting higher accurate detection of somatic_mutations at lowallelic fraction increases utility
