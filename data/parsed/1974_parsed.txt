generalized empirical bayesian_methods for discovery of differential data in high_throughput biology motivation high_throughput data are now commonplace in biological_research rapidly_changing technologies and application mean that novel methods for detecting differential behaviour that account for a large p small n setting are required at an increasing rate the development of such methods is in general being done on an ad_hoc basis requiring further development cycles and a lack of standardization between analyses results we present here a generalized method for identifying differential behaviour within high_throughput through empirical bayesian_methods this approach is based on our bayseq algorithm for identification of differential_expression in rna_seq based on a negative_binomial and in paired data based on a beta binomial_distribution here we show how the same empirical bayesian_approach can be applied to any parametric distribution removing the need for lengthy development of novel methods for differently distributed data comparisons with existing_methods developed to address specific problems in high_throughput show that these generic methods can achieve equivalent or better performance a number of enhancements to the basic algorithm are also presented to increase flexibility and reduce computational costs availability_and the methods are implemented in the r bayseq v package available on bioconductorhigh throughput data are becoming ubiquitous in biological_research and numerous statistical_techniques have been developed to analyze these data often to identify patterns of difference between sets of biological_replicates microarray_technology led to a proliferation of methods designed to analyze data with many features i e genes but few biological_replicates the large p small n problem under an assumption of log normality the subsequent emergence of count_data from high_throughput hts experiments motivated the development of analysis methods which generally assume some form of over dispersed poisson_distribution the majority of these analytic_methods seek not merely to adjust for the high_dimensionality of the data but to exploit it through various forms of information borrowing across the p dimension however many of the methods developed achieve this borrowing of information by exploiting specific features of the data consequently while the methods developed for analysis of negative binomially distributed hts_data are conceptually similar to those previously_developed for analysis of log normally distributed data their implementation is very different novel technologies for high_throughput generation of biological data may require different distributional assumptions to current methods complete analyses of single_cell seem likely to require novel distributional assumptions as do analyses of high_throughput quantitative_proteomic and metabolomic_data in addition complex experimental_designs are producing diverse types of data from a single_organism which require the development of methods for multi_dimensional and integrative analyses while some of these challenges are beginning to be addressed this is being done on an ad_hoc basis requiring further development cycles and a lack of standardization between analyses we present here a generalized method for identifying differential behaviour applicable to high_throughput data of any type this approach is based on our bayseq algorithm initially_developed for identification of differential_expression in rna_seq using a negative_binomial and later adapted to paired data using a beta binomial_distribution these algorithms extended the method of parametric empirical_bayes point estimation by using multiple point estimators sampled across the large p dimension to approximate a distribution on the hyper parameters of the data here we show that this empirical bayesian_approach bayseq v is applicable to any parametric distribution removing the need for time consuming development of novel methods for each new type of data this generalization allows differential behaviour to be identified in any class or combination of classes of biomolecular event detectable by the application of high_throughput here we define biomolecular event to describe a biomolecular process producing a measurable signal with the potential to vary between experimental_conditions this may involve measurement of levels of biomolecules for example mrna seq or high_throughput modifications to biomolecules for example methyl seq and chip_seq or levels of interaction between biomolecules for example ribo seq to assess the utility of this approach we consider analyses on microarray_data assumed to be log normally distributed and simulated zero inflated negative_binomial data distributions novel to the empirical bayesian_approach here described we compare the performance of bayseq v to specific methods developed for analyses of such data in identifying differential_expression comparisons on over dispersed poisson data are largely superfluous since bayseq was originally designed for such data and extensive independent comparisons have already been carried_out nevertheless to demonstrate that the performance of bayseq v has not been degraded by the generalization we include a re analysis of thedata in supplementary we additionally demonstrate the capability of bayseq v to perform various novel analyses on a complex set of rna_seq from matched tissue_sampling in four age_groups of rat code examples describing these analyses are included in supplementary s
