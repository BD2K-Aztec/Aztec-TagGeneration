visual workflows for c metabolic_flux motivation the precise quantification of intracellular metabolic flow_rates is of fundamental_importance in bio techno logy and medical_research the gold_standard in the field is metabolic_flux mfa with c labeling experiments c mfa workflows orchestrate several mainly human in the loop software applications integrating them with plenty of heterogeneous information in practice this had posed a major practical barrier for evaluating interpreting and understanding isotopic data from carbon labeling experiments results graphical modeling interactive model exploration and visual data analysis are the key to overcome_this we have developed a first of its kind graphical tool suite providing scientists with an integrated software framework for all aspects of c mfa almost modules plug_ins have been implemented for the omix visualization software several advanced graphical workflows and ergonomic user_interfaces support major domain specific modeling and proofreading tasks with that the graphical suite is a productivity enhancing tool and an original educational training instrument supporting the adoption of c mfa applications in all life_science fields availability the omix light edition is freely_available www omixthe presented comprehensive plug in suite for the omix visualization software complements the recently_published cflux software and graphically supports the complete well established c mfa workflow the new look and feel enables experimentalists who are not familiar with programming or scripting to use the c mfa computational machinery immediately the classical command_line orientation of c mfa tools has thus become history although certain special requirements still might require a scripted solution at the time of writing omix plugins can be orchestrated to tailored evaluation workflows cf supplementaryand supplementary table s these plug_ins have been extensively tested and used in several c mfa studies with toy examples as well as with realistically complex real_life examples as a typical use case the developed suite is used to analyze a variety of corynebacterium_glutamicum strains for a broad range of dilution rates and bioreactor working volumes unpublished_data once a reference network model was set up datasets were quickly processed and visually evaluated with no overhead resulting flux maps were visualized with a tailored ovl script e g making it easy for the experimentalist to comparatively assess and characterize the cles according to their biological analytical and experimental reproducibility with that an in depth understanding of experimental and biological robustness of c glutamicum is conveyed in similar studies the graphical workflows was found to strongly reduce the development time for flux models and ease serial yet interactive fluxome analyses equally_important the graphical look and feel makes it much easier for c mfa newcomers to get started therewith our graphical suite delivers productivityenhancing tools that accelerate c mfa learning execution and dissimilation processes apart from practical issues the implementation of a complete graphical tool suite supporting c mfa is not just a simple wysiwyg task a collection of innovative ideas and algorithms were developed to exploit the potential of interactive graphical visualization non trivial domain specific yet universal algorithmic solutions are the derivation of cams from information contained in databases full copy paste functionality and compatibility of cams graphical proofreading and editing of cams interactive determination of free flux sets threedimensional representation and exploration of carbon labeling networks interactive path tracing as well as the automatic generation and drawing of mixture diagrams cf supplementary for a complete list although bare simulation times at present are in the range of milliseconds for single simulation runs extensive analyses should preferably be distributed to dedicated computing_resources purchase on demand compute models are an option for largescale c mfa workflows future work will be dedicated to alleviating post_processing tasks on distributed hpc resources to meet the increasing need for real_time accessibility and the control of fluxomics workflows which undoubtedly presents new challenges for our visual workflow
