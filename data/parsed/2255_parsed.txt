systems_biology hypermodules identifying clinically and phenotypically significant network modules with disease mutations for biomarker_discovery correlating disease mutations with clinical and phenotypic_information such as drug response or patient_survival is an important goal of personalized cancer_genomics and a first step in biomarker_discovery hypermodules is a network search algorithm that finds frequently mutated gene_modules with significant clinical or phenotypic signatures from biomolecular interaction networks establishing functional links between genetic_variation and human disease is a key goal of cancer_genome and genome_wide complex_diseases like cancer are often driven by infrequent changes in multiple genes in pathways network_analysis helps interpret mutations in systems context and find disease genes pathways and biomarkers for precision_medicine discovery of modules subnetworks in biological_networks helps isolate systems with disease related properties and reduces interactome complexity a growing number of methods are available for this purpose a landmark paper combines gene_expression with proteinprotein_interactions ppi to find predictive modules of cancer outcome the netbag method studies genetic_associations and copy_number to find autism related modules hotnet detects frequently mutated pathways in networks net cox builds prognostic cancer signatures in network_analysis of gene_expression data the reactome fi cytoscape_plugin uncovers prognostic gene_modules from networks and gene_expression data network based stratification predicts tumor_subtypes from mutations in network regions such modules maximize a feature of genes such as differential_expression disease mutation_frequency or enrichment of interactions because clinical profiles of patients are increasingly available in cancer_genomics efforts such as the the cancer_genome tcga pan cancer project new methods are needed to discover multivariate biomarkers in networks we recently analyzed cancer mutations in phosphorylation signaling and found that kinasesubstrate networks are informative of patient_survival and therapy response in particular we found network modules with rare_mutations in ovarian_cancer patients with improved_prognosis we created the hypermodules method to systematically discover clinically correlated modules from gene and protein networks based on our earlier work on functional subnetwork discovery here we present the previously unavailable software in open_source java as a command_line for automated work and a cytoscape app for interactive graphical_analysis type of clinical analysis and columns in data table survival time or variable such as tumor_relapse survival analysis requires follow_up time and vital_status of patients detected modules are studied further with network_visualization survival_curves and data export we tested hypermodules on protein networks to find survival modules with cancer mutations we extracted three human ppi_networks of variable size from irefweb and five cancer mutation datasets from the international cancer genome consortium portal version supplementary for example network_analysis of interactions with liver_cancer patients mutated genes and permutations takes min on an core computer with gb ram hypermodules is thus applicable to a range of networks and mutation datasets hypermodules is a biological_network mining algorithm that reveals modules of interacting genes with clinically informative disease mutations diverse biomolecular interaction networks can be analyzed including ppi_networks gene_regulatory and curated biological_pathways disease mutations are also broadly_defined although we initially studied cancer point_mutations other types of alterations such as copy_number and gene_expression changes can be used hypermodules finds correlations with groups of genes where mutations may be infrequent but the signature strengthens through network integration such modules are not often directly usable as biomarkers because of small_sample however we believe that our approach_helps discover genes and pathways as potential multivariate biomarkers for further experiments
