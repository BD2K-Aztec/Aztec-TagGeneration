structural_bioinformatics improving the accuracy of the structure_prediction of the third hypervariable loop of the heavy_chains of antibodies motivation antibodies are able to recognize a wide_range of antigens through their complementary determining regions formed by six hypervariable loops predicting the d structure of these loops is essential for the analysis and reengineering of novel antibodies with enhanced_affinity and specificity the canonical structure model allows high_accuracy prediction for five of the loops the third loop of the heavy_chain h is the hardest to predict because of its diversity in structure length and sequence_composition results we describe a method based on the random_forest automatic learning technique to select structural templates for h loops among a dataset of candidates these can be used to predict the structure of the loop with a higher accuracy than that achieved by any of the presently available methods the method also has the advantage of being extremely fast and returning a reliable estimate of the model quality availability_and the source_code is freely_available atantibodies are a class of y shaped proteins produced by b cells that the immune system uses to identify and neutralize foreign pathogens such as bacteria and viruses they have the remarkable ability to recognize virtually any foreign targets the antigens and bind to these with extraordinary affinity and specificity these characteristics make antibodies an ideal tool for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as cancer infectious and cardiovascular_diseases arthritis inflammation immune_disorders as well as for biotechnological_applications knowing the structure of antibodies is clearly instrumental for gaining insights into the biological_phenomena of the antibodyantigen recognition as well as to interpret clinical data and rationally redesign the molecule for medical and biotechnological purposes antibodies are composed of two identical heavy and light_chain pairs the antigen binding_site present on the upper tips of the y shape is formed by six hypervariable hv loops also referred to as the complementary determining regions cdrs three of the loops belong to the variable_domain of the light_chain l l and l and three to the variable_domain of the heavy_chain h h and h the variability in these cdr loops in terms of loop length and amino_acid is the main_reason of the antibody capability to bind many different antigens the framework regions of antibodies are fairly well conserved while the structural_variations occur mostly in the cdr loops we and others have developed effective methods to predict the structure of antibodies the strategy consists of modeling the framework by homology while the prediction of five of the six loops is based on the canonical structure cs model that states that these loops the light_chains loops and the h and h loops of the heavy_chain can only assume a limited number of conformations and that these are determined by the presence of key_residues in specific positions in the sequence of the antibody according to a recent blind assessment of the prediction_accuracy of antibody modeling a good prediction can be obtained for non h loops with an average root_mean rmsd of their c atoms close to a only a partial cs model exists for the h loop which allows the prediction of the structure of its four n_terminal and six c terminal residues closer to the framework accordingly the prediction_accuracy for h loops is not equally satisfactory as for the other loops an important drawback because the h loop is central in the binding_site and therefore often essential in determining the antibodyantigen interactions in the above_mentioned assessment none of the tested methods was able to provide sufficiently good predictions for h the average rmsd for the best methods was a the high variability in length structure and sequence of this loop is usually invoked as the main_reason behind the difficulty of predicting its structure ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as to whom correspondence should be

medium provided the original_work for commercial reuse please_contact permissions_oup comthere have been several attempts to develop methods for predicting the structure of h loops both template based and template free methods that try to predict the structure using ab_initio conformation searches followed by ranking based on energy estimates and clash avoidance one of the most used approaches for antibody structure_prediction is rosetta antibody ra which combines template selections with ab_initio cdr h loop modeling using loop fragments and simultaneous optimization of the cdr loop conformations and variable light vl variable heavy vh orientations another interesting approach is fread which attempts to predict antibody loops using local similarities local sequence and geometric matches fread uses environment specific substitution scores to identify the best fragments for building the structure of the loops each of the previous_approaches has its own disadvantages and limitations and this prompted us to develop the method described here one of the main limitations of ab_initio approaches e g ra is due to our incomplete understanding of the physicochemical principles_governing protein_structures which leads to the employment of pseudo energy approximate functions that are not always accurate in distinguishing correct predictions in addition ab_initio approaches tend to have high_computational on the other hand the available homologybased methods such as fread s suffer from being essentially dependent on the h sequence alone that has proven to be insufficient to provide accurate_models especially for longer loops the confread method tried to overcome_this by including contact profile information however this only led to minor improvements obtained at the expense of a much lower coverage given the central_position of the h region in the antigenbinding site there are several interactions with the other cdr loops as well as with the framework that could affect the conformation of h in line with this hypothesis we developed a method that takes_advantage of sequence_similarity and structural related features e g cs as well as a score reflecting the likelihood of the presence absence of specific interactions between the h residues and the rest of the modeled antibody structure we used a set of selected_features to train a random_forest rf machine_learning algorithm to select the closest loop among a dataset of h loops present in immunoglobulins of known structure the best predicted template s are used to build the structure of h that are subsequently ranked according to their intramolecular interactions we tested our model on the ra benchmark we used of the structures in the benchmark excluding the pdb ai case because in ra benchmark the h loop was uncorrectly reported as a six residue loop and our results are more accurate than those provided by ra considered the best method available at present on the same benchmark we also tested our method on recently deposited structures of antibodies with equally satisfactory_results last but not least the described method requires substantially less computing time with respect to the ra on average min
