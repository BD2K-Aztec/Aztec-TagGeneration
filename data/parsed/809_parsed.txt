systems_biology boolesim an interactive boolean_network simulator sinceintroduced boolean_networks for biological simulations they are extensively used to describe dynamic_network behavior especially when networks are big experimental_data scarce or only qualitatively available i e cell_cycle signaling or stem_cell boolean_networks can be visualized as a graph consisting of a set of nodes representing the species of the network plus a set of edges representing the interactions between these species in boolean_networks nodes can only take the discrete values and biological_entities are thus exclusively viewed as active or inactive phosphorylated or unphosphorylated expressed or not expressed and nothing in between this is a simplification of reality as biochemical species can be present in a continuous range of concentrations however signals are often transmitted via threshold crossings thus it is often appropriate to discriminate between two statesbelow and above the threshold which have different qualitative characteristics transitions between these states are defined by boolean logical operations that can account for activation inhibition and more complicated cooperative interactions thus the use of boolean_networks in mathematical_modeling of biological_processes is justifiable by its practicality although software_packages such as boolnet for r mussel or booleannet for python are available to simulate and analyze boolean_networks these packages require downloading installation and a certain basic_knowledge of programing moreover manipulating dynamic inactive node states beneath its graphical_representation of the time course the time series heatmap functionality is also helpful e g to identify cyclic attractors to enhance interoperability boolesim supports exporting networks to python booleannet or r boolnet formats export to and reimport from biographers internal exchange format jsbgn allowing storing the graph alongside its update rules together in one file the network graph and time series can also be saved as svg vector image to demonstrate our tool we imported a submodel of a published probabilistic boolean_network pbn describing epigenetic and transcriptional dynamics in somatic_cell reprograming to transform the pbn into a deterministic boolean_network we combined the update rules with the highest probability for every species results are shown in the time series represents a reprograming process i e the transition from a differentiated cell_lineage a to the pluripotent cell state and the minimal set of manipulations that were effected to enable this transition with the simplified synchronous boolean_network see we presented a boolean modeling tool that is easy to use and provides users with a qualitative insight into dynamic_behavior of biological_networks as the first tool for that purpose it has inbrowser functionality and works cross_platform it enables userswithout the need for downloading but simply by opening their browser chromium recommended and visiting the web_site rumo biologie hu berlin de boolesim to load their network and perform simulations and manipulations through clicking on the colored nodes boolesim is completely open_source and licensed under the free software license gnu affero general_public gpl version source_code and off line version are available on the github repository https github com matthiasbock boolesim in the future boolesim could be extended to include stochasticity through asynchronous or pbns to find attractors or to represent state spaces
