data_and pugsvm a cabig tm analytical tool for multiclass gene_selection and predictive classification phenotypic up regulated gene support_vector pugsvm is a cancer biomedical_informatics grid cabig tm analytical tool for multiclass gene_selection and classification pugsvm addresses the problem of imbalanced class separability small_sample and high gene space dimensionality where multiclass gene markers are defined by the union of one versus everyone phenotypic upregulated genes and used by a well matched one versus rest support_vector pugsvm provides a simple yet more accurate strategy to identify statistically reproducible mechanistic marker_genes for characterization of heterogeneous_diseases microarray_gene studies provide new opportunities for the molecular characterization of heterogeneous_diseases multiclass gene_selection is an imperative task for identifying phenotype associated mechanistic genes and achieving accurate diagnostic classifications most existing multiclass gene_selection methods heavily rely on the direct extensions of two class gene_selection methods however simple extensions of binary discriminant_analysis to multiclass gene_selection are suboptimal and not well matched to the unique characteristics of a multicategory classification_problem specifically the existing_methods will select gene subsets that preserve the distances of well separated classes while likely create error_prone large overlap between neighboring classes in phenotypic up regulated gene support_vector pugsvm see schematic flowchart and mathematic descriptions to whom correspondence should be addressed of the method in the supplementary_material we select genes that are highly_expressed in one phenotype relative to each of the remaining phenotypes namely one versus everyone phenotypic up regulated_genes ovepug ovepug provides evenhanded gene resources for discriminating both neighboring and well separated classes and intends to assure the statistical reproducibility and biological_plausibility of the selected genes ovepug is well suited for small_sample problems a concern with many current microarray_datasets we also implement other competing peer methods for multiclass gene_selection including signal_to snr t statistic t stat pooled ratio of between groups to withingroups sum of squares bw and svm based recursive_feature svmrfe in the classification component of pugsvm we implement the ovrsvm committee classifier which has proved highly_successful in multicategory classifications with finite or limited amounts of high_dimensional in real_world applications we also include several other popular multicategory classifiers including k nearest neighborhood knn nave_bayes classifier nbc and ovosvm pugsvm was developed through the cabig cabig nci nih gov in silico research_centers of excellence isrce effort and offers users across the broader cancer research_community a unique yet effective tool for identifying multiclass gene markers and predicting clinical_outcomes in cancer treatment pugsvm is an open_source software_package the java and matlab codes and documents are freely_available at the authors web_site enabling users to easily modify the program and add new functions or extensions http www cbil ece vt edu cabig pugsvm htm pugsvm is a comprehensive open_source tool that consists of interconnected components for multiclass gene_selection and predictive classification the core algorithms in the package are ovepug and ovrsvm which address several critical yet subtle issues in molecular characterization of heterogeneous_diseases for both biological_research and clinical_applications pugsvm emphasizes the statistical reproducibility of the selected gene markers under small_sample supported by their biologically_plausible interpretations several competing gene_selection and classification methods are also incorporated into the package to demonstrate the superior_performance of pugsvm via objective comparisons through the cabig isrce effort we plan to adapt pugsvm to identify gene markers as druggable targets and predict breast_cancer resistance and recurrence after tamoxifen treatment we have established several workflow pipelines for using pugsvm for example we first download breast_cancer gene_expression from tcga and g doc and then normalize and label the data using cabig tools such as genepattern we feed the processed data to pugsvm the gene_candidates identified by pugsvm will be sent to visual statistical data analyzer for visualization mapping onto known signaling_pathways and further analysis we are currently working to create taverna workflow modules for all analyses and making them publicly_available to the cancer community
