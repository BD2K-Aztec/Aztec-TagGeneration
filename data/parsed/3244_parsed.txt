systems_biology neural fate decisions mediated by trans activation and cis inhibition in notch_signaling motivation in the developing nervous_system the expression of proneural genes i e hes neurogenin ngn and deltalike dll oscillates in neural_progenitors with a period of h but is persistent in post_mitotic neurons unlike the synchronization of segmentation clocks oscillations in neural_progenitors are asynchronous between cells it is known that notch_signaling in which notch in a cell can be activated by dll in neighboring_cells trans activation and can also be inhibited by dll within the same cell cis inhibition is important for neural fate decisions there have been extensive studies of trans activation but the operating mechanisms and potential implications of cis inhibition are less clear and need to be further investigated results in this article we present a computational_model for neural fate decisions based on intertwined dynamics with trans activation and cis inhibition involving the hes notch and dll proteins in agreement with experimental_observations the model_predicts that both trans activation and cis inhibition play_critical regulating the choice between remaining as a progenitor and embarking on neural_differentiation in particular trans activation is essential for generation of oscillations in neural_progenitors and cis inhibition is important for the asynchrony between adjacent cells indicating that the asynchronous oscillations in neural_progenitors depend on cooperation between trans activation and cis inhibition in contrast cis inhibition plays more critical roles in embarking on neural_differentiation by inactivating intercellular notch_signaling the model presented here might be a good candidate for providing the first qualitative mechanism of neural fate decisions mediated by both trans activation and cis inhibition in the developing mammalian nervous_system it has been shown that the expression of proneural genes i e hes ngn and dll oscillates in neural_progenitors however in immature post_mitotic to whom correspondence should be addressed neurons hes is downregulated but ngn and dll are upregulated in a sustained manner suggesting that oscillatory versus sustained expression of proneural genes is critical for neural fate decisions additionally notch_signaling via intercellular_communication also plays_important neural fate decisions i e activation of notch_signaling prevents cells from differentiating and plays_a in maintaining neural_progenitor populations during development intercellular_communication via notch_signaling is involved in a wide_variety of processes and generally controls binary fate decisions between neighboring_cells ligandreceptor trans interactions i e interactions between neighboring_cells results in trans activation and release of the notch_intracellular ligandreceptor interactions also take place within the same cell i e cis interaction which induces the inactivation of notch by a process called cis inhibition both trans activation and cis inhibition have emerged as key regulatory_mechanisms in both vertebrates and invertebrates del trans activation has been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically especially in the control of vertebrate neurogenesis and somite formation in contrast the operating mechanisms and potential implications of cis inhibition are less clear and need to be further investigated analyzing cell_fate based on both transactivation and cis inhibition may have a broad impact on our system level understanding of notch_signaling and will be an important topic for future exploration both oscillation and synchronization of clock_genes induced by intercellular notch_signaling are necessary for normal segmentation however oscillations in neural_progenitors are asynchronous between neighboring_cells progenitor_cells tend to asynchronously differentiate into diverse cell_types so that they can respond differently to the same environmental condition and thereby contribute to generation of diversity in the developing_brain both experiments and computational_models have shown that intercellular notch_signaling can successfully lead to synchronized segmentation clocks however synchronization cannot be realized despite the existence of intercellular notch_signaling in neural_progenitors it has been speculated thatin contrast to the results of the substantial studies on trans activation between dll and notch the operating mechanisms and potential implications of cis inhibition are less clear in this article we present a computational_model for neural fate decisions based on intertwined dynamics with trans activation and cis inhibition involving the hes notch and dll proteins the model_predicts that both trans activation and cis inhibition play_critical neural fate decisions and therefore provides a good framework for the theoretical_analysis of the mechanisms_underlying neural fate decisions mediated by both trans activation and cis inhibition
