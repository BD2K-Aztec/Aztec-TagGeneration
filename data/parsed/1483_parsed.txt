druge_rank improving drug_target interaction prediction of new candidate_drugs or targets by ensemble learning to rank motivation identifying drugtarget_interactions is an important task in drug_discovery to reduce heavy time and financial cost in experimental way many computational_approaches have been proposed although these approaches have used many different principles their performance is far from satisfactory especially in predicting drugtarget_interactions of new candidate_drugs or targets methods approaches based on machine_learning for this problem can be divided_into two types feature_based and similarity based_methods learning to rank is the most powerful technique in the feature based_methods similarity based_methods are well accepted due to their idea of connecting the chemical and genomic spaces represented by drug and target similarities respectively we propose a new method druge_rank to improve the prediction_performance by nicely combining the advantages of the two different types of methods that is druge_rank uses ltr for which multiple well known similarity based_methods can be used as components of ensemble learning the identification of drugtarget_interactions is a crucial process in drug_discovery which can facilitate the understanding of drug action_mechanism disease_pathology and drug side effect using biochemical_experiments to identify these interactions is a reliable yet expensive_and approach in fact the cost of developing a new fda_approved drug has doubled every years since with only around drugs approved by fda per year furthermore there exist a huge number of unexplored compounds and human proteins which makes it impossible to examine their interactions effectively by experimental_approaches for instance there are over million chemical_compounds in pubchem database and only less than have proteinidentifying drugtarget_interactions of new unknown drugs or targets is a very challenging_task where interactions of new drugs or targets are unavailable previous methods can be divided_into two groups feature and similarity based_methods druge_rank incorporates the outputs of similarity based_methods as features to improve the prediction_performance this point has not been considered in any existing work including those using ltr our experimental_results clearly demonstrated that the novel combination of similarity and feature based_methods such as druge_rank is significantly better than independent approaches moreover drugerank provides a robust framework to integrate other types of information to improve the accuracy of drugtarget_interaction prediction compared with drug and target features pair features from the similarity based component methods are the key to improve the performance of druge_rank a common_assumption behind similaritybased methods is that similar drugs targets are likely to interact with similar targets drugs we validated this assumption in drugbank data analysis in addition we compared the drugs highly predicted by component methods directly confirming that component methods in druge_rank can provide diverse results and are complement to each other this must contribute to the performance improvement of druge_rank currently we select the component methods by considering their accuracy diversity and efficiency with the increase of possible component methods an interesting problem would be how to automatically choose the most suitable component methods we found that identifying interactions of new drugs is more difficult than the one of new targets which is consistent with previous study this suggests that the action_mechanism of drug is complicated where one drug may have multiple types of targets and sometimes similar drugs may have different mechanisms in this case druge_rank would be particularly useful since drugerank can integrate the diverse component methods effectively for better performance in fact the performance improvement over the component methods by druge_rank for a new drug is much higher than the one for a new target another interesting discovery is that relative low prediction_performance on fda experimental drugs one main_reason is that the ratio of drugtarget_interaction for experimental drugs is much lower than the one for fda_approved training data many non interaction pairs might be false_negatives druge_rank can be used to predict top drugtarget_pairs as the promising candidates for further experimental_verification we have developed druge_rank to improve the performance of predicting drugtarget_interactions of new drugs or targets the idea of druge_rank are three folds i the problem of predicting drugtarget_interactions can be modeled as a multilabel classification task ii this problem can be suitably solved by using ltr a powerful feature_based machine_learning approach which converts multilabel classification to label ranking iii the outputs of cutting_edge similarity based machine_learning can be features like drug and target features all being able to be the input of ltr druge_rank outperformed all competing_methods in both cross_validation and several independent test scenarios which demonstrate the predictive advantage of druge_rank in addition in contrast to previous_studies with a small number of targets all known interactions in drugbank have been used in this work indicating the thoroughness and validity of our results overall we believe that this highperformance software druge_rank will contribute to the development of pharmaceutical sciences and relevant industry
