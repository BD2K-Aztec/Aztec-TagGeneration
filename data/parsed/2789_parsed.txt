manipulation of fastq data with galaxy here we describe a tool suite that functions on all of the commonly known fastq format variants and provides a pipeline for manipulating next_generation data taken from a sequencing machine all the way through the quality filtering steps availability_and this open_source toolset was implemented in python and has been integrated into the online data analysis platform galaxy public web access http usegalaxy org download http getgalaxy org two short movies that highlight the functionality of tools described in this manuscript as well as results from testing components of this tool suite against a set of previously_published files are available atthe proliferation of next_generation has created numerous data management and analysis issues the most troubling of these issues stems from the lack of standardized sequencer output and tools the de facto standard fastq comes in a number of distinct variants causing much of the difficulty experienced by biologists when working with next_generation data the first steps following data_acquisition involve preparing and quality checking the produced sequencing_data these steps typically follow the workflow i parsing sequencer output ii calculating and iii visualizing summary_statistics on quality_scores and nucleotide distributions iv trimming reads if necessary and v filtering reads by quality_score and other various manipulations here we describe a set of tools able to handle all known fastq variants that has been integrated into the online data analysis platform galaxy http usegalaxy org allowing experimental biologists without any programming experience to easily manipulate to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as http galaxyproject org sequencing_data using a point and click interface this open_source toolkit has no known data size limitations and was implemented in python allowing true cross_platform availability all of the following tools unless mentioned otherwise are found under the next_generation ngs quality check qc and manipulation section within galaxy furthermore by integrating this toolset into galaxy researchers have access to a plethora of other genome_analysis software as well as a fully customizable workflow pipeline system and http galaxycast org are recommended for users to familiarize themselves with genome_analysis using galaxy
