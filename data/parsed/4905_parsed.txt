wegoloc accurate prediction of protein subcellular_localization using weighted gene_ontology we present an accurate and fast web_server wegoloc for predicting subcellular_localization of proteins based on sequence_similarity and weighted gene_ontology go information a term weighting method in the text categorization process is applied to go terms for a support_vector classifier as a result wegoloc surpasses the state of the art methods for previously used test datasets wegoloc supports three eukaryotic kingdoms animals fungi and plants and provides human specific analysis and covers several sets of cellular locations in addition wegoloc provides i multiple possible localizations of input protein s as well as their corresponding probability scores ii weights of go terms representing the contribution of each go term in the prediction and iii a blast e value for the best_hit with go terms if the similarity_score does not meet a given threshold an amino_acid based prediction is applied as a backup method availability wegoloc and users guide are freely_available at the website_http www btool org wegoloc
