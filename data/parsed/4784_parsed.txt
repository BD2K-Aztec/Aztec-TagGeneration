data_and undo a bioconductor r package for unsupervised deconvolution of mixed gene_expressions in tumor_samples we develop a novel unsupervised deconvolution method within a well grounded mathematical framework to dissect mixed gene_expressions in heterogeneous tumor_samples we implement an r package unsupervised deconvolution undo that can be used to automatically detect cell specific marker_genes mgs located on the scatter radii of mixed gene_expressions estimate cellular proportions in each sample and deconvolute mixed expressions into cell_specific profiles we demonstrate the performance of undo over a wide_range of tumorstroma mixing proportions validate undo on various biologically mixed benchmark gene_expression and further estimate tumor_purity in tcga cptac datasets the highly_accurate deconvolution results obtained suggest not only the existence of cell specific mgs but also undos ability to detect them blindly and correctly although the principal application here involves microarray gene_expressions our methodology can be readily applied to other types of quantitative molecular_profiling data availability_and undo is available at http biocon ductor org_packages tumorstroma interactions serve as both a major confounding_factor and an underexploited information_source in studying tumor and microenvironment although analyzing tumor_cells in their microenvironment provides the most relevant context mixed expressions cannot be resolved directly by global profiling experimental solutions to isolate pure cells are inconvenient and have many limitations current computational alternatives perform basically a supervised deconvolution where the required a priori information is often inaccurate or context dependent thus greatly limits supervised approaches supported by a well grounded mathematical framework we argue that both cell_specific profiles and mixing proportions can be estimated in a completely unsupervised mode from two or more heterogeneous_samples using raw measured gene_expression values fundamental to the success of our approach is the geometric identifiability of cell specific marker_genes mgs warranted by i non negativity of gene_expression values and ii co definition of distinct phenotypes and cellspecific mgs the unsupervised deconvolution undo r package adapts and extends recent unsupervised deconvolution framework in the literature using undo to dissect tumorstroma mixed gene_expressions we show that i the scatterplot of mixed cell expression_profiles is a compressed version of the scatterplot of pure cell expression_profiles ii resident genes on the two radii of scatter sector are cellspecific mgs and furthermore the two radius vectors defined by the mgs coincide with mixing proportions accordingly undo first detects mgs on the two radii of the scatter sector in tumor_samples then estimates cell proportions using standardized average expression values of mgs and finally uncovers pure cell expression_profiles by matrix inversion we demonstrate the performance of undo on both synthetic and benchmark real gene_expression with highly_accurate deconvolution results we further apply undo to estimate tumor_purity in three datasets from tcga the cancer_genome cptac clinical proteomic tumor analysis consortium and obtain highly comparable results with the estimates by bacom and absolute based on somatic copy_number data the undo software delivers a completely unsupervised deconvolution method for dissecting tumorstroma mixed gene_expressions supplementary tested on many benchmark_datasets undo is effective at detecting cell specific mgs and degs and estimating cell proportions and cell_specific profiles we expect undo method with a bioconductor r package to be a useful tool for extracting cellspecific molecular signals in studying tumorstroma interactions in many biological_contexts though the undo method currently works for two source mixtures only it is principally applicable to the situation where tumor or non tumor_tissue is assumed to have a common composition of cellular subtypes across the tumor_samples
