structural_bioinformatics protein peeling d new tools for analyzing protein_structures we present an improved version of our protein peeling web_server dedicated to the analysis of protein_structure architecture through the identification of protein units produced by an iterative splitting algorithm new features include identification of structural_domains detection of unstructured terminal elements and evaluation of the stability of protein unit structures availability the website is free and open to all users with no login requirements at http www dsimb inserm fr dsimb tools analyzing the architecture and organization of protein_structures is essential for understanding protein_flexibility folding functions and interactions we previously_proposed an innovative representation of protein architecture that gives a detailed_description of protein_structure anatomy proteins are split into sets of compact subregions called protein units pus a pu corresponds to one sequence fragment characterized by a high number of intra pu contacts and a low number of inter pu contacts contact probabilities between residues are computed as distances between c atoms using a logistic function using this contact probability matrix and an optimization procedure based on matthewss correlation_coefficient mcc between submatrices the algorithm defines optimal cutting points that separate the region examined into two or three pus this methodology is called protein peeling pp the process is iterated until the compactness of the pus reaches a given limit an index assesses the compactness quality and relative independence of each pu pus bridge the representation and description gap between secondary_structures and structural_domains pp is a useful tool for better understanding and analyzing the organization of protein_structures the pp web_server has been developed to accommodate advanced parameters here we present a new version of our pp web_server that offers substantial improvements and new features recognition of unstructured n or c terminal segments a novel scoring_function for pu characterization and identification of structural_domains to whom correspondence should be addressed
