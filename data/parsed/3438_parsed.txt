paspa a web_server for mrna poly a site predictions in plants and algae motivation polyadenylation is an essential process during eukaryotic gene_expression prediction of poly a sites helps to define the end of genes which is important for gene_annotation and elucidating gene_regulation mechanisms however due to limited knowledge of poly a signals it is still challenging to predict poly a sites in plants and algae paspa is a web_server for poly a site prediction in plants and algae which integrates many in house tools as add ons to facilitate poly a site prediction visualization and mining this server can predict poly a sites for ten species including seven previously poly a signal non characterized species with sensitivity and spe cificity in a range between and availability_and http bmi polyadenylation is one of the essential processes and a point of regulation for eukaryotic gene_expression this process involves the cleavage at the end of pre messenger_rna pre_mrna and the addition of a poly a tail a poly a site marks the end of a gene the recognition of which is important to fully understand the functions of genes and to accurately annotate the genomes given the connection between polyadenylation and transcription_termination correct identification of poly a sites would also predict where transcription_termination may occur moreover alternative_polyadenylation the use of different poly a sites of a gene has been recognized as an important gene_expression regulator in eukaryotes a number of computational_tools based on support_vector or discriminant_analysis have been developed to predict poly a sites or poly a signals in human including erpin polyar dragon polya spotter etc unlike human or animals where the dominant signal aauaaa is found in of poly a sites no highly_conserved poly a signal can be found in plants or algae there are subsequently fewer prediction_models available our group developed a poly a site prediction_tool called poly a site sleuth pass based on a generalized hidden_markov ghmm pass and its modified_version have been applied on the poly a site prediction for arabidopsis and rice respectively another classification based model called poly a site classifier pac was developed for green_alga also developed a classification based command_line called polya iep to predict poly a sites in arabidopsis to our knowledge most of the aforementioned tools were implemented as standalone programs with command_line interfaces seven of these species are previously non characterized in terms of their poly a signals and poly a sites for prediction purposes the positive data_set was generated from poly a sites in untranslated_regions utrs random_sequences and sequences from utrs or coding_sequences were used as control datasets described in supplementary section s part of the sequences in the known poly a site datasets were randomly_selected for model training part of the rest of the sequences from the positive ploy a datasets and the control datasets were used to estimate sensitivity sn and specificity sp described in supplementary section s similar to previous_studies a compromise between sn and sp was used to evaluate the model performance additional indexes including matthews correlation_coefficient the area under_the fmeasure were also employed for a more comprehensive evaluation of the performance cross value of sn and sp ranges from to the variation of performance among different species may due to the distinct set of poly a signals used in the respective species in addition compared with previous prediction_tool pass for arabidopsis and rice paspa obtains higher performance with better flexibility more details about the model evaluation are given in supplementary section s
