databases_and toxygates interactive toxicity analysis on a hybrid microarray and linked data platform motivation in early_stage drug_development it is desirable to assess the toxicity of compounds as quickly as possible biomarker genes can help predict whether a candidate drug will adversely_affect a given individual but they are often difficult to discover in addition the mechanism of toxicity of many drugs and common compounds is not yet well understood the japanese toxicogenomics project provides a large database of systematically collected microarray samples from rats liver kidney and primary_hepatocytes and human cells primary_hepatocytes after exposure to different compounds in different dosages and at different time intervals however until now no intuitive_user has been publically available making it time consuming and difficult for individual researchers to explore the data results we present toxygates a user_friendly integrated analysis platform for this database toxygates combines a large microarray_dataset with the ability to fetch semantic linked data such as pathways compoundprotein interactions and orthologs on demand it can also perform pattern based compound ranking with respect to the expression values of a set of relevant candidate_genes by using toxygates users can freely interrogate the transcriptomes response to particular compounds and conditions which enables deep exploration of toxicity mechanisms availability_and toxygates is freely_available to the public at http toxygates nibio toxicogenomics is one of several recent omics approaches to the safety_assessment of chemical_compounds in early_stage drug_development gene_expression analysis of animals target_organs after drug_administration can help assess potential toxicity before phenotypic appearance through the use of biomarker genes the japanese toxicogenomics project tgp an initiative that set out to collect a large amount of toxicogenomics data systematically began in as a joint govermentprivate sector project this project lasted for years ending in its first outcome was the original tg gates toxicogenomics project genomics assisted toxicity evaluation system which is not open to the public tg gates is a data storage and toxicity_assessment system for data analysis as part of the project in early most of the tgp data including the gene_expression biochemical blood and histopathological data as well as high_resolution images of in vivo organ samples were released to the public through the open tg gates otg web_site toxico nibio go jp however given the current form of otg it is not easy for users to explore these gene_expression data on their personal_computers because of the large amount of data as well as its static organization and raw format for example to extract correlations between gene_expression and variables such as time or dose level the user would have to download binary files in the affymetrix cel format extract human_readable expression values and perform tasks such as normalization before this kind of analysis could begin to make it more accessible we now introduce toxygates an integrated web_based user_friendly analysis platform the tgp data have been produced in accordance with wellplanned experimental_conditions there are two main types of data in vivo data and in vitro data the condition pattern of the in vivo data which was collected from rattus_norvegicus is the combination of four time points h h h h four dose levels control low middle high and two organs liver kidney these samples were taken after a single_dose of the studied compound was administered repeat dose data are also available for in vivo experiments in the case of repeat dose samples the parameters are identical to the single_dose ones except that the time points are days days days and days after the initial administration the condition pattern of the in vitro data available from r norvegicus and homo_sapiens is the combination of three time points h h h four dose levels control low middle high and one cell_type primary_hepatocytes these parameters potentially allow investigators to conduct not only classifier analysis but also time series analysis dose effect analysis and vivovitro bridging analysis the value of a particular dataset is greater if a larger number of perspectives on it are available it is simply possible to answer more questions when datasets can be related to each other to whom correspondence should be addressed clearly it is desirable to integrate otg with other datasets to the greatest possible extent in toxygates data such as pathways proteins and compound targets from a variety of databases are integrated and displayed alongside the microarray_data and the basic architecture is designed to allow for easy integration of additional data_sources in the future this is achieved in part by making use of linked semantic data in the resource description format rdf http www w org rdf rdf makes it easy to combine and evolve datasets in an ad_hoc fashion while still obtaining well defined results thus toxygates is a rich analysis platform that allows for easy investigation of the otg data offering several different kinds of analysis functions and data perspectives as well as extensible data_integration toxygates allows users to explore the available data interactively optionally downloading them at any stage of processing analysis begins by choosing a dataset a dataset is a group of related dna_microarrays targeting messenger_rna with a common species dose type single or repeat and organ if in vivo or in vitro cell_type for example one dataset would be rat in vivo liver single_dose rvls gives an overview of the six datasets in toxygates data are viewed from the perspective of sample groups we define a sample group as a collection of samples typically each experiment specified by a combination of the compound dose level and measurement time point was done in biological triplicate for the in vivo data and thus such a combination includes three samples microarrays for example a sample group can be defined as consisting of methapyrilene high_dose h and acetaminophen middle dose h in the rvls dataset this group would contain six samples three from each compound dose and time combination such groups can easily be contrasted with each other and genes can be analyzed for differential_expression microarray expression values are stored in a prenormalized format see methods for the normalization details and can easily be integrated with annotations from external datasets such as kyoto_encyclopedia kegg_pathways gene_ontology gene_ontology and chembl or drugbank compounds such annotations are obtained dynamically from linked data resource description format rdf endpoints these tools economize the researchers time and enable them to proceed to more detailed analysis more quickly we have described toxygates a novel user_friendly analysis platform for otg a comprehensive toxicogenomics database developed in japan during the span of years otg is in itself a resource of potentially great value for the understanding of toxicity mechanisms and the identification of biomarker genes assisting preclinical drug_development toxygates adds further value by making this data_collection accessible to a large number of individual researchers and users providing unique integrated analysis tools which include dynamic views of remote data as well as making data access simpler and easier than previously toxygates allows users to query otg both by going from compounds and experimental_conditions to relevant_genes and by going from relevant_genes to compounds although currently we place_greater the former style of investigation the current release of toxygates represents the first public release and we hope to make several improvements we aim to curate and expand the collection of remote rdf datasets that have been integrated as probe sources and as dynamic columns we also aim to integrate other gene_expression into toxygates finally we hope to provide additional valuable perspectives and data analysis methods in response to user feedback
