genome_analysis a wavelet_based method to exploit epigenomic language in the regulatory_region motivation epigenetic landscapes in the regulatory_regions reflect binding condition of transcription_factors and their co factors identifying epigenetic condition and its variation is important in understanding condition specific gene_regulation computational_approaches to explore complex multi_dimensional landscapes are needed results to study epigenomic condition for gene_regulation we developed a method awnfr to classify epigenomic landscapes based on the detected epigenomic landscapes assuming mixture of gaussians for a nucleosome the proposed method captures the shape of histone_modification and identifies potential regulatory_regions in the wavelet domain for accuracy estimation as well as enhanced computational speed we developed a novel algorithm based on down sampling operation and footprint in wavelet we showed the algorithmic advantages of awnfr using the simulated_data awnfr identified regulatory_regions more effectively and accurately than the previous_approaches with the epigenome data in mouse_embryonic and human lung fibroblast cells imr based on the detected epige nomic landscapes awnfr classified epigenomic status and studied epigenomic codes we studied co occurring histone_marks and showed that awnfr captures the epigenomic variation across time availability_and the source_code and supplemental document of awnfr are available atthe epigenetic landscapes represented by modifications to histones dna_methylation and other proteins that package the genome regulate the function of cells by activating or repressing gene activity the epigenetic landscapes drawn over the genome reflect the commitment of cells to a lineage and or response to the environmental changes histone codes representing combinatorial_effects of histone_modification tell how transcriptional apparatuses are used in a given cell_type environment at active promoters active marks including mono di and tri methylation of lys of h h_k showed strong signals chromatin_marks at the enhancers showed strong h_k and weak h_k histone acetylations are enriched both at active promoter and enhancer epigenetic variations reflected condition specific binding of transcription_factors tfs therefore identifying epigenomic condition in regulatory_regions is important to understand condition specific gene_regulation algorithmic development to exploit epigenomic landscapes is required for systematic analysis of cell_type gene_regulation here we present a method that explores multi_dimensional epigenomic landscapes using the wavelet transforms wts wavelet compromises between time and frequency based views of signal because of its property wavelet has been widely used in signal and image_processing in genome_wide study wavelet has been applied to analyzing dna_replication profile studying admixed population and analyzing protein or microarray_data also wavelet has been also applied for epigenomic data analysis we applied wavelet to idntify nucleosome given the multi_dimensional histone_modification data for accurate and fast performance we applied down sampling wt and wavelet footprint in modeling nucleosome awnfr identifies the position and the shape of nucleosomes after modeling a nucleosome with mixture of gaussians mogs the gapped region between two identified nucleosomes is defined as a nucleosome free region nfr using the shape of histone_modification captured in the wd we classified nfrs based on the epigenomic landscapes and interrogated the combination of histone_modification marks previously a number of algorithms were suggested to detect nfrs from histone_modification data a method_named nucleosome_positioning from sequencing nps was designed to predict nucleosome position nps used wt for denoising signal after modeling a nucleosome with laplacian of gaussian homer package is equipped with a function to predict nfrs normal uses gaussian_mixture to identify nucleosome position however these frameworks only allow one mark for the input and cannot be applied to detecting comprehensive epigenetic variation or code an hmm based_approach called chromia predicted regulatory_regions using epigenome data to whom correspondence should be addressed to show the algorithmic advantages of awnfr we evaluated the performance of hwm in both parameter_estimation and nfr detection first we compared hwm with dwt and dt cwt for enriched region detection also we compared dog with other competitors such as gass nps and canny for the parameter_estimation of mogs for real_data we compared the performance using histone_modifications in mesc and imr supplementarysummarizes the data we used to predict nfrs
