sequence_analysis provean web_server a tool to predict the functional effect of amino_acid and indels we present a web_server to predict the functional effect of single or multiple amino_acid insertions_and using the prediction_tool provean the server provides rapid analysis of protein variants from any organisms and also supports high_throughput analysis for human and mouse variants at both the genomic and protein levels availability_and the web_server is freely_available and open to all users with no login requirements at http provean large_scale genotyping and genome re sequencing_projects have generated a large amount of sequence variant data for healthy and diseased individuals in human and model_organisms sequence_variants may reside in the protein_coding or non coding_regions of the genome whereas non coding variants can potentially play a regulatory_role and affect_gene coding variants can affect protein_function and activity by altering the gene_product such as substitution insertion or deletion of amino_acids frameshift or truncation as the number of genome_wide variants is usually large it is a challenging_problem to identify the causal_variant for a disease or specific phenotype of interest for this purpose computational_tools such as polyphen and sift were developed to provide functional_predictions for coding variants since then many other tools have been developed until recently we have developed a new tool protein variation effect analyzer provean which uses an alignment based score approach unlike most existing_tools provean can generate predictions not only for single_amino but also for multiple amino_acid insertions and deletions using the same underlying scoring_scheme as the original provean web_server was limited to supporting the analysis of single protein queries we have expanded the provean web_server to support high_throughput online analysis using the provean tool the provean web_server can now provide precomputed prediction for large sets of genome_wide nucleotide or amino_acid variants for both human and mouse for the original single protein query function run time has been greatly_improved in the current new version by storing and reusing previously computed homologous protein_sequences supporting sequences information for query proteins to provide binary predictions the cutoff for provean scores was set to for high balanced accuracy however users can reapply their own cutoffs for their analysis to achieve either higher sensitivity or higher specificity the sensitivity_and obtained using different score cutoffs are shown in the supplementary_material supplementary it was shown that the performance of provean for single_amino is comparable with other tools here we also examine the prediction consistency with other tools sift and polyphen using the uniprot human polymorphisms and disease mutations dataset the three tools agree on a large portion of the variants but there are still many variants for which three tools make different predictions the results are summarized using venn diagrams in the supplementary_material supplementary
