high_throughput feature counting and measurement of roots the original roottrace tool has proved successful in measuring primary_root lengths across time series image data biologists have shown interest in using the tool to address further problems namely counting lateral_roots to use as parameters in screening studies and measuring highly curved roots to address this the software has been extended to count emerged lateral_roots and the tracking model extended so that strongly curved and agravitropic roots can be now be recovered here we describe the novel image_analysis algorithms and user_interface implemented within the roottrace framework to handle such situations and evaluate the results availability the software is open_source and available from http sourceforge net_projects roottrace high_throughput measurement of plant_roots is a key requirement in systems_biology the nature of biological_experiments means the observation of many plants is necessary in order to understand growth processes e g responses to stimuli and hormones traditionally changes in growth were monitored by manual measurement of plants today image_analysis algorithms are being developed which allow such measurements as root_length curvature and or architectural properties to be taken semi automatically from an image some software also enables multiple measurements on sequences of images with little interaction from the user such analysis opens_the to high_throughput quantification of plant_growth previous work has seen the release of such a tool roottrace which is able to measure primary length of many individual roots given standard digital_camera images of plants_grown on agar_plates in growth chambers as is common practice roottrace is able to record the growth of these roots over time lapse image_sequences it is also able to record the curvature properties of each root trace with user input only required on the first frame in this article we describe important extensions to the roottrace algorithms which additionally allow the counting of lateral_roots and a new tracking model which is able to track to whom correspondence should be addressed increasingly curved roots the addition of which allows different biological_questions to be answered both these extensions add to the high_throughput capabilities of the software the top_down model based_approach used by roottrace can now be intuitively tailored to meet the individual requirements of the biological data being analyzed a new gravity independent tracking framework has been included and a method of detecting lateral_roots on typically straighter roots has been implemented
