structural_bioinformatics esbmtools enhanced native_structure based modeling tools motivation molecular_dynamics simulations provide detailed insights into the structure and function of biomolecular systems thus they complement experimental_measurements by giving access to experimentally inaccessible regimes among the different molecular_dynamics techniques native_structure based models sbms are based on energy_landscape theory and the principle of minimal frustration typically used in protein and rna_folding simulations they coarse grain the biomolecular system and or simplify the hamiltonian resulting in modest computational requirements while achieving_high agreement with experimental_data esbmtools streamlines running and evaluating sbm in a comprehensive package and offers high_flexibility in adding experimental or bioinformatics derived restraints results we present a software_package that allows setting up modifying and evaluating sbm for both rna and proteins the implemented workflows include predicting protein_complexes based on bioinformatics derived inter protein contact_information a standardized setup of protein_folding simulations based on the common pdb format calculating reaction coordinates and evaluating the simulation by free_energy with weighted histogram_analysis method or by phi values the modules interface with the molecular_dynamics program gromacs the package is open_source and written in architecture independent python energy_landscape theory and the principle of minimal frustration stipulate that biomolecular evolution results in an effective overall bias of a macromolecules energy_landscape being funnelshaped toward its global minimum at the native folded_state native_structure based models sbms also often referred to as g o models realize an idealized minimally frustrated folding funnel devoid of any energetic traps by a simple hamiltonian that allows molecular_dynamics simulations to reach biologically_relevant timescale the sbm potential is based on the native folded structure and native contact_information the number of formed native contacts in a structure is the dominant reaction coordinate typically called q the q value can be used as a reaction coordinate to investigate folding paths or as an order_parameter for the weighted histogram_analysis method the sbm can be combined with coarse_graining approaches proteins can be represented by single beads at the positions of their c atoms accordingly there exist formulations of the sbm at an all atom and c graining level see supplementary_information bioinformatics derived contact_information or experimental_measurements can be added as restraints to sbm eventually the sbm defines a force_field that results in computationally_tractable simulations that facilitate simulations on the effective timescale of seconds for small proteins even on single cpus in combination with extensive sampling existing web based_solutions like the smog server allow a straightforward setup and evaluation of standard sbm our open_source esbmtools extends the customization options enabling the setup of automatized workflows and strong modifications of sbm by e g adding arbitrary additional contacts protein rna_structures novel ligand topologies or manipulating force_field
