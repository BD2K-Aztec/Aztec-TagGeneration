systems_biology a parallel algorithm to compute chemical organizations in biological_networks analysing genome_scale in silico models with stoichiometry based_methods is computationally_demanding the current_algorithms to compute chemical organizations in chemical reaction_networks are limited to small_scale networks prohibiting a thorough analysis of large models here we introduce a parallelized version of the constructive algorithm to determine chemical organizations the algorithm is implemented in the standard c programming_language and parallelized using the message_passing mpi protocol the resulting code can be executed on computer clusters making use of an arbitrary number of processors the algorithm is parallelized in an embarrassing parallel manner providing good scalability availability an implementation of the algorithm including source_code can be obtained fromstoichiometry based network_analysis methods like flux_balance elementary mode analysis and chemical organization analysis have proven useful in gaining a better understanding of the functioning of biochemical_systems at the systems level with the ongoing efforts to elucidate more and more biochemical details genome_scale have become available for an increasing number of organisms analysis of such networks with species and reaction numbers ranging in the thousands pose a new computational challange to meet this challange we introduce a parallelized version of the constructive algorithm to determine chemical organizations a chemical organization is a set of network species constituting a subsystem of the whole network that fulfills two properties i algebraic closure and ii self maintenance the first property ensures that the species of an organization cannot generate a species that is not already contained in that set while the second property ensures that a flux vectorthe computational time required to compute the organizations for a given reaction_network model does not solely depend on the network size but also its structure being np_hard the computation of all organizations will remain unfeasable for certain networks even when using the parallelized version of the algorithm on a computer cluster nevertheless the parallelized version reduces runtime to practical limits for large models especially if many cpusare available for example all connected organizations of three previously not tractable networks could be determined using the parallelized algorithm
