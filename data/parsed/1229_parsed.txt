data_and cyprules a rule_based p inhibition prediction server cytochrome_p cyps are the major enzymes involved in drug_metabolism and bio activation inhibition models were constructed for five of the most popular enzymes from the cyp superfamily in human liver the five enzymes chosen for this study namely cyp a cyp d cyp c cyp c and cyp a account for of the xenobiotic and drug_metabolism in human_body cyp enzymes can be inhibited or induced by various drugs or chemical_compounds in this work a rule_based cyp inhibition prediction online server cyprules was created based on predict ive models generated by the rule_based c algorithm cyprules can predict and provide structural rulesets for cyp inhibition for each compound uploaded to the server capable of fast execution performance it can be used for virtual high_throughput vhts of a large set of testing compounds availability_and cyprules is freely_accessible atamong cyp enzymes cyp a cyp c cyp c cyp d and cyp a are responsible for of drug oxidation or hydrolysis more than drugs have been identified in causing liver_injury making this the most common reason for a drug to be withdrawn from the market hepatotoxicity and drug_induced account for a substantial number of compounds failure highlighting the need for drug_screening assays capable of detecting potential compound toxicity early in the drug_development processes previous cyp prediction_models or prediction servers were either based on a small number of compounds screened with non rule based_approaches that could not suggest structural rules directly contributing to specific p or only gives yes no classification results in this study we chose five of the most common p enzymes to build their corresponding inhibition prediction_models with compounds the goals are i to first build statistically high performance d and d qsar_models utilizing rule_based c algorithm as a prediction_tool to provide structural_information that contribute towards p inhibition endpoints in a faster and more direct manner compared with other machine_learning ii and then provide a simple easy to use and freely_available web_server for quick assessment of compound inhibitions towards the five major cyp enzymes the best c models for each cyp enzymes after considering different combination of descriptor sets are listed in with classification_accuracy ranging from to and g mean ranging from to when compared with the other two freely_available cyp prediction servers metapred and whichcyp cyprules outperformed in most cyp isoforms accuracy values of and for metapred and and for whichcyp isoforms a c c d and a respectively most importantly metapred and whichcyp only give yes no classification results but cyprules can further provide detailed structural_information that can be used as guidelines to refine drug_candidates because the cyp d dataset is highly imbalanced compared with other cyp datasets cyp d inhibitors were the most difficult to predict in all previous_studies it is worth noting that our reported cyp d inhibition classification model outperformed all of the previous_studies with accuracy the detailed_description for cyp d model construction was described in supplementary_file
