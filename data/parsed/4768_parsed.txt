genetics_and twophaseind an r package for estimating gene treatment interactions and discovering predictive_markers in randomized_clinical in randomized_clinical identifying baseline genetic or genomic markers for predicting subgroup treatment effects is of rising interest outcome dependent sampling is often employed for measuring markers the r package twophaseind implements a number of efficient statistical_methods we developed for estimating subgroup treatment effects and genetreatment interactions exploiting the genetreatment independence dictated by randomization including the case only estimator the maximum estimated likelihood estimator and the semiparametric maximum_likelihood for parameters in a logistic_model for rare failure events subject to cen soring we have proposed efficient augmented case only designs a variation of the casecohort design to estimate genetic_associations and subgroup treatment effects in a cox_regression the r package is computationally scalable to genome_wide studies as illustrated by an example from womens health initiative availability_and the r package twophaseind is available from http cran r pro ject org_web depending on genetic_background and clinical_characteristics individuals respond differently to treatment or prevention in randomized_clinical there is a rising interest in identifying baseline biomarkers that predict subgroup or individual treatment effects for example pharmacogenenetics or pharmacogenomics studies that may lead to personalized or precision_medicine a common design of such studies is to measure predictive_biomarkers of treatment efficacy from achieved specimens after trial completion the genetic or genomic markers are often expensive to measure particularly for genome_wide high_throughput assays such as whole_genome the outcomedependent sampling such as casecontrol or casecohort sampling are widely used for cost efficiency in this type of retrospective_studies only designs for trials with rare_events subject to censoring in which genetic biomarker main effects are also of interest the r package twophaseind assembles a number of functions to compute the estimates and provide standard_error and p values for subgroup treatment effects and genetreatment interactions in various aforementioned study settings the twophase part in the name of the package refers to the retrospective sampling for biomarker measurement after the completion of the prospective_trial and the ind part refers to the unifying theme in implemented methods that we exploit genetreatment independence to improve the estimation efficiency data examples are included in the package and presented in an r package vignette
