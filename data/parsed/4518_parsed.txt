tabix fast retrieval of sequence_features from generic tab_delimited files tabix is the first generic tool that indexes position sorted files in tab_delimited formats such as gff bed psl sam and sql export and quickly retrieves features overlapping specified regions tabix features include few seek function calls per query data compression with gzip compatibility and direct ftp http access tabix is implemented as a free command_line as well as a library in c java perl and python it is particularly useful for manually examining local genomic_features on the command_line and enables genome viewers to support huge data_files and remote custom tracks over networks availability_and http samtools sourceforge net when we examine local genomic_features on the command_line or via a genome viewer we frequently need to perform interval queries retrieving features overlapping specified regions we may read through the entire data file if we only perform interval queries a few times or preload the file in memory if interval queries are frequently performed e g by genome viewers however reading the entire file makes both strategies inefficient given huge datasets a solution to the efficiency problem is to build a database for the data file but this is not optimal either because generic database indexing algorithms are not specialized for biological data the technical complexity of setting up databases and designing schemas also hampers the adoption of the database approach for an average end_user under the circumstances a few specialized binary formats including bigbed bigwig and bam have been developed very recently to achieve efficient random_access to huge datasets while supporting data compression and remote file access which greatly helps routine data_processing and data visualization at present these advanced indexing techniques are only applied to bed wiggle and bam nonetheless as most tab_delimited biological data_formats e g psl gff sam vcf and many ucsc database dumps contain chromosomal positions one can imagine that a generic tool that indexes for all these formats is feasible and this tool is tabix in this article i will explain the technical_advances in tabix indexing describe the algorithm and evaluate its performance on biological data the tabix algorithm is implemented in c and java with perl and python bindings to the c library when the input_file name is a url starting with http or ftp tabix will retrieve data directly from the remote file the tabix package is distributed under the mit x license free to both academic and commercial uses to evaluate the performance of tabix i applied it to two datasets all human est alignments and x short read_alignments on both datasets the bgzip compression reduces file sizes by a factor of and tabix only invokes one seek function call for each interval query tabix is slower on the short read_alignments because each kb interval contains more data nonetheless tabix is still fast enough for a genome viewer data_retrieval especially retrieval over network is i o bounded rather than cpu bounded invoking fewer seek calls and reading fewer data from disk network have a bigger impact on the practical performance
