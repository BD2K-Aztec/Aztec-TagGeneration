exact and complete short_read to microbial_genomes using graphics_processing programming motivation the introduction of next_generation techniques and especially the high_throughput systems solexa illumina inc and solid abi made the mapping of short_reads to reference_sequences a standard application in modern bioinformatics short_read is needed for reference based re sequencing of complete_genomes as well as for gene_expression analysis based on transcriptome_sequencing several approaches were developed during the last years allowing for a fast alignment of short_sequences to a given template methods available to date use heuristic techniques to gain a speedup of the alignments thereby missing possible alignment positions furthermore most approaches return only one best_hit for every query_sequence thus losing the potentially valuable information of alternative alignment positions with identical scores results we developed saruman semiglobal alignment of short_reads using cuda and needleman wunsch a mapping_approach that returns all possible alignment positions of a read in a reference_sequence under a given error threshold together with one optimal alignment for each of these positions alignments are computed in parallel on graphics hardware facilitating an considerable speedup of this normally time consuming step combining our filter algorithm with cuda accelerated alignments we were able to align_reads to microbial_genomes in time comparable or even faster than all published approaches while still providing an exact complete and optimal result at the same time saruman runs on every standard linux pc with a cuda compatible graphics accelerator for short read_alignments against microbial_genomes saruman has proven to be as fast or even faster than other available approaches like soap bowtie bwa shrimp and pass tables and in contrast to heuristic approaches saruman guarantees to find optimal alignments for all possible alignment positions compared to shrimp another exact aproach saruman shows a better runtime performance thus it is the first non heuristic approach providing full indel support in competitive computing time the completeness of the saruman mapping was demonstrated using a constructed dataset where all reads could be mapped correctly saruman is designed as a short_read approach nonetheless it works properly and with reasonable running_times for reads up to lengths of bp the qgram index used in the filter step has a memory_usage that in worst_case increases linearly with the size of the reference_genome furthermore as saruman provides a proper handling of ns in the reference_sequence as well as in the reads it cannot use two bit encoding page
