modified screening and ranking algorithm for copy_number detection motivation copy_number cnv is a type of structural_variation usually defined as gen_omic segments that are kb or larger which present variable copy_numbers when compared with a reference_genome the screening and ranking algorithm sara was recently_proposed as an efficient approach for multiple change_points detection which can be applied to cnv_detection however some practical issues arise from application of sara to single_nucleotide data results in this study we propose a modified sara on cnv_detection to address_these first we use the quantile normalization on the original intensities to guarantee that the normal mean model based sara is a robust method second a novel normal mixture_model coupled with a modified bayesian_information is proposed for candidate change_point selection and further clustering the potential cnv segments to copy_number states simulations revealed that the modified sara became a robust method for identifying change_points and achieved better performance than the circular_binary cbs method by applying the modified sara to real_data from the hapmap project we illustrated its performance on detecting cnv segments in conclusion our modified sara method improves sara theoretically and numerically for identifying cnvs with high_throughput genotyping_data availability_and the modsara package is implemented in r program and freely_available atsingle nucleotide polymorphisms snps structural_variations such as deletion duplication or insertion of a chromosome segment and epigenetic reasons account for the tremendous variability of human genomics copy_number cnv is a type of structural_variation which is usually defined as genomic_segments that are kb or larger presenting variable copy_numbers when compared with a reference_genome duplication or deletion on any of the two copies of genomic_segments results in variation of this region in human populations cnvs are generated by recombination based or replication based mechanisms which can be inherited their formation also occurs when de_novo locus specific mutation happens with the new technologies developed in recent_years smaller copy_number that are even in snp level are detectable increasing evidence suggests that cnvs commonly exist and have strong impact on disease risks through cnv mapping of human_genome from individuals researchers found that of human_genome is subject to cnvs meanwhile other research revealed that the average number of cnvs per individual in the hapmap individuals was moreover a large_scale cnv_detection study in human_genome demonstrated that a large amount of the identified cnvs overlapped with protein coding_region transcription_levels higher or lower than those that can be achieved by control of transcripts of a single_copy per haploid_genome given this information cnvs in human_genome may significantly affect risks of not only mendelian_diseases but also many common diseases great effort is being made to uncover a causal_role of cnvs in pathogenesis of human common disorders such as pancreatic_adenocarcinoma autism growth_retardation and hiv progression precisely identifying cnvs and studying their genetic functions will greatly benefit the functional analysis of human genomics and complement current gwass which measure genome_wide genotype variations various techniques have been proposed for detecting dna cnvs in humans and mammalians the advent of whole_genome snp_genotyping array and the next_generation which assays hundreds of thousands of points in parallel permits kilobaseresolution detection of cnvs with the development of these highresolution techniques many population_based statistical algorithms have been developed for cnv studies including quantisnp cnvcall cnvdetector cghcall van_de cnv seq cnvtools birdsuite and cnvassoc penncnv is probably the most popular software for cnv analysis which implements hidden_markov incorporating the log r ratio lrr values b allele_frequency baf values and also the distances between neighbouring snps meanwhile many change_point based_approaches have also been developed and extensively applied to the detection of cnvs existing change_point based_approaches use exhaustive searching such as binary segmentation_method circular_binary cbs and penalized_regression these global searching approaches present high_computational given that the data_points are repeatedly used in the process of determining change_points along the same sequence as a result finding multiple change_points in massive snp_genotyping array data accurately and efficiently is challenging the screening and ranking algorithm sara was recently_proposed as an alternative approach for multiple change_points detection this algorithm hypothesizes that determining whether a position at the dna_sequence is a changepoint or not does not depend on the information far away from this position the sara algorithm searches along the sequence in a series of windows and it finds the local maximizers for the scan statistic as the most probable change_points locally these local maximizers are then ranked and chosen by a backward subset selection_strategy based on bayesian_information bic which yields final change_points as discussed by niu and zhang it takes only on operations to perform the screening and ranking steps therefore sara ensures low computational_complexity down to on which makes it more efficient than the existing iterative searching algorithms with complexity at least on this statistical property makes sara more suitable for high_throughput datasets however some practical issues arise from the application of sara to snp data for identifying cnvs first the distribution of intensities in high_throughput affymetrix snp_array for example always presents heavy tails when compared with normal_distributions which violates the assumption of sara second the changepoints identified by sara are not clustered to make final calling of copy_number states in this article to address the above two issues we propose several strategies to implement sara on cnv_detection first we use the quantile normalization qn on the original intensities to alleviate the requirement of normality second we propose to use a novel normal mixture_model and apply the bic criterion for candidate change_point selection and further cluster the potential cnv segments to copy_number states after our modification the sara algorithm is robust to the violations of the normal assumption and yields high_sensitivity for identifying change_points through intensive simulation_studies we evaluated the validity of the modified sara on identifying change_points for cnvs our simulation_results demonstrated that the modified sara achieved higher power than cbs by applying it to real_data from the hapmap project we illustrated the performance of the modified sara on detecting cnv segments in this article we proposed a modified sara method to improve the power of sara by qn when the intensity is not normally distributed and to reduce the false_positive errors by a clustering strategy to evaluate the performance of our proposed method versus existing ones we developed a novel method to generate dna_sequences that mimic real_data for the purpose of evaluating cnv_detection our simulations with noises from t distributions highlight the necessity of preprocessing by qn on sara which renders its robustness to the normal assumption moreover we propose to use multiple bandwidths in identifying change_point candidates to optimize the sensitivity then a normal mixture model_based strategy following bic criterion in deletion of false_positives to optimize its specificity by applying the modified sara on a simulated dataset mimicking a real_dataset from the hapmap project we illustrated the great performance of the modified sara on detecting change_points with snp_genotyping in all the scenarios we simulated the modified sara achieved better performance than cbs tables and supplementary qn also affected the performance of cbs to some extent in addition real_data indicated that the modified sara outperformed cbs in both sensitivity_and although they identified similar number of changepoints our improvements emphasize the preference to use the modified sara in identification of cnvs in conclusion we propose a modified sara method by optimizing its performance in both theoretical and applicable aspects for identifying cnvs with highthroughput genotyping_arrays the better performance of the modified sara on change_points detection compared with cbs highlights the necessity and contribution of our modification the combination of multiple bandwidths and normal mixture_model strategies allows optimized sensitivity_and on the one hand using multiple bandwidths the modified sara achieves better power of the detection of changepoints while on the other hand the implementation of the normal mixture model_based overcomes the over sensitivity of the original sara to small mean changes which is undesirable for cnv_detection thus the modified sara has more precise identification of the change_points corresponding to true cnvs such advantages are exhibited in the real_data analysis results in which the modified sara identified more realistic cnv segments than cbs one concern of our modification is that larger cnv segments may be produced than the original_version of sara this is because we cluster two adjacent cnv segments together at the clustering step when both have the same direction of change and similar jump sizes however as noted in the real_data analysis the proportion of short segments identified by sara was larger than cbs which demonstrated that our modification did not mistakenly group adjacent change_points we provide a reliable solution for the over sensitivity issue of the original sara method in this study to effectively filter false_positive change_points our suggestion is to apply normal mixture model_based following subset selection based on modified bic other combinations of these two strategies were also explored in the simulation_studies i selection with modified bic criterion only ii normal mixture model_based only and iii selection with modified bic criterion following normal mixture model_based were all applied to the simulated_datasets however our proposed combination exhibited the best performance on subset selection of the candidate pool the underlying mechanism is of interest and will be further investigated in our future study investigating the association of cnvs with common quantitative_traits and human complex_diseases is a challenging_task in current genetic community our implementation in the sara method by optimizing its performance is of great value for cnv identification which ensures more accurate and valid cnv_calls for future association study compared with the originally developed
