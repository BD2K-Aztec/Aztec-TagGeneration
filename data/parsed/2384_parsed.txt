structural_bioinformatics improving b cell epitope_prediction and its application to global antibody antigen docking motivation antibodies are currently the most important class of biopharmaceuticals development of such antibody based drugs depends on costly_and screening campaigns computational_techniques such as antibodyantigen docking hold the potential to facilitate the screening process by rapidly providing a list of initial poses that approximate the native complex results we have developed a new method to identify the epitope region on the antigen given the structures of the antibody and the antigenepipred the method combines conformational matching of the antibodyantigen structures and a specific antibodyantigen score we have tested the method on both a large non redundant set of antibodyantigen complexes and on homology_models of the antibodies and or the unbound antigen structure on a non redundant test_set our epitope_prediction method achieves recall at precision against recall at precision for a background random_distribution we use our epitope predictions to rescore the global docking_results of two rigid_body docking algorithms zdock and cluspro in both cases including our epitope prediction increases the number of near native poses found among the top decoys availability_and our software is available fromantibodies are the key protein factors in the acquired immune_responses in vertebrates the most common human antibody isotype is the igg which is one of the main mediators of secondary immune_responses antibodies have a conserved_structure with solved structures available in the protein_data most of the variability in antibodies both sequence and structure can be found in the antigen binding_site which is chiefly composed of the complementarity_determining loops cdrs the affinity and specificity of the antibodys cognate antigen can be effectively modulated by only a few mutations to the cdrs owing to their malleable binding_properties antibodies are currently one of the most important biopharmaceuticals the majority of the technologies used for artificial antibody design are based on costly screening campaigns however there is a growing number of computational_methods aimed at aiding the process of artificial antibody design two areas of computational antibody design are the focus of this manuscript b cell epitope_prediction e g el and global antibodyantigen docking e g given a sequence or structure of an antigen in silico b cell epitope_prediction aims to identify a set of residues on the antigen capable of binding an antibody many successful b cell epitope prediction_methods rely on structural_information but sequence alone can also produce useful predictions the majority of current methods operate without antibody information aiming to identify all potential antibody_binding attempting to map all epitopes might not be optimal because some antigens such as hen_egg have been shown to form complexes with many different antibodies these bind to different areas meaning that most of the lysozymes surface constitutes a part of some epitope moreover it has been shown that two different therapeutic_antibodies gevokizumab and canakinumab activate two distinct_pathways by binding to different epitopes of il in this article we create antibodyspecific epitope predictions as we believe these will be more useful for the development of therapeutic_antibodies computational b cell epitope_prediction provides information about the regions of the antigen bound by the antibody but it does not directly contribute to the knowledge of the particular antibody residues that need to be mutated so as to modify its function this problem can be tackled by antibodyantigen docking which given the structure of the antibody and the antigen provides a list of putative orientations of the two molecules with respect to each other antibodyantigen docking requires different methodology from that used for the corresponding problem concerning non antibody targets this is because antibodies use different residues in their binding_sites when compared with both general proteins and antigens and thus an asymmetric scoring system is required that accounts for these discrepancies in this manuscript we focus on epitope_prediction and global docking and how those two methods in concert can facilitate computational artificial antibody design we develop an antibody specific epitope_prediction method epipred which uses geometric matching of the antibody and antigen interfaces coupled with an antibodyantigen specific knowledge based potential we use our epitope predictions to rescore the global docking_results of two fast rigid_body docking algorithms zdock and cluspro server in antibody mode we demonstrate that including the epitope information in our global docking pipeline enriches the top decoys with more native poses
