databases_and interoperability between phenotype and anatomy ontologies motivation phenotypic_information is important for the analysis of the molecular_mechanisms underlying_disease a formal ontological representation of phenotypic_information can help to identify interpret and infer phenotypic_traits based on experimental_findings the methods that are currently used to represent data and information about phenotypes fail to make the semantics of the phenotypic trait explicit and do not interoperate with ontologies of anatomy and other domains therefore valuable resources for the analysis of phenotype studies remain unconnected and inaccessible to automated analysis and reasoning results we provide a framework to formalize phenotypic descriptions and make their semantics explicit based on this formalization we provide the means to integrate phenotypic descriptions with ontologies of other domains in particular anatomy and physiology we demonstrate how our framework leads to the capability to represent disease_phenotypes perform powerful queries that were not possible before and infer additional knowledge large_scale genomics research increasingly includes the collection of phenotypic_information to infer disease_states from genetic conditions similarly evolutionary_studies heavily rely on phenotypic descriptions across species several biomedical databases collect and organize phenotypic_information to integrate this information across different domains and databases and to communicate the data to the research_community phenotype ontologies were developed which formalize the meaning of terms used to characterize phenotypes ontologies are specifications of a conceptualization of a domain and are used to make the meaning of terms in a vocabulary explicit such that they can be used for consistency verification information_retrieval and knowledge_discovery at least two kinds of phenotype ontologies can be distinguished ontologies in which each term contains one specific phenotypic trait and ontologies and methods that permit the composition of a term to whom correspondence should be addressed through the combination of an entity and a quality each of these approaches describes a phenotype through qualities that are attributes of an entity for example a size of an arm would be described as a quality size which is the quality of arm in addition to these qualities phenotype ontologies contain classes describing absence and presence of parts functions dispositions and processes as well as abnormality currently these features are also represented as qualities and rarely further analyzed in particular the attribution of qualities like absent or dysfunctional does not yet enable inferences about the parts or functions of an entity consequently these approaches fail to interoperate with anatomy or physiology ontologies if however the meaning of these qualities would be made explicit and classes like absent or dysfunctional characterized in terms of the has part and has function relations information_flow between phenotype and anatomy or physiology ontologies would be possible thereby leading to a semantic integration of these ontologies and the capability for expressive queries as anatomy ontologies often represent canonical prototypical organisms inconsistencies may arise when they are combined with phenotype ontologies for example an anatomy ontology may contain a statement that asserts that every human has an appendix as part while a phenotypic description of a human may assert that this human has no appendix as part because inconsistencies prevent query answering and semantic interoperability a framework for phenotypic descriptions must accommodate statements about deviations from reference models without leading to inconsistencies we provide a method to make the intended meaning of phenotypic descriptions explicit and interoperable with anatomy and physiology ontologies for this purpose we first provide the means to formalize phenotypic_traits while reusing classes and relations from other ontologies based on this formalization we describe how to consistently integrate phenotypic descriptions with canonical ontologies and demonstrate how our method leads to expressive and flexible descriptions of disease_phenotypes as well as the possibility for automated inference and knowledge_discovery we applied our method to examples taken from phenotype ontologies and provide an example ontology which is available from our project_web our framework for formalizing phenotypic descriptions is based on the web_ontology owl owl is based on an expressive decidable fragment of first order logic and provides the foundation for the semantic_web to maintain compatibility with currently established methods for representing phenotypes and reuse the data that has been annotated with it we also demonstrate an implementation in the obo flatfile format the first distinction is drawn between phenes of objects and phenes of processes we primarily classify phenes of objects into four main categories structural functional qualitative and participatory phenes under the structural phenes we show possible further classifications based on the relations we use in our method qualitative phenes can be further distinguished into those where only the quality is relevant and those where the qualitys value is considered
