systems_biology psexplorer whole parameter_space exploration for molecular signaling_pathway dynamics motivation mathematical_models of biological_systems often have a large number of parameters whose combinational variations can yield distinct qualitative behaviors since it is intractable to examine all possible combinations of parameters for non trivial biological_pathways it is required to have a systematic strategy to explore the parameter_space in a computational way so that dynamic behaviors of a given pathway are estimated results we present psexplorer a computational_tool for exploring qualitative behaviors and key_parameters of molecular signaling_pathways utilizing the latin hypercube sampling and a clustering technique in a recursive paradigm the software enables users to explore the whole parameter_space of the models to search for robust qualitative behaviors the parameter_space is partitioned into sub regions according to behavioral_differences sub regions showing robust behaviors can be identified for further analyses the partitioning result presents a tree_structure from which individual and combinational effects of parameters on model behaviors can be assessed and key_factors of the models are readily identified availability the software tutorial manual and test models are available for download at the following address http computational_modeling is a valuable_tool to understand the complex_biological such models often possess complex topological structures with multiple positive and or negative feedbacks and a large number of parameters so that combinational perturbations on these parameter_values can greatly affect qualitative behaviors of the models two important issues in this approach are to understand the scope of behaviors that the model can experience and to identify key_parameters regulating the behaviors bifurcation analysis is one of welldeveloped methods for qualitative behavior analysis of dynamical_models its application to systems_biology is limited however since it can examine the effects of only a few parameters mostly one or two at a time although a tool for the global parametric perturbation analysis of biochemical_models is available it is focusing on parameter_sensitivity i e a quantification of individual effects of parameter variations respecting to quantitative changes in the model outputs in this note we outline psexplorer an efficient computational_tool to explore high_dimensional parameter_space of biochemical_models for identifying qualitative behaviors and key_parameters the software supports input models in sbml format it provides a friendly graphical_user allowing users to vary model_parameters and perform time course simulations at ease various graphical plotting features helps users analyze the model dynamics conveniently its output is a tree_structure that encapsulates the parameter_space partitioning results in a form that is easy to visualize and provide users with additional information about important parameters and sub regions with robust behaviors it is imperative to employ an in silico analysis to systematically identify the specific perturbations that have significant effects on the system behaviors especially when numerous experiments on living_systems are not practical globally perturbing model_parameters to analyze system dynamics was used in previous_studies for automating the approach psexplorer has been developed from the framework proposed bywith necessary refinements to boost computational performance instead of using an exhaustive sampling_approach psexplorer utilizes a novel recursive stratified sampling_approach that can help explore high_dimensional spaces efficiently on each recursion step the latin hypercube sampling requires less samples to be generated thanks to its balancing distribution property then the coupling of a clustering_algorithm with a regression tree model provides a mean for a parameter_space stratification which allows the sampling process to concentrate on highly_heterogeneous regions while ignoring homogeneous ones as a result the number of samples required to properly explore the parameter spaces can significantly reduce last but not the least one unique feature of the software that makes it more interesting than the sensitivity analysis technique is the ability to identify combinatory effects of parameter variations on model behaviors the result tree not only identifies sensitive_parameters but it also can tell how they combine to produce a specific behavior of interest
