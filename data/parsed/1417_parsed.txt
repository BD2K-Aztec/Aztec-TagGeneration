gene_expression discriminative local subspaces in gene_expression data for effective gene_function motivation massive_amounts of genome_wide gene_expression data have become available motivating the development of computational_approaches that leverage this information to predict gene function among successful_approaches supervised_machine such as support_vector svms have shown superior prediction_accuracy however these methods lack the simple biological intuition provided by co expression networks cns limiting their practical usefulness results in this work we present discriminative local subspaces dls a novel method that combines supervised machine_learning and co expression techniques with the goal of systematically predict genes involved in specific biological_processes of interest unlike traditional cns dls uses the knowledge available in gene_ontology go to generate informative training_sets that guide the discovery of expression signatures expression_patterns that are discriminative for genes involved in the biological_process of interest by linking genes co expressed with these signatures dls is able to construct a dis criminative cn that links both known and previously_uncharacterized genes for the selected biological_process this article focuses on the algorithm behind dls and shows its predictive_power using an arabidopsis_thaliana dataset and a representative set of go terms from the biological_process ontology our results show that dls has a superior average_accuracy than both svms and cns thus dls is able to provide the prediction_accuracy of supervised_learning methods while maintaining the intuitive understanding of cns availability a matlab_implementation of dls is available atdiscovering the biological_processes that genes carry out inside the cell is a major_challenge to understand gene function at a genome_wide scale unfortunately many organisms lack in depth understanding about the genes involved in specific biological_processes as an example in the favorite model in plant biology arabidopsis_thaliana of its genes lack annotations about their biological_processes in the gene_ontology go database go annotations date november http www geneontology org machine_learning has emerged as one of the key technologies to support gene function discovery in particular many methods have been proposed to take advantage of the massive_amounts of microarray_expression available seefor reviews these prediction_methods can be classified into two broad groups supervised and semi_supervised approaches on one hand supervised techniques use a labeled training_set of genes to learn how to discriminate the genes of each label or function on the other hand semi_supervised approaches first group genes in an unsupervised manner without using any functional information and then a prediction is performed usually by propagating the overrepresented functions among the genes of each group guiltby association rule among supervised machine_learning support_vector svms have been one of the most successful_approaches to predict gene function as has been shown by several works however despite their theoretical advantage in terms of classification_accuracy in practice svms present the mayor inconvenience of operating as a black_box although additional techniques can be applied to extract comprehensible semantic_information from svm models their application is not straightforward and is usually restricted to linear svm models in the general_case of non linear svms the transformation of the data to high_dimensional spaces complicates any interpretation of the svm solution in our experience this is a major_limitation for gene function discovery as understanding the predictions is a key aspect to evaluate their biological soundness and guide research this aspect is even more critical considering the incomplete nature of annotations and the capability of genes to have multiple functions which prevents obtaining an error_free gold_standard and thus evaluating the absolute accuracy of the methods false_negative problem in contrast to supervised methods many semi_supervised approaches have emerged based on simpler but biologically sound concepts such as co expression and the guilt by association rule to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an

original_work the basic assumption in these methods is that if a group of genes shows synchronized correlated expression_patterns then there is a high chance for them to participate in a common biological_process common techniques used to group genes are clustering biclustering seefor reviews and co expression networks cns unfortunately current methods based on cns do not offer the accuracy of supervised methods to predict gene function as we show in this work by comparing the performances of cns and svms furthermore their classification strategy poses some relevant inconveniences in particular the selection of a suitable correlation threshold to define co expressed genes is often difficult and arbitrary furthermore both cns and clustering rely on global co expression_patterns meaning that genes need to be co expressed in a large proportion of the data in order to be grouped together usually these data involve hundreds_or of microarray_experiments each measured under a wide_range of experimental_conditions such as different time points tissues environmental_conditions genetic_backgrounds and mutations in this scenario expecting global co expression becomes a strong imposition and limitation the previous_observation has motivated the development of biclustering_algorithms the main idea behind biclustering is to find clusters of genes that co express in subsets of experimental_conditions after the seminal work by an extensive list of biclustering approaches has been developed seefor reviews however besides their theoretical advantages these approaches have not been extensively used in practice based on our experience the unsupervised local_search of experimental_conditions often leads to clusters with genes from a broad range of functions thus limiting their discriminative properties this problem is even worse considering the noisy nature of microarray_data which often leads to the discovery of biologically meaningless biclusters selecting datasets in a condition dependent_fashion should more precisely identify gene interactions relevant to a specific biological_question at hand however given the amount of expression data available today manual selection of the relevant conditions is not a practical solution in most cases to overcome the state of the art limitations exposed above and aid gene functional research we present discriminative local subspaces dls a novel machine_learning that discriminatively predicts new genes involved in a biological_process of interest by building a discriminative cn dls takes_advantage of the discriminative nature of supervised_learning while maintaining the expressiveness of cn approaches unlike other co expression based_methods dls exploits the existing knowledge available in go to construct informative training_sets these training_sets guide the search of suitable subsets of experimental_conditions containing expression signatures an expression signature corresponds to a discriminative expression pattern with two key_properties i it is defined in a local subspace of the data i e a particular gene and a subset of experimental_conditions and ii it is highly discriminative exclusive for the positive training genes associated to a biological_process of interest as a further feature and to tackle the inherent noise of negative training_sets genes not related to a biological_process dls incorporates a procedure that iteratively predicts false_negative fn genes and refines the training_set in order to improve its prediction_performance the discriminative nature of expression signatures allows dls to reveal novel co expression associations for the selected process in contrast to discriminative black_box models such as svms these predicted associations can be exposed in the context of a discriminative cn giving the scientist the possibility to visualize evaluate and interpret the predicted associations unlike traditional cn dls does not rely on a predefined and fixed correlation threshold to construct the networks instead dls uses a bayesian probabilistic_approach that adaptively derives a confidence_score for each predicted association a network is then constructed based on a desired minimum confidence which is translated into different correlation thresholds depending on the discriminative level of each signature in order to test the prediction power of our method we use an a thaliana expression dataset containing microarray hybridizations we compare dls performance with respect to cn and two versions of svm linear svm and radial basis kernel rbf svm the accuracy and predictive_power of the methods are tested using cross_validation and also testing the enrichment of year predictions with respect to new annotations using representative go terms from the biological_process ontology our results reveal that dls attains superior average_accuracy and similar predictive_power than rbf svm furthermore they show a clear advantage for dls over linear svm and cn in both tests remarkably they show that unlike svm and cn dls is able to systematically improve its predictive_power when increasing the number of available experimental_conditions the rest of the article_presents the details behind dls method section our experimental_setup section the main results section and our principal conclusions of this work section in this work we described dls a novel method that combines supervised machine_learning and co expression approaches to effectively predict new genes involved in a biological_process of interest we introduced four key_concepts that allow dls to effectively predict gene function the derivation of informative training_sets of genes by discovering fn training genes the supervised search of discriminative expression_patterns in subsets of experimental_conditions expression signatures a bayesian probabilistic_approach to derive the confidence for each prediction and the construction of discriminative cns to represent predictions by using an a thaliana expression dataset and go biological_processes our experiments showed that dls is able to provide effective gene functional_predictions with accuracies comparable to the highly discriminative svms while maintaining the expressiveness of cns interestingly they also show that unlike svms and cns dls systematically improves its prediction_performance as more experimental_conditions are added to the dataset thus we believe that the supervised use of co expression proposed in this work opens new opportunities to extract meaningful biological hypothesis from the increasing amounts of expression data and therefore to cope with the need to understand gene_functions and biological_processes
