data_and bioinformatics programs are fold over represented among the highest impact scientific_papers of the past_two motivation to analyze the relative proportion of bioinformatics papers and their non bioinformatics counterparts in the top most cited papers annually for the past_two results when defining bioinformatics papers as encompassing both those that provide software for data analysis or methods underlying data analysis software we find that over the past_two more than a third of the most cited papers in science were bioinformatics papers which is approximately a fold enrichment relative to the total number of bioinformatics papers_published more than half of the most cited papers during this span were bioinformatics papers yet the average year jif of top bioinformatics papers was whereas the average jif for top non bioinformatics papers was significantly_higher p the year trend in the average jif between the two groups suggests the gap does not appear to be significantly narrowing for a sampling of the journals producing top papers bioinformatics journals tended to have higher gini coefficients suggesting that development of novel bioinformatics resources may be somewhat hit or miss that is relative to other fields bioinformatics produces some programs that are extremely widely_adopted and cited yet there are fewer of intermediate success the top papers per year for years contained a total of bioinformatics papers when counting_methods papers as bioinformatics related papers there were in more than half the years evaluated a bioinformatics program was the most cited paper this is striking because the relative fraction of bioinformatics papers within the literature as a whole is much smaller to get an approximate estimate of how many bioinformatics papers are in medline under the same definitions as used here to evaluate the top most cited three mesh based queries were constructed varying in their stringency see methods as a baseline of papers from journals with bioinformatics in their name were evaluated and determined to be reporting the development of novel software or methods the others were analysis papers the mesh based queries were launched and as a positive control the number of papers in journals containing bioinformatics in their name using the same query was evaluated a sampling of articles from each query was manually evaluated to estimate the number_of fp returned supplementary as shown in the coverage of the least restrictive query is close to the baseline estimate of the fraction of bioinformatics papers that contain software methods development using this estimate approximately of the papers in medline report the development of bioinformatics_methods or software thus bioinformatics papers are approximately to fold over represented among sciences most cited papers depending on whether methods papers are counted as bioinformatics a comparison of the journal impact_factors jif between the annually most highly cited bioinformatics papers and nonbioinformatics paper shows that despite their disproportionate impact on science top bioinformatics papers tend to be published in journals with a significantly_lower average year jif relative to the top non bioinformatics paper p similarly bioinformatics and methods papers combined had an average jif of versus p the higher gini coefficients for bioinformatics journals suggest that development of novel bioinformatics resources may be somewhat hit or miss that is some approaches become widely_adopted and produce a disproportionate number of extremely highly cited papers while most are not widely_adopted and at least relative to some of the other journals analyzed here there are not as many papers that fall between the two extremes this may also provide a potential explanation for the jif gap methods developed to solve biological_problems whether novel ones or significant improvements on prior methods may be technically sound but if it is difficult to know a priori which ones will be widely_adopted or sorely needed then it would be understandable for that to diminish enthusiasm there is a degree of subjectivity when classifying papers strictly into bioinformatics versus non bioinformatics as some cases are not clear e g should a minor permutation of an existing method be counted as a new method but the magnitude of the differences found suggests that the main conclusions are not likely to be altered by a few differences of opinion regarding paper classification this study highlights the disproportionate impact bioinformatics has had on science in the past_two the gini_coefficient analysis of citations by journal suggests a greater gap between citationrich and citation poor bioinformatics papers which suggests that it may be worth examining in greater_depth why some of the less cited methods fared so poorlywere they simply not needed or was the right audience simply not aware of their existence are researchers reluctant to adopt new methods even if better if a solution already exists it suggests bioinformatics as a field is somewhat hit or miss or high_risk high reward relative to other fields as researchers bioinformaticians face challenges in being recognized for their work that are somewhat unique to their field its tempting to suggest a change to the system is in order but outside of bioinformatics there seems little incentive to do so the use of altmetrics may be one immediate solution but that presumes that others will officially recognize and accept their use another solution is for authors of superstar papers to invest in bioinformatics as a field by publishing substantial updates and improvements to their programs in bioinformatics related journals awareness of the underestimated impact of bioinformatics is only part of the problem the other part is finding effective solutions
