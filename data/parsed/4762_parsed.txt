two_dimensional segmentation for analyzing hi c data motivation the spatial conformation of the chromosome has a deep influence on gene_regulation and expression hi c technology allows the evaluation of the spatial_proximity between any pair of loci along the genome it results in a data matrix where blocks corresponding to self interacting regions appear the delimitation of such blocks is critical to better understand the spatial_organization of the chromatin from a computational point_of it results in a d segmentation problem results we focus on the detection of cis interacting regions which appear to be prominent in observed data we define a block wise segmentation model for the detection of such regions we prove that the maximization of the likelihood with respect to the block boundaries can be rephrased in terms of a d segmentation problem for which the standard dynamic_programming applies the performance of the proposed methods is assessed by a simulation_study on both synthetic and resampled data many key_steps of the cell development and cycle such as dna_replication and gene_expression are influenced by the d structure of the chromatin the folding of the chromosome in the space defines chromosomal territories the function of which has been studied for few years now typically topologically_associating contain clusters of genes that are co regulated thus the detection of chromosomal_regions having close spatial_location in the nucleus will provide insights for a better understanding of the influence of the chromosomal conformation on the cells functioning several chromosome_conformation technologies have been developed in the past_decade among which hi c is the most recent this technology is based on a deep_sequencing approach and provides read_pairs corresponding to pairs of genomic_loci that physically interact in the nucleus the raw measurement provided by hi c is therefore a list of pairs of locations along the chromosome at the nucleotide_resolution these measurement are often summarized as a square matrix y where y i j stands for the total number of read_pairs matching in position i and position j respectively positions refer here to a sequence of non overlapping windows of equal sizes covering the genome the number n of windows may vary from one study to another liebermanconsidered an mb resolution whereaswent deeper and used windows of kb blocks of higher intensity arise among this matrix revealing both cis and trans interacting regions although both types of interaction are likely to exist cis interacting regions seem to be prominent in the data see for instance and some have been confirmed to host co regulated_genes such regions result in block of higher signal along the diagonal of the data matrix the purpose of the statistical_analysis is then to provide a fully_automated and efficient strategy to determine these regions a first attempt was presented in where the author strategy is first to summarize the d data into a d index called the directionality index then to apply a regular hidden_markov to the summary data to retrieve the segmentation in this article we show that such a two step strategy can be avoided and that summarizing the data is not required to solve the segmentation problem detecting diagonal blocks can be seen as a particular d segmentation issue the d segmentation has been widely investigated for the detection of contour with arbitrary shape in images see for example from a computational point_of image_segmentation is an open_problem because no predefined ordering exists that could be used to provide exact and efficient algorithms compared with contour detection it is worth noticing that hi c data segmentation displays a specific pattern that did not receive any special_attention from the image_processing community one of our contributions is to prove that this d segmentation problem boils down to a d segmentation problem for which efficient dynamic_programming apply our formulation of the problem also allows us to solve some nonblock diagonal segmentation problems see the end of section the article is organized as follows in section we define a general statistical_model for hi c data which can deal with both raw and normalized data we prove that the maximum_likelihood of the block boundaries can be efficiently retrieved in section we first present an extensive simulation_study to assess the performance of our approach on both simulated and resampled data we then apply the proposed methodology to the data studied by which are publicly_available and compare our results with their regions the package implementing the proposed method is presented in section where some open problems are also discussed to whom correspondence
