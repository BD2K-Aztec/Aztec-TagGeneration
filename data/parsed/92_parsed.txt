gene_expression a computationally_efficient modular optimal discovery procedure motivation it is well known that patterns of differential_gene across biological conditions are often shared by many genes particularly those within functional_groups taking_advantage of these patterns can lead to increased statistical_power and biological clarity when testing for differential_expression in a microarray experiment the optimal discovery procedure odp which maximizes the expected number of true_positives for each fixed number of expected false_positives is a framework aimed at this goal storey et_al introduced an estimator of the odp for identifying_differentially however their odp estimator grows quadratically in computational time with respect to the number of genes reducing this computational_burden is a key_step in making the odp practical for usage in a variety of high_throughput problems results here we propose a new estimate of the odp called the modular odp modp the existing full odp requires that the likelihood_function for each gene be evaluated according to the parameter_estimates for all genes the modp assigns genes to modules according to a kullbackleibler distance and then evaluates the statistic only at the module averaged parameter_estimates we show that the modp is relatively insensitive to the choice of the number of modules but dramatically_reduces the computational_complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of genes we compare the full odp algorithm and modp on simulated_data and gene_expression data from a recent study of morrocan amazighs the modp and full odp algorithm perform very similarly across a range of comparisons availability the modp methodology has been implemented into edge a comprehensive gene_expression analysis software_package in r available at http genomine org edge since the development of microarrays a large number of methods have been proposed to identify genes that are differentially_expressed across biological conditions methods exist that borrow strength across genes to shrink variances apply data adaptive thresholds to traditional statistics or calculate hierarchical bayesian posterior to whom correspondence should be addressed probabilities recently proposed an approach_called the optimal discovery procedure odp that borrows strength across genes with similar expression_patterns when testing them for differential_expression the odp which must be estimated in practice maximizes the expected number of true discoveries for a fixed expected number of false_discoveries this optimality property makes the odp an attractive choice for use in analyzing gene_expression and other high_throughput data conceptually the odp uses information about differential expression_patterns across all genes to inform the decision about any specific gene shows a simple simulated dataset that illustrates the odp concept the black_box highlights the genes that are differentially_expressed among groups the first set_of are upregulated in the first two groups and downregulated in the third the second set_of are downregulated in the second group and upregulated in the first and third the third set is upregulated in the second group and downregulated in the others in this example each pattern of differential_expression is shared across genes the number of genes sharing each pattern is different and only three of the six possible differential expression_patterns are present the odp directly utilizes this information stemming from the idea that if a gene shares an expression pattern with other genes that have been identified as differentially_expressed then it is more likely to be differentially_expressed as well it has been shown that the odp is more powerful for detecting differential_expression than existing_methods such as the traditional t test or f test a shrunken t test sam and empirical_bayes methods the odp statistic is related to the commonly used likelihood_ratio lr test_statistics also known as the neymanpearson statistic suppose we have observed an n vector of expression data x i for the i th gene the traditional lr statistic which is optimal when testing a single hypothesis evaluates the likelihood under the null_hypothesis of no differential_expression for that gene l i and the alternative hypothesis l ia and forms their ratio l ia x i l i x i as the test_statistic if the ratio is large enough then the gene is called differentially_expressed the odp has a similar structure except the ratio is taken of all alternative likelihoods to all null likelihoods given the genes data x i where these likelihoods are evaluated across all genes the odp statistic is the ratio alt l ja x i null l j x i as with the lr statistics the odp statistic for a test also captures evidence against the null_hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis a heatmap of simulated gene_expression data for a study comparing three groups the genes inside the black_box show three common gene_expression the first pattern is downregulated for groups and and upregulated for group the second pattern is downregulated for groups and and upregulated for group the third pattern is downregulated for group and upregulated for groups and the number of genes sharing each pattern is different and only three of the six possible differential expression_patterns are present the odp is designed to utilize these expression_patterns to improve inference of differential_expression but in contrast to the univariate lr test the odp summarizes the evidence against the null taking_into the information from the other possibly related tests being performed when another gene is uninformative it contributes essentially nothing to the above odp statistic because its likelihood is very low although the odp statistic is more powerful than traditional statistics developed for testing single hypotheses it requires the evaluation of a large number of likelihoods for each dataset for each gene the number of terms to calculate in the odp statistic is on the order of the total number of genes resulting in a computational_cost that grows quadratically in the number of genes when doing a genome_wide analysis the original odp estimator introduced inperforms this exhaustive set of calculations however if groups of genes share_common expression_patterns they will have similar probability_distributions and therefore their calculations can be compressed into a single computational step here we propose to identify modules of genes based on similarity of probability_distributions using a clustering scheme based on the kullbackleibler distance the odp statistic can then be calculated using only the distributions derived from the centroids of these modules and weighted by the number of genes in that module since the number of modules is much smaller than the number of genes the odp computation will be substantially_reduced however the performance of and results from the modular odp approach are very similar to the full odp approach in addition to a substantial reduction of computation the unknown_parameters for each centroid can be accurately estimated because multiple genes are used the modp estimator has two advantages over the full odp estimator first the number of modules is generally much smaller than the number genes k m thereby dramatically reducing the computational_burden the second advantage is that the averaged parameter fits within each module will be more stable than individual genes parameter_estimates we now compare the behavior of the modp estimator to the full odp estimator both on simulated gene_expression data and on data from a study comparing gene_expression levels in human_leukocytes from individuals_living in three different environments we show below that the modp algorithm offers nearly identical results as the full odp while indeed requiring substantially less computing time the optimal discovery procedure odp is a powerful approach for the analysis of high_throughput however the full odp requires the computation of a large number of likelihoods to evaluate the statistic for any specific gene this leads to computational costs that grow quadratically in the number of genes since significance of these statistics is typically evaluated by a non parametric bootstrap approach requiring many sets of odp statistics to be calculated there is a strong need for methods that reduce the computational_cost of evaluating these statistics here we have introduced a new approach for calculating odp statistics based on forming probabilistic gene_modules using the kullbackleibler distance and greatly reducing the number of likelihood calculations making up each statistic the modp statistics are formed from a small number of likelihood calculations making the computation grow nearly linearly in the number of genes even though the modp statistics are substantially faster to calculate we have shown that they produce nearly identicalresults to the full odp statistics in both simulated_and examples even though the modp requires the user to decide the number of modules in advance we have shown that the modp statistics are relatively robust to the choice of the number of modules in both the simulated_and examples it was observed that modules or more were sufficient to match the performance of the full odp also because the modp method borrows strength across multiple genes the averaged parameter_estimates defining each module form more stable estimates of gene_expression variation relevant to the study and may contribute important information beyond unsupervised_clustering although we have used the normal likelihood in the formulation of our method justified because the data are continuous and can be shown to be approximately normal the odp approach may be utilized with other probability_distributions the methodology_presented in this article has been implemented in the edge software_package freely_available genomine org edge
