response to the comment on 'protein protein binding_affinity prediction from amino_acid sequence' we would like to thank moal and fernandez recio for their insightful comments on our recent_publication in bioinformatics yugandhar and gromiha the main objective of the work was to develop a method for predicting the binding_affinity of protein protein_complexes using sequence_based features we have utilized both predicted binding_sites and amino_acid for developing the method the method was formulated with inner feature_selection and tested with outer leave_one our method could predict the binding_affinity of protein protein_complexes within a mean absolute error mae of using leave_one experiment the statistical_significance of pearsons_correlation was assessed with p values we realized minor changes in the predicted binding_sites at the local computer and server due to the usage of different versions of the prediction software which moderately altered the results among the protein protein_complexes used as a test_set and six additional complexes mentioned in moal and fern ndez recio the binding_affinity of of them were predicted within a deviation of kcal_mol complexes with kcal_mol further three complexes have high_sequence with our initial set of complexes and binding_affinity of one of them differs by kcal_mol due to experimental_conditions and or different binding_modes which are the limitations of our model as discussed in the article on the other hand we have predicted the binding_affinity of all the considered protein protein_complexes using average assignment method saraboji et_al for evaluating the performance of the present method we have assigned the binding_affinity of each complex using the average dg of all the complexes as well as the average in each group we obtained a mae of and kcal_mol respectively the performance of our method is almost twice better than the average assignment method mae is we have utilized the single property correlation_coefficient to relate the important property with binding_affinity and combination of properties for predicting the binding_affinity for enzyme inhibitor_complexes and other enzymes experimental dg varies in the ranges of kcal_mol and kcal_mol respectively the predicted binding_affinities also span in these wide ranges in addition four typical complexes with high and low affinities in these classes are correctly_predicted within an average mae of kcal_mol the assignment of random values or average showed an average mae of kcal_mol further we have refined our model which showed a better performance in both cross_validation and test datasets and the details will be reported elsewhere
