paa an r bioconductor_package for biomarker_discovery with protein microarrays the r bioconductor_package protein array analyzer paa facilitates a flexible analysis of protein microarrays for biomarker_discovery esp protoarrays it provides a complete data analysis workflow including preprocessing and quality_control uni and multivariate feature_selection as well as several different plots and results tables to outline and evaluate the analysis results as a main_feature paas multivariate feature_selection are based on recursive_feature e g svm recursive_feature svm rfe with stability ensuring strategies such as ensemble feature_selection this enables paa to detect stable and reliable biomarker candidate panels availability_and paa is freely_available bsd clause license from http www bioconductor org_packages paa protein microarrays pms such as the protoarray by thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa are used for autoimmune antibody_screening studies e g to discover biomarker candidate panels in human body_fluids to discriminate two groups of samples e g diseased and controls for protoarray data analysis the software prospector is often used because it provides the advantageous univariate feature ranking approach minimum m statistic mms and a protoarray specific robust linear_model normalization rlm however since prospector provides hardly any further functionality for biomarker_discovery it is a quite limited tool therefore we have adopted and extended prospectors key features mms rlm and implemented paa which provides a complete data analysis_pipeline for protoarrays and other single color pms paa provides a comprehensive toolbox and an adaptable workflow for pm data analysis it comprises the most important methods of prospector and goes far beyond especially the multivariate feature_selection based on rfe embedded in ffs or efs which is a cutting_edge strategy for biomarker_discovery enables paa to identify stable and reliable feature panels finally paa is flexible since the r bioconductor framework facilitates workflow extension and customization
