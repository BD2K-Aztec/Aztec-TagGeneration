orfm a fast open_reading predictor for metagenomic_data finding and translating stretches of dna lacking stop_codons is a task common in the analysis of sequence_data however the computational_tools for finding open_reading are sufficiently slow that they are becoming a bottleneck as the volume of sequence_data grows this computational bottleneck is especially problematic in metagenomics when searching unassembled reads or screening assembled_contigs for genes of interest here we present orfm a tool to rapidly_identify open_reading orfs in sequence_data by applying the ahocorasick algorithm to find regions uninterrupted by stop_codons benchmarking revealed that orfm finds identical orfs to similar tools getorf and translate but is four five times_faster while orfm is sequenc ing platform agnostic it is best suited to large high_quality datasets such as those produced by illumina sequencers availability_and source_code are freely_available for download atin genomics stretches of dna uninterrupted by stop_codons are known as open_reading orfs the tag amber taa ochre and tga opal stop_codons signal the ribosomal machinery to cease translation with few exceptions an extended stretch of dna free of in frame stop_codons is evidence that a gene may be encoded on that region orf prediction in metagenomics can be performed on finished population genomes draft population genomes assembled_contigs or individual_reads searching for genes in individual metagenomic_reads gene centric analysis is useful when reference_genomes are unavailable and assembly of reads is either computationally prohibitive or a microbial_community is too complex for successful assembly in long assembled sequences conventional gene predictors use information such as codon_usage to more accurately_predict genes but these signals become unreliable in the limited genomic_context of short_read in bacterial and archaeal genomes genes are not interrupted by exons and intergenic space is minimal so short_read derived from these genomes are more likely to encode a fragment of a gene uninterrupted by a stop_codon orf prediction directly on early next_generation e g roche was difficult as they produced reads prone to insertion_deletion indel_errors in contrast newer illumina based sequencers generate reads where indel_errors are rare reads are higher quality and the errors that do occur are chiefly substitution_errors the current widespread use of illumina_sequencing in metagenomics presents an opportunity to find orfs in microbial reads directly identification of orfs in short_read simplifies downstream comparative_analysis and allows use of tools that require protein_sequence as input e g searching for protein_families with hmmer using orfs instead of six frame translating sequences for downstream sequence comparison tools e g blast v c the author published_by
