genome_analysis challenges in rna_virus bioinformatics motivation computer_assisted studies of structure function and evolution of viruses remains a neglected area of research the attention of bioinformaticians to this interesting and challenging field is far from commensurate with its medical and biotechnological importance it is telling that out of talks held at ismb the largest international bioinformatics conference only one presentation explicitly dealt with viruses in contrast to many broad established and well organized bioinformatics communities e g structural_genomics ontol ogies next_generation expression analysis research groups focusing on viruses can probably be counted on the fingers of two hands results the purpose of this review is to increase_awareness among bioinformatics researchers about the pressing needs and unsolved_problems of computational virology we focus primarily on rna_viruses that pose problems to many standard bioinformatics analyses owing to their compact genome_organization fast mutation_rate and low evolutionary_conservation we provide an overview of tools and algorithms for handling viral sequencing_data detecting functionally_important rna_structures classifying viral_proteins into families and investigating the origin and evolution of viruses viruses have been the first biological_systems for which complete genomic_information became available bacteriophage ms in and x in by the mid s multiple strains of important_human in particular hiv had been sequenced laying the foundation for a systematic comparative_genomics of the diverse virus families with the completion of the human_genome and the sequencing of hundred of eukaryotic and thousands of prokaryotic_genomes however the bioinformatics community focussed almost entirely on these much larger and more complex systems with few exceptions most viral_genomes are thus relatively poorly_annotated and few computational_tools and techniques have been developed specifically for the many idiosyncratic features of individual virus families the small_size of viral_genomes makes it possible to sequence large_numbers of isolates usually in clinical context that are unavailable for any living_systems this flood of sequencing_data in itself calls for specific methods of analysis which so_far are available in part at best in this survey we concentrate on rna_viruses they form a highly_diverse grouping usually classified in terms of their genome_organization they may have a single_stranded ss genome in either plus e g poliovirus enterovirus hepatitisa virus or in minus orientation e g rabiesvirus maizemosaic virus or a double_stranded ds rna_genome e g rotavirus or ssrna with a dsdna as an intermediate product e g retroviruses including hiv nevertheless they share several common features in particular their genomes are small ranging from enterobacteria phage bz to nt coronavirus encoding just a handful of proteins furthermore their mutation_rates are large enough to form a to whom correspondence should be addressed quasi species rather than a single genetically homogenous species in the classical sense many of the common questions raised in virology call for specific bioinformatics support how is viral gene_expression regulated how do rna_viruses evolve how common are they have we already seen the whole diversity of rna_virus families or genera how quickly do they change how often do variations occur how important is recombination in viral evolution is there a single common viral origin or do we find clearly independent origins in this contribution we review the state of the art of the computational_methods that have helped to address some of these questions in particular we will be concerned with i finding and assembling viral_genomes based on rna_seq ii regulatory rna_elements and processed subgenomic rna species iii classification_problems regarding viral protein_families iv phylogenetics and evolution of rna_viruses and v virushost associations as a basis for biomedical_applications
