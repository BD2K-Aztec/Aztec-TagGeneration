systems_biology sorad a systems_biology approach to predict and modulate dynamic signaling_pathway response from phosphoproteome time course measurements motivation signaling_networks mediate responses to different stimuli using a multitude of feed_forward feedback and cross_talk mechanisms and malfunctions in these mechanisms have an important role in various diseases to understand a disease and to help discover novel therapeutic_approaches we have to reveal the molecular_mechanisms signal_transduction and use that information to design targeted perturbations results we have pursued this direction by developing an efficient computational_approach sorad which can estimate the structure of signal_transduction networks and the associated continuous signaling dynamics from phosphoprotein time course measurements further sorad can identify experimental_conditions that modulate the signaling toward a desired response we have analyzed comprehensive phosphoprotein time course data from a human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell_line and demonstrate here that sorad provides more accurate_predictions of phosphoprotein responses to given stimuli than previously presented methods and importantly that sorad can estimate experimental_conditions to achieve a desired signaling response because sorad is data_driven it has a high potential to generate novel hypotheses for further research our analysis of the hepatocellular liver carcinoma data predict a regulatory connection where akt_activity is dependent on ikk in tgf stimulated cells which is supported by the original data but not included in the original model availability an implementation of the proposed computational_methods will be available atbinding of the ligand on the cell_surface initiates a signaling_cascade that is propagated via several parallel_pathways through phosphorylation of specific amino_acid in signaling proteins building a mechanistic_understanding of signaling_pathway dynamics from experimental_data has remained challenging for several reasons although mass_spectrometry based techniques have witnessed considerable progress recently it is laborious to measure active_forms of proteins in a highly quantitative and high_throughput manner furthermore unraveling functional interactions between phosphoproteins demands a large number of experiments where the key signaling_molecules are perturbed or even co perturbed by using direct gene_knockouts gene knockdowns specific_inhibitors or other external_stimuli a number of different computational strategies have been proposed to model signal_transduction a methodology based on bayesian_networks for describing the interconnections between signaling proteins has been used to study t cell_signaling used an approach based on fuzzy_logic an extension to the two valued boolean algebra to study the downstream_signaling of tumor_necrosis epidermal_growth and insulin_receptors while logic based_approaches provide models that are easy to interpret and analyze computationally they do not allow biophysically motivated mechanistic modeling_approaches which inevitably require the use of dynamic and continuous models of signaling_networks reviewed in ordinary_differential ode which represent the average of detailed chemical_reaction models in a cell_population have thus become preferable in studies focusing on signaling dynamics for example constructed an ode model to describe receptor dependent mitogen_activated signaling based on prior_biological about the network_structure and also identified a novel regulatory motif reverse_engineering of dynamic_models of molecular_networks has also been extensively_studied in the context of transcriptional_regulation and several ode modeling_methods have been proposed a ijond lahdesmakilahdesma our approach differs from the previous methods by using continuous non parametric dynamics and importantly by providing a way to modulate networks response as described below to whom correspondence should be addressed a far reaching goal is to use mathematical_models and computational_methods to modulate signaling_pathway responses in healthy and diseased conditions for example attempted to detect drug_targets from phosphoproteomic data by identifying changes in a pathway induced by a treatment relative to an untreated control given the complexity of signaling_pathway dynamics accurate modulation strategies inevitably require the use of a mechanistic_model of network_dynamics modelbased intervention_approaches have been studied in the context of probabilistic boolean_network but there is an interest on how the intervention_strategies can be implemented for continuous and dynamical_models here we present a flexible non parametric ode model and propose an efficient and scalable network structure_learning algorithm to identify signaling_pathways and their dynamics from phosphoprotein data this modeling method called sorad assumes the standard ode formulation but alleviates the detailed parametric model specifications by using nonparametric functions this has important consequences for the signaling_pathway reconstruction as we have to estimate only the kinetic_parameters and and the hyperparameters of the covariance function but no parameters directly related to the regulatory_functions when applied to previously_unseen stimuli sorad provides quantitatively accurate signaling_pathway responses more importantly we show how sorad can be used to design interventions for the modulation of said pathways response and dynamics this novel and unique method enabling the design of optimal stimuli e g receptor stimuli drug treatment encourages the discovery of new methodologies for experimental_design drug_discovery and therapeutic_applications to demonstrate sorads performance we make use of the dream project an initiative to foster collaboration between experimental and computational_biologists and validate our predictions on independent experimental_data from a human carcinoma cell_line part of dream originally published in
