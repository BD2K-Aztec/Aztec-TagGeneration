metab mesh annotating compounds with medical_subject progress in high_throughput has led to the development of a variety of resources that link genes to functional information contained in the biomedical_literature however tools attempting to link small_molecules to normal and diseased physiology and published_data relevant to biologists and clinical_investigators are still lacking with metabolomics rapidly emerging as a new omics field the task of annotating small_molecule metabolites becomes highly_relevant our tool metab mesh uses a statistical_approach to reliably and automatically annotate compounds with concepts defined in medical_subject and the national library of medicines controlled_vocabulary for biomedical concepts these annotations provide links from compounds to biomedical_literature and complement existing resources such as pubchem and the human metabolome database availability http metab mesh in recent_years many tools have been developed for automated annotation of genes transcripts and proteins and linking them to published biomedical_literature the resulting information has proved valuable for a range of bioinformatics_tools and research related to disease_gene gene_set testing and pathway visualization_tools vast_amounts of data_describing biological_roles of metabolites drugs and other small_molecules have been published several public_databases have been developed to annotate the metabolome of human and other organisms however to date there are still few tools that attempt to automatically develop search and present literature derived compound annotations to the biomedical research_community pubchem is a public resource used by individual to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as researchers and as input_data for other tools that provides access to million_compounds and million substances and includes biomedical structure safety and additional information including links to pubmed_abstracts via synonym mapping toxnet is another tool developed by national_library nlm that allows searches for compounds and provides links to relevant_literature through multiple sources several tools geared towards chemists such as compounds in literature cil and wendi allow users to search compounds using names smiles strings or compound structures and identify relevant publications rather than linking compounds to all available literature we decided to utilize medical_subject mesh to annotate compounds with the most commonly associated medical biological terms and vice_versa we believe that this approach_helps to provide more focused results and aids in finding relevant relationships and literature mesh is the nlm controlled_vocabulary used to manually index articles for medline_pubmed mesh covers a broad range of biological topics and medical terms with such general headings as disease anatomy chemicals and drugs and phenomena and processes there are currently mesh descriptors that are organized into a hierarchical_structure in addition there are mesh qualifiers that can be used to narrow a descriptor to a more specific topic nlm provides a list of chemical substances that contain a wide_range of synonyms used in biomedical publications that can be linked to the compound synonyms used in pubchem using the compounds and their occurrences in pubmed literature we performed statistical_tests to estimate the significance of the associations between compoundmesh descriptor pairs the resulting associations supporting data and literature can be accessed through our web_based metab mesh web_services are also available http ws ncibi org m m html and allow for batch queries users have the ability to identify either the mesh descriptors significantly associated with a given compound or the compounds associated with a selected mesh descriptor examples of both use cases are provided below tool we filtered the mesh descriptors to those under the following main headings diseases anatomy chemicals and drugs phenomena and processes organisms psychiatry and psychology anthropology education sociology and social phenomena technology industry and agriculture this resulted in a total of unique mesh descriptors next we determined the total number of pubmed articles annotated with at least one of these mesh descriptors and at least one pubmed substance that maps to a pubchem synonym million which served as the complete background set of articles for our tests we also determined the pubmed articles annotated with each mesh descriptor and each pubmed substance and the total number of articles for each compound using these values and the numbers of pubmed articles co annotated with each compoundmesh term pair we tested the significance of association between each compoundmesh term pair using two sided fishers exact tests and p values were calculated this resulted in a total of million tests with significant associations p value significant associations are presented in metab mesh sorted by p value the false_discovery method was used to adjust p values for multiple_comparisons and the resulting q values are provided in certain instances the association is so significant that the precise p value cannot be calculated in these cases the p value is set to and the statistic from the equivalent test is used to sort the associations by decreasing significance as an alternative measure of strength of association we provide the fold_change defined for a specific compound and mesh descriptor as follows to illustrate the uses and features of metab mesh we present two applications suppose we would like to determine_whether cyclic_amp camp is commonly associated with any certain type of cancer we can query the compound cyclic_amp in metab mesh using an exact match search and filter the mesh headings by disease to see that diseases are found to be significantly associated with camp among the top displayed to see the complete list of results we can download the tab_delimited text_file to view in a spreadsheet supplementaryshows the metab mesh results for the top diseases the two diseases most strongly associated with camp_levels are pseudohypoparathyroidism and neuroblastoma there are several other types of cancers listed but neuroblastomas are by far the most strongly associated mesh disease term by p value p e leydig_cell tumor although less studied in the literature had the highest fold enrichment fold with other cancers including glioma osteosarcoma and adrenal_gland neoplasms clicking the literature link for neuroblastoma and limiting to review_articles immediately brings our attention to defects in camp pathway may initiate carcinogenesis in dividing nerve_cells another important feature of metab mesh is the ability to search for compounds associated with a mesh descriptor e g a disease suppose one would like to identify compounds associated with phenylketonuria a metabolic disease caused by a defect in the enzyme phenylalanine_hydroxylase this enzyme is required to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine supplementaryshows the top compounds associated with phenylketonurias among these are phenylalanine endophenyl tetrahydrobiopterin sapropterin pterin and several other compounds that are known to be associated with this disease this example illustrates that metab mesh prioritizes known relationships if users are unsure of the mesh_term they require they can browse the mesh tree via our provided link metab mesh also provides a quick way to retrieve the abstracts related to both disease and the compound no other tool currently has this capability additional examples of use are provided in the supplementary_material in conclusion metab mesh provides a quick and convenient method for identifying compounds commonly associated with a biological topic or medical term or for identifying biological topics or medical terms commonly associated with a compound of interest although metab mesh is not meant to predict novel associations due to its dependence on what is in the literature as the examples illustrate it is very useful for identifying sets of associations that would otherwise be difficult to find metab mesh creates a valuable
