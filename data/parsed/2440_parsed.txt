inferred mirna_activity identifies mirna mediated regulatory_networks underlying multiple_cancers motivation micrornas mirnas play_a in regulating tumor_progression identifying_key mirnas defined by their functional activities can provide a deeper_understanding of biology of mirnas in cancer however mirna expression_level cannot accurately_reflect mirna_activity results we developed a computational_approach actmir for identifying active mirnas and mirna mediated regulatory_mechanisms applying actmir to four cancer datasets in the cancer_genome tcga we showed that i mirna_activity was tumor_subtype specific ii genes correlated with inferred mirna activities were more likely to enrich for mirna binding_motifs iii expression levels of these genes and inferred mirna activities were more likely to be negatively_correlated for the four cancer_types in tcga we identified key mirnas for each cancer subtype and annotated their biological_functions the mirna_target pairs predicted by our actmir algorithm but not by correlation of mirna_expression levels were experimentally_validated the functional activities of key mirnas were further demonstrated to be associated with clinical_outcomes for other cancer_types using independent datasets for er her breast_cancers we identified activities of key mirnas let d and mir a as potential prognostic_markers and validated them in two independent er her breast_cancer datasets our work provides a novel scheme to facilitate our understanding of mirna in summary inferred activity of key mirna provided a functional link to its mediated regulatory_network and can be used to robustly predict patients survival availability_and the software is freely_available research mssm edu integrative network biology software html micrornas mirnas have been shown to control cell_growth differentiation and apoptosis consequently impaired mirna_expression has been implicated in tumorigenesis in recent_years mirna_expression signatures have been used to classify cancers and to predict favorable_prognosis including however these studies did not provide direct mechanistic links between mirnas and their mrna_targets therefore whether and how the identified mirnas play key regulatory_roles in post_transcriptional is not clear a conventional way for identifying_key regulatory mirnas which potentially regulate expression levels of a large_number is to explore mirna mrna relationships based on their expression levels by integration of mrna and mirna_expression levels key cellular_pathways related with mirna_signatures are shown to associate with cancer_progression however the association between mirna and mrnas does not imply that the mirna causally regulates these genes it may be due to pleiotropic effect of upstream_regulators furthermore mirna expression_level is not equivalent to its functional activity there are proteins or rnas that can mediate the influence of mirnas on target_genes such as risc complex the relative_abundance of mirnas to its target_genes determines the functional activity levels of mirnas thus to infer key mirnas and understand their gene_regulatory it is critical to accurately quantify the regulatory activity of mirnas by considering their effectiveness on target_genes by applying systematic computational_models integrated with prior information on the regulatory_sequence of mirnas multiple mirna mediated_pathways have been identified for example key mirnas are shown to affect genes expression levels using an integrative model different approaches for identifying_key mirnas have been proposed such as testing mirnas binding_sites enrichment among sets of co expressed genes some studies infer the mirna_activity using mrna_expression data of genes enriched for mirna_target or average difference in expression levels of mirna_targets versus non targets however these methods do not explicitly consider the role of mirnas as a post transcriptional_regulator the amount of expression_level variation attributed to mirna regulation corresponds to the changes from the total transcribed mrna_level or baseline mrna expression_level the model to consider pre processed mrna_level is essential to accurately infer mirna activities here we present a novel computational_method actmir for explicitly inferring the activity of mirnas based on the changes in the expression levels of target_genes due to post_transcriptional the inferred mirna_activity is further used to identify key mirnas that regulate expression levels of a large_number and may drive tumor_progression key mirnas identified from its inferred activity can be used as biomarkers for predicting prognosis or as therapeutic_targets for cancer treatment our actmir method for inferring mirna_activity is based on two assumptions about mirna function i the baseline expression levels of target_genes when a mirna has no impact is approximated by their levels in samples with low expression_level of the corresponding mirna as sufficient mirna concentration is essential for its function ii the suppression of target_genes by a mirna depends on the expression levels of the mrnas we applied actmir to four cancer_types in the cancer_genome tcga actmir identified key mirnas that play_a in transcriptional regulations for each cancer subtype we demonstrated that our inferred mirna_activity could be further used for identifying_functional target_genes and as prognostic_biomarkers notably we identified let d and let g as key tumor_suppressors in er her breast_cancers targeting on the expression_level of collagen and extracellular_matrix genes the predicted putative causal_relationships between let d and let g and target_genes based on the inferred activity were experimentally_validated additionally the predicted activities of let d and let g were associated with survival we further demonstrated in two independent cohorts that predicted activities of two key mirnas i e let d and mir a in er her breast_cancers were consistently associated with survival while none of expression levels of these key mirnas was significantly associated with survival the phenomenon that only mirna_activity predicted by our actmir method was robustly associated with patient_survival was observed in multiple_cancer taken together our proposed actmir method does not only identify key mirnas but also provides direct mechanism links between mirnas and their functional mrna_targets which in turn act together to affect clinical_phenotypes we presented a novel computational_approach actmir for inferring mirna_activity and identifying_key mirnas that might causally activities of key mirnas identified in tcga datasets are of robust prognostic value in independents cohort datasets for ov a survival prognosis by mirna_activity based on the independents cohort dataset y axis ovarian_cancer dataset were compared to the results from tcga data x axis b kaplan_meier based on the activity of mir based ondataset the blue and red curve represents under and over active group respectively regulate a large_number and applied it to multiple_cancer our approach explicitly infers mirna activities instead of using mirna_expression levels as a surrogate by applying this method to mrna and mirna_expression in four different cancer_types we identified key mirnas for each tumor_subtype in particular when applied our approach to the tcga breast_cancer dataset we identified and key mirnas for er her and er breast_cancers respectively it is worth to note that results based on clinical subtyping er her pr status and molecular subtyping pam classification were similar supplementaryand detailed in supplementary results key mirnas of prognostic potentials were still significantly associated with survival after adjusting clinical pathological_parameters supplementary er her especially triple_negative breast_tumors are frequently invasive and metastatic involving biological_processes such as extracellular_matrix interestingly we identified two mirnas let d and let g that regulated_genes involved in extracellular_matrix furthermore we showed that activities of let d were consistently associated with survival in the independent breast_cancer studies our results not only support metastasis is associated with survival of triple_negative but also show that let d and let g are putative key_regulators of metastasis additionally the activity of mir a was prognostic in all three independent cohorts in addition to as potential prognostic_biomarkers the inferred activities of these key mirnas in er her breast_cancers can also be valuable therapeutics targets as there are very limited therapeutic_options for triple_negative our findings based on an unbiased systematic approach were supported by the previous observations based on experimental approach in great details our analyses suggested the role of let g in tumor_metastasis and mir a as a malignancy promoting_factor in breast_tumors by the mirna_activity followed by its functional_annotation and prognosis test furthermore our result also suggested the novel role of let d in metastasis and prognosis whereas the previous study failed to identify it because their study was based on the expression levels of let mirna family instead of mirna_activity this suggests our approach based on the inferred mirna_activity will facilitate to find more tumor_promoting or prognostic mirnas that may not be identified based on their expression levels alone different types of survival_outcomes were used in the tcga dvinge et_al and buffa et_al breast_cancer datasets by overlapping results based on these datasets we reduced potential false_positives but might also miss many true_positives however survival_analyses based on both mirna expression_level and mirna activities suffered the same drawback our result showed that there was no prognostic mirna based on expression_level consistent in multiple independent datasets while there were multiple prognostic mirnas based on activities consistent in multiple independent datasets suggesting our approach based on the mirna_activity is robust in an effort to uncover prognosis biomarkers of cancers mirnas would be a suitable candidate due to their small_size resulting in resistant to rnase degradation furthermore we showed that the effect of mirnas for prognosis was robust we measured the effectiveness and robustness of mirnas vs cnv as prognostic_markers using two independent cohorts of ov supplementaryand detailed in supplementary results cnvs are predominant functional genomic_alterations in ov interestingly we found only one consistent prognostic cnv factor or associated mrna factor whereas three consistent prognostic mirnas based on activity in ov supplementary suggesting a potential of mirna activities as effective and robust biomarkers it is worth to note that our actmir approach aims to infer mirna activities not to comprehensively identify mirna_targets the actmir procedure for inferring mirna activities is based on regression_models too few candidate targets of a mirna included in the actmir procedure may result in less robustness of mirna_activity estimation on the other hand too many low confident candidate targets included will bias mirna_activity estimation to zero there were multiple mirna_target data bases in addition to targetscan such as miranda and pita compared to other databases targetscan covered more mirnas supplementary also target_genes based on targetscan were more consistent with experimentally_derived targets such as by clash containing both canonical and non canonical targets and par_clip containing canonical targets methods than other database supplementary unlike targetscan which predicted canonical mirna_targets experimental_approaches such as clash revealed both canonical and non canonical mirna_targets however mirna target_gene interactions are subtype context specific most experimental methods covered only limited number of conditions resulting large_numbers of false_positives or false_negative which in turn affect accuracy of mirna_activity inference based on the regression_model also experimentally_derived target sets were only available for a fraction of mirnas for example clash dataset consisted of mirnas and par_clip dataset consisted of only mirnas it is hard to make fair comparison of mirna activities across all mirnas if target_genes for some mirnas contain experimentally_derived targets while others do not thus we used only targetscan but excluding other experimentally_derived target databases in our current study the target_genes from the targetscan database were mainly predicted based on seed sequences so that mirnas in the same mirna family share targets to test whether considering mirnas in the same mirna family together enhance the ability to identify potential mirna functional targets we compared the percentage of negative correlations between the predicted target_genes expression levels with the sum of the expression levels of mirnas in a family or the expression levels of individual mirnas our result supplementary showed that considering all members in a mirna family as a whole did not improve regulatory potentials of mirnas on the other hand many studies suggested that mirnas in the same mirna family have different binding_patterns to their target_genes even though they have the same seed sequences also only a fraction of predicted target_genes were regulated by a mirna reflecting to idiosyncratic patterns of mirnas in the mirna family we used wls regression to account for binding_affinity differences to different target_genes when inferring a mirna_activity as a result different mirnas in the same mirna family which had the same set of target_genes based on targetscan had different sets of functional targets for example activities of let a and let d correlated with different genes among the same set of target_genes supplementary a mirna can post_transcriptionally regulate many target_genes in our validation experiment we only tested two targets whose expression levels most correlated corresponding mirna activities validation of a few target_genes may not guarantee that other target inferred mirna activitygenes will be regulated by mirnas nor related pathways regulated mirnas instead of genome_wide target_gene validation and functional_validation which are needed in future_studies we validated mirna_target relationships by showing that mirna functional target sets based on independent datasets were significantly overlapped our regression procedure for inferring mirna_activity fully accounts for post_transcriptional by mirna_activity in contrast to directly use the expression_level of either the mirna or targeted genes as a surrogate for mirna regulatory activity indeed the target_genes of mirnas that were predicted based on the activity and were experimentally_validated in this study could not be detected as target_genes based on corresponding mirna_expression there are multiple experimental_approaches for estimating mirna activities proposed to experimentally measure mirna_activity by quantifying its target_genes in highthroughput manners they demonstrated that some highly_expressed mirnas might exhibit relatively weak activity which in some cases correlated with a high target to mirna ratio or increased nuclear_localization of the mirna our results were consistent with their results only one third of mirnas analyzed show significant fdr correlation between their expression levels and activities however our method is different from their method in several aspects i our inferred activity is cell context specific instead of synthetic environments ii our method is based on degradation levels of all genes with predicted mirna binding_motifs instead of expression levels of a few genes with conserved binding_motifs similarly pecot et_al and other papers showed that genes and associated pathways functionally regulated by a mirna were cancer subtype specific combined experimentally defined mirna_binding and targetscan predicted mirna_binding to define mirna target_genes and used difference of median correlations of mirna target_genes or mirna non target_genes with mirna expression_level to indicate mirna_activity showed that only a fraction of target_genes predicted by targetscan were repressed by a mirna and mirna_activity was cancer subtype specific even though some conclusions were similar our approach significantly_differed from farazi et_al s approach in multiple_ways first our iterative weighted regression_approach for inferring mirna_activity explicitly identified functional target_genes of mirnas in each cancer subtype based on in vivo data in contrast farazi et_al inferred subtype specific target_genes based on in vitro data of one single cell_line of other cancer subtype which contradicted with their own assumption that mirna target_genes were cancer subtype specific second even though the choice of using correlation between gene_expression and mirna_activity and target_gene enrichment test to infer functionally_active mirnas in our approach or correlation between gene_expression and mirna expression_level to reflect mirna function activity used byis subjective our approach is applied to multiple breast_cancer datasets indicating that our actmir approach for inferring mirna activities is robust more importantly our approach can be readily applied to any cancers without the need of experimentally deriving mirna_targets in the specific cancer type taken together our results underscore the value of inferring mirna_activity from a systems_biology perspective as a promising strategy for investigation of its causal_effects on target_genes and furthermore survival_outcomes of cancer patients there are several directions in which this approach can be extended first the integration of mirna mrna cnv and other high_throughput data into bayesian causal models may shed light on how key mirnas are regulated and lead to further refine mirnamediated regulatory_networks it will also be interesting to uncover the mechanisms_underlying the mirna functions by comparison of regulators between activity and expression of mirnas using cnv or mutation data furthermore a model considering several mirnas together is needed to investigate the cooperative or synergetic effects between mirnas function finally it is worth to further assess potentials of key mirnas as prognosis biomarkers and therapeutic_agents experimentally
