systems_biology dose an r bioconductor_package for disease ontology semantic and enrichment_analysis disease ontology do annotates human genes in the context of disease do is important annotation in translating molecular findings from high_throughput data to clinical_relevance dose is an r package providing semantic_similarity computations among do terms and genes which allows biologists to explore the similarities of diseases and of gene_functions in disease perspective enrichment_analyses including hypergeometric model and gene_set are also implemented to support discovering disease associations of high_throughput this allows biologists to verify disease relevance in a biological experiment and identify unexpected disease associations comparison among gene_clusters is also supported availability_and dose is released under artistic license the source_code and documents are freely_available through bioconductorcharacterizing disease disease relationships and mining gene_disease provides insights in analyzing high_throughput data to elucidate molecular_mechanisms of complex_diseases understanding similarities among diseases and among genes in disease context helps in early_diagnosis drug_repurposing and new drug_development investigating gene_disease with gene_lists obtained by high_throughput experiments helps exploring biological_questions in disease context and discovering unanticipated functions disease ontology do provides a consistent description of genes in disease perspectives to provide researchers with more accessible of disease knowledge the do database supplies a web_browser for users to explore do vocabularies while disease and gene_annotations database supplies a web_interface for mapping genes and diseases do is organized as a directed_acyclic laying the foundation for computation of disease knowledge using semantic_similarity algorithms there are many generic quality tools for computation of semantic measures including sml simpack semmf owlsim and similarity library http goo gl xcuj these generic libraries can be employed to analyze do semantic similarities dosim was designed specific for do but the authors fail to maintain the package functional do fundo implemented hypergeometric_test to assess significant of do associations with a gene_list however fundo doesnt allow users to customize the background set of genes and thus may introduce biases in the results to address the shortcoming of lack of r bioconductor_package that designed for computation of semantic and enrichment_analyses based on do we present dose that allows measuring semantic_similarity among do terms and genes using several information content and graph_structure based_algorithms for evaluating functional_associations with gene_lists of highthroughput genomic and proteomic_studies dose supports hypergeometric_test and gene_set gsea which incorporate expression_level measurements to extract disease relevance of biological_experiments more importantly dose provides several do specific visualization functions to produce_highly customizable publication quality figures of similarity and enrichment_analyses that are not available elsewhere with these visualization_tools the results obtained by dose are more interpretable
