gene_expression jamie joint analysis of multiple chip_chip experiments motivation chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by genome tiling_array hybridization chip_chip is a powerful approach to identify transcription_factor tfbss in target genomes when multiple related chip_chip datasets are available analyzing them jointly allows one to borrow information across datasets to improve peak_detection this is particularly useful for analyzing noisy datasets results we propose a hierarchical mixture_model and develop an r package jamie to perform the joint analysis the genome is assumed to consist of background and potential binding regions pbrs pbrs have context dependent probabilities to become bona_fide binding_sites in individual_datasets this model captures the correlation among datasets which provides basis for sharing_information across experiments real_data tests illustrate the advantage of jamie over a strategy that analyzes individual_datasets separately availability jamie is freely_available fromchip chip is a powerful approach to study proteindna_interactions by coupling chromatin_immunoprecipitation with genome tiling arrays this technology allows one to create genomewide maps of transcription_factor with rapid_growth of chip_chip data in public_repositories such as gene_expression it becomes more and more common that multiple datasets related to the same tf pathway or biological system are collected when multiple such datasets are available it is often desirable to analyze them jointly looking at all data together not only enables one to study commonality and context dependency of proteindna association but also creates opportunities to borrow information across datasets to improve statistical_inference this is particularly useful if the data of primary interest are noisy and information from other datasets is required to distinguish signals from noise to whom correspondence should be addressed performed by two different labs using affymetrix mouse promoter r arrays the purpose of these experiments is to locate binding_sites of two tfs gli and gli in different cellular contexts both gli and gli are members of gli family of tfs which recognize the same dna_motif the figure shows log fold enrichment between the normalized chip and control probe intensities the first experiment gli limb measures gli binding in developing limbs of mouse_embryos this experiment has low_signal due to an unoptimized chip protocol and use of a mixed cell_population gli is active only in the posterior fraction of the limb but chip_chip was performed using the whole limb as a result cells from the anterior limb may dilute signals in the posterior limb in spite of the weak signals one still wants to find true gli binding_sites in this dataset since gli is a key transcriptional_regulator for controlling proper development of limb a careful examination of the data shows that peaks in these four datasets are correlated in other words they tend to occur at the same locations in the genome this correlation can be potentially used to improve statistical_inference for example the weak peak highlighted by the solid box in gli limb cannot be easily distinguished from background_noise if one looks at this dataset alone however if all datasets are analyzed together the observation that all other datasets have strong peaks at the same location suggests that the weak peak in gli limb is a real binding_site in contrast the peak highlighted by the dashed box has approximately the same magnitude in the gli limb data but no binding signal has been observed in the other datasets suggesting that it is less likely to be a real binding signal when multiple datasets are analyzed jointly it is important to keep in mind that some tfbss are context specific for example the location shown inis bound by gli in gli limb but not in gli limb and gli gnp gnp stands for granule neuron precursor_cells in this case even without referring to the other datasets the enrichment in gli limb is sufficiently strong and should be called as a peak on the other hand one should avoid claiming that gli limb and gli gnp have peaks in this region only because there is a strong peak in gli limb ideally there should be a mechanism that automatically integrates and weighs different pieces of information and rank peaks according to the combined evidence this cannot be achieved by simply analyzing each dataset separately and then taking intersections of the results in the past_few a number of algorithms and software_tools have been developed for analyzing chip_chip data examples_include tiling analysis software tas from affymetrix mat tilemap hgmm mpeak tilescope ringo bac and dsat however they are all designed for analyzing one dataset at a time and the full advantage of data is not exploited when multiple related datasets are available a recent hierarchical hidden_markov hhmm approach developed byallows joint analysis of one chip_chip data and one chip_seq this represents a new progress towards using information more efficiently via correlating two types of high_throughput chip experiments nevertheless this method does not target analyzing two related chip_chip experiments more importantly its current form does not support the analysis of more than two datasets and it is not easy to generalize the method to handle multiple datasets since its number of parameters grows exponentially when the number of datasets increases in summary although jointly analyzing multiple chip_chip datasets is conceptually appealing currently there is no convenient tool to perform such analysis here we develop jamie an r package for joint analysis of multiple chip_chip experiments to support convenient and efficient mapping of tfbss by jointly analyzing two or more related chip_chip experiments jamie uses a hierarchical mixture_model to capture correlations among datasets the model provides the basis for sharing_information across datasets its number of parameters grow linearly with the number of datasets a computationally_efficient algorithm is developed to estimate the model_parameters given the estimated parameters the model is applied to scan the genome and find tfbss our tests on real_data show that by pooling information jamie improves peak_detection over the traditional approach that analyzes individual_datasets separately in summary we have introduced a novel hierarchical mixture_model for jointly analyzing multiple chip_chip datasets the model was implemented using an efficient algorithm jamie our simulation and real_data showed that by sharing_information across data jamie can improve the analysis of multiple correlated chipchip datasets the well controlled comparison between jamie pooling and jamie single showed that the improvement can be consistently observed in different test data and it can be substantial in datasets with low_signal in our tests jamie was also compared with two other popular chip_chip peak_detection methods unlike the comparison between jamie pooling and jamie single these additional comparisons were less wellcontrolled in the sense that the observed differences among these algorithms could be attributed to a number of factors knowing how much each factor contributes to the difference generally is difficult as a result these comparisons do not allow one to conclude that joint data analysis is better than separate analysis from this perspective the comparison between jamie pooling and jamie single is more informative as it is able to illustrate a generalizable design principle that can be used to improve future algorithm design in the past_few a number of important design principles have been developed for building good chip_chip data analysis algorithms for example by using a probe sequence_dependent
