prediction of nuclear_export signals using weighted regular expressions wregex motivation leucine rich nuclear_export signals ness are short amino_acid that mediate binding of cargo_proteins to the nuclear_export receptor crm and thus contribute to regulate the localization and function of many cellular_proteins computational_prediction of nes motifs is of great interest but remains_a results we have developed a novel approach for amino_acid searching that can be used for nes prediction this approach termed wregex weighted regular expression combines regular expressions with a position_specific pssm and has been implemented in a web_based freely_available software_tool by making use of a pssm wregex provides a score to prioritize candidates for experimental_testing key features of wregex include its flexibility which makes it useful for searching other types of protein motifs and its fast execution time which makes it suitable for large_scale analysis in comparative tests with previously available prediction_tools wregex is shown to offer a good rate of true_positive motifs while keeping a smaller number of potential candidates availability wregex is free open_source available fromcomputational prediction of protein features is being increasingly_applied to investigate several aspects of protein_function and regulation such as proteinprotein_interactions post_translational and subcellular_localization in eukaryotic_cells dynamic transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is an important regulatory_mechanism for many cellular_proteins active nuclear_import and export is carried_out by soluble_receptors termed importins and exportins respectively which escort their cargo_proteins through the nuclear_pore gorlich importins and exportins recognize and bind specific amino_acid in their cargo_proteins which function as nuclear_localization nlss or nuclear_export signals ness one of the best studied types of nuclear_transport signal is the leucine rich nes that mediates binding of cargo_proteins to the nuclear_export receptor crm a leucine rich ness typically consists of a short stretch of amino_acids containing several hydrophobic_residues not necessarily leucine with a characteristic pattern initial studies of a limited number of ness led to propose a consensus nes pattern with four conserved hydrophobic_residues represented by separated by a variable number of intervening residues represented by x this consensus pattern has been progressively expanded and refined through the analysis of a larger number of experimentally confirmed ness these studies mostly based on sequence_alignment suggested that residues at positions other than the conserved may also contribute to nes activity for example acidic_residues glu asp were found to be overrepresented in functional ness further insight into nes features has been recently obtained through structural_analyses of the crm nes binding_interface the crystal_structures of crm nes complexes showed that ness fit into a rigid hydrophobic groove on the surface of the receptor and that a fifth hydrophobic residue in the nes amino_terminal to may increase the affinity of the nes crm interaction these structural_analyses also revealed that acidic_residues in certain positions may contribute to nes affinity by interacting with a basic surface flanking crm hydrophobic groove thus providing a biological explanation to the previously_noted overrepresentation of acidic amino_acids in ness altogether these previous_studies have unveiled the remarkable complexity of the crm dependent nes in addition to the complex nature of the signal the identification of physiologically_relevant ness is further hampered by the fact that amino_acid that conform to the nes pattern may be found in hydrophobic protein cores where they would be unavailable for crm binding a valid strategy for nes identification may begin by mapping amino_acid segments with crm dependent export activity active nes motifs in the protein of interest if the d structure of the protein is known the solvent_accessibility of these motifs may then be evaluated and finally their physiological relevance can be validated by mutagenesis in the first step of this strategy the use of efficient computer based nes prediction_tools may play_an several nes prediction_tools have been developed to date these include programs that apply regular expressions derived from the nes consensus pattern such as elm as well as machine_learning programs such as netnes and nessential we have recently compared the performance of elm and netnes using these programs to predict candidate nes motifs in human deubiquitinases dubs the more recent nessential program was not available at the time this comparison was carried_out predicted candidates were subsequently_tested using an in vivo nuclear_export assay in our hands the ability of elm to identify amino_acid with nuclear_export activity was superior to that of netnes although the estimated positive_predictive for netnes and for elm was relatively low for both programs we have devised and tested a novel approach termed weighted regular expressions wregex that can be applied to the prediction of functional amino_acid including ness wregex combines the use of a regular expression with a position_specific pssm in the case of nes prediction the pssm takes_into the potential contribution of each nes residue not those at the conserved hydrophobic positions to nes activity in this study we submit wregex to a series of comparisons with nessential and elm and progressively optimize its regular expression and training pssm the features of wregex in comparison to these existing_tools as well as the potential application of wregex to the identification of other functional_motifs in proteins besides ness are discussed we have implemented wregex as a web_interface accessible to any researcher we have developed and tested a novel approach for motif searching consisting on the combination of both a regular expression and a pssm this approach termed wregex can be regarded as an evolution of the eukaryote linear motif elm resource importantly the introduction of a pssm provides a score that may help prioritizing candidates for experimental_testing our initial motivation to develop wregex was the prediction of nes motifs in this regard wregex compares well with the most recently_developed nes predictor nessential being faster and offering a better compromise between the number of potential candidates to test and the number of true_positives although we have focused here on nes motif searching wregex is a generic tool that can be used for searching other functional protein motifs thanks to the novel use of groups in the regular expression the pssm can be computed based on patterns rather than on strict positions as a consequence there is no need to make use of the artificial concept of alignment gaps which has no utility when considering the physical conformation of the protein motif wregex also offers the possibility of considering input motif weight when building the pssm this is useful when the motif has a quantifiable activity rather than a yes no effect if this is the case scores derived from an activity assay can be used for building the pssm another important feature of wregex is its fast execution which make this tool useful for large_scale database_search results of nes prediction using wregex e graphs show the score assigned by wregex
