genome_analysis crossmap a versatile_tool for coordinate conversion between genome_assemblies motivation reference genome_assemblies are subject to change and refinement from time to time generally researchers need to convert the results that have been analyzed according to old assemblies to newer versions or vice_versa to facilitate meta_analysis direct comparison data_integration and visualization several useful conversion tools can convert genome interval files in browser_extensible or general_feature format but none have the functionality to convert files in sequence_alignment or bigwig format this is a significant gap in computational genomics tools as these formats are the ones most widely used for representing high_throughput sequencing_data such as rna_seq chromatin_immunoprecipitation dna_seq etc results here we developed crossmap a versatile and efficient tool for converting genome coordinates between assemblies crossmap supports most of the commonly used file_formats including bam sequence_alignment wiggle bigwig browser_extensible general_feature format gene_transfer format and variant_call availability_and crossmap is written in python and c source_code and a comprehensive users manual are freely_available at http crossmap sourceforge net the human_genome brought into the world the first human_reference that has been widely used as basis for biomedical_research this reference_genome has been and is still being refined and improved the first working draft assembly became available in with gaps subsequently several assemblies were released in the human_reference was in its th version hg or grch with remaining gaps mb and a new human reference assembly grch is to be released at the end of hundreds of thousands of studies have been performed and sequence_data have been analyzed according to different versions of the reference_genome as more accurate versions of the reference_genome become available the compatibility and therefore the ability to integrate new and old genomics results becomes a major barrier when dealing with such heterogeneous datasets two approaches can be considered the first consists of re aligning all the data to the same reference_genome however redoing the whole analyses is time consuming especially for high_throughput hts_data in some cases re aligning is impossible if the original raw_data were not available the second approach faster and more convenient consists of converting genome coordinates between assemblies tools like the university of california santa_cruz ucsc liftover ensembl assembly converter and galaxy are able to convert plain text_files containing genome intervals in browser_extensible bed general_feature format gff browser_extensible gtf format however most hts_data are in bam sam bigwig format rather than in plain text_files because binary compressed files such as bam or bigwig facilitate data storage fast transferring efficient retrieving and visualization for instance nearly all processed data generated by encode and tcga were represented in bam or bigwig format or both to the best of our knowledge no bioinformatics tool is available to convert these big data_files here we introduce crossmap a versatile_tool to convert coordinates or annotation files between genome_assemblies it supports the most commonly used file types including bam bed bigwig gff gtf sam wiggle wig and vcf variant cell format formats for large plain text_file types such as bed gff gtf and vcf reading from remote servers and compressed files is supported see online manual this versatile_tool will greatly_facilitate meta_analysis and integration of hts_data
