structure ppi a module for the annotation of cancer related single_nucleotide at protein_protein motivation the interpretation of cancer related single_nucleotide snvs considering the protein features they affect such as known functional sites proteinprotein_interfaces or relation with already annotated mutations might complement the annotation of genetic_variants in the analysis of ngs_data current_tools that annotate mutations fall short on several aspects including the ability to use protein_structure information or the interpretation of mutations in protein_complexes results we present the structureppi system for the comprehensive analysis of coding snvs based on d protein_structures of protein_complexes the d repository used interactome d includes experimental and modeled structures for proteins and proteinprotein_complexes structureppi annotates snvs with features extracted from uniprot interpro appris dbnsfp and cosmic databases we illustrate the usefulness of structureppi with the interpretation of non synonymous snvs from cosmic and the g project that provides a collection of snvs mapped onto the protein d structure of human proteins of the swissprot curated proteins in uniprotkb release and proteinprotein_interfaces with potential functional_implications availability_and structureppi along with a user_manual and examples isavailable at http structureppi bioinfo cnio es structure the code for local installations at https github com rbbt workflowspredicting how single_nucleotide snv alters the function of protein products is a topic of growing interest in genomics and bioinformatics reviewed in one of the key limitations of the current computational_tools for the prediction of the impact of snvs is that proteinprotein_interactions are poorly considered or completely ignored this is surprising since we know that proteins work as part of protein_complexes and interaction networks and a number of databases with high_quality d structurally resolved protein interactome networks are available and increasingly used to understand human genetic_diseases for a recent review about this topic see in spite of this methods that allow a systematic analysis of snvs considering known functional_residues in spatial contact with the mutation and including full atom level description of proteinprotein_interfaces are not available indeed only a few methods e g pmut snpeffect snps d we present structureppi a system to facilitate the comprehensive analysis of cancer related snvs which combines d proteinfor more details the d protein complex interface between ensp and human liver x nuclear_receptor beta is also shown pdb id nqa structures of protein_complexes with functional_annotations from different databases the system implements the generally_accepted idea that strong indicators of positive_selection for tumorigenesis driver_mutations are located in functional_domain sites or they affect amino_acid that have been shown to be important by d protein_structure furthermore the system provides information about known functional_residues in close physical proximity to query snvs thus structureppi can provide both mechanistic and biological_insights into the role of snvs in a given cancer
