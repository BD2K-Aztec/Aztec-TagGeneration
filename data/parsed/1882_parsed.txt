sequence_analysis freeibis an efficient basecaller with calibrated quality_scores for illumina sequencers motivation the conversion of the raw intensities obtained from next_generation into nucleotide_sequences with well calibrated quality_scores is a critical step in the generation of good sequence_data while recent model based_approaches can yield highly_accurate calls they require a substantial amount of processing time and or computational_resources we previously_introduced ibis a fast and accurate basecaller for the illumina_platform we have continued active development of ibis to take into account developments in the illumina technology as well as to make ibis fully open_source results we introduce here freeibis which offers significant improvements in sequence accuracy owing to the use of a novel multiclass support_vector svm algorithm sequence quality_scores are now calibrated based on empirically_observed scores thus providing a high correlation to their respective error_rates these improvements result in downstream advantages including improved genotyping accuracy availability_and freeibis is freely_available for use under the gpl http bioinf eva mpg de freeibis it requires a python interpreter and a c compiler tailored versions of libocas and liblinear are distributed along with the package a crucial step in the illumina_sequencing pipeline is basecalling the generation of individual nucleotide_sequences and associated quality_scores which measure the probability of a sequencing_error from raw intensities the default basecaller provided by illumina bustard develops a model from the raw intensities and uses it to perform basecalling alternative basecallers aimed at achieving a better performance than bustard have been proposed these basecallers can be divided_into those that apply a modelling strategy like bustard naivebayescall or see das and vikalo for a faster implementation and all your base ayb and those that rely on supervised_learning approaches or intermediate approaches we introduce an update to our basecaller ibis freeibis replaces the restricted license svm library with libocas which is released under the gnu public license our results show that freeibis outperforms the previous version of our software in terms of sequence accuracy we measured how the decision score of the svm corresponded to the observed error_rate as measured by the number of mismatches for each predicted quality_score of control reads to their respective genome a function approximating this distribution is then used to assign quality_scores for individual bases the resulting scores show a high_level of correlation between their observed error_rate and the predicted one thus obviating the need for quality_score recalibration as a post_processing step we compare the newest versions of freeibis and ibis against the default basecaller for two genome_analyzer ii ga runs a hiseq run and a miseq run on a set of dna_sequences genotyped using both sanger and illumina sequencing_technologies freeibis provides an improvement in genotype accuracy over the default illumina basecaller
