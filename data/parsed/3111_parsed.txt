msa an r package for multiple_sequence although the r platform and the add on packages of the bioconductor_project are widely used in bioinformatics the standard task of multiple_sequence has been neglected so_far the msa package for the first time provides a unified r interface to the popular multiple sequence_alignment clustalw clustalomega and muscle the package requires no additional software and runs on all major platforms moreover the msa package provides an r interface to the powerful package shade which allows for flexible and customizable plotting of multiple_sequence availability_and msa is available via the bioconductor_project multiple_sequence is one of the most fundamental tasks in bioinformatics it serves as the basis for the detection of homologous regions for detecting motifs and conserved_regions for detecting structural building_blocks for constructing sequence_profiles and as an important prerequisite for the construction of phylogenetic_trees since exact methods scale exponentially with the number of aligned sequences approximative methods have been introduced that try to obtain decent yet not necessarily optimal alignments with reasonable computational effort clustalw is a classic but still very commonly used method t coffee and muscle b are other methods that are widely used clustalomega is a more recent top notch method that has been designed to align large_numbers of sequences in relatively short time for a more comprehensive_overview of multiple_sequence methods we refer to edgar and batzoglou and notredame all methods mentioned above are available as command_line programs or via web interfaces e g on the embl ebi server http www ebi ac uk tools msa however for the r platform that is widely used in bioinformatics the possibilities to perform multiple_sequence are limited the biostrings package which is the standard package for sequence_analysis within the bioconductor_project provides data_structures for storing and manipulating multiple_sequence but not methods for computing them only recently the muscle package that provides a simple interface to muscle has been released via bioconductor for other methods users still need to resort to external stand alone programs this article_presents msa an r package released as part ofbioconductor in april the package provides a unified interface to the three most common multiple_sequence methods and further integrates shade for customizable pretty printing of multiple_sequence
