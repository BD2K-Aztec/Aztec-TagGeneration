genome_analysis mlml consistent simultaneous estimates of dna_methylation and hydroxymethylation motivation the two major epigenetic_modifications of cytosines methylcytosine mc and hydroxymethylcytosine hmc coexist with each other in a range of mammalian cell_populations increasing evidence points to important roles of hmc in demethyla tion of mc and epigenomic regulation in development recently_developed experimental methods allow direct single base profiling of either hmc or mc meaningful analyses seem to require combining these experiments with bisulfite_sequencing but doing so naively produces inconsistent estimates of mc or hmc levels results we present a method to jointly_model read_counts from bisulfite_sequencing oxidative bisulfite_sequencing and tet assisted bisulfite_sequencing providing simultaneous estimates of hmc and mc levels that are consistent across experiment types dna_methylation is an important epigenetic mark in mammals in addition to the extensively_studied methylcytosine mc modification its oxidation product hydroxymethylcytosine hmc has been observed at substantial levels in both somatic and embryonic_stem recent_studies of hmc in mouse tet knock_out models mouse zygotic development and multiple cell_types suggest that hmc is involved in epigenetic_regulation the current most comprehensive and accurate method for profiling cytosine_methylation is bisulfite_sequencing bs_seq treatment with sodium_bisulfite converts unmethylated_cytosines to uracils but does not distinguish between mc and hmc and consequently the yield of methylation from bs_seq is the sum of mc and hmc levels two recently_developed techniques oxidative bisulfite_sequencing oxbs seq and tet assisted bisulfite_sequencing tab seq provide high_throughput singlebase resolution measurements of mc and hmc respectively any two of bs_seq tab seq or oxbs seq can be combined to profile both the mc and hmc methylomes of a cell_population and especially when studying hmc proper interpretation of results depends on having some estimate of the mc level however naive manipulation of read_count frequencies from independent sequencing_experiments often produces two kinds of overshoot problems in estimating mc and hmc levels when combining bs_seq with tab seq the mc level at a given cpg_site can be estimated by subtracting the hmc level tab seq from the combined mc hmc level bs_seq the result can be negative because of random_sampling or systematic_error in each experiment similarly combining tab seq and oxbs seq could lead to estimates of mc and hmc levels_exceeding these overshoot sites may constitute a substantial_proportion in one dataset based on oxbs seq technology of cpg_sites captured by reduced_representation rrbs and oxrrbs experiments exhibited overshoot to fully leverage the information in these data requires some method for making consistent estimates of mc and hmc levels we present maximum_likelihood methylation_levels mlml for simultaneous estimation of mc and hmc combining data from any two of bs_seq tab seq or oxbs seq or all three when available our estimates are consistent in that mc and hmc levels are non negative and never sum over in an important subset of cases our estimates are not only consistent but also show significantly greater_accuracy at sites with lower coverage to understand the properties of our estimators and the frequency method we used simulations with fixed coverage and precisely set levels for mc and hmc assuming the experiments were bs_seq and tab seq the case of bs_seq and oxbsseq is symmetric with the estimates for p h and p m exchanged for each valid combination of mc and hmc levels from f g we simulated from binomial distributions for both bs_seq and tab seq estimates for p h and p m were made using the maximum_likelihood method and the frequency method which estimate p h using h h g and p m using max t u t h h g the relative_error j p pj p for both estimation methods was computed and then averaged over simulations for each parameter combination the average estimation errors are presented in supplementary table s estimates of p h are more accurate using mlml especially at lower values of p h and low coverage for example when the true_values are p m p h the mlml reduces the average relative_error by at overshoot sites compared with frequency estimates when the coverage is and this reduction in error increases to for such sites covered only the trend for errors of p h estimates is shown in indicating the accuracy advantage for mlml as a function of coverage the simulation also revealed substantial_amounts of overshoot sites under different mc and hmc level combinations supplementary tables
