jassa a comprehensive tool for prediction of sumoylation sites and sims motivation post_translational by the small_ubiquitin sumo proteins a process termed sumoylation is involved in many fundamental_cellular sumo proteins are conjugated to a protein substrate creating an interface for the recruitment of cofactors harboring sumo interacting motifs sims mapping both sumo conjugation sites and sims is required to study the functional_consequence of sumoylation to define the best candidate sites for experimental_validation we designed jassa a joint analyzer of sumoylation site and sims results jassa is a predictor that uses a scoring system based on a position frequency matrix derived from the alignment of experimental sumoylation sites or sims compared with existing web_tools jassa displays on par or better performances novel features were implemented towards a better evaluation of the prediction including identification of database hits matching the query_sequence and representation of candidate sites within the secondary_structural and or the d fold of the protein of interest retrievable from deposited pdb files availability_and jassa is freely_accessible at http www jassa fr website is implemented in php and mysql with all_major contact sumoylation is a eukaryotic post_translational which consists in the reversible attachment of members of the small_ubiquitin sumo protein_family on a protein substrate resulting in the dynamic_regulation of its biochemical_properties proteins involved in many fundamental_cellular like dna_repair transcription control chromatin_organization macromolecular assembly and signal_transduction are sumoylated for a review see thus it is not surprising that deregulation of sumoylation is associated to various pathological_conditions like neurological_disorders cancers and pathogen proliferation for reviews sumo proteins are conjugated to a lysine k residue of the substrate through the sequential action of sumo specific activating e conjugating e and ligating e enzymes and de conjugation relies on sumo specific_proteases virtually all eukaryotes express sumo proteins mammals and plants harboring several paralogues and the components of the conjugation pathway are highly_conserved across eukaryote proteomes analysis of sumo targets shows that the modified k is often embedded within the consensus_sequence wkxe where w is a hydrophobic residue and x any amino_acid which is a binding_site for ubc the single e conjugating enzyme extended variants of this motif were described including negatively_charged amino_acid dependent sumoylation motifs ndsm phosphorylation dependent sumoylation motifs pdsm and phosphorylation sumoylation motif where a cluster of negatively_charged and or phosphorylatable residues downstream of the core motif promotes sumo conjugation by strengthening the interaction between the substrate and ubc sumoylation of the inverted consensus motif xkw was also reported however not every sequence conforming to the consensus motifs is modified likely because the environment of the target k must adopt a favorable conformation to be accessible to the sumo machinery notably modification by sumo occurs at nonconsensus sites this is the case for of the sumoylated substrates identified by the vertegaals group sumo creates an interface for the recruitment of protein cofactors that harbor short peptide_sequences known as sumointeracting motifs sims most sims feature a loose consensus_sequence composed of aliphatic residues often flanked by acidic and or phosphorylatable amino_acids the hydrophobic_core adopts a b strand conformation that can accommodate in a pocket formed by the a helix and the b strand of sumo adjacent negatively_charged control the affinity the polarity and the paraloguespecificity of the sim sumo interaction mapping sumo conjugation sites and sims is mandatory to fully characterize the biological_consequences of sumoylation large_scale mass_spectrometry ms based proteomic_studies allowed the identification of hundreds of proteins harboring sumoylation sites and or sims however the use of this approach is limited by the transient nature of the modification the small fraction of a protein that is sumoylated and the difficulty to identify branched peptides resulting for the tryptic_digestion of sumoylated proteins when ms data are not available computer_aided prediction of sumoylation sites and sims by in silico analysis represents a promising strategy to reduce the number of potential targets for experimental_verification we developed jassa joint analyzer of sumoylation site and sims to provide a comprehensive_overview of potential sumoylation sites and sims the prediction relies on a scoring system based on a position frequency matrix pfm derived from the alignment of experimentally_validated sequences when compared with existing bioinformatics_tools jassa displays on par or better predictive performances to increase the reliability of the prediction jassa offers additional features such as identification of database db hits matching the query_sequence systematic pattern search against extended motifs analysis of the physico_chemical of adjacent residues and when a pdb_file is available the possibility to represent candidate sites within the secondary_structural and the d fold of the query_protein we believe that jassa will provide a valuable support for selecting the best candidate sites for experimental_studies
