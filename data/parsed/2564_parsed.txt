data_and iphace integrative navigation in pharmacological space the increasing availability of experimentally_determined binding_affinities for drugs on multiple protein targets requires the design of specific mining and visualization_tools that graphically integrate chemical and biological data in an efficient environment with this aim we developed iphace an integrative web_based to navigate in the pharmacological space defined by small_molecule contained in the iuphar db with additional interactions present in pdsp extending beyond traditional querying and filtering tools iphace offers a means to extract knowledge from the target profile of drugs as well as from the drug profile of protein targets availability iphace is available atthe perception that drugs bind selectively to only a few biological_targets has been largely biased by the limited time and resources devoted to the systematic_screening of compounds against a large panel of proteins recent efforts towards generating compiling and storing pharmacological data for drugs are challenging this traditional perception as most drugs appear to have a rich polypharmacology in this respect data_repositories such as the psychoactive_drug screening_program pdsp drugbank iuphar db and pubchem have become essential public resources that provide up todate information on the binding_affinity profile of drugs the increasing amount of available data on drugtarget_interactions brings on the need to develop new interactive tools for data_integration and mining that can facilitate knowledge extraction all the above databases offer via individual web_sites the possibility to perform some degree of querying and filtering to enable data access in addition other resources such as sea supertarget stitch and drugviz provide purposely designed tools to analyse and visualize drugtarget relationships along these lines iphace represents a new integrative conceptual_framework to navigate in the pharmacological space covered by drugs the current release contains interactions between drugs and to whom correspondence should be addressed targets g_protein gpcrs and ion_channels extracted from iuphar db and pdsp the iphace navigator was designed to enable a multidisciplinary_team of drug_discovery scientists to visually process information on chemical_structures and biological_activities of drugs in an efficient organized and integrative manner as more data on the interaction of drugs with multiple_targets become available tools such as iphace are likely to deepen our understanding of both the polypharmacology of drugs and the cross pharmacology of targets
