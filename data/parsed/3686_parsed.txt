genetics_and predictive_models for population performance on real_biological fitness_landscapes motivation directed_evolution in addition to its principal application of obtaining novel biomolecules offers significant potential as a vehicle for obtaining useful information about the topologies of biomolecular fitness_landscapes in this article we make use of a special_type of model of fitness landscapesbased on finite_state machineswhich can be inferred from directed_evolution experiments importantly the model is constructed only from the fitness data and phylogeny not sequence or structural_information which is often absent the model called a landscape state machine lsm has already been used successfully in the evolutionary computation literature to model the landscapes of artificial optimization_problems here we use the method for the first time to simulate a biological fitness_landscape based on experimental evaluation results we demonstrate in this study that lsms are capable not only of representing the structure of model fitness_landscapes such as nk landscapes but also the fitness_landscape of real dna oligomers binding to a protein allophycocyanin data we derived from experimental_evaluations on microarrays the lsms prove adept at modelling the progress of evolution as a function of various controlling parameters as validated by evaluations on the real landscapes specifically the ability of the model to predict optimal mutation_rates and other parameters of the evolution is demonstrated a modification to the standard lsm also proves accurate at predicting the effects of recombination on the evolution a fitness_landscape is a conceptual visualization of the topographic relationship between a genotype and a static fitness_function a property that will determine reproductive rate the properties of the fitness_landscape relate to the behaviour of evolving populations and as such they have become integral tools in both to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as evolutionary_biology and evolutionary computation despite their long_term and widespread use the information pertaining to real_biological fitness_landscapes is currently limited as a consequence researchers interested in studying the dynamics of evolution are often forced to rely on in silico landscape models instead many artificial fitness_landscapes have attempted to model the properties of real biomolecular fitness_landscapes these have ranged from john maynard smiths simple word game metaphor for protein space to more complex models which incorporate properties such as ruggedness and neutrality the real fitness_landscapes of proteins are poorly_understood and so the accuracy of these simplistic models is unknown at the molecular level adaptive_evolution is routinely studied and exploited during the process of directed_evolution the steps within a directed_evolution experiment mimic darwinian processes within a lab and closely_resemble the structure of many standard genetic_algorithms methods used widely in computer science for optimization iterative cycles of mutation and or recombination and selection have led to the development of a plethora of novel or improved biological_entities this has been achieved without any guidance from a molecular level understanding of protein_function sequencing the intermediates produced during the course of a directed_evolution experiment reveals the series of modifications that have led to the new functionality this approach has provided new insights into the relationship between the sequence and function of proteins and how proteins may adapt during natural_evolution determining how properties such as selection_pressure mutation_rate and library size population will affect the success of future_experiments however would require extrapolation beyond these limited evaluations recently a study was undertaken to map the complete interaction profile of every possible base oligonucleotide with a fluorescent protein allophycocyanin using the ability to perform highly multiplexed assays afforded by microarrays based on over one million evaluations the data_set reveals a complete_sequence fitness_landscape this still represents a simple biomolecular interaction ideally a resource is desired that represents more complex_biological no doubt with the continuing development and availability of high_throughput sequencers and or microarrays even more extensive datasets will emerge over the coming months and years this potential development while exciting is only part of the battle however in order to understand something useful about the landscapes and the dynamics of evolution on them appropriate models or abstractions from the raw_data must be inferred in computer science in the field of evolutionary computation characterizing fitness_landscapes and how their features might affect evolutionary progress and dynamics is an area of intense study grefenstette and altenberg independently developed the idea of modelling predicting evolutionary progress from fitness distribution data using respectively simple regressions and search kernels to represent these distributions the landscape machine lsm was developed independently but is a concrete implementation of altenbergs search kernel it models the fitness_landscape of a particular abstract optimization_problem as a finite_state machine representing landscapes purely as collections of phenotypic states and describes transitions between these states as a consequence of mutation consider s is the collection of all possible fitness values within a landscape and s s s represents a value associated with an individual for simplicity a single_sequence when s the parents fitness is transformed by mutation a new value e e s the child is generated with a probability t se the probabilities of transformation between all points within s can be stored within a transition_matrix t and used to replace the real landscape in some cases the lsm can model these transitions exactly represents a simple maxones problem the states s represent values of solutions to the problem in which the aim is to optimize the number of s within a binary string of length l the states match the number of s within the string arcs indicate the transition_probabilities between these states when a single random bit is flipped or within a string such a model can act as a substitute for the real problem when assessing the performance of a genetic_algorithm in which candidate solutions variations of the string have been replaced by these states the success and speed of several different algorithms meaning different population_sizes different methods of biased selection different selection_pressures and so forth can then be assessed without the use of any genotypic information for more complex landscapes calculating these transitions or even storing a matrix of transitions between all points within s becomes intractable if this is the case points within s are pooled together into equally_spaced fitness intervals states and transition_probabilities are inferred from values generated by a sampling algorithm run on the real landscape using this approach landscape state machines have shown a high degree of accuracy and specificity in predicting the performance of different evolutionary algorithms on a range of optimization_problems studied in computer science lsms were proposed not only for the study of computer science optimization_problems but also with the intention of future use in directed_evolution in this article we begin to examine empirically their potential in this area for the first time until now no attempt has been made to model recombination_events using lsms this task is not a trivial extension to the scheme since populating a three_dimensional transition_matrix for the fitnesses of two parents and one child would require a much greater number of evaluations on the real landscape in other words the sampling will be at an even greater order of sparseness than with the standard lsm the lsm will also be limited in the algorithms it can assess because the sampling algorithm will only sample combinations of parents from a range dictated by the selection_pressure employed and the properties of the fitness_landscape we attempt to correct for these problems using a simple heuristic described in methods section the performances of a range of genetic_algorithms including those that incorporate recombination were assessed on both real landscapes and lsm abstractions of these landscapes nklandscapes with different levels of epistasis and a dnaprotein interaction landscape derived from real experimental_evaluations were both investigated the lsms proved adept at modelling the features of the landscapes with strong correlations between the relative performances of the lsms and the corresponding real_world algorithms the ability to model real_biological fitness_landscapes with sufficient fidelity to allow predictions of the most appropriate near optimal parameters of evolution mutation_rates recombination selection_pressures etc using fitness information alone seems to be an encouraging prospect for future progress in this area predicting the performance of genetic_algorithms using limited sampling is not a new concept and a multitude of statistics have been developed to characterise the features of landscapes and the consequent effects on algorithm performance these statistics tend to be self validating in that they are correct only in their own terms and require prior_knowledge of the landscape they are characterising in practice these predictors of genetic_algorithm hardness often underperform and are incapable even of determining whether a hillclimber an algorithm that accepts only beneficial changes will be more effective than a genetic_algorithm identifying whether a landscape is easy or hard to search using these measures gives almost no indication of how to tackle it currently the only way to tune algorithms for optimal_performance on a landscape is to assess the performance of these algorithms through trial and error lsms are abstractions of real landscapes based on limited sampling data allowing genetic_algorithm performance to be assessed as it would be on the real landscapes the ability of the lsm to characterize the landscape of interest can be directly measured by comparison of the performance of the genetic_algorithms on the landscapes and on the lsms the lsms in this study are capable of closely replicating algorithm performance on the landscape from which they are derived the cost of generating the models described here is high with the number of evaluations sampled from the experimental landscape similar to the number required to map the entire mer landscape in contrast no sequence_information is required to construct the lsms this makes lsms cheap to construct as by products of directed_evolution experiments which are more than capable of producing quantities of data of this magnitude it has previously been shown that accurate lsms can be constructed with far fewer real evaluations and an effective sampling algorithm can be beneficial to lsm accuracy in this study a sampling algorithm with a low mutation_rate was selected not for its performance on the landscape but because from this low mutation_rate a much greater range of mutation_rates can be assessed by the lsm through matrix multiplication this comes at a price higher mutation_rate transitions may not be sampled the predictions made on the performance of algorithms with much higher mutation_rates show only a small loss in accuracy which is remarkable given that any error within the transition_matrix is multiplied with every matrix multiplication the most important finding of this study has been that the simple structure of the lsm is capable of mimicking the features of a real_biological landscape derived from real experimental_data despite the noise that is inherent to such measurements and the complex sequence structural interactions it would be interesting to determine to what extent lsms can replicate real_biological fitness_landscapes and whether they can be extended to model non static and multiple fitness functions it may be necessary to modify the structure of the lsms as we have attempted here to model recombination for instance higher_order markov_models may be more appropriate for highly neutral and epistatic landscapes further landscape state machines are not limited to studying static mutation_rates but could also be applied to dynamic mutation_rates and could feasibly be implemented in memetic algorithms directed_evolution experiments give an insight into the process of molecular_evolution that is unobtainable at the level of whole organisms parent and child fitness values have previously been used to make quantitative assessments of biomolecular fitness_landscapes through measures such as autocorrelation lsms go beyond simple landscape metrics providing an abstraction of the real systems upon which further experiments can be performed with the onset of high_throughput methodologies for the assessment of modified transformed peptides proteins and cells lsms can make use of this deluge of data in a tractable manner independent of any sequence or structural_information the resulting lsms may serve as a resource to researchers studying molecular_evolution providing a platform beyond simplistic and often unrealistic model landscapes in this study we extended lsms to generate d structures capable of modelling recombination in genetic_algorithms using several matrices representing different mutation_rates serially can permit the assessment of algorithms with dynamic mutation_rates and there is no reason to suggest that the structure of the lsms could not be extended to model multiple fitness functions simultaneously experiments performed using nk landscapes and an experimental landscape indicates lsms represent a promising tool in both evolutionary computation and evolutionary_biology
