structural_bioinformatics prediction of peptides binding to the pka rii subunit using a hierarchical strategy motivation favorable interaction between the regulatory_subunit of the camp_dependent pka and a peptide in a kinase anchoring proteins akaps is critical for translocating pka to the subcellular sites where the enzyme phosphorylates its substrates it is very hard to identify akaps peptides binding to pka due to the high sequence_diversity of akaps results we propose a hierarchical and efficient approach which combines molecular_dynamics md_simulations free_energy virtual mutagenesis vm and bioinformatics analyses to predict peptides binding to the pka rii regulatory_subunit in the human_proteome systematically our approach successfully retrieved out of documented rii binding_peptides literature curation supported that many newly predicted peptides might be true akaps here we present the first systematic_search for akap peptides in the human_proteome which is useful to further experimental identification of akaps and functional analysis of their biological_roles contact it is critical to understand how the functions of kinases are regulated a classic kinase is camp_dependent also known as protein_kinase pka pka is a heterotetramer composed of two catalytic c subunits and two regulatory r subunits the regulatory_subunit r has four isoforms ri ri rii and rii each r subunit contains an n_terminal dimerization docking d d domain followed by an inhibitor site and two tandem camp binding_domains the d d domain is a four anti_parallel helix_bundle which provides a stable and hydrophobic_surface for peptides in a kinase anchoring proteins akaps the proteinprotein_interaction between the pka r subunit dimer and akap makes the enzyme locate at the subcellular sites where it phosphorylates the substrates to initiate downstream signal_transduction to whom correspondence should be addressed it is no doubt that the identification of akaps is critical for understanding the functional_roles of pka akaps share similar functional properties but have quite diverse sequences and structures which makes it extremely_difficult to identify akap proteins solely based on sequence or structural_similarity consequently only a limited number of akaps have been identified so_far in human numerous computational_approaches have been developed to predict the binding_peptides of modular domains such as sh sh ww and pdz the success of these approaches on various systems demonstrated the efficiency of the computational_methods to predict the transient and weak binding between protein_domains and peptides since there are not many known akap peptides and no sequence_motif for akap peptides has been detected it is not straightforward to apply these methods to identify pkaakap interactions here we developed a hierarchical_approach by integrating information of binding_free calculation secondary_structure transmembrane tm prediction and sequence_conservation analyses of candidate peptides to predict putative akaps in the human_genome since only crystal_structure between akap peptide and pka rii is available here we focused on predicting akaps specific for rii our approach is readily_applicable to identify the binding_partners of other regulatory_subunit isoforms of pka as well our approach includes the following steps i the swissprot database was screened to find potential akap peptides using a position_specific pssm derived from the virtual mutagenesis vm b results and prior_knowledge ii secondary_structure for each candidate peptide was predicted and the peptides without helices were removed of the known akap peptides were predicted to form helices iii tm domain for each candidate peptide was predicted and the peptides located within tm regions were removed all known akap peptides were predicted outside tm regions and iv conservation analysis across seven vertebrate_species was conducted on each remaining peptide and the nonconserved ones were removed all known akap peptides are conserved the top putative akap peptides predicted from the human_proteome included the known ones literature curation also suggested that our predictions are able to identify new akap peptides we believe that this systematic prediction of akap peptides from the
