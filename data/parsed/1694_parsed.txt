genome_analysis exploiting sequence_similarity to validate the sensitivity of snp_arrays in detecting fine scaled copy_number motivation high_density snp_genotyping are efficient and cost_effective platforms for the detection of copy_number cnv to ensure accuracy in probe synthesis and to minimize production_costs short oligonucleotide probe_sequences are used the use of short probe_sequences limits the specificity of binding targets in the human_genome the specificity of these short probeset sequences has yet to be fully analysed against a normal reference human_genome sequence_similarity can artificially elevate or suppress copy_number measurements and hence reduce the reliability of affected probe readings for the purpose of detecting narrow cnvs reliably down to the width of a single probeset sequence_similarity is an important issue that needs to be addressed results we surveyed the affymetrix human mapping snp_arrays for probeset sequence_similarity against the reference human_genome utilizing sequence_similarity results we identified a collection of fine scaled putative cnvs between gender from autosomal probesets whose sequence matches various loci on the sex_chromosomes to detect these variations we utilized our statistical_approach dectecting recurrent copy_number change using rank order_statistics drecs and showed that its performance was superior and more stable than the t test in detecting cnvs through the application of drecs on the hapmap population datasets with multi matching probesets filtered we identified biologically_relevant snps in aberrant regions across populations with known association to physical traits such as height covered by the span of a single_probe this provided empirical confirmation of the existence of naturally_occurring narrow cnvs as well as the sensitivity of the affymetrix snp_array technology in detecting them availability the matlab_implementation of drecs is available atthe importance of copy_number cnv in influencing phenotypic_differences and disease_susceptibility has been well established in a number of studies in determining cnvs that are more likely to have a causal_association with phenotypes and disease_predisposition it is important to focus on recurrent copy_number cn changes present in multiple samples recurrent cn changes are those that are consistent in an assumed homogeneous_population as well as those that stratify heterogeneous sub populations an ongoing challenge is the reliable and efficient detection of these changes both variations and aberrations down to the resolution provided by the microarray_technology high_throughput microarrays based on single_nucleotide snps are an effective platform for analysing cnv in recent_years the resolution of snp_arrays has grown exponentially while the cost of experiments continued to fall making these a feasible high_resolution platform to conduct cnv studies involving a large number of samples snp_arrays such as those by affymetrix typically limit the length of probe_sequences to mers to ensure accuracy in probe synthesis as well as to keep manufacturing costs down a probeset consists of a collection of probes at a short_distance offset from each other covering typically a span of mers the use of short probeset sequences results in reduced specificity towards the targeted genomic locus and this in turn degrades the signal_quality of the intended target in proportion to the number of unintended loci matched however the uniqueness or similarity of each probeset sequence on existing snp_arrays with respect to the reference human_genome is not a fully explored aspect of snp_array quality this is the focus of our first contribution in this article we determined the sequence_similarity for each and every probeset on all affymetrix snp_array variants by sequence_matching the two allelic versions of each flanking probeset sequence against the reference human genome_assembly ncbi the result provides an interesting insight in terms of target uniqueness and can be used directly as a quality filter to remove multi matching probesets prior to performing cn analysis in assessing the performance of various methods for the detection of recurrent cnv it is often useful to have a set of ground_truth labels that serve as an approximate gold_standard our second contribution in this article is the derivation of a set of approximate ground_truth labels from probeset sequence_similarity for the detection of putative cnv in normal gender samples the advantage of using this set of labels is that they are based on naturally_occurring cn imbalances in gender and are not based on artificially implanted peaks or spikes against simulated gaussian_noise as a background additionally the labels of putative cnv cover both narrow as well as longer contiguous regions of cn change which provides some form of natural diversity in the data that may not be captured as closely in synthetically simulated_data finally since these labels are based on dna sequence_similarity the putative cnvs across gender will be recurrent in the majority of samples and not just a small subset of samples this essentially is a perfect fit for the nature of cn change that we aim to detect our third contribution is dectecting recurrent copy_number change using rank order_statistics drecs a statistical_approach for the detection of recurrent cn variation aberration in multiple samples it is based on a normalized rank transformation of raw log ratios i e replacing raw log ratios with their cumulative probability density to reduce the impact of outlying measurements this effectively transforms the distribution of the raw log ratios to a discrete uniform_distribution for consistent estimation of variance and computation of statistical_significance we have evaluated the effectiveness of drecs in terms of bullet its sensitivity specificity accuracy and area_under auc in detecting putative cn difference across gender as described previously using the t test as a benchmark bullet its consistency in performance on both raw log and segmented cn as inputs bullet its scalability to sample_size and array resolution and bullet its ability to identify fine scaled regions of cnv with known biological_significance in our final contribution we show the existence of recurrent cnv in the hapmap populations e g in single snps with known association to physical traits such as height and freckles this empirically validates the effectiveness of drecs in identifying recurrent cnv that stratify populations down to the resolution of the microarray and also highlights the sensitivity of the snp microarray in detecting regions of narrow cnv in section we describe our approach in identifying the extent of sequence_similarity to the human_genome across every variant of the affymetrix snp_array in section we use the knowledge of sequence_similarity to derive ground_truth labels of putative cn change to help us assess the performance of our statistical_approach drecs section in detecting recurrent cnv in section we evaluate the performance of drecs under various experimental_conditions with the t test as a benchmark and apply drecs to detect known cn polymorphisms we conclude the section with a short discussion on two biologically_relevant cnvs identified
