genetics_and compression and fast retrieval of snp data motivation the increasing interest in rare genetic_variants and epi static genetic effects on complex phenotypic_traits is currently pushing genome_wide association study_design towards datasets of increasing size both in the number of studied subjects and in the number of genotyped_single snps this in turn is leading to a compelling need for new methods for compression and fast retrieval of snp data results we present a novel algorithm and file_format for compressing and retrieving snp data specifically_designed for large_scale association studies our algorithm is based on two main ideas i compress linkage_disequilibrium blocks in terms of differences with a reference snp and ii compress reference snps exploiting information on their call rate and minor_allele tested on two snp datasets and compared with several state of the art software_tools our compression algorithm is shown to be competitive in terms of compression_rate and to outperform all tools in terms of time to load compressed data availability_and our compression and decompres sion algorithms are implemented in a c library are released under the gnu_general and are freely downloadable froma genome_wide gwas measures a large set of common_genetic mainly in the form of single_nucleotide snps across different individuals to see whether any variant is associated with a phenotypic trait promising examples of gwas findings that may soon be translated into clinical care are starting to emerge including variants that provide strongly predictive or prognostic_information or that have important pharmacological implications gwass however have brought insight on what is known as the missing_heritability problem almost without exception only a small part of the genetic_variance estimated from the data can actually be explained with association results of gwass apart from environmental and epigenetic interactions the genetic_component of phenotypic_traits is now believed to be attributed to larger numbers of small effect common_variants large effect rare_variants or probably to a combination of the two this has induced an increase in both the number of required samples and the number of measured markers genomes in a gwas often resorting to new technologies such as next_generation this in turn is leading to a compelling need for new methods for effective compression and fast retrieval of snp data for this purpose the widely used whole genome_analysis tool plink has introduced the binary ped bed format which requires only bits to store the information on one genotype however the achieved compression_rate is often not sufficient with large_datasets still requiring several gigabytes for storage on disk bed files can be further processed with all purpose compression tools like zip or gzip which often achieve rather high compression_rates the drawback of this solution however is the need to fully decompress the files before accessing the data thus requiring both additional computational time and additional disk_space for the temporary storage of uncompressed data the majority of the methods proposed in the literature for the storage and retrieval of dna data are designed to compress the entire_genome of a small number of subjects and rely on the presence of a reference_genome and or of a reference variation map such methods however are unfit for gwas data where the number of subjects is much higher and the proportion of identical base_pairs between subjects is much lower proposes an efficient algorithm for compressing collections of haplotypes which however requires genetic_sequences to be phased propose a software_tool tgc for compressing collections of snps and indels by positively exploiting similarities in the whole collection however the tool still requires genetic data to be fully decompressed before accession and together with the aforementioned methods it suffers from the large overhead required for storing a reference_genome to the best of our knowledge the problem of compressing gwas data has only been directly addressed bywith the speedgene software_tool the authors propose an algorithm for compressing each snp according to the most effective among three types of coding algorithms or codes designed to exploit the peculiar properties of the genotype distribution of each snp in the compression process by compressing one snp at a time however the speedgene approach does not take into account the strong local_similarity typical of snp data linkage_disequilibrium the object of this work is to develop a novel algorithm for the compression and fast retrieval of snp data decomposing the to whom correspondence should be addressed problem in two tasks i summarizing linkage_disequilibrium ld blocks of snps in terms of differences with a common nearby snp and ii compress such snps exploiting information on their call rate and minor_allele the latter task is accomplished by means of five compression codes two of which are inspired by some ideas frombut are designed with a more compact_representation we test our algorithm on two datasets namely a set of subjects from the wellcome_trust case_control wellcome_trust case control and the millions of snps genotyped by the genomes_project genomes compared with the widely used analysis tool plink the speedgene software for snp compression and retrieval the general compression tool gzip and the specific genetic compression tool tgc our algorithm is shown to outperform the two former tools in terms of storage space and all considered tools in terms of time to load the data in this article we presented a novel algorithm and file_format for the compression and fast retrieval of snp data our algorithm is based on two main ideas summarize ld blocks in terms of differences with a reference snp and compress reference snps with the best among five types of codes designed to exploit the information on the call rate and minor_allele of the snps we compared our algorithm with one of the most widely_adopted tools for genetic data analysis the plink software with the state of the art in gwas data compression and retrieval the speedgene software with the general compression tool gzip and with the specific genetic compression tool tgc our algorithm was shown to outperform the two former tools in terms of storage space and all the other tools in terms of time to load the data on two representative datasets furthermore among the analysed tools only our algorithm and gzip accomplish truly lossless_compression and were able to process both datasets within the gb_memory limit the algorithm has been implemented as an open_source c software library to facilitate its integration into newly_developed genetic_analysis software tools based on our library could sit in the gwas analysis_pipeline right after variant_calling and implement for example data quality_control or association analysis effectively exploiting the reduction in storage space and time to load the data granted by our library and file_format the library directly processes snp data in the widely used plink binary format and thus does not require additional effort for preprocessing the output of our software consists in a pck file containing compressed snp data and in a pair of bim and fam text_files identical to the ones of the plink binary format rather than extreme compression we decided to favour the readability of our file_format and the speed of data_retrieval this has motivated several design choices retain the familiar bim and fam text_files in the output save the byte size of each compressed snp at the beginning of the pck file thus adding a size overhead to facilitate data access limit to one the depth of the summary in the compression algorithm thus allowing data decompression with only two passes of the entire file percentage of the number of snps coded as reference or summarized first two columns and percentage of the total file size occupied by reference snps by summarized snps by the overhead in the compressed file and by the the creation of the summary i e the choice of which snps should be coded as reference and of which snps should be summarized by each reference is at the core of our compression algorithm in general finding the optimal summary is an npcomplete problem the current version of our algorithm solves the problem with a greedy approach which performs sufficiently well thanks to the strong locality of genetic_information however we intend to further study the problem from an optimization point_of to understand whether more advanced solutions could be designed another future direction will be to extend our compression framework to more expressive file_formats such as the gen format used by the analysis tools snptest and impute and the vcf together with its binary counterpart bcf the former format particularly effective for complex meta_analysis problems where data are aggregated from multiple genotyping_platforms and several snps are imputed allows one to assign probability_values to the three genotypes of each snp in each subject the latter format on the other hand is the current standard for representing genetic_variation in the form of snps indels and larger structural_variants together with additional quantitative information originating from next_generation such as read_depth the seminal idea will be to exploit the redundancy of neighbouring variants across a collection of individuals to effectively store reduced representations of both allele probability_distributions and read_counts
