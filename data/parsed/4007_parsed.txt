riboswitch scanner an efficient phmm based web_server to detect riboswitches in genomic_sequences riboswitches are non coding rna located in the untranslated_regions where they bind a target_metabolite used to specify the riboswitch class and control the expression of associated genes accurate identification of riboswitches is the first step towards understanding their regulatory and functional_roles in the cell in this article we describe a new web_application named riboswitch scanner which provides an automated pipeline for phmm based detection of riboswitches in partial as well as complete genomic_sequences rapidly with high_sensitivity availability_and riboswitch scanner can be freely accessed on the web atriboswitches are cis_regulatory genomic_segments that control the expression of downstream_genes by undergoing conformational changes on ligand_binding they are mainly found in bacteria but have also been detected in a few eukaryotes riboswitches are categorized into different classes according to the type of ligand and secondary_structure high sequence level conservation and structural_similarity are found in the aptamer domain of the riboswitches belonging to the same class riboswitches control the expression of genes that are involved in biosynthesis and transport of the ligands as well as transcription_factors in view of their important regulatory_role in bacteria and a few eukaryotes it is essential to develop tools for accurate identification of different classes of riboswitches several approaches have been developed for computational identifications of riboswitches an influential and one of the earliest programs adapted for riboswitch search is infernal based on the covariance model cm rfam databases are dependent on cms for annotation of ncrnas but construction of cms is computationally_expensive and accuracy of cm is sensitive to the quality of input multiple_sequence and no user_friendly riboswitch specific web_servers are available for this method ribex abreu is a web_based capable of detecting riboswitches based on sequence_motifs that are unique to a specific class it is less sensitive for riboswitch classes that are characterized by short_length and simple sequence_motifs the ribosw web_server is able to identify classes of riboswitches based on the structural conformations and sequence_conservation within the functional region but tpp and cobalamin riboswitches are difficult to detect with their method limitation of all these web_tools is that they impose upper_bounds on the length of the input_sequences and none of these tools are capable of detecting riboswitch from whole genome_sequences the denison riboswitch detector drd webserver was developed to predict classes of riboswitches from dna_sequences based on a dynamic_programming the drd algorithm considers mismatches which are likely to yield more false_positives recently a riboswitch identification method was proposed v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com b that combines the accuracy of structure based_predictions with the speed of sequence_based by exploiting an inverse rna_folding problem solver in this application note we describe a new web_based for accurate detection of riboswitches using a method based on profile_hidden phmm these are appropriate for modeling sequence_profiles and searching databases for remotely homologous_sequences by exploiting the high_level of sequence conservations of the aptamer domain in every class of riboswitches we had previously demonstrated that phmm methods are able to identify potential riboswitches in whole genome_sequences accurately and much faster than infernal cms search the latest infernal package currently available which uses accelerated phmm and hmm banded cm alignment_methods and has reduced cm search times compared with older infernal versions with little cost to detection sensitivity however if for searching sequences with cms the e value calibration step is needed the computing time of cm models increases substantially construction of riboswitch models to search of sequence_databases require less computing time with phmms with this motivation we developed a phmm based web_application named riboswitch scanner for predicting putative riboswitches along with their locations in genomic_sequences for classes of riboswitches moreover users can also search new riboswitch classes riboswitch scanner detects the putative riboswitches with higher accuracy than other available web_based tools for riboswitch discovery therefore the riboswitch scanner provides more efficient alternative riboswitch detection tool that assist in the development of automated genome_annotations the webserver allows the user to submit nucleotide_sequences in fasta_format the input_sequence can be a segment of a genome such as a utr region of a gene or the complete genome the user can input the sequence by pasting it in the textbox or by using the file upload facility more than one riboswitch class can be selected at a time by checking the appropriate boxes besides each class in order to search for riboswitches beyond the classes listed the user can select the other option in the riboswitch family sections and create their own riboswitch classes by uploading at least four seed sequences in fasta_format this generates the phmm for the new class and searches the input_sequence for instances of this user_defined riboswitch the results of riboswitch searches for each of the selected riboswitch classes in the main strand and complementary_strand of the genome are returned in the output page in a userfriendly format if the selected family of riboswitch is present in the genome the riboswitch locations e value and phmm score is generated for every detected riboswitch riboswitch sequences based on locations are extracted and given in the output page supplementary_file shows a sample output page the secondary_structures based on minimum_free of riboswitches predicted by phmm are provided using dot bracket notations rnafold generated folded structure for each of the predicted riboswitches and the consensus secondary_structure image courtesy of rfam of the selected riboswitch family can be downloaded in a zip file from the link provided in the output page the secondary_structure images obtained using rnafold are named in the format seq startposition endposition riboswitch so that they can be easily correlated with the corresponding hits listed in the output page therefore the user can further verify the phmm predicted riboswitches by comparing the folding pattern of the predicted riboswitches with the consensus rfam image of this riboswitch family the performance of the tool for all classes was evaluated through fold cross_validations in fold cross_validations each class of riboswitch seed sequence_datasets was randomly divided_into five sets the training and testing of every class has been carried_out five times each time using one distinct set for training and remaining four sets for testing the overall performance of a riboswitch model is the average performance over five sets in comparison with other available web_based tools for riboswitch detection riboswitch scanner detects riboswitches with higher sensitivity sensitivity_and of riboswitch scanner for all classes of riboswitches and relative comparison of sensitivity of riboswitch scanner with other existing web_based tools are given in the supplementary_file sensitivity_and are calculated based on the predictions of rfam seed sequences
