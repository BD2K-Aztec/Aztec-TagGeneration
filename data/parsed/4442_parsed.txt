stronger findings for metabolomics through bayesian modeling of multiple peaks and compound correlations motivation data analysis for metabolomics suffers from uncertainty because of the noisy measurement technology and the small_sample of experiments noise and the small_sample lead to a high_probability of false findings further individual compounds have natural_variation between samples which in many cases renders them unreliable as biomarkers however the levels of similar compounds are typically highly_correlated which is a phenomenon that we model in this work results we propose a hierarchical_bayesian for inferring differences between groups of samples more accurately in metabolomic_studies where the observed compounds are collinear we discover that the method decreases the error of weak and non existent covari ate effects and thereby reduces false_positive to achieve this the method makes use of the mass_spectral peak data by clustering similar peaks into latent compounds and by further clustering latent compounds into groups that respond in a coherent way to the experimental covariates we demonstrate the method with three simulated studies and validate it with a metabolomic benchmark_dataset availability_and an implementation in r is available at http research ics aalto fi mi software peakanova contact samuel kaski aalto fi changes in metabolite_concentrations provide insights into disturbances in biological_processes that take place in organisms changes in the metabolome are informative especially about nutrition and metabolism ore sic sic and about the immune system chromatography coupled mass_spectrometry is the standard measurement technology for the untargeted quantification of metabolites and other small_molecules the spectral_data from the measurement device are known to be noisy with various sources of uncertainty katajamaa and ore sic sic starting from sample_preparation and compound ionization and ending at peak identification annotation and summarization however the spectra also have structure that is useful for the inference of differences between groups of samples because of the high_level of noise excessive false discovery has been highlighted among the main risks in the analysis of metabolomic_data on the other hand weak changes are likely to go undetected from observations of individual compounds singular_value svd based dimensionality_reduction techniques such as analysis_of anova simultaneous component analysis asca have been proposed to identifying interpretable associations between experimental covariates and multivariate changes in the metabolome however as the decomposition in asca operates on the covariate_effects of the standard anova model the method does not improve the quantification of the covariate_effects compared with the standard model further svd has been applied to interpreting changes in the variance of the samples in association to the covariates again building on the standard anova model outside metabolomics structured anova type models have been proposed to improve the inference of covariate_effects a gaussian_process based anova model for spatial data enables the inference of smooth covariate_effects for nearby data_points and a dependent dirichlet_process mixture of anova models can identify substructure in a designed experiment with lowdimensional observations of the outcome for metabolomics a bayesian clustering model has recently been proposed for improving the inference of covariate_effects through the integration of multiple same source spectral peaks individual spectral peaks have been argued to be unreliable for the statistical_analysis because of their high_level of noise although the mass_spectrometer produces multiple peaks that arise from one compound there so_far are only few methods to integrate these additional observations used multiple peaks to enhance peak annotation addressing a major source of error in the analysis of metabolomic_data the recently_proposed multipeak model for the inference of covariate_effects is to our knowledge the first systematic approach for using additional peaks in the statistical_analysis of intensity data in this work we aim at reducing the risk of false associations between experimental covariates and the observed metabolome we propose a structured anova type model that benefits both from the multiple spectral peaks produced by the mass_spectrometer and from the collinear structure of metabolomic_data because of the collinearity that arises from the compounds concurrent involvement in biological_processes it is reasonable to model individual compounds as members of coherent groups of compounds to whom

we show that by not only clustering spectral peaks into latent compounds but in addition by clustering these compounds into coherently responding latent groups we can detect weak covariate_effects in the data more accurately next we show that we can benefit from the inherent structure of the mass_spectral in two ways first we can make the inference of compound specific covariate_effects more accurate by using multiple peaks from the compound second in the regime of low_signal we can further improve the accuracy by imposing stronger structure on the model and infer the covariate_effects on groups of coherently responding compounds we present experimental_results on simulated_data and metabolomic benchmark data with known changes in the concentrations of chemical_compounds in the experiments we compare three approaches for the inference of covariate_effects single peak the standard anova model where the covariate_effects are computed as the average difference of the intensity of a single peak between the sample groups level a bayesian_approach for inferring the covariate_effects using data from multiple spectral peaks level the bayesian_approach proposed in this work for inferring the covariate_effects through the two level clustering of peaks and coherently responding compounds we evaluate each approach by its accuracy at inferring the covariate_effects the accuracy is measured in terms of the mean squared error mse additional spectral peaks produced by the mass_spectrometer as a result of the ionization process have been shown to be useful for the inference of covariate_effects when multiple peaks can be confidently associated with one compound however even with multiple peaks supporting the inference small covariate_effects may be hidden under the between sample variation we addressed this problem by introducing stronger structure to the model of the covariate_effects thereby regularising the covariate_effects and making them less dependent on the variation of individual compounds we achieved an improvement in the accuracy of the inferred covariate_effects by assuming a structure of coherently responding compounds in the data we proposed a structured model for inferring covariate_effects for groups of compounds through two layers of probabilistic clustering metabolomic_data are known to have collinear structure for similar compounds this phenomenon is argued to arise from the biological_processes that the compounds are involved in however the method proposed in this work does not restrict the groups of compounds by their chemical or biological similarity but infers the groups only based on their responses to the covariates in the experiments we showed that the two level model proposed in this work decreases the error of inferred covariate_effects in a typical setting where the true effects are small or diminishing through three simulated experiments testing the approaches with multiple zero effect clusters varying effect_size and varying number of similarly responding compounds we demonstrated that the two level model is more accurate at inferring weak covariate_effects from noisy multipeak data when compared with the two comparison approaches the outcome was repeated on a metabolomic benchmark_dataset with known changes in the compound concentrations following the reduction in the error for the weak covariate_effects the two level model is argued to reduce false findings to further improve the consistency of the inferred covariate_effects we suggest the following avenues of research i prior_knowledge about the similarity of the compounds can be incorporated into the prior of the higher_level clustering either in terms of the biological_processes in which the compounds are involved or in terms of the chemical similarity of the compounds ii the lower level clustering can be improved to detect even the weakest peaks by incorporating prior_knowledge about the relative positions of the peaks associated with one compound this is possible thanks to the fact that the expected positions of many adduct and isotope peaks can be calculated based on the ionization process and the chemical formula of the compound respectively iii the covariate_effects in the isotope peaks are argued to be highly preserved because the isotope peaks do not arise from variation in the ionization process additionally the expected relative heights of these peaks can be calculated if the identitynumber of compounds per cluster rmse the error in the covariate effect inferred by the compound clustering model level decreased when more coherently responding compounds were observed the accuracy of the peak clustering model and the data based single peak approach level and single peak respectively remained_constant root_mean rmse is shown as a function of the number of compounds i e lower level clusters per higher_level cluster result from the third simulated experiment section where a weak covariate effect of was generated and the number of compounds was gradually_increased from to note the two level and one level models and the single peak approach level level and single respectively are compared by their mse between the inferred and the true covariate effect the smallest mse for each true effect is highlighted in bold the significance of the difference between the two level model and the two comparison approaches is tested with the two sided paired_t with the benjaminihochberg correction for the p values a near zero value below the machine accuracy is denoted
