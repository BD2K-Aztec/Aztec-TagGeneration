automatic reconstruction of d neuron structures using a graph augmented deformable model motivation digital reconstruction of d neuron structures is an important step toward reverse_engineering the wiring and functions of a brain however despite a number of existing_studies this task is still challenging especially when a d microscopic image has low single to noise ratio and discontinued segments of neurite patterns results we developed a graph augmented deformable model gd to reconstruct trace the d structure of a neuron when it has a broken structure and or fuzzy boundary we formulated a variational problem using the geodesic shortest_path which is defined as a combination of euclidean_distance exponent of inverse intensity of pixels along the path and closeness to local centers of image intensity_distribution we solved it in two steps we first used a shortest_path graph algorithm to guarantee that we find the global optimal_solution of this step then we optimized a discrete deformable curve model to achieve visually more satisfactory reconstructions within our framework it is also easy to define an optional prior curve that reflects the domain_knowledge of a user we investigated the performance of our method using a number of challenging d neuronal image datasets of different model_organisms including fruit_fly caenorhabditis_elegans and mouse in our experiments the gd method outperformed several comparison methods in reconstruction_accuracy consistency robustness and speed we further used gd in two real applications namely cataloging neurite morphology of fruit_fly to build a d standard digital neurite atlas and estimating the synaptic bouton density along the axons for a mouse_brain availability the software is provided as part of the v d neuron package freely_available penglab janelia org proj v d contact pengh janelia hhmi orga major engineering challenge recognized by the national academy of engineering is to reverse_engineer a brain to achieve such a goal we would need a number of enabling techniques of which one of the fundamental computational_techniques is to precisely digitize the d morphological structure of a neuron acquired through various microscopy methods such as laser_scanning this process is often called neuron reconstruction or tracing there are a number of existing_studies on neuron tracing one may use structure elements spheres cylinders as image matching templates to progressively fit and march along a neuron structure proposed a to whom correspondence should be addressed ray bursting algorithm to cast rays in the bright image regions to approximate a neuron structure assembled multiple detected center skeletons of a neuron as the complete d structure interactive tracing was also considered the widely used neurolucida software mbf bioscience provides a method to reconstruct a neuron manually in d used the live wire algorithm in d semiautomatic online tracing in our v d system http penglab janelia org proj v d we also provide an efficient d semiautomatic interactive neuron tracing and editing method fibrous_tissue segmentation_methods for other medical_images and bioimages e g electron microscopy_images are also relevant to neuron tracing for instance partial_differential and mathematical morphology methods for blood_vessel tracing e g can be used for neurons as well in this article we focus on a hard case of d neuron reconstruction where a d microscopic image had low single tonoise ratio and or broken and fuzzy neurite patterns that are due to the intrinsic punctuated neurite structures e g synaptic boutons or imperfectness of sample_preparation such datasets are common for the nervous_systems of different animals for instance the punctuated and thus often broken neurites can be ubiquitously seen in the single_neuron images of drosophila_melanogaster fruit_fly and caenorhabditis_elegans and b and the multiaxon staining of a mouse_brain the high_level of background_noise in an image can also lead to broken and fuzzy neurites e g in these challenging situations the methods summarized above often fail our intuition to solve this problem is to combine both global and local cues the global information will guide the finer scale optimization using local information we formulate a graph augmented deformable gd model based on the geodesic shortest_path and produce satisfactory tracing by first optimizing a shortest_path graph problem followed by refining a d deformable curve within the gd framework it is also easy to incorporate an investigators prior_knowledge e g the starting and ending locations for tracing the shape prior of a d reconstruction etc in a number of experiments using both synthetic data and real neuronal patterns of different model_organisms including fruit_fly c elegans and mouse our method outperforms several comparison methods in terms of accuracy consistency robustness and speed we also applied gd to building a d neurite pattern atlas for the fruit_fly brain and to estimating synaptic bouton density in a mouse_brain
