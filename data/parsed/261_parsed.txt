genetics_and a multivariate bernoulli model to predict dnasei hypersensitivity status from haplotype_data motivation haplotype models enjoy a wide_range in population inference and disease_gene the hidden_markov traditionally used for haplotypes are hindered by the dubious assumption that dependencies occur only between consecutive pairs of variants in this article we apply the multivariate bernoulli mvb distribution to model haplotype_data the mvb distribution relies on interactions among all sets of variants thus allowing for the detection and exploitation of long_range and higher_order interactions we discuss penalized estimation and present an efficient algorithm for fitting sparse versions of the mvb distribution to haplotype_data finally we showcase the benefits of the mvb model in predicting dnasei hypersensitivity dh statusan epigenetic mark describing chromatin accessibilityfrom population scale haplotype_data results we fit the mvb model to real_data from individuals on whom both haplotypes and dh status in lymphoblastoid_cell are publicly_available the model allows prediction of dh status from genetic data prediction r in cross_validations comparisons of prediction under the mvb model with prediction under linear_regression best linear unbiased prediction and logistic_regression demonstrate that the mvb model achieves about higher prediction r than the two competing_methods in empirical data availability_and software implementing the method described can be down loaded ataccidents of history and variable recombination_rates have divided the human_genome into blocks of shared recent ancestry ancestry sharing manifests itself in complex haplotype patterns and strong dependencies among variants recall that a haplotype summarizes the sequence of alleles displayed by the sampled markers in a narrow genomic_region of a particular chromosome therefore modeling haplotype_data is of paramount_importance for a wide_range of problems in population_genetics and disease_gene haplotypes have been traditionally analyzed by hidden_markov hmms with emissions corresponding to observed genotypes and transitions to recombination_events although hmms for haplotypes undergird many efficient and accurate algorithms for haplotype_phasing genotype_imputation browning and browning and identity by descent detection they suffer from the drawback of modeling only dependencies between consecutive variants this assumption leads to the unrealistic conclusion that the previous variant and the next variant are independent given the current variant ignoring dependencies among non consecutive markers makes_it to detect and exploit long_range and higherorder interactions among variants these complex dependencies definitely exist in the human_genome and are important factors in genetic_studies this article applies the multivariate bernoulli mvb distribution to haplotype_data the mvb distribution captures the entire spectrum of dependencies among the entries of random binary vectors of length n the observed haplotypes at n nearby single_nucleotide snps can be thought of as realizations of such a process since there are n possible haplotypes for n snps the mvb distribution requires an unsustainable exponential number of parameters vast_amounts of training data or clever algorithms cannot compensate for this combinatorial explosion here we investigate a poisson re parameterization of the mvb distribution and impose an norm penalty to enforce sparsity in parameter_estimation these steps allow us to devise an efficient coordinate ascent algorithm for learning the mvb parameters from haplotype_data while restricting the number of parameters to a manageable level we showcase the utility of the mvb model by predicting an individuals dnasei hypersensitivity dh status from haplotypes observed near known dh sites dh status is a mark of open chromatin and flags genomic_regions where the dna is accessible to the dnasei enzyme these regions such as transcription_start correlate with active dna regulation dh status is usually assayed through dnase_seq a genome_wide high_throughput technology that sequences genomic_regions sensitive to dnasei recent research suggests that genetic_variants control this epigenetic mark since dh status can be naturally encoded as a binary variable the mvb model offers a natural way to integrate dh status and local haplotype_data in predicting dh status from haplotypes the mvb model allows all allelic sets to contribute regardless of the order of the participating snps and the physical distances separating them our analysis of data from the genomes_project genomes demonstrates the superiority of the sparse mvb distribution in model_fitting in practice interactions beyond order three play little role in determining haplotype_frequencies in these data our new cyclic coordinate descent algorithm for estimating the mvb interaction parameters converges quickly and reliably the mvb model also turns out to be pertinent to predicting dh status from haplotype_data at known dh sites on a sample of just subjects cross_validation under the mvb yields a prediction r of for dichotomized dh levels as expected the accuracy of dh prediction decreases as extraneous predictors are added finally prediction under the mvb achieves about better accuracy than prediction by linear_regression best unbiased linear predictor or blup and logistic_regression thus the mvb model is recommended for prediction of binary epigenetic status from local haplotype_data this article_presents the mvb distribution as a vehicle for modeling haplotype_data because the number of distinct haplotypes observed in a narrow genomic_region tends to be small the mvb model is typically wildly over parameterized to achieve parsimony we propose a lasso penalty within a poisson sampling framework the penalized mvb model encourages the detection and exploitation of higher_order interactions among the underlying snps in contrast to markovian models interactions extend beyond nearest_neighbor and pairwise interactions the interaction parameterization adopted here is more natural than the naive mvb parameterization implicitly seen in blup and logit empirically the interaction parameterization extracts more haplotype_information and predicts with better accuracy our application of the mvb model to predict dh status from observed haplotypes supports the utility of the model we show that the mvb model achieves better accuracy than blup and logit in predicting simulated dh status the overall prediction r achieved by mvb blup and logit on real dh status suggests substantial heritability of this epigenetic signal prediction r across validation individuals averaged over regions for mvb blup logit and hmm as a function of h int when h is fixed at
