gene_expression joint estimation of isoform_expression and isoform specific read_distribution using multisample rna_seq motivation rna_sequencing technologies_provide a powerful_tool for expression analysis at gene and isoform level but accurate estimation of isoform abundance is still a challenge standard assumption of uniform read intensity would yield biased_estimates when the read intensity is in fact non uniform the problem is that without strong assumptions the read intensity pattern is not identifiable from data observed in a single sample results we develop a joint statistical_model that accounts for non uniform isoform specific read_distribution and gene isoform_expression estimation the main_challenge is in dealing with the large number of isoform specific read distributions which potentially are as many as the number of splice_variants in the genome a statistical regularization via a smoothing penalty is imposed to control the estimation also for identifiability reasons the method uses information across samples from the same region we develop a fast and robust computational procedure based on the iterated weighted_least algorithm and apply it to simulated_data and two real rna_seq with reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction validation empirical tests show that our model performs better than existing_methods in terms of increasing precision in isoform level estimation availability_and we have implemented our method in an r package called sequgio as a pipeline for fast processing of rna_seq alternative use of exons can form a number of combinations called splice_variants which can be used as templates for producing related but distinct proteins alternative_splicing has been observed among different tissue_types in of human genes and greatly diversifies the transcriptome many splice_variants have been found to be implicated in a wide_range of human_diseases and functional_roles for this reason it is important to develop the technologies and statistical_methods to distinguish and quantify different isoforms of the same gene to compute an absolute expression scorein reads per kilobase per million_reads rpkm unitsread counts are normalized against the transcript length and the total number of mappable reads typically to estimate isoform abundance read_counts falling into a gene with multiple_isoforms are modeled as a poisson_process with uniform sampling across each transcript but due to a number of factors e g the or bias local nucleotide_composition effectssuch as priming or gc biasor other technical biases read_distribution might not be uniform indeed empirical goodness_of test for the poisson_model fitted under the uniform assumption shows that a majority of these models have poor fit this would lead to bias in the isoform_expression estimates recent methods suggest estimating non uniform read_distribution from single isoform genes these methods are rather limited where either one distribution is used for all isoforms or a different distribution depending on length in other words all transcripts of the same length from all genes regardless of what genes and whether the genes have single or multiple_isoforms are assumed to have the same read_distribution this ignores for example the local composition effect of the transcript furthermore a recent study did suggest that as the method used for rna library_preparation introduces some amplification artifacts the distribution of read_coverage could be isoform specific in real_data we do find that the distribution for different transcripts that share_common length is not always the same in addition we observe that read_distribution is highly_correlated across samples in supplementary report supplementary figures s and s show typical examples of non uniform read distributions with overabundance on the region interestingly across samples we find similarities in the shape of the read distributions even between different tissues there is evidence that the sample to sample similarity in nonuniform read distributions holds more generally across the genome see supplementaryin the supplementary report the restriction imposed by the previous methods in estimating read_distribution highlights one main difficulty once we allow non uniformity in principle each transcripteven from the same to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as geneto have its own specific pattern would lead to a large number of distribution_patterns potentially as many as the number of transcripts this makes the estimation highly nontrivial to account for local composition effect adjusted for priming bias where each read is reweighted based on its first few bases if based on seven nucleotides heptamer they needed to calculate the proportion of reads starting with each specific heptamer i e frequencies so reads beginning with a certain composition of seven nucleotides overrepresented in the heptamer distribution are down weighted modeled the read_counts depending on the specific composition of nucleotides along a gene and developed a more complex poisson linear_and model to estimate the effect of a certain nucleotide occurring in the k th nucleotides away from a given position j by modeling the count of reads starting at position j the gene_expression levels and the coefficients of the effect of surrounding nucleotide are optimized iteratively cufflinks one of the mostly commonly tools used to deal with sequence specific_biases problem in isoform_expression estimation assumes uniform read_distribution in its basic model but provides an ad_hoc correction of bias step it also estimates positional bias which measures whether fragments are preferentially located toward either ends of the transcripts unlike the base level bias correction_method our idea is to model the isoform specific read_distribution and expression jointly the observed sample to sample similarity suggests that combining data from different samples makes read_distribution identifiable our approach automatically allows for the local composition effect without any need for explicit modeling such a joint model is more natural so we expect it to lead to better performance the algorithm of iteratively estimating isoform_expression and read_distribution has some similarity to the idea in a recent published program nurd where a global bias curve for all genes and a local bias curve for each gene is estimated using nonparametric models in this study we compare the estimation accuracy of our model against cufflinks nurd and the method under uniform read_distribution assumption using a set of simulated_datasets and also apply our proposed method to two real_datasets in summary the purpose of this article is to describe a method for joint estimation of isoform level expression and isoformspecific read_distribution allowing for isoform specificity automatically deals with positional bias and local composition effects but it is challenging as we then have to estimate as many distributions as the number of isoforms in the genome regularization via a smoothing penalty is used to control the estimation of the read distributions primary results show that our approach provides substantial improvement on the quality of model_fitting and improves the sensitivity in isoform level differential_expression compared with the method based on uniform assumption cufflinks and nurd in this article we introduce a novel method using rna_seq from multiple samples to estimate the isoforms expression taking_into non uniform read_distribution through simulations that model read count_data from non uniform_distribution we demonstrate that our method improves accuracy in the expression quantification when read_distribution deviates dramatically from uniform there is a striking improvement in accuracy of the expression estimation furthermore our method can be easily adapted for use with any next_generation and mapping program sequgio uses a fundamentally distinct method to estimate read_distribution first of all it does not assume any relationship between sequencing bias and relative_position of a certain nucleotide in a fragment it uses an explicit and transparent model with isoform specific read intensity to simultaneously correct different sources of bias second sequgio is able to estimate isoformspecific read_distribution as long as count level data are available for a single transcriptional unit in contrast to produce nucleotide specific bias weights cufflinks requires the nucleotide level information of all genes the same global nucleotide distribution is then used for all fragments but estimation of nucleotide bias weights might be sensitive to which and how many singleisoform genes are taken into calculation the main assumption of the joint model is that non uniform read distributions can be identified using information across samples given that the read_distribution is consistent across samples in section a of the supplementary report we have presented evidence that the sample to sample similarity holds generally in the genome even between different tissues in practice we recommend users to follow the procedure to check the consistency especially when pooling information from two biological groups e g diseased versus healthy if not consistent the estimation should be done separately in the application to human brain_tissue data although only three samples are available we see sequgio performs fairly well based on the correlation with cufflinks and rt_pcr estimates when there are samples we would recommend using them all in estimation on the other hand if a large number of samples are available and the computational system is limited it would be useful to consider a two staged procedure i in the first stage the readnote the first row lists the percentage of de isoforms but genes with de isoforms can be non de at gene level percentage is summarized in the second row last two rows show the number of transcripts with both fc and highly_expressed the number of transcripts upregulated in tissue a br l and m stands for brain liver and muscle intensities are estimated from a subsample and ii in the second stage these intensities are fixed so only expression levels need to be estimated gold_standards for transcript_level expression are difficult to obtain experimentally improvement by our method is shown mostly by empirical means via the goodness_of statistics we also rely on simulations and limited isoform level rt_pcr data to assess the accuracy of our results in the simulations we consider both a non uniform_distribution and a slight deviation from uniformity and all parameter_values are those we estimate from the real_data so they are a fair testing procedure one limitation of many current methods including our own is that all isoforms for a gene are assumed to be known because of the huge amount of information from different isoform level annotation database and complex structure of transcriptome the current annotation is incomplete we suspect this might partially cause discrepancies in the rt_pcr validation most biological annotation databases may be updated almost every week some databases will be closed and merged with others e g astd are integrated in ensembl_database there is a need to develop a reliable and comprehensive mega annotation database but it is worth emphasizing that with the rna_seq mouse tissue data used in this article mapped counts and genes identified are comparable with results from those studies that use the same dataset
