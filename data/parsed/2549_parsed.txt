gene_expression inter_species pathway perturbation prediction via data_driven detection of functional homology motivation experiments in animal_models are often conducted to infer how humans will respond to stimuli by assuming that the same biological_pathways will be affected in both organisms the limitations of this assumption were tested in the improver species translation challenge where stimuli were applied to both human and rat cells and perturbed pathways were identified in the inter_species pathway perturbation prediction sub challenge multiple teams proposed methods to use rat transcription data from stimuli to predict human gene_set and pathway activity under the same perturbations submissions were evaluated using three performance_metrics on data from the remaining stimuli results we present two approaches ranked second in this challenge that do not rely on sequence_based orthology between rat and human genes to translate pathway perturbation state but instead identify transcriptional_response orthologs across a set of training conditions the translation from rat to human accomplished by these so_called direct methods is not dependent on the particular analysis method used to identify perturbed gene_sets in contrast machine_learning based_methods require performing a pathway analysis initially and then mapping the pathway activity between organisms unlike most machine_learning direct methods can be used to predict the activation of a human pathway for a new test_stimuli even when that pathway was never activated by a training_stimuli availability gene_expression data are available from arrayexpress accession e mtab while software implementations are available fromthe fundamental assumption that underpins the use of animal_models for the study of human disease is that there is conservation in the nature of the responses to injury and therapy however work reported by the inflammation and host response to injury large_scale collaborative_research program published in compared the transcriptional_responses in peripheral_blood with inflammatory injuries such as burns blunt force trauma as well as to endotoxin in human patients and in mice with startling and unexpected_results humans had similar transcriptional_responses to burns trauma and endotoxemia the murine_model showed little correlation either to each other or to the human response among genes that changed_significantly in humans the murine orthologs were close to random to their human counterparts with r values ranging between and these observations as well as earlier ones have elicited considerable interest and debate investigators have noted that candidate agents developed in animals to block the inflammatory_response tested in clinical_trials have all failed when tested in humans a major criticism has been that there is no systematic study of how well murine clinical models mimic_human inflammatory_diseases to address_this an international crowdsourcing competition was convened in improver species translation challenge improver stc addressing the translatability of findings between rat and human model systems in four subchallenges i intra and ii inter_species protein_phosphorylation prediction iii inter_species pathway perturbation prediction and iv species specific network_inference the work presented here is based on submissions to the third sub challenge sc by team a l tarca r romero and team c hafemeister r bonneau for a set of test_stimuli sc asked participants to predict the perturbation state of gene_sets representing pathways biological_processes in human cells given corresponding data in rat the required submission was an ordering of the gene_sets based on the enrichment in genes that are differentially_expressed between stimuli treated and controls participants could tune their models on a set of training_stimuli for which data for both rat and human were made available as illustrated in details of the experimental_settings generation processing and quality_control analysis of the dataset can be found in and the raw_data to whom correspondence should be addressed have been submitted to the arrayexpress database and are available with the accession_number e mtab https www ebi ac uk arrayexpress experiments e mtab the gene_sets were selected from the msigdb database and included biological_pathways such as those available in kegg and reactome but also custom functionally_related groups of genes supplementary in the remainder of the article we will use the term pathway to refer both biological_pathways and gene_sets for both simplicity reasons and to be consistent with the name of the sub challenge inter_species pathway perturbation prediction among the submissions to sc there were two main classes of methods the first category of methods was based on machine_learning applications in which the training was performed at the pathway level only panel c i e the input was the pathway perturbation states in rat and human for a set of stimuli and dependencies between them were exploited modeled our methods represent the second category which we call direct methods these methods trained on the differential_expression de state of all individual genes across the different stimuli to identify a response homology between rat and human genes based on this homology gene de metrics in human are either borrowed team or estimated team from those in rat for the same stimuli gene de metrics are then used to infer pathway perturbation panel a this article_describes in detail the approach of team a l t and r r and team c h and r b who were tied for second place in this challenge we describe commonalities and differences between these two direct methods and the machine_learning based_approaches the criteria used to discuss these methods include i prediction_performance overall and for the most challenging scenarios using metrics estimated as in the official team ranking but also in alternative ways ii applicability of the methods to instances when a given pathway was activated by few or no stimuli in the training_set and iii the dependence of the rat to human pathway activity translation on the particular gene_set method used both approaches rely on moderated t tests capturing the significance and direction of change of rat and human genes for the same stimuli in the training_dataset to find one rat gene as a predictor for each human gene ortholog pairs b team s method finds the rat gene that is ranked similarly across all training_stimuli when compared with a given human gene the rat data in the test_set are then used to impute the needed human expression data team s method fits a simple linear_model with one coefficient and intercept per ortholog pair and predicts t values directly c machine_learning bypass gene_expression and de tests altogether and map rat pathway activity nes or fdr values to human pathway activitythe systems_biology verification improver pathway perturbation prediction challenge verified methods and concepts of interspecies translation of pathway activity based on gene_expression data in this work we focused on the solutions of team and team and put them in context of other submissions with the goal of investigating their advantages and limitations given the training data both methods assigned one rat gene to each human gene based on a similar response_pattern across the training_stimuli this orthology mapping is used to impute the missing human gene_expression values team or to predict the t values of de tests in human from rat team these two approaches are different in nature from another category of methods used by other teams in this challenge namely machine_learning these two categories of methods direct methods versus machine_learning can be seen as a different sequence of two basic steps gene_set and inference from rat data to human data the machine_learning based_methods require that a gene_set method is applied first and then inference of the pathway activation_status from rat to human is learned in contrast direct methods that are the subject of this article perform the rat to human inference first and then apply the gene_set step therefore one can see that mapping pathway activity from rat to human accomplished by the machine_learning is dependent on the particular pathway analysis method used this might be problematic because a given pathway may or may not appear to be activated by a given stimulus depending on the sensitivity_and of the gene_set method that was applied in contrast the rat to human inferences made by the direct methods are independent of the particular gene_set method that is involved and they produce a correspondence between human and rat genes this correspondence identifies rat genes thought to be under similar regulatory_control in humans for the given type of cells and stimuli used in the experiments the data_driven orthologs found by the direct methods predicted inter_species differential_gene better than sequence_based orthologs and were significantly overlapping between the two methods yet they were divergent from sequence_based orthologs extracted from hgnc database based on the three performance_metrics aupr pearson_correlation and bac computed by pooling predictions and gold_standard over all pathways and stimuli the top three teams would be team alt team and team alt all machine_learning one could argue that this pooling of predictions favors methods that do not deal with the most difficult scenarios i e with pathway activation inference for those pathways that were seldom or never activated in the training_dataset and simply predict these pathways as non activated an alternative would be to compute the performance_metrics per pathway and then average over the pathways however this is not feasible for aupr and the correlation_coefficient but is for bac therefore we compared the rankings of the machine_learning with the ones of the direct methods based on the bac alone computed as in the official challenge pooled and also per pathway and then averaged mbac the pooled bac was consistently higher for top three machine_learning than for our direct methods however on average our direct methods have a higher mbac than the top three machine_learning the inability of machine_learning to predict the activation_status of pathways that were never activated in the training_dataset is reflected in the sensitivity of analysis restricted to those pathways none of the top three methods all machine_learning produced a single true_positive for these pathways however the direct method of team achieved a sensitivity of at specificity bac and team achieved a sensitivity of at specificity bac machine_learning define a stimuli effect on a given pathway into classes activation versus non activation and hence require one or more instances of activations to work an alternative machine_learning approach around this issue is to transform the classification_problem into a regression_problem as team did and use a continuous form of the pathway activity evidence combination of nes scores and fdr values in a regression_model that can be fit regardless of the number of activation cases for a given pathway team had the highest mbac statistics computed over all pathways yet this method did not find any true_positive for the zero activation pathways in the training_dataset a second alternative discussed in this issue by team would be to cluster pathways into groups and hence borrow activation information across pathways however from the outset such an approach did not appear to be outperforming the methodology used by team for their official submission in this challenge the task of using transcriptomics_data in rat to infer pathway activity in human for a given stimuli proved to be challenging regardless of the approach that was used to tackle this problem compared with the task of predicting protein_phosphorylation status in human based on gene_expression and phosphorylation data in rat sub challenge sc the prediction of pathway activity sub challenge sc was much more difficult with the best pooled bac in sc being compared with in sc there may be several reasons for this one of which being the fact that in the human training data only few outcomes are positives
