evaluation of hierarchical_models for integrative genomic_analyses motivation advances in high_throughput have led to the acquisition of various types of omic_data on the same biological_samples each data type gives independent and complementary information that can explain the biological_mechanisms of interest while several studies performing independent analyses of each dataset have led to significant results a better understanding of complex biological_mechanisms requires an integrative_analysis of different sources of data results flexible modeling_approaches based on penalized likelihood methods and expectation_maximization em algorithms are studied and tested under various biological relationship scenarios between the different molecular_features and their effects on a clinical_outcome the models are applied to genomic_datasets from two cancer_types in the cancer_genome glioblastoma_multiforme and ovarian_serous cystadenocarcinoma the integrative_models lead to improved model_fit and predictive_performance they also provide a better understanding of the biological_mechanisms patients survival availability_and source_code implementing the integrative_models

publicly_available at https tcga data nci nih gov tcga advances in high_throughput have led to the acquisition of various types of omic_data including whole_genome methylation transcriptomic glycomic proteomic and metabolomic each data type provides a snapshot of the molecular_processes involved in a particular phenotype while studies focused on one type of omic_data have led to significant results an integrative omic analysis can provide a better understanding of the complex biological mechanisms_involved in the etiology or progression of a disease by combining the complementary information from each data type consequently there has been a growing effort in recent_years to collect multiple omic_data types on the same sampling units initially the efforts had focused on the integration of two types of data as in expression_quantitative eqtl_analysis which explores the association between dna sequence_variations and gene_expression phenotypes or copy_number cnv gene_expression associations there are now several studies that collect various omic_data on the same samples the nci project for example provides various omic_data for a panel of cancer_cell collected from diverse tissues http discover nci nih gov cellminer the cancer_genome tcga project http cancergenome nih gov is another great public resource for integrative genomic v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com analysis that collects multiple omic_data types on the same samples for different cancers the availability of these data has led to the development of statistical_methods and bioinformatics_tools to explore the associations between different omic datasets and evaluate their relationships with phenotypic outcomes seefor a review various studies have demonstrated that integrative approaches are more effective in identifying subtle_effects that would have been missed in single dataset analysis thus providing improved statistical_power while reducing the detection of false_positives a commonly used approach for integrative_analysis remains the application of univariate tests evaluating the association between pairs of elements from two omic_data types this however raises a problem of multiplicity making it practically impossible to identify significant links after correcting for multiple testing in addition it ignores the fact that genomic markers do not work independently but in coordination monni and tadesse developed a bayesian stochastic partitioning method that overcomes this by combining ideas of mixtures of regression_models and variable_selection to uncover cluster structures in gene_expression and simultaneously identify subsets of cnvs associated to the correlated expression_profiles proposed icluster which uncovers tumor_subtypes by integrating various omic datasets using latent allocation indicators and specifying a variancecovariance structure that accounts for the dependence across data types proposed an integrative bayesian_analysis of genomic_data ibag which specifies a hierarchical_model that considers links between markers from different omic sources at the gene level and identifies their association with a clinical_outcome using bayesian_lasso in a similar approach used a hierarchical_bayesian to incorporate relationships between biological_features and introduced latent scores to explain the clinical_outcome in this paper our main objective is to identify significant associations between markers across omic datasets and elucidate the complementary information that explain the clinical_outcome similarly to we will focus on omic features at the gene level but we also explore different modeling_approaches that allow dependencies between features within a gene within a functional network or across all genes in the datasets in addition we do not introduce latent scores that summarize the information of several markers as our primary interest is in identifying relevant markers and their interrelationships in order to gain a better understanding of the biological_mechanisms a phenotype the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section_describes the tcga datasets used to demonstrate the performance of the models section_presents the biological considerations and the different statistical_models investigated section_presents the results of the analyses and section concludes the paper with a summary of the main findings tables and present the mean and standard_deviation of the adjusted r over repeated cross_validation fits for the various integrative_models in each of the three data subsets data data data for the gbm and osc datasets respectively as a reference comparison model we fit a penalized cox_model on the gene_expression data only adjusting for age we also report the cox_model with only age effect we considered integrative_models investigating association between cnvs and gene_expression levels at the gene level integrative gene within the same disease function network integrative network and throughout the genome integrativegenome when cnv methylation relationships are considered as in the methylation_sites within the gene are viewed as independent outcomes uni methylation or as a multivariate correlated outcome multi methylation we also assessed the impact of incorporating the uncertainty in the cnv methylation relationship using the em_algorithm outlined in section these comparisons are performed allowing cnvs to directly affect or not the survival_outcome as depicted inand for all the datasets the integrative_models provide better fit to the data compared to the reference model or the model with only age effect with regards to the subsets of features considered for integration focusing on markers selected based on the relevance of pathways for the phenotype under investigation as in data has the worst performance compared to using features selected based on univariate scans we obtain the largest adjusted r with data in terms of cnv methylation relationships the performance depends on the data subsets considered and the subsequent cnvgene expression or cnv survival associations allowed for example for gbm data the integrative model that considers cnvs and methylations not to be related to each other but to each act directly on gene_expressions no cnv methylation gave the largest adjusted r when cnv survival association is allowed instead for gbm data the no cnv methylation model did not necessarily have the best performance and had the lowest adjusted r when allowing all cnvs to act on gene_expression changes integrative genome when allowing for cnv methylation association the multi methylation model that accounts for the dependence between methylation_sites in the same gene and the unimethylation model have similar performance this may be due to two factors i in most cases there are only one or two methylation_sites that map to the same gene ii the multivariate_regression group penalization procedure ofwe used is designed to select the same covariates for all outcomes but with varying regression_coefficients thus in a situation where a cnv may affect only one of the methylation_sites mapping to a gene all sites would be related to the cnv thereby introducing noise when a cnv methylation relationship is allowed accounting for the uncertainty in the association using the em_algorithm appears to help in some of the models with respect to cnv gene_expression association the model that lets cnvs act on expression levels of genes they map to integrative gene performs significantly better for all gbm data subsets when cnv survival association is allowed when copy_numbers are not allowed to be directly associated with the survival_outcome the integrative genome setting which lets all cnvs potentially act on a gene expression_level provides in general the best performance for osc although the integrative gene model is the best for data for the other data subsets the integrative network or the integrative genome scenarios give better model fits with regard to cnv survival association allowing copy_numbers to act directly on survival rather than just through their effect on gene_expression levels provides improved model_fit this is most obvious in gbm data and data for the other data subsets the performance slightly varied depending on the cnv methylation and cnv gene_expression associations considered although the results were relatively comparable finding models with good predictive_performance is more challenging than determining good explanatory_models in particular survival_prediction in cancer is a difficult_task because of the intrinsic high variability that exists in patients survival_outcome another challenge is the lack of a good criterion to assess the predictive_performance of survival models here we used repeated fold cross_validations to assess the performance of the various models using the c index measure as described in section we present inthe results for gbm and osc in the larger data subset data which gave the best model_fit considering methylation_sites mapping to the same gene as a multivariate outcome or incorporating the em_algorithm in the cnv methylation relationships gave_similar as the unimethylation models so only the latter and the models assuming no cnv methylation link are reported we note that the integrative_models give improved predictive_performance for example for gbm the integrative gene models give the highest cross_validated c indices when considering cnv gene_expression associations across the whole_genome integrative genome the model with no cnv methylation appears not to perform as well as the reference model relating only gene_expression data to survival_outcomes however when allowing for cnv methylation associations this models predictive_performance is comparable to that of the integrative gene similarly for osc the integrative gene models and the models that allow for cnv methylation association have the highest c index values we note concordant_results between goodness_of and predictive_performance the better explanatory_models withhigher adjusted r values also give better prediction with higher cross_validated c indices besides providing improved model_fit and better predictive_performance an advantage of the integrative approach is that it gives insights into the biological_mechanisms the clinical_outcome by identifying relationships between molecular_features and their effects on the outcome provides a graphical summary of these relationships for the best performing integrative model in gbm adjusted r cross_validated c index this corresponds to the model depicted inallowing for cnvmethylation and direct cnv survival association in data overall mrna_transcripts are found to be associated with survival among these genes have transcript_levels that are modulated by methylation markers which themselves are influenced by cnv markers mapping to the same genes gene_expression levels are associated to copy_number changes while other genes have their mrna_abundance modulated by methylation markers there are also another set of cnvs found to be directly associated to survival many of the identified markers are known to be implicated in cancer we found p protein activated_kinase pak which is predominantly expressed in brain to have a couple of methylation markers modulating its transcription_levels which in turn are related to survival in gbm previous_studies have determined this gene to be highly_expressed in tumor_tissues of glioma patients and have suggested that inhibition of this gene by rna_interference might efficiently suppress tumor development in glioma_cells another study_examining the underlying_molecular of pak found that suppression of this gene in glioma_cells significantly_inhibited cell_growth cell_migration and that pak could inhibit cell_apoptosis suggesting that it could have a potential role in prevention and treatment of glioma tumors among the cnv markers directly associated to survival is eph receptor a epha which is known to be overexpressed in different tumors including gbm and shows an inverse_association with survival in gbm epha has been put forward as a prognostic_marker and a potential therapeutic marker for primary and recurrent gbm other cnv markers we identified like protein_tyrosine receptor type a ptpra and bcl like bcl l have respectively been shown to be implicated in oncogenic_transformation and to play_an in inducing_apoptosis among the mrna_transcripts identified to be associated to survival is fibroblast_growth fgf a gene known to be involved in cell_survival activities tumor_growth and invasion other gene_expression changes found to be related to gbm survival include eukaryotic_translation a eif a which has two isoforms both carrying unfavorable prognostics for various cancers glutathione_s mu gstm which has been linked to adult brain_tumors and tnf_receptor traf known to mediate antiapoptotic signals from tnf_receptors result of integrative genomic analysis for gbm data methylation markers are represented with rectangles cnv markers with soft edged rectangles mrna_transcripts with ellipses for cnvs acting directly on survival the names
