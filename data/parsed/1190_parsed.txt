data_and cpfp a central proteomics facilities pipeline the central proteomics facilities pipeline cpfp provides identification validation and quantitation of peptides and proteins from lc_ms datasets through an easy to use web_interface it is the first analysis_pipeline targeted specifically at the needs of proteomics core facilities reducing the data analysis load on staff and allowing facility clients to easily access and work with their data identification of peptides is performed using multiple search_engines their output combined and validated using state of the art techniques for improved results cluster execution of jobs allows analysis capacity to be increased easily as demand grows availability released under the common development and distribution license atmass spectrometry ms has emerged as the dominant technique for the identification and quantitation of peptides and proteins from complex_mixtures a large number of institutions have established core proteomics facilities to provide ms services sharing equipment and expertise with a wide_range of users with the growth in demand for high_throughput lc_ms analysis of complex samples and increased interest in quantitative_proteomics effective analysis of data can be challenging existing freely_available pipelines such as tpp cpas labkey software foundation openms topp swisspit and masspectras support a variety of proteomics search_engines and validation tools but often require users to understand the various parameter formats of the search_engines reconcile differences in post_translational ptm specifications and manually run multiple searches if more than one search_engine is to be used commercial applications such as scaffold proteome software portland or usa peaks bioinformatics solutions inc waterloo on canada and sorcerer sage n research milpitas ca usa provide user_friendly interfaces but require significant outlay if multiple licences are required the central proteomics facilities pipeline cpfp aims to provide a simplethe dld ltq and serum orbi datasets described inwere analysed using cpfp searches used the ipi human sequence database v and the parameters given in results were filtered to an estimated fdr using the targetdecoy procedure shows the number of identifications for mascot x tandem k score and omssa searches processed separately and a combined result merged using iprophet combining the results of the three search_engines gives a higher number of peptide_spectrum psms and unique peptide_identifications versus the best performing single search_engine omssa in both cases the increase in psms is and for the dld ltq and serum orbi datasets respectively submission to and combination of results from all search_engines is automated and required no additional steps for the user versus the use of a single search_engine timings for the serum orbi dataset on a core cluster were min s for mascot min s for x tandem and min s for omssa individually versus min s for all searches in parallel followed by combination of results
