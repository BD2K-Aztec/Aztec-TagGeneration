genome_analysis easystrata evaluation and visualization of stratified genome_wide association meta_analysis data the r package easystrata facilitates the evaluation and visualization of stratified genome_wide association meta_analyses gwamas results it provides i statistical_methods to test and account for between strata difference as a means to tackle genestrata interaction effects and ii extended graphical features tailored for stratified gwama results the software provides further features also suitable for general gwamas including functions to annotate exclude or highlight specific_loci in plots or to extract independent subsets of loci from genome_wide datasets it is freely_available and includes a user_friendly scripting interface that simplifies data_handling and allows for combining statistical and graphical functions in a flexible fashion availability easystrata is available for free under the gnu_general v from our web_site www genepi regensburg de easystrata and from the cran r package repository cran r project org_web easystrata genome_wide association meta_analyses gwamas in which multiple study specific genome_wide association gwa results are pooled have resulted in a to fold increase in the number of known genes contributing to complex_traits and diseases meanwhile a focus is also on geneenvironment wide interaction analyses gewis that are conducted to further characterize genetic main effects as well as to discover novel genetic_associations that are only present under certain environmental_conditions geneenvironment interaction gxe although some gewis have already extended from single study analyses to meta_analyses so_far only few reported replicable gxe effects for categorical environmental_factors e gewis meta_analyses can be implemented as gwamas stratified by e for example a gwama stratified by sex or by smoking_status stratified gwamas do not only improve power to detect stratum sensitive genetic main effects but also allow for testing genestrata gxs interaction and joint main interaction effects although a variety of methods for the analysis of stratified gwama results exist the availability of software_tools is limited see supplementaryfor a comparison with other gwas tools we have developed an r package called easystrata which allows the user to obtain statistical and graphical summaries for comparisons across strata and to investigate potential gxs effects the software was developed within the gxe working_groups of the giant genetic investigation of anthropometric traits consortium and the functionality of the package is exemplified on gwama results for anthropometric traits which are publically available at www broadinstitute org collaboration giant easystrata is applicable to stratified gwamas of continuous or dichotomous_outcomes and many of the functions are also applicable for non stratified gwamas supplementary note
