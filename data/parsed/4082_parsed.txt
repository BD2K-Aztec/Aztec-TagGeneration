gene_expression rseqnp a non parametric approach for detecting differential_expression and splicing from rna_seq high_throughput of transcriptomes rna_seq has become a powerful_tool to study gene_expression here we present an r package rseqnp which implements a non parametric approach to test for differential_expression and splicing from rna_seq rseqnp uses permutation_tests to access statistical_significance and can be applied to a variety of experimental_designs by combining information across isoforms rseqnp is able to detect more differentially_expressed or spliced genes from rna_seq availability_and the r package with its source_code are freely_available athigh throughput sequencing of transcriptomes rna_seq is a widely used approach to study gene_expression many statistical_approaches have been developed to characterize gene_expression variation across rna_seq experiments and many of them are designed for testing differential_expression de of genes without considering their alternative spliced isoforms for a comprehensive_review see several recent_studies that directly applying the de approach for detecting differential splicing ds may lead to erroneous_results because those approaches do not incorporate the complexity induced by isoform_expression estimation for genes with multiple_isoforms to this end several approaches were recently_developed to detect de at isoform level however there are two remaining issues i many existing_approaches only compare between two biological conditions such as normal versus diseased and their usages for complex experimental_designs are thus limited and ii most existing_approaches assume parametric distributions poisson or negative_binomial for observed read_counts which although can achieve good performance when the distributional assumptions hold may have severely deteriorated performance should the distributional assumptions be violated and that is often the case especially for large_sample rna_seq where outliers usually exist here we present rseqnp a non parametric approach for testing de and ds from rna_seq rseqnp extends a non parametric approach for detecting de and aims at detecting both de and ds rseqnp can be used with a variety of rna_seq experimental_designs including those with two unpaired or paired or multiple biological conditions and those with quantitative or survival_outcomes using simulation_studies we find that our proposed approach has well controlled type_i and achieves good statistical_power for moderate sample_sizes and effect_sizes see supplementary section s for details here we apply rseqnp to a real rna_seq dataset and compare it with ebseq and cuffdiff which are two existing_approaches for detecting de of genes and isoforms from rna_seq the dataset was generated from paired_end experiments performed on prostate_cancer samples and matched benign samples from chinese prostate_cancer patients since neither ebseq nor cuffdiff can handle paired two group comparison we run all three programs on the dataset under the setting of unpaired two group comparison i e treat_cancer and benign samples as two distinct groups as well as run rseqnp under the setting of paired two group comparison for preprocessing we use the programs suggested by each of the three approaches to quantify expression values for all the genes and isoforms rsem for ebseq rseq for rseqnp and the integrated quantification program for cuffdiff nevertheless the three programs for quantification show very similar results see supplementary section s summarizes the numbers of differentially_expressed and spliced genes identified by each program see supplementary section s for detailed steps and additional results of the analysis we use fdr for rseqnp and cuffdiff and posterior_probability of being differentially_expressed ppde for ebseq to call a differential event ppde is the metric reported by ebseq and ppde corresponds to controlling fdr at as expected when treating the data as two distinct groups rseqnp detects fewer differentially_expressed and isoforms but by applying the gds more differentially_expressed or spliced genes are detected furthermore when accounting for the paired two group nature of the data rseqnp detects even more differential events we find that cuffdiff detects a much smaller number of differentially_expressed or spliced genes which is consistent with report from another study
