locuszoom regional visualization of genome_wide association scan results genome_wide gwas have revealed hundreds of loci associated with common human genetic_diseases and traits we have developed a web_based plotting tool that provides fast visual display of gwas results in a publication ready format locuszoom visually displays regional information such as the strength and extent of the association_signal relative to genomic_position local linkage_disequilibrium ld and recombination patterns and the positions of genes in the region availability locuszoom can be accessed from a web_interface at http csg sph umich edu locuszoom users may generate a single plot using a web form or many plots using batch mode the software utilizes ld_information from hapmap phase_ii ceu yri and jpt chb or genomes ceu and gene information from the ucsc browser and will accept snp identifiers in dbsnp or genomes format single plots are generated in s source_code and associated databases are available for download and local installation and full documentation is available online genome_wide gwas have identified hundreds of loci associated with complex human_diseases and traits gwas test for association with dichotomous or quantitative_traits at millions of snps across the genome and can identify variants many hundreds of kilobases away from any known gene the next challenge in human_genetics will be to identify the causal_variants and genes responsible for disease association at the many disease associated loci identified from gwas an associated region may contain only a single strongly associated snp or more commonly a set of snps with varying_degrees of association due to local linkage_disequilibrium ld patterns when examining results an example locuszoom plot showing the hdl cholesterolassociated region near the mmab gene conservation which is available for all snps in dbsnp or the genomes_project august release the size of the data_points can optionally reflect the square_root of the sample_size the bottom panel of a locuszoom plot shows the name and location of genes in the ucsc_genome positions of exons are displayed and the transcribed_strand is indicated with an arrow this allows the visual comparison of association results relative to coding_regions gene names are automatically spaced relative to one another to avoid overlap currently used plotting tools include regional association plotter snap and ld based viewers such as ld plus candisnper and valid locuszoom provides additional features not currently available in any other single tool such as i the display of genomes or novel snps from sequencing studies ii functional_annotation of snps iii exon_intron distinction and automated gene spacing iv ability to plot regions larger than kb v no pre selection of input_files and vi web_based batch mode and availability of source_code and databases for download and local installation of locuszoom
