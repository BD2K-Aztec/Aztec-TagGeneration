an efficient bayesian_inference framework for coalescent_based nonparametric phylodynamics motivation the field of phylodynamics focuses on the problem of reconstructing population_size dynamics over time using current genetic samples taken from the population of interest this technique has been extensively used in many areas of biology but is particularly useful for studying the spread of quickly evolving infectious_diseases agents e g influenza_virus phylodynamic inference uses a coalescent model that defines a probability density for the genealogy of randomly_sampled individuals from the population when we assume that such a genealogy is known the coalescent model equipped with a gaussian_process prior on population_size trajectory allows for nonpara metric bayesian_estimation of population_size dynamics although this approach is quite powerful large_datasets collected during infectious_disease surveillance challenge the state of the art of bayesian phylodynamics and demand inferential methods with relatively low_computational results to satisfy this demand we provide a computationally_efficient bayesian_inference framework based on hamiltonian monte_carlo for coalescent_process models moreover we show that by splitting the hamiltonian function we can further improve the efficiency of this approach using several simulated_and we show that our method provides accurate estimates of population_size dynamics and is substantially faster than alternative_methods based on elliptical slice sampler and metropolis adjusted langevin algorithm availability_and the r code for all simulation_studies analysis conducted in this article are publicly_available atpopulation genetics theory states that changes in population_size affect genetic_diversity leaving a trace of these changes in individuals genomes the field of phylodynamics relies on this theory to reconstruct past population_size dynamics from current genetic data in recent_years phylodynamic inference has become an essential tool in areas like ecology and epidemiology for example a study of human influenza a virus from sequences sampled in both hemispheres pointed to a sourcesink dynamics of the influenza evolution phylodynamic models connect population_dynamics and genetic data using coalescent based_methods typically such methods rely on kingmans coalescent model which is a probability model that describes formation of genealogical relationships of a random_sample of molecular sequences the coalescent model is parameterized in terms of the effective_population an indicator of genetic_diversity while recent_studies have_shown in alleviating computational difficulties of phylodynamic inference existing_methods still lack the level of computational_efficiency required to realize the potential of phylodynamics developing surveillance programs that can operate similarly to weather monitoring_stations allowing public_health to predict disease_dynamics to optimally allocate limited resources in time and space to achieve_this we present an accurate and computationally_efficient inference_method for modeling population_dynamics given a genealogy more specifically we concentrate on a class of bayesian_nonparametric methods based on gaussian processes following palacios and minin and we assume a log gaussian_process prior on the effective_population as a result the estimation of effective_population trajectory becomes similar to the estimation of intensity of a log gaussian cox process lgcp which is extremely_challenging since the likelihood evaluation becomes intractable it involves integration over an infinite dimensional random function we resolve the intractability in likelihood evaluation by discretizing the integration interval with a regular grid to approximate the likelihood and the corresponding score function for phylodynamic inference we propose a computationally_efficient markov_chain mcmc_algorithm using hamiltonian monte_carlo hmc and one of its variants called split hmc which speeds up standard hmcs convergence our proposed algorithm has several advantages first it updates all model_parameters jointly to avoid poor mcmc convergence and slow mixing rates when there are strong dependencies among model_parameters knorr second unlike a recently_proposed integrated nested laplace approximation_method inla which approximates the posterior_distribution of model_parameters given a fixed genealogy our approach can be extended to more general settings where we observe genetic data as opposed to the genealogy of sampled individuals that provide information on genealogical relationships third we show that our method is up to an order of magnitude more efficient than alternative mcmc algorithms such as metropolis adjusted langevin algorithm mala adaptive mala amala knorr and elliptical slice sampler es that are commonly used in the field of phylodynamics finally although in this article we focus on phylodynamic studies our proposed methodology can be easily applied to more general point_process models the remainder of the article is organized as follows in section we provide a brief overview of coalescent models and hmc algorithms section_presents the details of our proposed sampling methods experimental_results based on simulated_and are provided in section section is devoted to discussion and future_directions phylodynamic inference has become crucial in conservation biology epidemiology and other areas bayesian_nonparametric methods coupled with coalescent models provide a powerful framework to infer changes in effective_population with many advantages one of the main advantages of bayesian_nonparametric methods over traditional parametric methods that assume fixed functional_form of n e t such as exponential_growth is the ability of bayesian_nonparametric methods to recover any functional_form without any prior_knowledge about n e t with the technological advance of powerful_tools for genotyping individuals it is crucial to develop efficient methodologies that can be applied to large number of samples and multiple genes in this article we have proposed new hmc based sampling algorithms for phylodynamic inference we have compared our methods to several alternative mcmc algorithms and showed that they substantially_improve computational_efficiency of gp based bayesian phylodynamics more results are provided in the supplementary document further our analysis shows that our results are not sensitive to the prior specification for the precision parameter j this is inline with previously_published for similar models see_supplementary of to obtain the analytical solution of a in splithmc we eigen decompose the precision matrix c in sacrificing sparsity one can however use the cholesky decomposition instead c in r t r and transform f rf this way the dynamics a would be much simpler with the solution as a rotation because r is also tridiagonal similar to c in in theory the computational_cost of splithmc could be reduced to od in practice however we found that this approach would work well when the hamiltonian is mainly dominated by the middle term this condition does not hold for the examples discussed in this article nevertheless we have provided the corresponding splithmc method with cholesky decomposition in the supplementary_file since it can still be used for situations where the middle term does in fact dominate the overall hamiltonian there are several possible future_directions one possibility is to use es as a proposal generating mechanism in updating f as opposed to using it for sampling from the posterior_distribution finding a good proposal for j or s however remains_challenging another possible direction it to allow j to be time dependent when there is rapid fluctuation in the population one single precision parameter j may not well capture the corresponding change in the latent vector f our future work will include time varying precision j t or more informative covariance_structure in modeling gaussian prior also we can extend our existing work by allowing irregular grids which may be more suitable for rapidly_changing population_dynamics another important extension of the methods presented here is to allow for multiple genes and genealogical uncertainty the mcmc methods proposed here can be incorporated into a hierarchical framework to infer population_size trajectories from sequence_data directly in contrast inla cannot be adapted easily to perform inference from sequence_data this greatly limits its generality
