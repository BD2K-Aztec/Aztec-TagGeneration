genome_analysis fasd somatic a fast and accurate somatic snv detection algorithm for cancer_genome data recent_advances in high_throughput have enabled us to sequence large number of cancer samples to reveal novel insights into oncogenetic mechanisms however the presence of intratumoral_heterogeneity normal_cell and insufficient sequencing_depth together pose a challenge for detecting somatic_mutations here we propose a fast and an accurate somatic single_nucleotide snvs detection program fasd somatic the performance of fasd somatic is extensively assessed on various types of cancer against several state of the art somatic snv detection programs benchmarked by somatic snvs from either existing databases or de_novo higher depth sequencing_data fasd somatic has the best overall performance furthermore fasd somatic is efficient it finishes somatic snv calling within h on x whole_genome sequencing_data in paired_samples availability_and the program datasets and supplementary files are available at http jjwanglab org fasd somatic next_generation and third generation sequencing are widely used to detect genetic_mutations from tumor_tissues and their paired normal_tissues from the same individual providing an immense power for understanding the cause of cancer besides the inherited germ_line mutations the newly acquired somatic_mutations constitute the majority of genetic_mutations that cause cancer increasing evidences show that tumoral heterogeneity exists not only in intertumoral level but also in intratumoral level when the sequencing_depth is insufficient the minor clones which may harbor the meaningful positively_selected mutations could be easily concealed by the dominant clones furthermore owing to the presence of non tumor_cells in the bulk of tumor the proportion of effective covered reads with somatic_mutations will decrease therefore making somatic_mutation detection more difficult finally the germ_line variants can outnumber somatic variants by several orders of magnitudes this further complicates the difficulty of somatic_mutation detection efforts have been made by both biologists and bioinformaticians ato overcome those challenges but the methods to call somatic single_nucleotide snvs directly from sequencing_data with accuracy and efficiency are still in demand supplementary section
