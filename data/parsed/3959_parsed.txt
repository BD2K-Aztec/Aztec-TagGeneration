rehh an r package to detect footprints of selection in genome_wide snp data from haplotype_structure with the development of next_generation and genotyping approaches large single_nucleotide haplotype datasets are becoming available in a growing number of both model and non model species identifying genomic_regions with unexpectedly high local haplotype homozygosity relatively to neutral expectation represents a powerful strategy to ascertain candidate_genes responding to natural or artificial selection to facilitate genome_wide of selection based on the analysis of long_range haplotypes we developed the r package rehh it provides a versatile_tool to detect the footprints of recent or ongoing selection with several graphical functions that help visual interpretation of the results availability_and stable version is available from cran http cran r project org development version is available from the r forge repository http r forge r project org projects rehh both versions can be installed directly from r function documentation and example data_files are provided within the package and a tutorial is available as supplementary_material rehh is distributed under the gnu general public licence gpl in a pioneering work investigated the genetic footprints of recent positive_selection in humans by analyzing longrange haplotypes at several candidate_genes using a novel measure called the extended haplotype homozygosity ehh ehh is defined as the probability that two randomly_chosen chromosomes carrying the same allele at a focal snp single_nucleotide are identical by descent over a given distance surrounding it if the core allele is under selection then the ehh is expected to be close to one over a large distance upstream and downstream the focal snp however testing the departure of ehh from neutral expectation remains difficult without making strong assumptions about the population demographic_history therefore proposed an empirical test based on the integral of the observed decay of ehh which they defined as integrated ehh ihh they further defined a test_statistic ihs as the log ratioidentifying genomic_regions with unexpectedly high local haplotype homozygosity relatively to neutral expectation is a powerful strategy to ascertain candidate_genes responding to natural or artificial selection the availability of large snp haplotype datasets in a growing number of both model and non model species makes it possible to apply such a strategy in this context rehh provides a all in one user_friendly to detect the footprints of recent or ongoing selection using ehh related statistics
