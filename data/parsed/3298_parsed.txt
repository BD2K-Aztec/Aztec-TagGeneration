sequence_analysis nrpssp non ribosomal peptide synthase substrate predictor non_ribosomal nrpss are multi modular enzymes which biosynthesize many important peptide compounds produced by bacteria and fungi some studies have revealed that an individual domain within the nrpss shows significant substrate selectivity the discovery and characterization of non ribosomal peptides are of great interest for the biotechnological industries we have applied computational mining methods in order to build a database of nrpss modules that bind to specific substrates we have used this database to build a hidden_markov predictor of substrates that bind to a given nrps availability the database and the predictor are freely_available on an easy to use website at www nrpssp com nonribosomal_peptide nrpss are multi modular enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of natural_products a minimal nrps module contains specific functional_domains which are able to catalyze several activities such as amino_acid adenylation a activation thioesterification t thiolation or acyl carrier domain and peptide_bond c condensation domain allowing elongation of the nascent peptide the primary composition of the final_product is determined by the sequential_order of the a domains along the synthetase because each a domain recruits a particular type of substrate the crystal_structure of the peptide synthetase grsa which was solved with a bound a phenylalanine substrate molecule has enabled the identification of key_residues in the a domain which are important for the substrate_binding accordingly these residues can be determinant in the substrate_specificity of a domains and their extraction from characterized a domains has achieved a collection of key_residues signatures and general rules for deducing substrate_specificity of non characterized a domains moreover machine_learning have been applied to build a classifier based on key_residues and on the physico_chemical of amino_acids to gain prediction power consequently software_tools and databases have been developed to collect nrps products such as norine and nrps pks and to predict to whom correspondence should be addressed the binding substrates of an nrps such as nrps pks np searcher pks_nrps analysis and nrpspredictor these prediction websites are mainly based on the generally_accepted rule of analysing the active_site within the a domains however it is known that this approach has difficulties analysing certain types of synthetases especially those which belong to fungi species problems can be caused because the grsa crystal seems to be an inadequate model for them jenke kodama and dittmann or because the large number of sequence_variants in the active_centre does not allow a correct extraction of the key_residues for prediction this observation suggests the interest of developing new prediction_methods supported by other approaches one of these approaches could be the use of hidden_markov hmm ashave applied to functionally classify the acyl coa synthetase super family_members this work suggests that the application of hmm profiles to classify this superfamily outperforms the predictions based on a limited number of active_site the methods stated above can also be applied to a more ambitious goal such as the determination of the substrate that binds to an adenylation_domain the current omics era has enabled the exponential_growth of the sequenced nrps this implies that a tool which could predict the specificity of their a domains is of increasing interest and its training could be beneficial with the new annotated nrps these facts the previous_experience of our group in the area and the cited publications have enabled the presented work whose ultimate_goal is to develop a new bioinformatic tool in order to achieve the collection annotation storage and prediction of substrates which bind to adenylation domains in nrpss this open software_tool applies a new approach in the areas of the prediction based on hmm enlarged training_sets applying mining techniques the regular update of its database and its design for the functional analysis of incoming ngs_data the large increase of sequenced proteins that has occurred in recent_years has enabled the collection of more data than in previous_studies proteins were initially worked with which were annotated as nrpss or had at least one a domain however only a small subset of these proteins are fully annotated only proteins are in the swissprot subset and a small fraction of this subset was useful for building the database the automatic_annotation of substrates with its corresponding a domain obtained entries then a data curation was manually done correcting the existing data errors and deleting the doubtful entries mainly because i they do not belong to an nrps module and ii the lack of knowledge of the exact correspondence with a substrate this process results in a database with domains which have a known binding substrate from these sequences were used for training the classifier because the rest binds to substrates that have annotated sequences although the size is not too large it is the biggest database that has been used to train a method which predicts nrps substrates used a database with entries of which were used to train the svm classifier and the recent update of this method used a database with entries the number of entries to train the classifier was not described this means that our database has more than triple the size of previous ones it is available online and the semi automatic_methods that have been developed allow its regular update we expect that this resource will be a reference_set for future_research in this area this database was used to construct the classifier by means of the application of hmm profiles the reliability of the classifier was measured using all data as a train and test_set and by a loo method as well section the error_rate was and for loo and whole training data respectively if low score results highlighted in red in the web_application are considered as not available the error_rate decreases to and respectively the loo sequences were analysed with nrpspredictor and pks_nrps analysis in order to estimate their error_rate in similar terms the nrpspredictor test obtained an error_rate of taking_into all the predictions and excluding null and unavailable predictions similarly pks_nrps analysis obtained error_rates of and respectively supplementary this is a very promising result indicating that the use of more comprehensive training data and hmm achieves a more reliable predictor in addition the results obtained by classifying fungal proteins were studied_separately the error_rate excluding low score results were for loo and for whole training data and if the low score results are not excluded for loo and for whole training data an increase of the error_rate is noticeable when low score results are not filtered this increase is induced by the wide_variety of fungi a domains and their small number in the training_set similar results have been obtained with nrpspredictor and pks_nrps analysis whose predictions had a low coverage around and an error_rate of and respectively excluding null and non available predictions see supplementary however coverage problems are expected to disappear as the number of fungi a domains in the test_set is increased and this is a major objective which nrpssp attempts to address with frequent updates nrpssp is available via the website www nrpssp com this website easily allows the analysis of a set of sequences which are passed as parameters in a fasta_format supplementaryshows an example in addition the website has a download section which contains the updated database that has been used to train the current classifier and the hmm profiles which have been built it enables future_studies in the area and the execution of the classifier in a stand alone mode in this way the application is designed for use with ngs_data which is becoming common in biotechnological research and allows a quick functional_annotation of nrps proteins and knowledge of the substrate_specificity of their a domains
