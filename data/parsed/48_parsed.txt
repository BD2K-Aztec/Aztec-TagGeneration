sequence_analysis accurate estimation of haplotype frequency from pooled_sequencing and cost_effective identification of rare haplotype carriers by overlapping pool sequencing motivation a variety of hypotheses have been proposed for finding the missing_heritability of complex_diseases in genome_wide studies have focused on the value of haplotype to improve the power of detecting associations with disease to facilitate haplotype_based association analysis it is necessary to accurately estimate haplotype_frequencies of pooled_samples results taking_advantage of databases that contain prior haplotypes we present ehapp based on the algorithm for solving the system of linear equations to estimate the frequencies of haplotypes from pooled_sequencing effects of various factors in sequencing

haplotypes with total coverage of when unknown haplotypes exist our method maintains excellent_performance for haplotypes with actual frequencies comparisons with present method on simulated_data in conjunction with publicly_available illumina sequencing_data indicate that our method is state of the art for many sequencing study_designs we also demonstrate the feasibility of applying overlapping pool sequencing to identify rare haplotype carriers cost effectively availability_and ehapp in perl for the linux platforms is available onlinegenome wide association studies have identified numerous genetic_variants associated with complex_diseases and have provided_valuable their genetic_architecture however most variants identified so_far confer relatively small increments in risk and explain only a small proportion of heritability a variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the missing_heritability including rare_variants genegene and geneenvironment interaction in addition studies have focused on the values of haplotypes and genome_wide haplotype association gwha studies have been presented to find the association between haplotypes and diseases the combination of genetic_marker alleles such as single_nucleotide snps on a single chromosome is called a haplotype which provides valuable information on evolutionary_history and may lead to the development of more efficient strategies to identify genetic_variants that increase susceptibility to diseases rather than examining variants independent of each other simultaneously considering the values of multiple_variants within haplotypes can improve the power of detecting associations with disease up to now numerous haplotypes have been found associated with several diseases to facilitate gwha studies it is necessary to estimate haplotype_frequencies accurately from deoxyribonucleic_acid dna pools of case and control samples presented poolhap to estimate haplotype_frequencies from pooled_samples by next_generation on the basis of an expectation_maximization put forward harp to calculate the frequencies of haplotypes from pooled_sequencing however both poolhap and harp required that the haplotypes for pooled_samples were known for inferring the frequency which may conflict with real situation taking_advantage of haplotype database information has been proved feasible and helpful for haplotype frequency_estimation under the plausible assumption that few haplotypes actually possess the vast_majority of proportion or haplotype database is large enough compressed_sensing cs could be used for the rapid and accurate reconstruction of the haplotype composition of pooled_samples utilized techniques from cs to reconstruct the composition of a mixture of bacteria by utilizing databases that contain all the possible species translated the haplotype_frequencies estimation as a joint constrained sparse optimization_problem which has been studied in the cs literature with the development of sequencing_technology a large number of haplotypes are rapidly gathered into public_databases such as hapmap dgrp the drosophila genetic reference_panel and genomes the number of samples used in hapmap allows the project to find to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com of haplotypes with frequencies of or greater in a population since cs was proposed to recover sparse signals from incomplete and inaccurate measurements suppose the haplotypes for the samples in pooled sequencing are included in the database which is large enough it is viable to infer the frequencies of haplotypes contained in the prior database by utilizing techniques from cs however for low_frequency haplotypes not contained in the database it is hard to recover the frequency once a haplotype is confirmed that it has association with diseases similar to genomic_variants screening for the haplotype carriers is of great value in practical_application borrowing ideas from group testing theory ding overlapping pool sequencing was presented for the purpose of identifying rare_variant carriers cost effectively on the basis that the frequencies of haplotypes could be estimated precisely from pooled_sequencing clearly overlapping pool sequencing can also be applied in the identification of rare haplotype carriers here by means of prior haplotype_information contained in the database we present a method to estimate the haplotype_frequencies from pooled_sequencing the proposed method uses as inputs a database of haplotypes and pooled sequencing results and returns estimated frequency for each haplotype contained in the database a mathematical framework is first presented to translate haplotype frequency_estimation as solving a system of linear equations nnreg algorithm is employed to calculate the frequencies of haplotypes effects of various factors in sequencing on the performance of our method were evaluated using simulated_data the effects of unknown haplotypes contained in the pooled_samples were also demonstrated comparison with harp on both simulated_data and publicly_available illumina sequencing_data showed that our method may be more preferable for current massive_parallel finally on the basis of accurate estimation of haplotype frequency from pooled_sequencing we revealed that it is feasible to identify rare haplotype carriers cost effectively by applying overlapping pool sequencing we have implemented the method in an open_source ehapp estimate haplotype frequency from pooled_sequencing http bioinfo seu edu cn ehapp taking_advantage of prior haplotype_information contained in the database we present ehapp for inferring haplotype_frequencies from pooled_sequencing nnreg algorithm is employed to calculate the frequency which achieves sparse recovery by means of a conventional non negative least_squares algorithm and the optimal for nnreg could be obtained by conducting substantial simulations b comparison on simulated sequencing_data with read_length ranging from to bp r denotes the results for real illumina sequencing_reads with length_bp and s denotes the results for simulated sequencing_reads with length_bp outliners for box plots are not shown haplotype with true frequency lower than is neglected in the statistics of r diffresults of experiments on simulated sequencing_data showed that higher depth of coverage and lower error_rate could improve the performance of our method with sequencing_error our method could estimate the frequencies of haplotypes with only about average relative_errors for pooled sequencing of the mixture of haplotypes with total coverage of thanks to the simplification for m our method could maintain excellent_performance for haplotypes with actual frequencies higher than when unknown haplotypes exist comparisons with harp on simulated_data in conjunction with real sequencing_data showed that our method is more outstanding for short_reads with respect to snp density and preferable for current massive_parallel analysis for arabidopsis data also revealed that our method performed better in distinguishing similar haplotypes since only the proportions of a t c and g for each snp are used to recover haplotype_frequencies our method is much faster and requires fewer memories compared with harp which takes all the reads into calculation at last we proved that overlapping pool sequencing could be applied in screening for rare haplotype carriers as long as haplotype_frequencies can be inferred accurately from pooled_sequencing the number of samples used in hapmap allows the project to find of haplotypes with frequencies of or greater in a population however haplotypes with low frequencies can also be observed for many populations although substantial errors happened for estimating the frequency of haplotype with proportion lower than when unknown haplotype exists this drawback could be addressed by completing the database to include haplotypes as much as possible alternatively the number of pooled individuals could be constrained to be smaller than a threshold to make the lowest haplotype frequency higher than therefore the frequency for known haplotype could still be inferred accurately even when unknown haplotypes exist one major application of our method is in casecontrol_studies for finding diseases associated with haplotypes after estimating frequencies for case and control samples independently haplotype with frequencies that differ statistically_significantly could be ascertained as disease associated haplotypes if the diseaseassociated haplotype is rare overlapping pool sequencing could be applied to identify the carriers among large_scale samples precisely with much lower cost we hope that our methods could be applied in the gwha and screening for rare haplotype carriers besides our method could also be applicable in non pool situations such as inferring the frequency of variants of duplicated regions e g transposable_elements the software implementing the method ehapp is open_source and available for download and can be easily integrated into existing analysis_pipelines note two haplotypes are identical for homozygous individuals aedal is assigned as the rare haplotype the th and th samples are simulated as heterozygous_carriers for haplotype aedal
