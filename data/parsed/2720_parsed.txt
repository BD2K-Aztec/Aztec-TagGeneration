systems_biology linkcomm an r package for the generation visualization and analysis of link communities in networks of arbitrary size and type an essential element when analysing the structure function and dynamics of biological_networks is the identification of communities of related nodes an algorithm proposed recently enhances this process by clustering the links between nodes rather than the nodes themselves thereby allowing each node to belong to multiple_overlapping or nested communities the r package linkcomm implements this algorithm and extends it in several aspects i the clustering_algorithm handles networks that are weighted directed or both weighted and directed ii several visualization methods are implemented that facilitate the representation of the link communities and their relationships iii a suite of functions are included for the downstream_analysis of the link communities including novel community_based measures of node centrality iv the main algorithm is written in c and designed to handle networks of any size and v several clustering_methods are available for networks that can be handled in memory and the number of communities can be adjusted by the user the advent_of technologies in the biological_sciences has resulted in a large amount of data that can often be represented as systems of interacting elements such as genes or proteins to understand how the nodes in these networks relate to one another and how the topologies of the networks influence how they work an extremely useful analytical_approach is to identify sets of related nodes known as communities until recently this was conducted by clustering nodes in the network however a major_drawback to this approach is that each node can belong to only a single community and in denselyconnected networks subnetworks may often overlap to such an extent that this approach becomes unsuitably restrictive a superior method that circumvents this constraint is to cluster the links between nodes thereby allowing nodes to belong to multiple communities and consequently revealing the overlapping and nested to whom correspondence should be addressed structure of the network we implement the algorithm outlined by which employs the jaccard coefficient for assigning similarity between links e ik and e jk that share a node k where n i refers to the first order node neighbourhood of node i after assigning pairwise similarities to all of the links in the network the links are hierarchically clustered and the resulting dendrogram is cut at a point that maximizes the density of links within the clusters normalizing against the maximum and minimum numbers of links possible in each cluster known as the partition density
