databases_and dbgsh a database of s glutathionylation s glutathionylation the reversible protein posttranslational_modification ptm that generates a mixed disulfide_bond between glutathione and cysteine_residue critically regulates protein activity stability and redox_regulation due to its importance in regulating oxi dative nitrosative_stress and balance in cellular response a number of methods have been rapidly developed to study s glutathionylation thus expanding the dataset of experimentally_determined glutathiony lation sites however there is currently no database dedicated to the integration of all experimentally_verified s glutathionylation sites along with their characteristics or structural or functional information thus the dbgsh database has been created to integrate all available data_sets and to provide the relevant structural analysis as of january dbgsh has manually collected experimentally_verified s glutathionylated peptides from research_articles using a text_mining approach to solve the problem of heterogeneity of the data collected from different sources the sequence_identity of the reported s glutathionylated peptides is mapped to uniprotkb protein entries to delineate the structural correlations and consensus motifs of these s glutathionylation sites the dbgsh database also provides structural and functional_analyses including the motifs of substrate sites solvent_accessibility protein secondary_and protein_domains and gene_ontology availability_and dbgsh is now freely_accessible ats glutathionylation is a redox_dependent posttranslational_modification ptm that involves the covalent_attachment of glutathione gsh to the thiol group of cysteine_residues and regulates based on the physiological gsh level and the gsh_gssg through spontaneous or enzymatic_reaction in addition to regulating redox_signaling s glutathionylation also serves to modulate cancer migration cell_death and survival energy_metabolism and glycolysis as well as protein_folding and degradation in several species ranging from bacteria to human the various targets of s glutathionylation also participate in pathogenesis of many diseases such as neurodegenerative_diseases metabolic_disorders and cancers due to the importance of s glutathionylation in clinical biological_processes numerous methods have been developed directed toward mass_spectrometry based s glutathionomics using various biological_systems to investigate and identify s glutathionylated targets and sites as the number of experimentally_identified s glutathionylated peptides grows a structured database is desirable for the further investigation of the biological_functions of s glutathionylated proteins and the substrate_specificities of s glutathionylation sites although a number of databases have been developed for ptms such as dbptm phosphositeplus regphos dbogap and dbsno limited resources have been dedicated to s glutathionylated proteins and their corresponding substrate sites thus a new database dbgsh containing the experimentally_verified s glutathionylated peptides from research_articles is proposed to facilitate the functional analysis of s glutathionylated proteins and to assist with the structural investigation of substrate sites literature pubmed id reference in addition a small number of protein s glutathionylation sites in uniprotkb are integrated into dbgsh with the corresponding literature references as of january a total of s glutathionylation associated articles covering organisms have been retrieved from pubmed in the dbgsh database there are s glutathionylated cysteines from s glutathionylated proteins supplementaryshows the statistics for the s glutathionylation data for each organism for a given protein the biological_function can be obtained from the annotation in uniprotkb to provide more effective information about protein functional and structural annotations relevant to s glutathionylated cysteines a variety of biological_databases such as interpro gene_ontology go protein_data pdb and kegg_pathway are integrated the information regarding the molecular_function cellular_components and biological_process for s glutathionylated proteins can be accessed by a cross_linking to the corresponding entry from go via a uniprotkb accession_number in addition the interpro biomart which is a web_service that provides the ability to build custom queries on the interpro database is used to extract the information about protein_domains and functional sites for the s glutathionylated proteins in dbgsh additionally the molecular_interaction and signaling_network of s glutathionylated proteins can be accessed by a cross_link that refers to the corresponding entries from kegg_pathway to study the structural_characteristics of s glutathionylation sites within the protein tertiary_structure all the experimentally_identified s glutathionylation sites are mapped to the corresponding positions in the protein entries in pdb the solvent_accessibility and secondary_structure around the substrate sites are also investigated however due to the limited information on protein_structures in pdb only of the gsh sites have corresponding tertiary_structures with reference to a previous study_investigating the structural_characteristics of ptms in proteins without known tertiary_structures two effective tools rvp net and psipred are used to predict the solvent_accessibility and secondary_structure respectively
