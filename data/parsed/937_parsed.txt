data_and characterizing gene_sets using discriminative random_walks with restart on heterogeneous biological_networks motivation analysis of co expressed gene_sets typically involves testing for enrichment of different annotations or properties such as biological_processes pathways transcription_factor etc one property at a time this common approach ignores any known relationships among the properties or the genes themselves it is believed that known biological_relationships among genes and their many properties may be exploited to more accurately reveal commonalities of a gene_set previous work has sought to achieve this by building biological_networks that combine multiple types of genegene or geneproperty relationships and performing network_analysis to identify other genes and properties most relevant to a given gene_set most existing network based_approaches for recognizing genes or annotations relevant to a given gene_set collapse information about different properties to simplify homogenize the networks results we present a network based method for ranking genes or properties related to a given gene_set such related genes or properties are identified from among the nodes of a large heterogeneous network of biological_information our method involves a random_walk with restarts performed on an initial network with multiple node and edge types that preserve more of the original specific property information than current methods that operate on homogeneous networks in this first stage of our algorithm we find the properties that are the most relevant to the given gene_set and extract a subnetwork of the original network comprising only these relevant properties we then re rank genes by their similarity to the given gene_set based on a second random_walk with restarts performed on the above subnetwork we demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm for ranking genes related to drosophila embryonic_development and aggressive responses in the brains of social animals a common task in bioinformatics is to characterize co expressed gene_sets using enrichment_methods such as hypergeometric tests or gene_set gsea associating the gene_set with other previously annotated sets these pre_existing gene_sets may be defined from many diverse types of biological_knowledge such as shared protein_domains evolutionary_origins biological_processes etc public_databases of curated annotations that enable this paradigm of gene_set characterization are highly_diverse and rapidly increasing this work addresses the challenge of incorporating heterogeneous data from multiple public resources into the task of characterizing the shared properties of a given gene_set and identifying additional genes that are important and related one broad approach employed to perform gene_set with these different public resources is to represent the data as a biological_network rather than using each data source one at a time to analyze a co expressed gene_set sources may be integrated within a network and simultaneously leveraged to identify related genes this idea was tested in the mousefunc challenge where nine algorithms for integrating heterogeneous genomic evidence on mouse genes were evaluated for their ability to discover genes related to a set of co functional_genes network based_algorithms have also been applied to other important bioinformatics tasks such as understanding causes of diseases and effects of therapies network based analysis of gene_sets in particular has been designed to extend and annotate gene_functions and modules quantify gene_set for functional molecular_networks identify subnetworks affected in or shared across diseases or cluster and find signatures of cancer_subtypes most gene_set analyses performed on a biological_network encompassing heterogeneous data types lose a significant portion of the data during network construction frequently the rich and diverse public datasets are converted to homogeneous genegene networks containing only nodes representing genes of a single species and unweighted edges of a single type in these homogenous networks an edge only represents a relationship between a pair of genes but details about the different types of evidence for that relationship are lost algorithms that rely on these networks assume that all relationships in the network are as reliable as any other other algorithms rely on improved weighted networks of gene_gene that estimate the confidence of each edge by integrating the strengths and types i e source database or experimental assay of the evidences for each relationship there are also some studies that utilize biological_networks containing more than one edge or node type however the networks in these studies usually have a structure specific to their system of interest most often containing nodes of two different types and three types of edges capturing similarity within each type of node sets and the known relationships between them although they construct heterogeneous networks these studies strictly rely on the structure of the problem and do not attempt to incorporate data from all possible sources genemania is a popular networkbased gene ranking algorithm that performed well in the mousefunc evaluations its approach specifically integrates data from many different sources without sacrificing the edge source information data from each source informs the creation of its own affinity network of genegene_interactions different affinity networks are up or down weighted based on their relevance to the original functional gene_set before being combined into a single composite and homogeneous network while the genemania approach works well and considers the types of sources that are most important to the ranking task it still discards the specific details about the genegene relationships when constructing each affinity network for example the edges within a pfam protein domain affinity network indicate that a pair of genes share a protein domain sequence but does not preserve which domain s it may have been we developed the drawr discriminative random_walk with restarts method to rank genes for their relatedness to a given gene_set using biological_networks that maintain detailed information from public data_sources our algorithm is explicitly designed to work on heterogeneous networks with multiple node types that are able to represent a complete collection of public genomic knowledge we believe that drawr is the first method of its genre with this ability we utilized the algorithm to perform the gene ranking task and simultaneously return the most relevant network_features like many other network based_algorithms that rely on guilt by association approaches our algorithm implements a modified random_walk with restart rwr however unlike other methods we employed two rounds of rwr a first round of rwr on the large noisy network of all public data which reports the network nodes related to the given query gene_set and a second stage rwr on a smaller network that includes only the query relevant nodes from the original network we evaluated our methods ability to recover left out genes from the expression domain gene_sets of drosophila embryonic_development we showed that our gene ranking_method improves when multiple data_sources are combined and when data from additional species are added to the original network we also found that the novel two round rwr approach performs better than the more common single round rwr we finally applied the drawr algorithm to a multi species study of intruder response in social animals to identify subtle and shared_genetic toolkits that underlie aggressive_behavior we have developed the drawr method to rank genes for their relatedness to a given gene_set in the context of extensive heterogeneous information represented as a network we showed that the rankings improve when more sources of information are incorporated into the network and when data from additional species are appended our algorithm applies a two stage rwr to rank related genes and as a byproduct produces a list of features that are specifically related to the gene_set we have shown its application in characterizing embryonic expression domains in drosophila and transcriptomic responses to social intruders in a cross_species study with genome_sequencing like the vertebrate_genomes genomes k and insect genomes i k underway and high_throughput becoming less expensive and more efficient a biological_network containing all public data would need to scale to thousands of species covering tens of millions of genes and potentially billions of functional interactions however in runs with the node million edge multi species heterogeneous network above representing the data required at least gb of ram and processing it took several hours using our r implementation with these requirements it becomes difficult to optimize the restart parameter or the number of selected_features in the second stage subnetwork for each query set since all of our results suggest that we are able to produce the best rankings when given the largest most diverse initial network scalability of the algorithm is an important issue and one of the driving reasons for selecting a random_walk with restart approach one common approach to address computational scalability is the paradigm of data and computation distribution offered by mapreduce the reliability and efficiency of this framework has led to its widespread_adoption and public instances e g the amazon elastic compute cloud provide a platform for users to store large_networks and deploy analysis tools on them a message passing version of the rwr algorithm maps easily to a mapreduce framework it has been implemented in the graph mining software pegasus has been shown to scale to graphs with billions of nodes and edges more recent software b lin pregel graphlab and graphx are explicitly designed to improve performance in scalable graph processing by carefully distributing data and minimizing communication costs there are several limitations to the random_walk based_approach first we are only able to represent positive information edges are only able to convey how closely_related two nodes are and nodes are only allowed to be annotated as belonging to the given gene_set however proper use of negative information may perhaps create a more nuanced network and produce better outcomes for example we may want to add edges that represent mutual_exclusivity or strong anti correlation between two nodes in the network we may also have negative_examples of a property of interest that we would like to incorporate to make rankings more accurate many of these properties may be addressed by remapping our random_walk on a connectivity network algorithm into an application of belief_propagation on probabilistic_graphical additionally although we normalize our edges by type the rwr does specifically treat different types of edges in a distinguishable way some studies have attempted to control how information is passed through different edge types by defining specific meta paths that dictate a sequence of node types that must be followed to inform a relationship between two nodes our simple two stage rwr algorithm for gene ranking provides a solution to and highlights the challenges of performing analysis of experimental_data on massive heterogeneous networks of biological_knowledge
