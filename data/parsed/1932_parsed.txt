genome_analysis gat a simulation framework for testing the association of genomic_intervals motivation a common question in genomic analysis is whether two sets of genomic_intervals overlap significantly this question arises for example when interpreting chip_seq or rna_seq in functional terms because genome_organization is complex answering this question is non trivial summary we present genomic association test gat a tool for estimating the significance of overlap between multiple sets of gen_omic intervals gat implements a null_model that the two sets of intervals are placed independently of one another but allows each sets density to depend on external variables for example isochore structure or chromosome identity gat estimates statistical_significance based on simulation and controls for multiple tests using the false_discovery availability gats source_code documentation and tutorials are available ata common question in genomic analysis is whether two sets of genomic_intervals for example chip_seq and gene_annotation classes overlap significantly more than expected by chance alone interval overlap is easy to compute but the significance can be computed analytically only for trivial situations hence significance is usually estimated by simulation under some null_model this model must account for genome_organization a model that assumes independent and uniform placement of both interval sets is almost always inappropriate when testing for association with gene_annotations because gene density strongly correlates with g c content and datasets of interest often also show g c biases here we introduce genomic association test gat a tool for computing the significance of overlap between multiple sets of genomic_intervals gat permits the restriction of the analysis to parts of a genome relevant to the experiment and accounts for chromosomal and isochore biases additional genomic_features can be controlled for by providing additional segmentation files gats approach was developed originally to test for the association of non coding transcripts with other genomic_elements but has since been applied to a variety of problems including conservation of non coding transcription between human and mouse enrichment of histone_marks and evolutionarily_conserved genomic_regions within non coding transcripts functional prediction of non coding transcripts via their neighboring genes and enrichment of chip_seq binding_events within signatures of open chromatin or disease associated intervals gats re implementation delivers to the scientific_community the extended functionality of themethods
