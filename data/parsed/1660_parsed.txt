structural_bioinformatics evol and prody for bridging protein sequence_evolution and structural_dynamics correlations between sequence_evolution and structural_dynamics are of utmost_importance in understanding_the of function and their evolution we have integrated evol a new package for fast and efficient comparative_analysis of evolutionary_patterns and conformational_dynamics into prody a computational toolbox designed for inferring protein dynamics from experimental and theoretical data using information_theoretic approaches evol coanalyzes conservation and coevolution profiles extracted from multiple_sequence of protein_families with their inferred dynamics availability_and prody and evol are open_source and freely_available under mitthe significance of protein dynamics in a wide_range of biological_functions including cell_signaling regulation and machinery is widely established in many cases sequence_variability goes hand in hand with structural_dynamics structural_dynamics correlates with evolvability or sequence and conformational diversity and enables adaptation to substrate_binding while maintaining specificity to our knowledge existing software usually relate evolutionary properties to static structures or they are exclusively dedicated to either sequence_analysis or structural_dynamics there is a need for methods that allow combined analysis of sequence co evolution and structural_dynamics these would be particularly useful if they could be performed and visualized in a versatile integrated computing environment toward addressing this need we introduce the v of prody with evol applications highlights of the new version are rich methods for coevolutionary analysis and extensions for analyzing and interpreting structural_dynamics following the approach_adopted in our recent comparative_study of sequence_conservation and coevolution patterns versus structure dynamics properties for a representative set of protein_families which has been validated in detailed case studies e g a distinctive_feature of prody is its capability to extract mechanistic_information from principal_component pca of ensembles of structures e g drug_targets the new release has several new modules and command_line applications named evol to evaluate sequence_conservation and coevolution using information_theoretic and statistical_approaches to our knowledge this is the only package that enables comparative_analysis of protein dynamics with sequence_evolution data extracted from multiple_sequence msas for protein_families evol adds new api features and command_line applications to prody for rapid assessment and visualization of sequence_conservation and coevolution patterns and allows for examining these results in the light of the structure and dynamics of proteins motivated by our current understanding of the role of intrinsic dynamics in sequence_evolution the prody api and the new extensions implemented here can harness efficient and powerful features of other open_source scientific packages e g numpy scipy and matplotlib to harness their efficient and powerful features thus making the api suitable for interactive usage and rapid and easy development of new applications
