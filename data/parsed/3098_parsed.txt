databases_and advance_access mpid t a database for sequence structure function analyses of pmhc and tr pmhc structures sequencestructurefunction information is critical in understanding the mechanism of pmhc and tr pmhc binding and recognition a database for sequencestructurefunction information on pmhc and tr pmhc interactions mhc peptide interaction_database tr version mpid t is now available augmented with the latest pdb and imgt dstructure db data advanced features and new parameters for the analysis of pmhc and tr pmhc structures availability http biolinfo org mpid t major_histocompatibility complexes mhc or human_leukocyte hlas in human are important elements of t cell_mediated they are cell_surface among which mhci proteins are ubiquitously_expressed by most cells and mhc_ii proteins are expressed by antigen_presenting apc mhc proteins bind immunogenic peptide epitopes p derived from antigens and present them as peptidemhc pmhc complexes on the cell_surface for subsequent recognition by t cell receptors tr leading to tr pmhc complexes which are responsible for t cell activation and triggering the adaptive_immune cascade understanding the physicochemical basis for the selection of certain specific peptide epitopes by mhc alleles and the consequent recognition of pmhc ligands by tr proteins is critical for the design of t cell based peptide vaccines an early collection of pmhc x_ray crystal_structures in the protein_data pdb led to the development of mpid comprising classical pmhc structures reporting pmhc interaction parameters with increasing pmhc and tr pmhc structures in the pdb and in the imgt dstructure db and reports of new interaction parameters mpid t was developed with pmhc and tr pmhc to whom correspondence should be addressed structures along with interaction parameters for the analysis of pmhc structures alone with recent rise in tr pmhc structural data in the pdb and in imgt dstructure db and updated interaction parameters there is an increasing demand for more effective and efficient computational protocols to predict t cell epitopes hence we have updated mpid t augmenting it with advanced features and new parameters for the analysis of both pmhc and tr pmhc structures to gain an in depth understanding of the structural determinants underlying tr pmhc binding and recognition mpid t aims to facilitate mining of fundamental relationships and structural_descriptors hidden within tr pmhc and pmhc interactions for in depth characterization inclusion of structural_descriptors like be msep tr docking angle and ca have facilitated in understanding the principles underlying tr pmhc binding khan and ranganathan unpublished results these descriptors can be used as parameters defining pmhc and tr pmhc interactions thereby facilitating rational development of methods to identify strong mhc binding t cell epitopes with greater_propensity to activate t cells this highlights the utility of mpidt in vaccine_research we have now enabled tr specific searches by classifying tr pmhc structures based on tr types future enhancements will include listing post_translational ptm for peptides to help understand the effect of ptm on tr pmhc binding and interaction mpid t will be updated on a quarterly basis
