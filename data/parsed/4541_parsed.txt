techniques to cope with missing_data in host pathogen protein interaction prediction motivation approaches that use supervised machine_learning for proteinprotein_interaction ppi prediction typically use features obtained by integrating several sources of data often certain attributes of the data are not available resulting in missing_values in particular our hostpathogen ppi datasets have a large fraction in the range of of missing_values which makes it challenging to apply machine_learning results we show that specialized techniques for missing_value can improve the performance of the models significantly we use cross_species information in combination with machine_learning like group_lasso with regularization we demonstrate the benefits of our approach on two ppi prediction_problems in our first example of salmonellahuman ppi prediction we are able to obtain high prediction_accuracies with precision and recall comparison with various other techniques shows an improvement of in f score over the next best technique we also apply our method to yersiniahuman ppi prediction successfully demonstrating the generality of our approach availability predicted interactions datasets features are available atidentification of proteinprotein_interactions ppis between a pathogen and its hosts will not only give us insights into the molecular_mechanisms pathogenisis but also provide us with potential targets aiding in the development of pathogen_specific therapeutics computational_methods complement experimental methods in studying ppis by predicting highly probable interactions which are used by experimentalists to filter out unlikely interactions from the prohibitively large set of potential interactions that need to be tested in particular supervised_machine use the existing known interactions as training data and formulate the interaction prediction_problem in a classification setting with target classes interacting or non interacting features are derived on the data by integrating various attributes of proteins which include protein_sequences from uniprot protein_family from pfam protein_structure from pdb gene_ontology go from the go database gene_expression from geo interactions to whom correspondence should be addressed between protein_families from ipfam protein domain interactions from did to name a few although these attributes are available for some proteins many of them remain_unknown for various reasons they are a part of ongoing experimental_studies difficulty of experimentation due to the nature of the protein lack of efficient high_throughput techniques limited pace of manual_curation from published_literature etc such unavailable information results in missing_values in the dataset missing_values make the application of any machine_learning algorithm and data analysis technique difficult as most approaches were designed to work on complete or nearly complete data imputation of missing_values involves exploiting available information about the data in order to best estimate the missing entries thus the choice of an appropriate missing_value method is very important in order to build good predictive_models here we develop methods to deal with missing_values for host pathogen ppi prediction prior work on ppi prediction within the supervised_learning framework deals with missing_values in one of the following ways eliminate all data with missing_values and use a random_forest rf classifier induced imputation originally introduced by which uses mean values of features in combination with proximity to other instances the abstaining variant of adaboost originally introduced by has been applied by the work by adds one extra binary indicator feature for every existing feature to indicate its availability limit the data_sources used to generate features so as to exclude the possibility of any missing_values as the main application of our techniques we consider salmonellahuman ppi prediction which is an important step towards developing our understanding of salmonello sis a disease that causes millions of infections and thousands of deaths every year world_wide the bacterium salmonella has protein_sequences in the reference proteome set in uniprot database known molecular_functions for proteins in go protein_structures for proteins in pdb and protein_family information for proteins in pfam_database approaches that construct features integrating data from these databases will thus have many missing_values since not all attributes are available for all proteins across all databases in the example dataset of salmonella human ppi that has known interactions with our feature_set we find that of the interactions have at least one feature with missing_values to cope with missing_values we can apply standard statistical imputation_methods or develop application specific methods that take advantage of the particular properties of the data being imputed our work falls in the second category and is novel in its use of the author s published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work the method we present is general and can be used whenever there is available data from a related distribution the proposed use of abundantly available cross_species data is analogous to sampling the missing_values of a feature from another related feature distribution we demonstrate the generality of our approach by successfully extending our modelling efforts to predict ppis in yersinia_pestis we presented an imputation technique for dealing with missing_values that arise in ppi prediction tasks the improvements we obtain on both hostpathogen ppi datasets over prior approaches that use generic imputation_methods clearly show the superiority of our method we further observe that the importance of the imputed features in the learned classifiers is significant implying that their imputation is important for prediction although our current work shows improvements in accuracy we believe that the resulting models which are based on the mar missingness assumption are less biased by the imputation technique as compared to the other commonly used methods characterizing and measuring such model bias as a consequence of imputation will be an interesting direction for future study as it will make model_selection more principled funding in part
