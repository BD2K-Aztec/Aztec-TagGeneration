sequence_analysis orthagogue an agile tool for the rapid prediction of orthology relations motivation the comparison of genes and gene_products across species depends on high_quality tools to determine the relationships between gene or protein_sequences from various species although some excellent applications are available and widely used their performance leaves room for improvement results we developed orthagogue a multithreaded c application for high_speed estimation of homology relations in massive datasets operated via a flexible and easy command_line the notion of sequence_homology in biology refers to similarities at the nucleotide or amino_acid level that may reflect ancestry and evolutionary_conservation two types of homology are most often distinguished orthology resulting from a speciation event and paralogy resulting from a gene_duplication software_tools for establishing homologies between genes or their products are becoming increasingly important to transfer knowledge from well studied model_organisms to other organisms identification of genuine homology relationships is no trivial task as it requires the knowledge of the last common_ancestor lca for every pair of sequences in theory lcas could be predicted on the basis of phylogenetic_analysis but this is not feasible at the proteome scale due to performance limitations therefore a variety of heuristic approaches are used instead of exhaustive phylogenetic_analyses to estimate orthology relations depending on the heuristics different sets of orthologs are generated with a varying degree of overlap and it is not trivial to gauge the precision of predictions objectively as a result a large number of widely used database resources e g cog kog eggnog roundup and oma were generated nevertheless as the number of complete proteomes is steadily growing even heuristic_algorithms meet their performance limitations an issue that is bound to become more and more acute in the future therefore we embarked on a high performance implementation of one of the popular heuristic approaches exemplified by the orthomcl software the orthomcl procedure comprises three major_steps performing an all against all blast basic local alignment_tool altschul et_al identification of putative orthology and inparalogy relations with the inparanoid algorithm steps and tend to be time consuming with large_datasets comprising complete proteomes in the range of a couple of days each for proteomes the exact duration depending on the setup while the time constraints of step can be mitigated by deployment on a large computer cluster there is no way to shorten step we therefore re implemented step comprising sub steps of the orthomcl procedure as outlined in its user guide http orthomcl org common downloads software v userguide txt and developed the c application orthagogue from the greek agogos lead the development of this application implied boosting the data parsing efficiency optimizing the memory use and data containers and providing a flexible command_line user_interface the result is an open_source with a significantly_shorter running time and an increased algorithmic flexibility
