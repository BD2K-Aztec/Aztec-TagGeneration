a conditional_random method for rna_sequence structure relationship modeling and conformation sampling accurate tertiary_structures are very important for the functional study of non coding rna_molecules however predicting rna_tertiary is extremely_challenging because of a large conformation space to be explored and lack of an accurate scoring_function differentiating the native_structure from decoys the fragment based conformation sampling method e g farna bears shortcomings that the limited size of a fragment library makes it infeasible to represent all possible conformations well a recent dynamic_bayesian method barnacle overcomes the issue of fragment assembly in addition neither of these methods makes use of sequence_information in sampling conformations here we present a new probabilistic_graphical conditional_random crfs to model rna sequencestructure relationship which enables us to accurately estimate the probability of an rna conformation from sequence coupled with a novel tree guided sampling scheme our crf model is then applied to rna conformation sampling experimental_results show that our crf method can model rna sequencestructure relationship well and sequence_information is important for conformation sampling our method named as treefolder generates a much higher percentage of native like decoys than farna and barnacle although we use the same simple energy function as barnacle rna has become an important research subject in recent_years and there is an increasing study of non coding rna in biology and health its growing important role appears in various life_domains and processes including regulating gene_expression interaction with other ligands and stabilizing itself to elucidate the function of an rna_molecule it is essential to determine its d structure however there are a great number of rna_sequences without solved structures experimental methods for rna d structure_determination are time consuming expensive and sometimes technically_challenging by far there are million rna_molecules with predicted_secondary in the rfam database but only of them have tertiary_structures in the nucleotide database therefore we have to fill this large_gap by predicting the d structure of an rna using computational_methods to whom correspondence should be addressed rna tertiary_structure does not gain as much attention as secondary_structure eddy and both molecular_dynamic methods and knowledge based statistical_methods have been proposed to fold rna_molecules the knowledge based statistical_methods for rna tertiary_structure consist of two major components an algorithm for conformation sampling and an energy function for differentiating the native_structure from decoys fragment assembly a knowledge based method widely used for protein_structure has been implemented in farna for rna d structure_prediction however this method has a couple of limitations i there is no guarantee that any region of an rna_structure can be accurately covered by structure fragments in the rna solved structure database which currently contains only a limited number of non redundant solved rna_structures and ii sequence_information is not employed in farna for conformation sampling mc sym is a motif assembly method for rna d structure_prediction which uses a library of nucleotides cyclic motifs ncm to construct an rna_structure mc sym has a time complexity exponential with respect to rna length i e the number of nucleotides so mc sym may not be used to predict the tertiary_structure for a very large rna as reported in mc sym also fails in the case when the secondary_structure of rna lacks cyclic motifs recently have proposed a probabilistic_model barnacle of rna conformation space barnacle uses a dynamic_bayesian dbn to model rna_structures but this dbn method does not take into consideration any sequence_information in addition barnacle models the interdependency between the local conformations of only two adjacent nucleotides but not of more nucleotides other rna three_dimensional structure_prediction can be found in das and baker this article_presents a novel probabilistic_method conditional_random crfs to model rna sequencestructure relationship different from barnaclewe use rnas tested by both barnacle and farna to benchmark our method treefolder these rnas contain nucleotides and are not homologous to any structures in our training_dataset in case an rna has multiple nmr structures we use the first structure in the pdb_file as its native_structure it is not very reliable to compare two methods simply using the decoys with the lowest rmsd since they may be generated by chance and also depend on the number of decoys to be generated the more decoys are generated the more likely the lowest rmsd decoy has lower rmsd from the native therefore a better strategy is to compare the rmsd distributions of decoys our treefolder generates better decoys than farna we compare farna and treefolder in terms of the quality of the decoy clustering centroids similar to farna clustering only on the top decoys with the lowest energy we run maxcluster to cluster the top of our decoys with the lowest energy into five clusters as shown in treefolder can generate decoys with better cluster centroids for nine rnas a d esy kka q a xjr zih sp a and f by the way even if a significantly_smaller number of decoys is generated by us the lowest rmsd decoys by our treefolder for a d zih and sp still have smaller rmsd than those by farna our treefolder generates better decoys than barnacle displays the and quantiles of the rmsd distributions for decoys generated by barnacle and treefolder the quantiles by barnacle are taken from supplementary table s in barnacle considers only decoys with energy since this kind of decoys are likely to have more correct base_pairings we use exactly the same energy function as barnacle so we also consider only decoys with energy to ensure a fair comparison we did not generate as many decoys as barnacle and thus for some test rnas we do not have many decoys with energy in this case we use decoys with energy on the rnas shown inpage i i i bold numbers indicate better distributions columns energy and energy list the number of decoys with energy and respectively bps is the number of base_pairings for of the tested rnas the model using sequence_information yields decoys with much smaller median rmsd bold numbers indicate smaller rmsd values distributions for eight of them esy kka q a qwa xjr zih sp a and f sequence_information is important for rna conformation sampling different from other two state of art methods farna and barnacle our treefolder makes use of sequence_information to significantly improve conformation sampling as measured by the median rmsd values of decoys the result is shown in in which we compare two crf models one using sequence to sample conformations and the other not without using sequence_information our crf method is similar to barnacle that is it models only angle state_transitions in a rna_structure both crf models use conformation states for the crf model without sequence_features the regularization factor is set to i e while for the crf model utilizing sequence_information the regularization factor are set to and i e to calculate the median rmsd for each rna we generate decoys using the two crf models sampling real valued angles generates better decoys in order to show the detailed difference between our treefolder and farna we look into the decoys of esy we choose it because that farnaand treefolder yield the largest difference on this rna among all the tested rna_molecules as shown in treefolder can generate a much larger percentage of decoys with rmsd than farna we also compute local rmsd of each position in the decoys which is defined as the rmsd of the segment of four consecutive nucleotides starting with this position as compared to the native_structure we calculate the correlation between the local rmsd of each position with the global rmsd as shown in among the decoys generated by both farna and treefolder the local rmsd at position has the highest correlation with the global rmsd we also calculate the angle error at each position by error vv where v is the angle vector of a decoy at one position and v is the native angle vector at the same position shows the angle error histograms in three positions page i i i accurate secondary_structure the results for l x and a from predicted secondary_structures are quite bad since all of their base_pairs are contained in a h type pseudoknot and only half of their base_pairs are recovered by contrafold however our treefolder generates decent conformations for half of the pseudoknot with predicted base_pairs as shown in brackets in particular treefolder generates decent structures for a from nucleotides to and for l x from nucleotides to respectively in order to improve sampling performance on the whole structures of l x and a we need an energy function like what is used in farna to guide the folding simulation
