detecting time periods of differential_gene using gaussian processes an application to endothelial_cells exposed to radiotherapy_dose fraction downloaded from motivation identifying the set of genes_differentially along time is an important task in two sample time course experiments furthermore estimating at which time periods the differential_expression is present can provide_additional temporal gene_functions the current differential detection methods are designed to detect difference along observation time intervals or on single_measurement points warranting dense measurements along time to characterize the full temporal differential expression_patterns results we propose a novel bayesian likelihood_ratio to estimate the differential_expression time periods applying the ratio test to systems of genes provides the temporal response timings and durations of gene_expression to a biological condition we introduce a novel non stationary gaussian_process as the underlying expression model with major_improvements on model fitness on perturbation and stress experiments the method is robust to uneven or sparse measurements along time we assess the performance of the method on realistically simulated dataset and compare against state of the art methods we additionally apply the method to the analysis of primary human endothelial_cells under an ionizing_radiation stress to study the transcriptional perturbations over measured genes in an attempt to better understand the role of endothelium in both normal and cancer tissues during radiotherapy as a result using the cascade of differential_expression periods domain literature and gene enrichment_analysis we gain insights into the dynamic_response of endothelial_cells to irradiation availability_and r package nsgp is available at www ibisc fr en logiciels arobas contactwith the advent_of measurement technologies large_scale systems_biology experiments are now routinely performed the first step towards understanding the system level responses is determining the genes that are differentially_expressed across samples obtained from two or multiple biological conditions which is usually performed over static microarray measurements however time series measurements of the transcriptomic state of the cells are necessary to reveal additional information of the inherently dynamic_regulation and function of the cells several differential_expression methods have been designed for time series data with majority of them testing whether the two sample time series are differential throughout the whole time course in this article we focus on the currently overlooked task of determining when genes are differentially_expressed from time series experiments under two sample setting e g control and case both bayesian and frequentist statistical_tests have been proposed for time series data in the bayesian_approach a bayes_factor between a null hypothesisassuming no differential expressionand a differential hypothesis is often approximated by computing the likelihood_ratios of the observed data against the competing_hypotheses in the differential hypothesis separate timeseries models are learned for both biological conditions while in the null_hypothesis a single model explains both samples a difference is declared if the two time series can be explained more confidently using separate differential models compared to a single null_model these approaches have been applied to testing whole time series to determine if a gene is differentially_expressed or not introduced the first test for estimating differential_expression separately for individual observation times to produce time intervals of differential_expression a time period between two neighboring and differential measured time points is assumed to be differential as well this allows characterizing the starting and ending times of the differential_expression providing for a temporal characterisation of the underlying biological_processes the time periods are restricted to start and end at an observed time point however in the case of sparse or uneven observation times it is highly_desirable to be able to estimate differential_expression accurately between measured timepoints producing a continuous estimate of the differential_expression time periods in this article we extend the approach ofby introducing a method for unconstrained detection of differentially_expressed time periods which need not to contain measured timepoints we propose two likelihood_ratio that measure the expected data likelihood instead of the observed data likelihood these can be evaluated naturally over probabilistic underlying expression models we consider the gaussian_process gpr models which have been commonly_applied to model time course gene_expression and are an apt model for likelihood_ratio estimation gpr models are a flexible class of non parametric bayesian_models which quantify the uncertainty of the underlying process estimates using gaussian_distributions gpr models of temporal gene_expression have been extended with outlier_detection hierarchical replicate models and clustering bootstrapping and with ordinary_differential ode model integrations a ij and l hdesm ki gpr models naturally support replicate measurements missing_values and sparse observation times an important particularity of many gene_expression is that they are generally obtained from a perturbation of the basal system under study as other non parametric_models gprs based on time invariant parameters are not appropriate to model kinetics in response to a perturbation to improve the accuracy of the modeling we consider non stationary gaussian processes that is gpr models that do not assume time invariance hence ideal to perturbation experiments they can model the early_and perturbation responses by varying the model smoothness we introduce a non stationary gaussian_kernel where the kernel variance is restricted to a logarithmic function of time which is directly learned from the data we consider a human endothelial_cell irradiation response experiment to elucidate gene_expression inhibitions and activations in the irradiated cells irradiation is an important class of stress to endothelial_cells for both normal_tissues and tumors during radiotherapy perturbation of the endothelial system by ionizing_radiation which remains mostly unknown has important consequences on the radiosensitivity of both normal and cancer tissues it is therefore of major importance to better understanding the biological_consequences of exposure_to and particularly to decipher the network perturbations that lead to a pathological phenotype of the cells we assess the method against a realistical simulated gene_expression time series and apply the novel ratios to the analysis of human_umbilical huvec under a realistic radiotherapy_dose fraction gy against a control cell_population as a direct result of the method over this large_scale gene system an insightful cascade of differential_expression time periods of the observed genes emerges below we present a non stationary gaussian_process model in section and introduce a non stationary gaussian_kernel and two novel likelihood_ratios in its subsections in section we evaluate the method against a simulated dataset and apply it to study the large_scale dynamic genetic response to irradiation we conclude in section we evaluate the performance of the non stationary gaussian models and likelihood_ratios against a realistically generated simulated dataset and conduct exploratory experiments on huvec under irradiation we model the gene_expression using the gpr models and estimate the time periods of differential_gene under irradiation
