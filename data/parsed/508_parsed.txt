genome_analysis aspeak an abundance sensitive peak_detection algorithm for rip_seq unlike dna rna abundances can vary over several orders_of thus identification of rnaprotein binding_sites from high_throughput sequencing_data presents_unique although peak identification in chip_seq has been extensively explored there are few bioinformatics_tools tailored for peak_calling on analogous datasets for rna_binding here we describe aspeak abundance sensitive peak_detection algorithm an implementation of an algorithm that we previously applied to detect peaks in exon_junction rna immunoprecipitation in tandem experiments our peak_detection algorithm yields stringent and robust target sets enabling sensitive motif_finding and downstream functional_analyses availability aspeak is implemented in perl as a complete pipeline that takes bedgraph files as input aspeak implementation is freely_available at https sourceforge net_projects as peak under the gnu_general aspeak can be run on a personal computer yet is designed to be easily parallelizable aspeak can also run on high_performance clusters providing efficient speedup the documentation and user_manual can be obtained from http master dl sourceforge net project as peak manual pdf high_throughput of short rna_fragments directly associated with rna_binding enables transcriptomewide mapping of protein binding_sites on rnas such binding_sites can be enriched by either immunopurification ip of rna protein_complexes rip or cross_linking followed by ip clip these approaches are analogous to chip experiments for dna_binding although identification of peaks in chip_seq has been addressed by numerous approaches development of specific bioinformatics_tools for rnaprotein binding_site identification has lagged behind with few alternatives with the recent explosion of high_throughput sequencing_data for dozens of rna_binding there is an urgent need to develop efficient and userfriendly applications to better address the computational challenges of identifying peaks in sequences with variable starting abundances here we describe a new peak_detection algorithm that is sensitive to differential_expression levels of target_transcripts this approach_enables robust peak_detection even in low_abundance transcripts we previously used our algorithm to define binding_sites for the exon_junction ejc here we describe an open_source and a much improved implementation of this abundance sensitive peak_detection algorithm aspeak aspeak is a fast and efficient expression sensitive peak caller for clip and rip_seq data aspeak implementation has the ability to run on multiple processors resulting in a significant speedup when used on high_performance centers compared with macs or piranha aspeak provides comparable or better results when used in an expression sensitive mode in addition aspeak is supported with extensive documentation that allows experienced bioinformaticians to customize their analyses using detailed parameter files finally a streamlined mode is available for biologists with limited knowledge of linux systems to easily run aspeak using default_settings our implementation aspeak is an open_source command_line program input_files are rna_seq clip rip_seq data in bed sam bam bowtie format and region annotation files such as refseq in bed format peak regions are output in a tab separated format aspeak can be run using a single command in a streamlined and simple manner additionaly aspeak can be parallelized and allows advanced users to run different steps separately for effective debugging and specialized applications
