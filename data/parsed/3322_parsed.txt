genome_analysis omega an overlap_graph de_novo assembler for metagenomics motivation metagenomic_sequencing allows reconstruction of microbial_genomes directly from environmental_samples omega overlap_graph metagenome assembler was developed for assembling and scaffolding illumina sequencing_data of microbial_communities results omega found overlaps between reads using a prefix suffix hash_table the overlap_graph of reads was simplified by removing transitive edges and trimming short branches unitigs were generated based on minimum cost flow analysis of the overlap_graph and then merged to contigs and scaffolds using mate_pair information in comparison with three de_bruijn assemblers soapdenovo idba ud and metavelvet omega provided comparable overall performance on a hiseq bp dataset and superior_performance on a miseq bp dataset in comparison with celera on the miseq data_set omega provided more continuous assemblies overall using a fraction of the computing time of existing overlap_layout assemblers this indicates omega can more efficiently assemble longer illumina_reads and at deeper coverage for metagenomic_datasets availability_and implemented in c with source_code freely_available omega omicsbio org metagenome assemblers attempt to reconstruct genomes of microorganisms in a community from its metagenomic sequencing_data in recent_years many isolate genome_assemblers have been developed for illumina sequencing_data using de_bruijn e g abyss idba allpath velvet and soapdenovo and overlap graphs e g sga and pegasus however they cannot be directly applied to metagenome_assembly for the following reasons first isolate genome_assemblers typically assume a uniform coverage depth across a genome this assumption is used for identifying repeat regions in a genome and estimating the size of a genome in metagenome_assembly however genomes may have vastly different coverage depths depending on their relative_abundances in a community second isolate genome_assembly only needs to resolve repeat regions within a single_genome while metagenome_assembly also has to handle repeat regions between multiple_genomes third sequencing_errors significantly convolute the assembly by introducing false overlaps between reads and disrupting true overlaps error_correction can be performed for isolate genome_assembly using consensus_sequences however it is difficult to separate sequencing_errors from single_nucleotide snps in metagenome_assembly to address these challenges some of the de_bruijn assemblers have been upgraded for illumina metagenomic sequencing_data including metavelvet and idba ud in this study the omega overlap_graph metagenome assembler algorithm was developed specifically for metagenome_assembly omega followed the general overlap_graph string_graph approach described in boa and pegasus here the overlap_graph approach was adapted to metagenome_assembly by addressing its differences from isolate genome_assembly described above the assembly performance of omega was compared with soapdenovo idba ud and metavelvet on illumina_hiseq bp data and miseq bp data soapdenovo was selected because it was used for metagenome_assembly in the human_microbiome and many joint genome institute studies idba ud and metavelvet were designed specifically for metagenome_assembly a widely used overlap_layout assembler celera was also compared using the miseq bp data
