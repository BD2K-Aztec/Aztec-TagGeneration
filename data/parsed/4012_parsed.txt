gene_expression rigorous assessment of gene_set tests motivation several statistical_tests are available to detect the enrichment of differential_expression in gene_sets such tests were originally proposed for analyzing gene_sets associated with biological_processes the objective_evaluation of tests on real measurements has not been possible as it is difficult to decide a priori which processes will be affected in given experiments results we present a first large study to rigorously assess and compare the performance of gene_set tests on real expression measurements gene_sets are defined based on the targets of given regulators such as transcription_factors tfs and micrornas mirnas in contrast to processes tfs and mirnas are amenable to direct perturbations e g regulator over expression or deletion we assess the ability of different statistical_tests to predict the perturbations from expression measurements in escherichia_coli saccharomyces_cerevisiae and human we also analyze how performance depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the regulator targets via a permutation approach we find that anova and wilcoxons test consistently perform better than for instance kolmogorovsmirnov and hypergeometric tests for scenarios where the optimal test is not known we suggest to combine all evaluated tests into an unweighted consensus which also performs well in our assessment our results provide a guide for the selection of existing tests as well as a basis for the development and assessment of novel tests the interpretation of gene_expression studies is difficult because a large_number or other expressed sequences are profiled instead of individual genes it has been proposed to analyze the expression of gene_sets that correspond to biological_processes the gene_ontology go is an example source for biological_process definitions and process associated gene_sets the analysis of expression data in the context of gene_sets can be performed by many different enrichment tests these tests aim to detect gene_sets exhibiting significant differential_expression however it is not known a priori which processes will be affected in a given expression experiment this lack of a dependable standard of truth has prevented an objective selection and evaluation of enrichment tests on real_data to whom correspondence should be addressed targets of gene_expression regulators such as transcription_factors tfs and micrornas mirnas can also be treated as gene_sets tfs are regulatory_proteins that bind to the promoter_regions of target_genes tgs to regulate their levels of expression mirnas are short nucleotides non_coding that are incorporated into the rna_induced risc to regulate the stability and translation of messenger_rna mrna_transcripts the activity of such regulators is not visible on the mrna_level tfs are frequently modulated at the post_transcriptional level and mirnas are usually not profiled it is thus important to indirectly determine the activity of regulators by analyzing their tgs here the same tests are employed that were devised for analyzing biological_processes we propose tfs and mirnas and their associated sets of tgs for the rigorous evaluation of gene_set tests the experimental perturbation of regulators offers the required standard of truth that is not available for biological_processes given regulator deletion or over expression experiments we consider the experimentally perturbed and the remaining regulators with their corresponding sets of tgs as positives_and respectively we thus evaluate the ability of statistical_tests to infer the perturbed regulator from the expression of its tgs the present study thereby conducts the first large comparison and rigorous assessment of gene_set tests on real_data we applied start of the art statistical_methods to test whether expression changes in regulator target sets might be due to chance in the following sections we review the field of gene_set tests and describe our approach to rank enrichment tests
