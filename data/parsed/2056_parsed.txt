giant gene_set uncertainty in enrichment_analysis over the past_years growing_knowledge about biological_processes and pathways revealed complex interaction networks involving many genes in order to understand these networks analysis of differential_expression has continuously moved from single genes towards the study of gene_sets various approaches for the assessment of gene_sets have been developed in the context of gene_set gsa these approaches are bridging the gap between raw measurements and semantically meaningful terms we present a novel approach for assessing uncertainty in the definition of gene_sets this is an essential step when new gene_sets are constructed from domain_knowledge or given gene_sets are suspected to be affected by uncertainty quantification of uncertainty is implemented in the r package giant we also included widely used gsa methods embedded in a generic framework that can readily be extended by custom methods the package provides an easy to use front end and allows for fast parallelization availability_and the package giant is available on cran differential_expression investigates the association of measurements of single genes to a predefined phenotype e g tumour versus inflammation frequently yielding thousands of differentially_expressed such analyses are often hard to interpret in a biological_context gene_set analyses aim at assigning a meaning to differentially_expressed by comparing them to sets of genes whose relevance in processes or pathways is known such gene_sets can be derived e g from gene_ontology kegg agefactdb reactome wikipathways or other collections of gene_sets albeit frequently used gene_set suffers from pitfalls concerning the significance assessment also the large variety of methods makes the choice of which analysis to use often difficult beside that issues arise from the crafting of the gene_sets for example rapidly_changing knowledge may not only affect the members of sets but also the mapping of probe_sets to gene identifiers e g if a gene_set is only enriched in the data because of genes that have been wrongly assigned to the gene_set to address_these of generating gene_sets we present a novel method to quantify the uncertainty in gene_set analyses this method assesses the impact of changes in the gene_set definition on the result of a gene_set we apply a bootstrap type resampling strategy in which parts of the original gene_set are replaced by randomly choosen genes by analyzing the derived credibility intervals an estimate of the certainty in the definition of the gene_set can be derived such robustness assessments are essential for the validation of custom hand crafted gene_sets and are also of interest for sets extracted from the knowledge bases mentioned above we demonstrate the handling of the giant package using a dataset of six p deficient liver tumor_samples and seven samples of deninduced liver_tumors in mice the dataset includes genes and no missing_values followingwe extracted the gene_expression values and performed a preprocessing of the dataset using the standard workflow for normalization baseline and percentile shifts were performed after log transformation showed a significant_enrichment of a hand crafted rb pathway gene_set in this dataset the set consists of up stream genes interaction_partners and downstream_targets related to the rb pathway all genes were collected from literature using the pubmed_database expression levels of the rb pathway genes in the data are illustrated in in the following we evaluate the uncertainty in the definition of this hand crafted rb pathway gene_set as a test_statistic the average absolute spearman_correlation to the class label of all genes in the set is calculated

of uncertainty for each value of k the quantiles of the resulting distribution are given k gives the null_distribution with the lower horizontal green line showing the corresponding quantile the upper horizontal red line gives the value of the test_statistic for the rb pathway t the black vertical_line indicates the degree of uncertainty where the two distributions null_distribution and distribution with a fixed degree of uncertainty do not overlap as we can see even for of random genes the perturbed gene_sets achieve_higher scores than the quantile of the null_distribution and are thus statistically_significant with respect to the null_distribution this indicates that the rb pathway gene_set is robustly enriched k in the dataset we developed a new robustness analysis that assesses and quantifies the performed enrichment_analyses using a partial resampling approach these anylses are especially important for newly found pathways but also well established and curated databases suffer from errors and uncertainty in their gene_set definitions our method allows now a quantification of the gene_set uncertainty and therefore an assessment of the validity of the enrichment_analyses the approach is implemented in the r package giant which also provides a comprehensive toolkit for generic gene_set apart from standard methods like gsea user_defined workflows can be constructed readily within the flexible pipeline mechanism this allows the user to build new high_level analyses adapted to the specific context of use
