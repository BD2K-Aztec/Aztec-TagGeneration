databases_and tisged a database for tissue_specific genes the tissue_specific genes are a group of genes whose function and expression are preferred in one or several tissues cell_types identification of these genes helps better understanding of tissuegene relationship etiology and discovery of novel tissue_specific drug_targets in this study a statistical_method is introduced to detect tissue_specific genes from more than gene_expression over human tissues mouse_tissues and rat_tissues as a result a novel subject specialized repository namely the tissue_specific genes database tisged is developed to represent the analyzed results auxiliary information of tissue_specific genes was also collected from biomedical literatures the spatial and temporal_variation in gene_expression carries crucial information of what the gene does thanks to the emergence of high_throughput like microarray the expressions of thousands of genes in multiple tissues can be now monitored simultaneously databases were thus constructed for storing representing and retrieving the information upon these databases a series of effective analysis tools were developed as well to explore and interpret the massive_amounts of data in the context of existing knowledge these include some sophisticated algorithms that are able to align or cluster the gene_expression so as to identify those non trivial patterns such as correlated expression differential_expression and specific expression some even mapped the gene_expression onto the regulatory metabolic and cellular_pathways nowadays there exist a lot of databases containing tissue_specific expression information some databases like geo and arrayexpress generally deposit microarray_datasets produced by various experiments some databases like tiger bodymap biogps and tissuedistributiondbs however mainly collect datasets of tissue_specific expressions many of these databases enable users to visualize and statistically analyze gene_expression some further provide special tools to facilitate to whom correspondence should be addressed the detection of non trivial patterns in this study we introduce a novel subject specialized database namely the tissue_specific genes database tisged which particularly provides information of tissue_specific genes derived from literature and data_mining of gene_expression
