riber diber a software_suite for crystal content analysis in the studies of protein nucleic_acid complexes co crystallization experiments of proteins with nucleic_acids do not guarantee that both components are present in the crystal we have previously_developed diber to predict crystal content when protein and dna are present in the crystallization mix here we present riber which should be used when protein and rna are in the crystallization drop the combined riber diber suite builds on machine_learning to make reliable quantitative predictions of crystal content for non expert users and high_throughput crystallography availability the program source_code linux binaries and a web_server are available at http diber iimcb gov pl riber diber requires diffraction data to at least resolution in mtz or cif web_server only format protein crystallographers who work on proteinnucleic acid complexes routinely face the problem that crystals that grow in a co crystallization experiment do not necessarily contain all components present in the solution the crystal content can be clarified by spectroscopic_methods but the equipment for such measurements is not commonly available alternatively crystals can be washed dissolved and analyzed by gel_electrophoresis with appropriate staining but this method is labor_intensive destructive and does not always provide a clear_cut answer in this work we present the new program riber for detecting the presence of rna stems in macromolecular crystals based on diffraction data alone riber complements the previously_developed program diber intended to search for double_stranded b dna and not doublestranded a rna the two programs are implemented as a stand alone software_suite and a web_server riber diber providing an easy way to judge nucleic_acid content of a crystal based on a diffraction dataset before the crystal_structure is solved to whom correspondence should be addressed the method may help to avoid a laborious phasing procedure when the component or the complex of interest is not present in the crystal both riber and diber extract two parameters from the dataset the first is a measure of a unit_cell size and is primarily used to distinguish nucleic_acid crystals from all others the second parameter is a measure for the largest local average of reflection intensities a large value for this parameter indicates the presence of very characteristic diffraction signals related to the regular stacking of a rna or b dna base_pairs a support_vector svm is used to make a prediction using either only the two parameters described above or optionally also a third score combined mode available for diber only which is calculated with the help of the molecular_replacement program phaser for those users who hold a license free for academic users diber and riber use similar parameterizations of the diffraction data and a svm to classify crystal content
