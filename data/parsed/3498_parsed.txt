sequence_analysis peptidelocator prediction of bioactive_peptides in protein_sequences motivation peptides play_important in signalling regulation and immunity within an organism many have successfully been used as therapeutic products often mimicking naturally_occurring peptides here we present peptidelocator for the automated prediction of functional peptides in a protein_sequence results we have trained a machine_learning algorithm to predict bio active_peptides within protein_sequences peptidelocator performs well on training data achieving an area under the curve of when tested in fold_cross on a set of redundancy reduced peptide containing protein_sequences it has predictive_power when applied to antimicrobial_peptides cytokines growth_factors peptide_hormones toxins venoms and other peptides it can be applied to refine the choice of experimental_investigations in functional studies of proteins availability_and peptidelocator is freely_available for academic users atpeptides which are often generated by cleavage from precursor_proteins are important molecules found in all organisms and play a role in a wide_range it is this universal distribution along with the diversity of functions that they undertake that make peptides interesting as putative therapeutic_agents for example as antimicrobials or analgesics peptides can function as hormones and immunomodulating agents through interactions with cytokines receptors and other signalling proteins and have attracted significant interest with recent appreciation of their ability to act as inhibitors or antagonists of proteinprotein_interaction other diverse functions include quorum_sensing in the regulation of gut bacteria populations inhibition or activation of enzymes e g ace_inhibitors membrane_bound protein channels transporters and receptors by toxin or venom peptides and the disruption of cell_membranes to facilitate the destruction of microbial cells by antimicrobial_peptides while most bioactive_peptides have been defined with a view to being therapeutic not all are so including for example toxins produced by one organism that may limit the growth of another organism or peptides found to inhibit an enzyme in an in vitro assay the definition of bioactive used here is a general catch all term for peptides having biological_effects and is representative of the concept that there may be some commonalities shared among diverse bioactive_peptides derived from larger precursor_proteins several health_benefits have been associated with bioactive_peptides particularly those derived from food_sources such as plants and bovine_milk they have been shown to be functionally_active from simple dipeptides in ace_inhibition to larger milk peptides important in immunogenicity and nutrition in early development specific health_promoting properties of food peptides include antithrombotic antimicrobial mineral binding opiod immune and cytomodulatory and blood_pressure reduction with many peptides exhibiting more than one function functional additives in food are an increasingly interesting area of development given the potential to deliver improvements in diet health and resistance to infection peptides offer a naturally derivable source of such functional_foods and as a result there has been considerable interest in the identification of bioactive_peptides in food_products particularly milk several peptides have already been commercialized as nutraceuticals demonstrating the need for more methods for the detection and characterization of novel bioactive_peptides in this area many databases have been created cataloguing instances of bioactive_peptides these include pepbank peptidedb biopep and the antimicrobial_peptide databases apd and camp the peptide activity classes found in peptidedb and biopep include antimicrobial_peptides cytokines_and peptide_hormones and toxin venom peptides whereas apd and camp are limited to antimicrobial_peptides such as antiviral to whom correspondence should be addressed antifungal antibacterial and antiparasitic peptides such databases have facilitated the bioinformatic_analysis of peptides promoting the creation of tools to aid in the identification of bioactive_peptides the identification of bioactive_peptides within protein_sequences is the first step in the development of a therapeutic product in food based protein precursors bioactive_peptides can be isolated by bacterial fermentation or through the use of gastrointestinal or alternative proteolytic_enzymes in silico strategies used to detect novel bioactive_peptides include the examination of sequence and structure homology as well as the emerging approaches of peptidomics homologybased prediction of bioactivity has successfully identified many instances of antimicrobial_peptides other bioinformatic_methods have been used to predict peptide modulators of human platelet_function as in many applications of bioinformatics tools for the prediction of bioactivity have used propensity scales which capture information about the statistical preferences of different amino_acids to be bioactive_peptides or not other prediction_tools have been based_on hidden_markov or sequence_alignments and feature_selection most tools focus on a particular class of bioactive peptide prediction for example antimicrobial_peptides however peptideranker which has been developed recently is a general bioactive peptide predictor these tools predict the bioactivity of stand alone peptide_sequences but they are not optimized for the discovery of bioactive_peptides within larger parent protein_sequences ignoring the protein context of the bioactive peptide which may provide_additional here we have combined many classes of bioactive_peptides that are functionally_distinct but nevertheless have shared properties using the precursor protein_sequences of these peptides retrieved from peptidedb we have trained bidirectional recursive neural_networks brnn which take as input the protein_sequence and a number of predicted structural_features of the protein and predict bioactive_peptides within the protein_sequence as far as we are aware only one other method exists for the identification of potential bioactive peptide regions within a protein_sequence and this method is specialized for the prediction of antimicrobial_peptides we have tested the performance of peptideranker on an independent test_set of antimicrobial_peptides from apd and followed up with an analysis of food proteins from the biopep database peptidelocator can accurately identify peptide regions in protein_sequences according to the likelihood that they are bioactive we have demonstrated the use of peptidelocator as part of a targeted identification pipeline for food peptides with beneficial_properties for example antimicrobial_peptides it can be used in conjunction with other tools and data for example food hydrolysates that provide information on the proteolyic cleavage of proteins by combining cleavage patterns with the bioactivity prediction from peptidelocator it is possible to identify bioavailable peptides from common food or other proteins similarly peptides predicted by peptidelocator for a given precursor protein can act as a guide for the selection of specific enzymes that will result in their release the utility of such an approach is demonstrated in our initial analysis of the biopep dataset showing the ability of peptidelocator to identify peptides from a set of food proteins there is a growing need for the identification of novel bioactive_peptides in proteins and this web_server is a useful addition to the repertoire of tools for investigating bioactivity peptidelocator is available as part of our web_server for bioactive peptide discovery and annotation the web_server implementation of the algorithm requires as input a uniprot accession_number which the server uses to retrieve the sequence from uniprot a graphical_representation of the score per residue at a given sequence position is included in the results page along with iupred disorder prediction scores the server builds an alignment of the orthologues of the protein_sequence to provide the relative local conservation rlc score as an additional plot in the output for metazoan sequences the peptidelocator score is unaffected by the presence of the rlc score for the protein however this is instructive in the interpretation of results similarly interpretation of the likely biological_context of the peptide is aided by the inclusion of disorder predictions from iupred peptidelocator is designed to allow fast and reliable annotation of protein_sequences and is freely_available for academic users at http bioware ucd ie a packaged version of the peptidelocator code is available by contacting the authors directly or through the bioware users group details on the peptidelocator web_page a web_service version of the software has been registered on biocatalogue org together with examples of how to run peptidelocator programmatically by submitting jobs in an automated fashion
