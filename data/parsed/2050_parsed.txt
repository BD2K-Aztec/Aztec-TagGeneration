gerv a statistical_method for generative evaluation of regulatory variants for transcription_factor binding motivation the majority of disease associated variants identified in genome_wide reside in noncoding_regions of the genome with regulatory_roles thus being able to interpret the functional_consequence of a variant is essential for identifying causal_variants in the analysis of genome_wide results we present gerv generative evaluation of regulatory variants a novel computational_method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription_factor binding gerv learns a k_mer based generative_model of transcription_factor binding from chip_seq data and scores variants by computing the change of predicted chip_seq reads between the reference and alternate allele the k_mers learned by gerv capture more sequence determinants of transcription_factor binding than a motif based_approach alone including both a transcription_factors canonical motif and associated co factor motifs we show that gerv outperforms_existing in predicting single_nucleotide associated with allele specific binding gerv correctly_predicts a validated causal_variant among linked single_nucleotide and prioritizes the variants previously_reported to modulate the binding of foxa in breast_cancer thus gerv provides a powerful approach for functionally annotating and prioritizing causal_variants for experimental follow_up analysis availability_and the implementation of gerv and related data are available atgenome wide association studies gwas have revealed genetic_polymorphisms that are strongly associated with complex_traits and diseases missense and nonsense variants that occur in protein_coding are simple to characterize however many gwas detected variants reside in non coding_regions with regulatory_function the influence of non coding variation on gene_expression and other cellular_functions is not well understood previous work has observed that non coding_dna changes in the recognition_sequences of transcription_factors can affect_gene and cellular_phenotypes thus predicting the effect of genomic_variants on transcription_factor tf_binding is an essential part of interpreting the role of non coding variants in pathogenesis most of existing computational_approaches to predict the effect of single_nucleotide snps on tf_binding such as strap and haplogreg are based on quantifying the difference between the presented reference and alternate alleles in the context of canonical tf_binding recent work uses k_mer weights learned from a gapped kmer svm to score the effect of variants taking_into the frequency of k_mer occurrences but not the spatial effect of k_mers here we present gerv generative evaluation of regulatory variants a novel computational_model that learns the spatial effect of k_mers on tf_binding de_novo from whole_genome chip_seq data and scores variants by the change in predicted chip_seq read_counts between the reference and alternate alleles gerv improves on existing_models in three ways first gerv does not assume the existence of a canonical tf binding_motif instead it models transcription_factor binding by learning the effects of specific k_mers on observed binding this allows gerv to capture more subtle sequence_features underlying transcription_factor binding including non canonical motifs second gerv accounts for the spatial effect of k_mers and learns the effect of cis regulatory_regions outside of the canonical tf motif this enables us to model the role of important auxiliary sequences in transcription_factor binding such as cofactors third gerv incorporates chromatin openness information as a covariate in the model which boosts the accuracy of the predicted functional_consequence of a variant we first demonstrate the power of gerv on the chip_seq for transcription_factor nf jb we show that gerv learns a vocabulary of k_mers that accurately_predicts held out nf jb chipseq data and captures the canonical nf jb motifs and associated sequences such as known co factors applying gerv to six transcription_factors on which allele specific binding asb analysis is available we show gerv outperforms existing_approaches in prioritizing snps associated with asb we demonstrate the application of gerv in post gwas analysis by scoring risk associated snps and their linked snps for breast_cancer and show that gerv trained on foxa chip_seq achieves_superior in prioritizing snps previously_reported to modulate foxa binding in breast_cancer despite the recent substantial advances in characterizing the genome_wide transcription_factor with chip_seq it remains a challenge to interpret variation in the noncoding region of the genome and to determine variants that cause transcription_factor binding changes in post gwas analysis our work improves the prediction of causal non coding variants when compared with other contemporary methods roc_curve first row and prc
