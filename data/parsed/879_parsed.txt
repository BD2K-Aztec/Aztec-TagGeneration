causal_relationship inference for a large_scale cellular network motivation cellular_networks usually consist of numerous chemical_species such as dna rna proteins and small_molecules etc different biological tasks are generally performed by complex interactions of these species as these interactions can rarely be directly measured it is widely_recognized that causal_relationship identification is essential in understanding biological_behaviors of a cellular network challenging issues here include not only the large number of interactions to be estimated but also many restrictions on probing signals the purposes of this study are to incorporate power_law in cellular network identification in order to increase accuracy of causal regulation estimations especially to reduce false_positive errors results two identification algorithms are developed that can be efficiently applied to causal regulation identification of a large_scale network from noisy steady_state experiment data a distinguished feature of these algorithms is that power_law has been explicitly incorporated into estimations which is one important structural property that most large_scale cellular_networks approximately have under the condition that parameters of the power_law are known and measurement errors are gaussian a likelihood_maximization approach is adopted the developed estimation algorithms consist of three major_steps at first angle minimization between subspaces is utilized to identify chemical_elements that have direct influences on a prescribed chemical element under the condition that the number of direct regulations is known second interference coefficients from prescribed chemical_elements are estimated through likelihood_maximization with respect to measurement errors finally direct regulation numbers are identified through maximizing a lower_bound of an overall likelihood_function these methods have been applied to an artificially constructed linear system with elements a mitogen_activated model with chemical_elements some dream initiative in silico data and some in vivo data compared with the widely_adopted total least_squares tls method computation results show that parametric estimation accuracy can be significantly_increased and false_positive errors can be greatly_reduced availability the matlab files for the methods are available atinferring causal_relationships of a cellular network is one of the fundamental problems in understanding cell behaviors major reasons behind extensive attentions to this problem appear to lie upon two facts one is that cellular_networks are generally of a large_scale and there are a huge number of causal interactions to be estimated the other is that there are many restrictions on probing signals in biochemical_experiments for example the perturbations must be non negative and some chemical_elements may not be directly_affected and so on these make the problem of estimating a cellular network much more difficult than identifying an industrial process with significant development of high throughout technologies and proteomics_analysis methods several approaches have now been proposed for unraveling the interactions of a cellular network such as boolean_network methods bayesian_network methods partial correlation_analysis differential_equation based time series analysis and so on however when applying these methods to large_scale cellular_networks several difficulties may arise for example with the number increment of chemical_elements in a network computational_burden of most of the methods increases exponentially to overcome this difficulty some methods limit the maximum direct regulation number but this may restrict application ranges of the method itself and give rise to a problem of selecting principal chemical_elements on the other hand statistical_methods such as partial correlation_analysis rely on a variety of pairwise correlation measures this means that an indirect effect may be wrongly recognized as a direct one and therefore leads to a high false_positive in addition a top_down approach is proposed infor causal regulation inference from steady_state concentration changes of chemical_species this strategy is based on the total differential formula and total least square tls estimations afterwards the results have been extended to time series data quasi_steady data etc and the non direct effect condition on experiment designs has been significantly weakened our computation experiences however show that when data length is of a moderate_size it is very rare that an identified regulationto illustrate the effectiveness of the developed inference algorithms we compare them with the tls method in this section using five examples which include an artificially constructed large_scale linear system a mapk_pathway model of ordinary nonlinear differential_equations some in silico datasets from the dream initiative and some in vivo datasets of note that in predicting the behaviors of a network not only structure of the network but also regulation directions and strengthes among its elements play_important in addition to some widely_adopted specifications in network inferences such as roc receiver_operating pr precision_recall curve auroc area under a roc_curve aupr area under a pr curve ppv positive_predictive se sensitivity fp false_positive etc the following three specifications are also adopted in this article which reflect the rate of false sign errors and parameter_estimation accuracies respectively to be more specific consider a cellular network consisting of n chemical_elements let x ij i j n denote the actual direct effect of the j th chemical element on the i th chemical element andxand andx ij its estimate moreover let n and p represent the total numbers of x ij and x ij respectively furthermore define fp false_positive number fn false_negative number fs false sign number la low accuracy number and aa acceptable accuracy number respectively as follows in this article possibilities have been investigated for incorporating the so_called power_law into identification of direct causal regulations in a large_scale cellular network under the assumption that measurement errors are independently and normally distributed a likelihood_maximization approach is suggested on the basis of relations between subspace angles and matrix singular values two procedures are suggested to estimate these interactions these methods are applied to an artificially constructed linear large_scale network a mapk_pathway model some recently_developed performance assessment networks and the in vivo data_set of a nine gene network and a five gene network comparisons with the widely_adopted tls method show that the suggested methods have distinguished advantages on both reduction of false_positive errors and improvement of parametric estimation accuracy moreover one of the supposed algorithms has a much faster convergence speed when either estimation error or estimation bias is considered while most of the reported results are encouraging the developed estimation procedures are still far from satisfaction of practical_application requirements this has been made very clear by the unsatisfactory performances with the sub challenges of dream as further researches it is interesting to investigate parameter_estimation from experiment data for the power_law simultaneous identification of direct causal regulations for multiple species appropriate statistical descriptions of noise and measurement errors as well as extending the procedures to estimations with other kinds of experiment data such as quasi_steady data time series data with non uniform sampling etc
