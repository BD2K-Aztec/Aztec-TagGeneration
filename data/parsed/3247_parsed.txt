gene_expression new approach for segmentation and quantification of two_dimensional images motivation detection of protein_spots in two_dimensional images de is a very complex task and current approaches addressing this problem still suffer from significant shortcomings when quantifying a spot most of the current software applications include a lot of background due to poor segmentation other software applications use a fixed window for this task resulting in omission of part of the protein spot or including background in the quantification the approach presented here for the segmentation and quantification of de aims to minimize these problems results five sections from different gels are used to test the performance of the presented method concerning the detection of protein_spots and three gel sections are used to test the quantification of sixty protein_spots comparisons with a state of the art commercial software and an academic state of the art approach are presented it is shown that the proposed approach for segmentation and quantification of de images can compete with the available commercial and academic software_packages availability a command_line prototype may be downloaded for non commercial use from http w ualg pt aanjos prototypes html contact developing new bioinformatics_tools both computational and experimental such as those for membrane_protein type prediction protein subcellular_location prediction drugtarget_interaction prediction substrateenzymeproduct triad network prediction and so on can timely provide very useful information and insights for both basic_research and drug_development and hence are widely welcome by the science community using image feature or graphic approaches to study biological_systems is currently a hot_topic in the biological and medical_science because it can provide useful intuitive insights as indicated by to whom correspondence should be addressed many previous_studies on a series of important biological topics such as enzyme_catalyzed protein_folding kinetics and folding_rates inhibition kinetics of processive nucleic_acid polymerases and nucleases and others these kind of approaches are also of great_importance in the field of proteomics the present study is an attempt to propose a new approach for the segmentation and quantification of two_dimensional images de the proteome was originally defined as the protein complement of the genome the proteome is complex and highly_dynamic since the proteins present in a sample will depend on e g the tissue cell organelle and or development stage analyzed analysis of proteomes requires techniques that can simultaneously separate thousands of proteins in complex_mixtures classical proteome_analysis is based on separation of proteins by de a technique originally described decades_ago o which has since been a subject to continuous developments enabling high_resolution and reproducibility in the first dimension of de proteins are separated by isoelectric_focusing during which they migrate along a ph_gradient to their isoelectric_point pi the second dimension separation perpendicular to the first separates proteins by sodium dodecyl sulpfatepolyacrylamide gel_electrophoresis sdspage according to their molecular_size de is unique in its ability both to resolve differently modified forms of the same gene_product in separate spots facilitating analysis of protein posttranslational_modifications and to enable simultaneous analysis of synthesis and amounts of hundreds of proteins in the same gel thus de is a widely used and important tool in proteome_analysis in a typical de based proteomics experiment aimed at detecting changes in the proteome related to a specific treatment several biological_replicates each for treated and control samples are separated on de proteins on the gels may be visualized by one of many staining_techniques e g coomassie blue_dye silver_staining fluorescent_dyes radiolabeling in de image_analysis is required for objective and quantitative_comparison of de spot patterns and several software_packages are commercially_available usually de image pipeline analysis consists of bullet spot detection bullet alignment of multiple de images and bullet quantification of protein_spots tests were performed in order to assess the quality of the proposed approach a state of the art commercial software for de analysis and a recent academic approach were used as base of comparison the chosen commercial software was progenesis samespots a very well known tool in the field of proteomics as for the academic approach we used pinnacle when analyzing images derived from biological_samples it is always necessary to validate detected spots manually to avoid inclusion of the background_noise in this study the spots detected by any software in the whole set of images were manually checked by an experienced proteomics researcher and defined based on experience as protein_spots valid positives or as false_positives resulting from staining artifacts giving rise to background_noise or to erroneous definition of spot boundaries because of the overlapping spots when comparing protein_profiles with progenesis samespot using a reference gel that defines the spot area for all gels the end result willproga and progb are the results from progenesis with different gels chosen as reference n a means that the spot was not detected on any of the gels and mean that the spot was only detected in the first or the second gel respectively depend on which gel is chosen as reference in progenesis it is most likely that the user chooses the gel with most round uniform spots because it will be easier to align this to the others the problem arises when the other gels spots vary in quality with respect to shape and size having defined the spots areas in the best gel and using these definitions in the other gels if the analysis is repeated with a new reference gel different results will be provided to the user as demonstrated by the results presented in since the proposed approach independently defines the spot area in each gel the program is more likely to give less biased end results for being reference gel independent another issue is how the spot area is detected progenesis uses spot and background to define the spot area pinnacle centers a fixed size window on the pinnacle of the spot the proposed approach defines the spot area from near the border of the spots and therefore avoids potential problems with less uniform spots in between gels furthermore by defining the spot area from the border of the spot it is easier to get at a more realistic estimate of spots placed close to each other as well as partially_overlapping non saturated spots which will be present in most experiments in comparison with the other software_packages tested the proposed method is shown to be able to detect the majority of validated protein_spots in a series of gel images while at the same time minimizing the number_of this represents a considerable improvement in terms of the time needed for manual validation and correction of spot boundaries a common bottleneck in proteomics_studies when analyzing samples based on biological_material with unknown absolute quantities of individual protein forms it is not possible to say which is the true answer other software_packages also give slightly different results but again it is not possible to say from this type of analysis which is the correct_answer a complete gel image is included in the support data segmented by progenesis samespot pdquest and proposed method for comparison it is noticeable that pdquest is the result that requires more user intervention and manual editing as also witnessed by other studies in summary this article_presents an efficient way of automatic_detection of quality markers to use in conjunction with the marker controlled watershed transform or even with the image foresting transform for the segmentation of de images and quantification of protein_spots also the presented technique can be used in the segmentation step for approaches that use common spot boundaries such asor even progenesis samespots the results can also be used by gel alignment for gel alignment_methods such as the one presented in post_processing the results produced by the method proposed in this article using the domain expertise will allow the correction of most of the discussed shortcomings but as stated before the topic of postprocessing is not in the scope of this article this article contributes to the field of d gel_based proteomics with an alternative approach that may compete with progenesis samespot and other important academic approaches in the detection of spots and the estimation of the spot volume for gel comparison
