network canvas network_visualization on a canvas with enrichment_analysis motivation networks are vital to computational_systems research but visualizing them is a challenge for networks larger than nodes and links ball and stick diagrams fail to convey much information to address this we developed network canvas n c a web_application that provides an alternative way to view networks n c visualizes networks by placing nodes on a square toroidal canvas the network nodes are clustered on the canvas using simulated_annealing to maximize local connections where a nodes brightness is made proportional to its local fitness the interactive canvas is implemented in hypertext markup_language html with the javascript_library data_driven documents d we applied n c to visualize canvases made from human and mouse gene_set libraries and canvases made from the food_and fda_approved drug set libraries given lists of genes or drugs enriched terms are highlighted on the canvases and their degree of clustering is computed because n c produces visual patterns of enriched terms on canvases a trained eye can detect signatures instantly in summary n c provides a new flexible method to visualize large_networks and can be used to perform and visualize gene_set and drug set enrichment_analyses availability n c is freely_available www maayanlab net n c and is open_source since the late s networks have been popularized for helping to increase our understanding of complex systems across various scientific_disciplines including systems_biology and systems pharmacology commonly networks are used to model complex systems by representing the various types of entities as nodes and their relationships as links network representation is useful for organizing the accumulating_data about the system which allows identifying novel non trivial relationships for example network representation is useful for finding clusters in proteinprotein_interaction or for detecting network_motifs such as feedforward and feedback_loops in addition selected nodes with common properties such as disease genes or differentially_expressed can be projected onto networks to highlight specific regions in the system whereas forming a network can be a first step toward modeling the systems dynamics in the fields of systems_biology and systems pharmacology networks are used to represent proteinprotein_interactions cell signaling_pathways gene_regulatory metabolic_networks drug_target networks and other types of networks where nodes and links may represent different types of relationships although network representation has been proven to be useful large_networks are difficult to visualize the most popular_approach to visualize networks is ball andstick diagrams many software_tools are available to convert networks saved in a tabular format into a graphic ball andstick representation however when there are more than nodes and links a situation that is common in systems_biology and systems pharmacology ball and stick diagrams fail to convey much useful information alternative_methods such as treemaps chord diagrams or clustered adjacency_matrix heatmaps can also visualize networks these approaches have their own advantages_and but most of these alternative_methods have not been widely_adopted in the past we have developed the software_tool grid analysis of time series expression gate which is a tool to visualize time_series on a hexagonal grid movie neighboring genes on the gate hexagonal grid can be considered connected in a network where links between genes are established based on a genegene time series correlation this gave us the idea that any network can be visualized on a hexagonal grid more recently we developed an algorithm called sets networks to construct functional association genegene and drugdrug networks based on their shared properties given gene or drug set libraries typically used for gene_set enrichment_analyses the algorithm converts these gene or drug set libraries to functional association networks fans based on various measures of gene or drug co occurrence in the fans genes are connected if they share many functional terms such as belonging to the same pathway or regulated by the same transcription_factor using the same approach gene_set libraries can be transposedmaking the genes the terms and the terms the set members associated with each gene for example a transposed gene_set library created from the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg signaling_pathways database can be created where a gene protein is the term and members of each set are pathways that contain the gene protein applying the sets networks algorithm on transposed gene_set libraries results in termterm fans similar networks have been developed for the cytoscape plug_ins bingo or enrichmentmap which display ball and stick diagrams of related gene_ontology go terms with the popular tools bingo and enrichmentmap enriched terms are visualized on the network by highlighting the enriched nodes go terms in different colors and size given input gene_lists entered by users here we implemented a new approach to visualize large_networks we project the network nodes onto a square grid canvas the method and tool are called network canvas n c n c arranges nodes on the canvas to maximize local connections where a nodes brightness is made proportional to its local fitness in addition we use this network visualizing approach to perform gene_set enrichment_analyses conceptually this approach provides similar functionality as bingo and enrichmentmap highlighting enriched terms on fans however instead of visualizing termterm networks using balls and sticks we visualize the networks of terms on a canvas where each square on the canvas represents a functional term and terms are organized on the canvas based on their gene_set content similarity this provides a condensed and appealing view of the results besides creating canvases for the three go ontologiesbiological process cellular_component and molecular functionas implemented for bingo and enrichmentmap we created canvases for additional gene_set libraries to make the plots interactive webbased lightweight and publication ready we implemented the application using the javascript_library data_driven documents d
