a framework for scalable parameter_estimation of gene_circuit using structural_information motivation systematic and scalable parameter_estimation is a key to construct complex gene regulatory models and to ultimately facilitate an integrative systems_biology approach to quantitatively understand_the underpinning gene_regulation results here we report a novel framework for efficient and scalable parameter_estimation that focuses specifically on modeling of gene_circuits exploiting the structure commonly found in gene_circuit this framework decomposes a system of coupled rate_equations into individual ones and efficiently integrates them separately to reconstruct the mean time evolution of the gene_products the accuracy of the parameter_estimates is refined by iteratively increasing the accuracy of numerical integration using the model structure as a case study we applied our framework to four gene_circuit with complex dynamics based on three synthetic datasets and one time series microarray data_set we compared our framework to three state of the art parameter_estimation methods and found that our approach consistently generated higher quality parameter solutions efficiently although many general_purpose parameter_estimation methods have been applied for modeling of gene_circuits our results suggest that the use of more tailored approaches to use domain specific information may be a key to reverse_engineering of complex_biological a quantitative_understanding of how expression of genes is controlled in time and space through the integration of computational and experimental methods is a main goal of molecular systems_biology among the major_obstacles in such an integrative systems_biology approach is the construction of kinetic_models that quantitatively support the current knowledge of a given gene circuit what makes the construction of gene_circuit especially difficult is the quantification of all reaction parameters as direct measurements of gene_regulation kinetics are seldom available thus model_parameters are often estimated indirectly using more readily available experimental_data e g even in modeling of relatively well known gene_circuits such as the phage l lysislysogeny developmental_pathway there are a number of unknown_parameters which are phenomenologically determined by fitting the models outputs to some experimental_observations the quality of time_series is crucial to the construction of phenomenological models that accurately capture the observed dynamical characteristics of a given gene circuit with advances in the gene_expression detection technologies single_molecule level measurements of gene_expression can now be obtained in a wide_range of organisms in particular recent_advances in fluorescence imaging_techniques facilitate real_time measurements of gene_expression at the single_molecule level making more accurate parameter_estimation for quantitative modeling of gene_circuits possible such single_cell are however noisy because of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations and often limited to lower concentration molecular_species such as mrnas because of such noisy gene_expression and highly nonlinear_dynamics involved in transcriptional regulations manual parameter_estimation in nontrivial gene_circuit is generally infeasible to systematically estimate the parameters of a biochemical kinetic_model the parameter_estimation problem is often treated as an optimization_problem in which parameter_values are selected to minimize a certain objective_function although several stochastic optimization and bayesian based_methods were successfully_applied to estimate_parameters of biochemical_models they often suffer from scalability problems when there are a large number of unknown_parameters to make the estimation of parameters more efficient several methods have been proposed to reduce the parameter search_space by decomposing rate_equations however the quality of these methods strongly depends on interpolation and smoothing functions which are often independent of the underlying model structure and can add strong artifacts recently kalman_filter based_approaches which can alleviate the scalability problem were applied to efficiently estimate kinetic_parameters although these approaches support parameter_estimation of models with unobserved variables a to whom all correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the author published_by this is an

commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com recent comparative_study showed that their performance could be sensitive to the initial condition and estimated parameters might be far from the true ones if the initial guess was not close to the solution most of these existing_methods are applicable to parameter_estimation problems of generic dynamical_models as they do not demand any domain specific knowledge although these general_purpose methods can easily be applied to modeling of any biological_systems it is clear that each of these methods has its advantages_and and that no single method is versatile enough to efficiently give optimal parameter_sets for all biological_models this observation has led us to develop a more tailored parameter_estimation method that focuses on a specific yet important subclass of biological_models namely gene_circuit to facilitate the mechanistic construction of thermodynamicsbased models that describe the quantitative behavior of gene_regulation from time series mrna data we developed a novel parameter_estimation framework called parameter_estimation by decomposition and integration pedi that specifically focuses on modeling of gene_circuits the main paradigm of pedi is divide_and by using the given mrna data and exploiting the structure of gene_circuit our framework divides a high_dimensional parameter_estimation problem into subproblems with a much smaller parameter_space each of which is in turn conquered i e solved by using any constrained optimization method at the initial step this problem reduction process leads to a crude linearization for numerical integrations which often results in poor estimates especially for highly nonlinear systems to improve the quality of the estimate with a basically negligible increase in computing time pedi places intermediate integration points using the underlying structural_information of a given gene circuit model and iteratively increases the accuracy of these intermediate points to increase the accuracy of the numerical integration which in turn improves the reconstructed dynamics this article introduces pedi and through the use of simulated_annealing sa as the optimization method applies the framework to three gene_circuit with complex dynamics based on synthetic time series mrna datasets and one yeast gene circuit model based on time series microarray_data we compared pedi with three state of the art parameter_estimation methods namely the evolutionary strategy with stochastic ranking sres the moment matching method coupled with hybrid extended_kalman hekf mm and the two phase dynamic decoupling method tddm our results show that pedi consistently produced the most accurate estimates efficiently in all the four parameter_estimation experiments this study thus demonstrated that pedi could provide an effective approach to efficiently estimating kinetic_parameters of gene_circuit the parameter_estimation problem in modeling of biological_systems is challenging as it usually involves many often infinite suboptimal solutions efficient and scalable parameter_estimation is crucial to the systematic construction of quantitative_models that support existing knowledge of complex_biological and more broadly to the success of integrative systems_biology going forward here we have introduced a novel computational framework which instead of considering general applicability is customized especially for parameter_estimation of gene_circuit to see how pedi performs in comparison with state of the art parameter_estimation methods we applied sres hekf mm and tddm to the parameter_estimation of the same gene_circuit with the same datasets we found that pedi consistently gave the most accurate estimates in a the reconstructed dynamics from the best parameter solution of pedi for the yeast feed_forward loop model the dynamics of mrna gcn was estimated by a smooth piecewise polynomial function pedi predicted the dynamics of mrnas leu and ilv i a framework for scalable parameter_estimation computationally_efficient matter to test how pedi performs given experimental gene_expression data we applied it to modeling of a yeast gene circuit from time series microarray_data we found that the reconstructed dynamics from pedi closely agreed with the experimental_data and by analyzing the estimated parameter set we were also able to make a testable hypothesis for an underlying regulatory_mechanism of this gene circuit although pedi can be applied to gene_circuits with an arbitrary size and degree of transcriptional interaction connectivity there are some limitations for example pedi cannot directly support gene regulatory models including transcriptional elongation and posttranscriptional modifications although we can relax the conditions of pedi so as to support more generic biological_models by not requiring a model to have the form described by equation the efficiency and the accuracy of the model decomposition might decrease while acknowledging the limited scope of the applicability we believe that the value of a more tailored_approach to the gene circuit domain far exceeds such potential drawbacks because of the importance of transcriptional_regulation in quantitative understandings of cellular_systems by narrowing down our focus to gene_circuit our customized approach was able to display two main advantages over the general parameter_estimation methods i it can make more appropriate assumptions about the kinds of gene_expression data available for parameter_estimation and ii it can exploit the structural_information on gene circuit modelsin particular statistical thermodynamic based gene_circuit an additional practical benefit of pedi is that it is relatively easy to implement in a lower level language such as c
