genetics_and an efficient gene_gene test for genome_wide in trio families motivation several efficient genegene_interaction tests have been developed for unrelated case control samples in genome_wide gwas making it possible to test tens of billions of interaction pairs of single_nucleotide snps in a reasonable timeframe however current family based genegene_interaction tests are computationally_expensive and are not applicable to genome_wide interaction analysis results we developed an efficient family based genegene_interaction test gcore for trios i e two parents and one affected sib the gcore compares interlocus correlations at two snps between the transmitted and non transmitted alleles we used simulation_studies to compare the statistical_properties such as type_i and power for the gcore with several other family based interaction tests under various scenarios we applied the gcore to a family based gwas for autism consisting of approximately trios testing a total of interaction pairs in the gwas can be finished in h by the gcore without large_scale computing_resources demonstrating that the test is practical for genome_wide genegene_interaction analysis in trios availability_and gcore is implemented with c and is available at http genome_wide gwas have been widely used in complex disease studies to identify the association of single_nucleotide snps with the disease although gwas have successfully identified many significant snps most snps exhibit modest_effects on the disease and can only explain a small proportion of the heritability of the disease as complex_diseases are caused by the joint effects of multiple genes genegene_interactions may also play_an in disease_etiology significant genegene_interactions have been identified for several diseases such as alzheimers_disease autism and schizophrenia therefore it is important to develop powerful and efficient genegene_interaction methods for gwas two major challenges are faced when performing interaction analysis in gwas the first is the computational_burden resulting from tens of billions of tests when considering all possible pairwise interactions between snps several computationally_efficient algorithms have been developed for pairwise interaction analysis for casecontrol gwas such as the fast epistasis test implemented in plink snpharvester snpruler boost and team the second challenge is the multipletesting correction burden resulting from the extremely_large number of tests to achieve genome_wide significance for these interaction tests a large_sample or strong interaction effects between snps are required several genegene_interaction methods have also been developed for family_based studies for families with at least one v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com affected and unaffected child conditional_logistic clr and logistic regression_based on generalized_estimating gee can be used for testing interactions clr has further been extended to accommodate families with one affected_child and two parents i e trios using the affected offspring as a case and pseudocontrols created based on the parental genotypes unphased is a likelihood_ratio that can be used for testing interactions by comparing the likelihoods of genotypes given the disease status with and without modeling the interaction multifactor_dimensionality mdr a machine_learning developed for casecontrol_studies has been extended to several family based interaction tests such as mdr pdt pgmdr and fam mdr a summary of tools available for genegene_interaction analysis is shown_inand a more detailed overview of these tools can be found in the supplementary_materials also more comprehensive reviews of genegene_interaction methods can be found in some review_papers as shown in current family based interaction methods are applicable to only candidate_gene regions iterative algorithms such as the newtonraphson method are used in parameter estimations in clr or gee as well as in the likelihood_ratio mdr based_approaches use cross_validation for model evaluation and permutations to approximate the distributions of the test_statistics these algorithms require intensive calculations hence these tests would not be applicable for analyzing genomewide interactions with tens of billions of tests we developed an efficient genegene_interaction test which considers correlations in trios gcore the gcore is extended from the fast epistasis test in plink the gcore statistic compares interlocus correlations at two snps between the transmitted and nontransmitted alleles we used theoretical distributions to model the statistic and calculate the variance and covariance thus the test does not use any iterative algorithms ensuring that the test is fast and applicable to genome_wide interaction studies we performed a comprehensive simulation_study to evaluate the type_i for the gcore and other genegene_interaction tests capable of analyzing family data with available software including gee unphased and mdr pdt simulations were also used to compare the power of the gcore with the three tests under various scenarios our simulation_results suggest that the gcore can be used as a screening_tool to efficiently identify the potential pairs of snps with interaction effects and other tests with higher power such as the likelihood_ratio implemented in unphased can be further used to evaluate the significance of the snp_pairs finally we applied the gcore to a familybased gwas for autism to screen all possible pairs of snps within genes and unphased was used to further test the pairs of snps identified by the gcore
