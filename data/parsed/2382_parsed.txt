systems_biology improvements in the reconstruction of time varying gene_regulatory dynamic_programming and regularization by information_sharing among genes method dynamic_bayesian dbns have been applied widely to reconstruct the structure of regulatory_processes from time series data and they have established themselves as a standard modelling tool in computational_systems the conventional approach is based on the assumption of a homogeneous markov_chain and many recent research_efforts have focused on relaxing this restriction an approach that enjoys particular popularity is based on a combination of a dbn with a multiple changepoint process and the application of a bayesian_inference scheme via reversible_jump rjmcmc in the present article we expand this approach in two ways first we show that a dynamic_programming scheme allows the changepoints to be sampled from the correct conditional distribution which results in improved convergence over rjmcmc second we introduce a novel bayesian clustering and information_sharing scheme among nodes which provides a mechanism for automatic model_complexity tuning results we evaluate the dynamic_programming scheme on expression time series for arabidopsis_thaliana genes involved in circadian regulation in a simulation_study we demonstrate that the regularization scheme improves the network reconstruction_accuracy over that obtained with recently_proposed inhomogeneous dbns for gene_expression from a synthetically designed saccharomyces_cerevisiae strain under switching carbon metabolism we show that the combination of both dynamic_programming and regularization yields an inference procedure that outperforms two alternative established network_reconstruction methods from the biology literature availability_and a

paradigm shifts have revolutionized molecular_biology in the second half of this decade systems_biology where the objective is to model the whole complexity of cellular_processes in a holistic sense and synthetic_biology which enables biologists to build new molecular_pathways in vivo i e in living_cells the combination of both concepts allows the viability of machine_learning for network_reconstruction to be tested in a rigorous way as an alternative to mechanistic_models which provide a powerful approach to the modelling of small systems composed of a few components and correlation mutual_information based_approaches which do not distinguish between direct and indirect interactions dynamic_bayesian dbns have emerged as a promising tradeoff between over simplicity and loss of computational tractability the standard assumption underlying dbns is that of homogeneity temporal processes and the time series they generate are assumed to be governed by a homogeneous markov relation however regulatory_interactions and signal_transduction in the cell are usually adaptive and change in response to external_stimuli following earlier approaches aiming to relax the homogeneity assumption for undirected graphical_models various recent research_efforts have therefore addressed the homogeneity assumption for dbns an approach that has become popular recently is based on a combination of a dbn with a multiple changepoint process and the application of a bayesian_inference scheme via reversible_jump rjmcmc robinson andproposed a discrete inhomogeneous dbn which allows for different structures in different segments of the time series with a regularization term penalizing differences among the structures proposed a continuous inhomogeneous dbn in which the parameters are allowed to vary while a common network_structure provides information_sharing among the time series segments lbre andproposed an alternative continuous inhomogeneous dbn which is more flexible in that it allows the network_structure to vary among the segments the model proposed inis a close cousin of an inhomogeneous dbn as opposed to the first three approaches hyper parameters are not consistently inferred withinwe have proposed two improvements for time varying dbns a gibbs_sampling gs scheme based on dynamic_programming dp as an alternative to rjmcmc and information coupling between nodes based on bayesian clustering the evaluation on a real gene_expression dataset from a thaliana suggests that gs dp shows faster mixing and convergence than mh rjmcmc a comparative_evaluation on synthetic data demonstrates that the new model based on information coupling between nodes compares favourably with earlier models that either employ network wide class or nodespecific class changepoints on gene_expression time series from a recent study of synthetic_biology in s cerevisiae the proposed model has outperformed two state of the art network_reconstruction methods these findings_suggest that the proposed method makes important_contributions both to inference and performance of network_reconstruction methods and hence adds a valuable new tool to the kit of computational_systems in our future work we will investigate different choices for the prior on node cluster formations introduced in section exploring methods from bayesian non parametrics based on dirichlet_process priors
