genome_analysis biased hosting of intronic microrna genes motivation micrornas mirnas are involved in an abundant class of post_transcriptional activated through binding to the untranslated_region utr of mrnas the current wealth of mammalian mirna_genes results mostly from genomic duplication_events many of these events are located within introns of transcriptional units in order to better understand the genomic expansion of mirna_genes we investigated the distribution of intronic mirnas results we observe that mirna_genes are hosted within introns of short genes much larger than expected by chance implementation we explore several explanations for this phenomenon and conclude that mirna integration into short genes might be evolutionary favorable due to interaction with the pre_mrna mechanism micrornas mirnas are short nt rnas that bind to complementary_sequences in the mrnas untranslated_region utr in order to regulate_gene through translational silencing mrna_degradation or cleavage mirna regulation is an abundant mode of post_transcriptional as each mirna_targets a multitude of mrnas mirnas were found to be involved in many cellular_processes such as growth differentiation and cell_death the current wealth of mirna_genes results mostly from genomic episodes dominated by large duplication_events in addition to local expansions e g see these events can be located in either intergenic or intronic_regions namely within introns of transcriptional units in order to better understand the genomic expansion of mirna_genes we investigated the genome wide_distribution of intronic mirnas we observe like others that mirna_genes are on average more frequently hosted in introns of long genes though we also notice that their presence within introns of short genes is much larger than expected by chance we discuss several explanations for this phenomenon and link this observation to differential pre_mrna of short versus long introns
