hhfrag hmm_based fragment detection using hhpred motivation over the last decade both static and dynamic fragment_libraries for protein_structure have been introduced the former are built from clusters in either sequence or structure space and aim to extract a universal structural alphabet the latter are tailored for a particular query protein_sequence and aim to provide local structural templates that need to be assembled in order to build the full_length structure results here we introduce hhfrag a dynamic hmm_based fragment search method built on the profileprofile comparison tool hhpred we show that hhfrag provides advantages over existing fragment assignment methods in that it i improves the precision of the fragments at the expense of a minor loss in sequence_coverage ii detects fragments of variable_length amino_acid iii allows for gapped fragments and iv does not assign fragments to regions where there is no clear sequence_conservation we illustrate the usefulness of fragments detected by hhfrag on targets from most recent casp availability a web_server for running hhfrag is available at http toolkit tuebingen mpg de hhfrag the source_code is available atthe success of many protein_structure prediction_methods critically depends on the existence of structural templates and our ability to detect them it seems that known protein_structures have reached a sufficient level of diversity for template based structure_prediction the percentage of new folds in the protein_data pdb dwindles and even the new folds tend to reuse building_blocks such as super secondary_structure motifs shared with non homologous_proteins the new folds add to pdbs diversity by providing new arrangements of known motifs rather than by introducing completely novel building_blocks also our ability to identify structural templates has reached a level of sensitivity such that the boundaries between homology_modeling and threading methods blur structures evolve more to whom correspondence should be addressed slowly than sequences and therefore highly_divergent sequences may still share a common structure the critical threshold of sequence_identity has been pushed to ever smaller values by profile profile methods superseding conventional sequence comparison algorithms even if no full_length template exists or if we fail to detect it there is still hope for structure_prediction segments of the query profile may show significant similarity to short conserved_regions in proteins from different folds such recurring sequence_patterns often correlate with persistent local structure examples of recurring motifs have been compiled into the i sites fragment library and proved useful in protein_structure i sites aims to build a concise static dictionary of reusable fragments and is an early attempt to discover a universal structural alphabet in contrast dynamic methods such as rosettas fragment extraction module nnmake aim to create a fragment library that is customized to the query_sequence although dynamically extracted fragments often correspond to the recurring motifs of static approaches no attempt is made to compile them into a non redundant universal dictionary static fragment_libraries trade low sequence_coverage for high_precision therefore dynamic fragment search seems more suitable for structure_prediction in conserved_regions also a dynamic approach should be as accurate as static libraries but in nonconserved regions the better coverage of dynamic fragment search comes at the price of reduced precision another limitation is that fragments typically come in fixed size with mer fragments being a popular choice this is more for technical convenience rather than having a specific biological meaning the actual instances of a structural_motif often show variable lengths with extensions or deletions at the termini i sites tries to address this problem by defining a set of overlapping partially redundant motifs the rosetta fragment selection tool nnmake searches a database of crystal_structures with better than resolution and pairwise sequence_identity all nine residue windows from the query_sequence are compared to the database entries using a score that is based on sequence_profile comparison and secondary_structure match the psi_blast profiles of the query and the candidate fragments are compared using the cityblock distance_metric this method has been extended by the frazor dynamic fragment selection tool using integer_linear frazor combines the sequence_profile similarity_score with additional structural_features secondary_structure solvent_accessibility and contact capacity in order to improve the fragment selection an alternative to fragment selection is the recent development of fragment sampling from probabilisticwe have introduced hhfrag a new hmm_based fragment detection method that uses the profile comparison tool hhpred to build a customized fragment library for a query protein_sequence our results show that a dynamic fragment library has advantages over a static library in that it improves the sequence_coverage dramatically compared to other dynamic approaches such as rosetta nnmake hhfrag improves the precision of the fragments significantly at the expense of a loss in sequence_coverage a distinctive advantage is that hhfrag extracts fragments with variable_length that may also contain gaps often fragments identified by hhfrag seem to point at a common evolutionary origin of the proteins_sharing the same motif consider the example of the gd box the gd box links remotely homologous members of the cradle loop barrel metafold and also otherwise unrelated folds sharing an analogous motif hhfrag detects gd boxes with very high coverage and precision this example shows that fragments found by hhfrag may arise from a common evolutionary origin and can be also the result of convergence our experiences with decoy generation using rosettas abinitiorelax protocol shows that most likely new strategies of
