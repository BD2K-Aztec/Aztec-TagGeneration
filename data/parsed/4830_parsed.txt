genome_analysis ustiloxins fungal cyclic_peptides are ribosomally_synthesized in ustilaginoidea virens motivation ustiloxins a and b are toxic cyclic tetrapeptides tyr val_ala ile gly y v a i g that were originally identified from ustilaginoidea virens a pathogenic_fungus affecting rice_plants contrary to our report that ustiloxin b is ribosomally_synthesized in aspergillus_flavus a recent report suggested that ustiloxins are synthesized by a non_ribosomal in u virens thus we analyzed the u virens genome to identify the responsible gene_cluster results the biosynthetic_gene was identified from the genome of u virens based on homologies to the ribosomal peptide biosynthetic_gene for ustiloxin b identified from a flavus it contains a gene_encoding precursor protein having five tyr val ile gly and three tyr ala ile gly motifs for ustiloxins a and b respectively strongly indicating that ustiloxins a and b from u virens are ribosomally_synthesized availability_and accession codes of the u virens and a flavus gene_clusters in ncbi are br and br respectively ustiloxins are toxic cyclic_peptides that were originally identified from ustilaginoidea virens a pathogenic_fungus affecting rice plant the circular moieties of these peptides are composed of tyr val_ala ile gly tetrapeptides that are circularized at the side_chains of tyr and ile ustiloxin a a derivative of ustiloxin peptides contains a circularized tetrapeptide with the composition of tyr val ile gly yvig whereas ustiloxin b another derivative of ustiloxin peptides contains the circularized peptide of tyr ala ile gly yaig the aromatic_rings of the tyr_residues in both ustiloxins a and b are modified by norvaline a non protein_coding amino_acid through a sulfoxide bond recently the ustiloxin b biosynthetic_gene was experimentally_identified from aspergillus_flavus using a novel method to predict gene_clusters from transcriptome_data middas m and the subsequent validation by liquid_chromatography analysis of the gene deletion_mutants the ustiloxin b gene_cluster contains genes including those encoding a fungal type c transcription_factor a major facilitatorsuperfamily transporter and cytochrome_p until recently this cyclic peptide was believed to be biosynthesized by the so_called non_ribosomal nrps because it contains a nonproteinogenic amino_acid norvaline in its chemical_structure however bioinformatic_analyses of amino_acid indicated that no nrps domains were observed in the gene_cluster instead a function unknown gene usta with a translated product containing repeats of the tetrapeptide yaig which is the exact amino_acid of the cyclic moiety of ustiloxin b was identified in the gene_cluster consequently ustiloxin b was shown to be the first case of a ribosomally_synthesized peptide reported from filamentous_fungi very recently reported the whole genome_sequence of u virens and proposed that an nrps gene_cluster is responsible for biosynthesis of ustiloxins in u virens however our analysis strongly suggests that an entirely different gene_cluster is responsible for the ustiloxin biosynthesis as ribosomal peptides in u virens based on homology to the ustiloxin b biosynthetic_gene from a flavus
