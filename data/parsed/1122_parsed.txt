computational refinement of post_translational predicted from tandem_mass motivation a post_translational ptm is a chemical_modification of a protein that occurs naturally many of these modifications such as phosphorylation are known to play_pivotal the regulation of protein_function henceforth ptm perturbations have been linked to diverse_diseases like parkinsons alzheimers diabetes and cancer to discover ptms on a genome_wide scale there is a recent surge of interest in analyzing tandem_mass data and several unrestrictive so_called blind ptm search_methods have been reported however these approaches are subject to noise in mass measurements and in the predicted modification site amino_acid position within peptides which can result in false ptm assignments results to address_these we devised a machine_learning algorithm ptmclust that can be applied to the output of blind ptm search_methods to improve_prediction quality by suppressing noise in the data and clustering peptides with the same underlying modification to form ptm groups we show that our technique outperforms two standard clustering_algorithms on a simulated dataset additionally we show that our algorithm significantly_improves sensitivity_and when applied to the output of three different blind_ptm sims inspect and modmap additionally ptmclust markedly outperforms another ptm refinement algorithm ptmfinder we demonstrate that our technique is able to reduce false ptm assignments improve overall detection coverage and facilitate novel ptm discovery including terminus modifications we applied our technique to a large_scale yeast ms_ms proteome profiling dataset and found numerous known and novel ptms accurately identifying modifications in protein_sequences is a critical first step for ptm profiling and thus our approach may benefit routine proteomic_analysis availability our algorithm is implemented in matlab and is freely_available for academic use the software is available online fromproteins are created through a biological_process called protein_biosynthesis this process begins with transcription and splicing of genes into messenger_rna mrna_molecules which are later translated into polypeptides at the time of translation a protein can either be active or inactive and its subsequent activity is generally regulated by chemical_modifications referred to as post_translational ptms ptms which may occur during or after translation involve an enzymatic addition of a chemical group e g a phosphate or a larger moiety e g an additional polypeptide such as ubiquitin onto one or more amino_acid many ptms in particular phosphorylation on serine s threonine t or tyrosine y can regulate a proteins function by influencing its folding stability or physical association with other proteins thereby activating or suppressing it since ptms have been shown to dynamically influence a wide_range of important processes e g catalysis of biochemical_reactions intracellular cell_signaling and cell_division mapping of ptms in a comprehensive proteome_wide manner remains a critical outstanding research problem although the biological_importance of certain ptms is well established the diversity and the prevalence of ptms and their targets remain to be fully elucidated one recently_developed approach to discover ptms on a genome_wide scale is to analyze tandem_mass ms_ms data using an unrestricted so_called blind ptm search_engine unlike traditional restricted search_methods blind search_engines require no predetermined list of candidate ptms with pre defined delta masses or preferred target residues this allows blind_ptm to be able to consider a large number of potential ptms at once representing both previously known ptms and new ones a number of blind search_engines have been reported that employ various different optimization techniques and sequence prediction_approaches havilio and wool reviews of protein mass_spectrometry and the detection of ptm by mass_spectrometry can be found in briefly a typical proteomic ms_ms experiment begins with an enzymatic_digestion of proteins into peptides for a complex_mixture it is common to simplify the mixture by separating peptides based on their chemical_properties such as hydrophobicity using liquid_chromatography before they are ionized and injected into a mass_spectrometer once in the spectrometer peptides are grouped and isolated based on their massto charge ratio simply referred to as mass ideally each group will contain one peptide variant for each group the peptides are further broken down by a fragmentation method such as collisioninduced dissociation cid to produce ion fragments the mass_spectrometer captures the ion fragmentation pattern for each group in a mass_spectrum the presence of ptms shifts the mass of the corresponding ions which changes the ion fragmentation pattern significantly specialized ptm search_engines like those discussed above are used to decipher these ion patterns and map each mass_spectrum to a peptide_sequence that best explains it the use of real and decoy proteins is an established practice for estimating false predictions for ms_ms analysis using database_search approaches including blind ptm search_methods decoy proteins are generated by reversing the amino_acid of real proteins this ensures that real and decoy proteins have the same distributions of amino_acids and protein lengths when using a protein reference_database containing an equal number of real and decoy proteins a random false peptide prediction modified or unmodified will have an equal likelihood of choosing a peptide from either a real protein or a decoy protein this allows the number of decoy peptide hits as an estimate for false detection rate in practice blind ptm search_methods suffer from two major sources of error sequence_dependent uncertainty in the modification position residue position along the peptide_sequence where the modification is deemed to occur and mass inaccuracy for the modification mass the fragmentation process is often incomplete and the presence of labile ptms may interfere with this process both issues combined result in ms_ms missing peaks that in turn may lead to ambiguous or erroneous modification predictions the presences of natural stable_isotopes such as carbon in addition to electronic noise are major contributors to inaccurate mass measurements this is more prominent in spectra generated from low mass resolution mass_spectrometers e g ion_trap mass_spectrometers which are still commonly used in todays mass_spectrometry studies shows a diagrammatic representation of the search results obtained from applying the blind ptm search_engine sims to a set of ms_ms previously_mapped to phosphopeptides enriched for phosphopeptides using a strong_cation based method the spectra from the complex peptide mixture in the original study were analyzed by a restricted ptm search method designed to look for phosphorylation and were validated manually the same dataset has been used in benchmark experiments in previous ptm studies phosphorylation is known to occur at da and primarily on the amino_acid serine s and less frequently on threonine t yet the results show even for those observed peptide_sequences that match to the original reference study that many of their modification delta masses and modified amino_acid deviate from this reference a closer look shows that many of the amino_acids misplaced are a few residues away from their corresponding reference modification position in a globalscale ptm survey these issues can make distinguishing true ptmfor spectra previously determined to be mapped to phosphopeptides they show that the statistics for modification mass and modified amino_acid deviate from the reference which determined that the ptm phosphorylation occurs at da and on serine s and threonine t a the distribution of the measured modification mass b identified amino_acids that deviate from s and t c the distribution of the distance in residues from the identified amino_acid to the reference for misplaced modifications this demonstrates that identified modifications are generally only a few residues away from the reference matches from false detections non trivial therefore identifying bona_fide ptms confidently remains difficult while these errors can potentially be reduced by technological improvement in instrumentation e g higher mass accuracy mass_spectrometers or using alternate fragmentation mechanisms we sought to develop an algorithm that can deconvolve errors associated with measuring masses and mapping of modification positions simultaneously to salvage both existing datasets and current experimental platforms these two sources of error were acknowledged by who briefly described a heuristic approach to account for shadows modifications that are misplaced by a ptm search_engine and later by the same group in the ptm refinement algorithm ptmfinder however in the former method their approach favors high_abundance modified peptides since it requires each peptide match to occur multiple times discretizes observed modification masses which introduces additional error with the mass measurements and can handle only one type of error per peptide namely either a modification mass error of exactly da or a modification position misplaced by exactly one page we conducted two proof_of experiments first we compared ptmclust to two standard clustering_algorithms k_means and a mixture of gaussians mog on a synthetically generated ptm dataset second we benchmarked ptmclust against three state of the art blind_ptm and a ptm refinement algorithm on a reference phosphopeptide dataset to show its strengths we applied our algorithm to process a yeast proteome dataset that contains multiple ptms in our experiments we initialized our algorithm with number of clusters k except for the first proof_of experiment the prior probability of each ptm group k k where k k the probability that the ptm occurs on amino_acid i a given that the ptm group is k ki a the modification mass mean for each ptm group k to be uniformly_distributed across the searched modification mass_range except for the first proof_of experiment and the variance of modification mass for each ptm group k and limited during learning to be no greater than the assumption on the maximum value for k corresponds to our knowledge that for a ptm group to be physically relevant it should have a well defined modification mass accurate identification of protein_modifications in protein_sequences is a critical first step in any ptm study and thus it may benefit the utility of proteomic_profiling to address research problems in basic biology as well as biomarker_discovery and drug_development in the clinical domain a recently_developed approach for ptm discovery is to analyze ms_ms data using a blind ptm search method genome_wide studies using sims inspect and other blind_ptm have reported numerous ptm candidates however these search_methods suffer from two problems mass measurement inaccuracy and uncertainty in predicting modification positions which limit their accuracy and precision we developed a novel machine_learning algorithm called ptmclust for post_processing the results of blind_ptm and improving prediction_performance by simultaneously identifying the positions of the most likely modified amino_acids and grouping peptides with similar modification mass and modified amino_acid we demonstrated that ptmclust improved on both true_positives correct modification position predictions and false_positives misplaces modification positions when applied to the outputs of sims inspect modmap and inspect postprocessed with ptmfinder a ptm refinement algorithm the results showed that our algorithm was able to detect a number of previously annotated naturally_occurring and artificially induced ptms most notably phosphorylation but also acetylation lysine oxidization methionine and even the formation of non covalent_adducts e g sodium potassium salts in addition our algorithm facilitates the identification of terminal modifications which is a feature not currently found in common blind_ptm to our knowledge this algorithm is the first technique that systematically and objectively addresses sequence_dependent variation in the ptm dataset at the ptm level which can improve the reliability of individual ptm identification for the task of ptm refinement we have shown that ptmclust outperforms ptmfinder on the dataset of phosphopeptides ptmfinder failed here because only of spectra map to modified peptides already detected in the dataset this is expected since it is known that only a small portion of spectra in an experiment map to modified peptides and current ms experimental_protocols for genome_wide studies are designed to sample as many different peptides as possible through the use of an exclusion list in the mass_spectrometer moreover many instances of the same modified_peptide either share the same modification position for both correct and misplaced cases or have vastly different modification positions that point to different phosphorylation_sites in the peptide the former can be explained page
