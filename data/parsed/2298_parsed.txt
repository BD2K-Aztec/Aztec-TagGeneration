identification of metabolic_network models from incomplete high_throughput datasets motivation high_throughput measurement techniques for metabolism and gene_expression provide a wealth of information for the identification of metabolic_network models yet missing observations scattered over the dataset restrict the number of effectively available datapoints and make classical regression techniques inaccurate or inapplicable thorough exploitation of the data by identification techniques that explicitly cope with missing observations is therefore of major importance results we develop a maximum_likelihood approach for the estimation of unknown_parameters of metabolic_network models that relies on the integration of statistical priors to compensate for the missing_data in the context of the linlog metabolic modeling framework we implement the identification method by an expectation_maximization em_algorithm and by a simpler direct numerical optimization method we evaluate performance of our methods by comparison to existing_approaches and show that our em method provides the best results over a variety of simulated scenarios we then apply the em_algorithm to a real problem the identification of a model for the escherichia_coli central_carbon based on challenging experimental_data from the literature this leads to promising results and allows us to highlight critical identification issues to further our understanding of the cellular_processes shaping the response of microbial cells to changes in their environment requires the study of the interactions between gene_expression and metabolism in recent_years high_throughput datasets comprising simultaneous measurements of metabolism fluxes metabolite_concentrations and gene_expression protein and mrna concentrations have become available these datasets provide a rich store of information for modeling the dynamics of the biochemical_reaction systems underlying cellular_processes in particular they promise to relieve what is currently a bottleneck for modeling in systems_biology obtaining reliable estimates of parameter_values in kinetic_models to whom correspondence should be addressed notwithstanding these experimental advances parameter_estimation remains a particularly challenging_problem among other things due to incomplete knowledge of the molecular_mechanisms noisy and partial observations heterogeneous experimental methods and conditions and the large size of networks as a consequence the models may not be identifiable may not generalize to new situations due to overfitting and nonlinear rate functions may make them cumbersome to analyze this has led to the proposal of simplified kinetic_modeling frameworks including linlog kinetics loglin kinetics power_law kinetics and more recently convenience kinetics linlog models are a particularly interesting choice for modeling metabolism simulation_studies on the level of both individual enzymatic_reactions and metabolic_networks have shown that they provide_reasonable approximations of classical enzymatic rate laws moreover with the help of a recent genome_scale linlog model of yeast metabolism parametrized using previously_published kinetic_models it has been possible to identify key_steps in the network that is reactions exerting most control over glucose_transport and biomass_production a major advantage of linlog models is that when measurements of fluxes enzyme concentrations and metabolite_concentrations are available the parameter_estimation problem reduces to multiple_linear power_law models up to a logarithmic transformation and loglin models also have this convenient property however the performance of regression approaches quickly degrades in the presence of missing_data as is often the case in high_throughput datasets due to experimental limitations or instrument failures in order to deal with this problem we propose in this article a maximum_likelihood method for the identification of linlog models of metabolism from incomplete datasets the specific contributions of the paper are fold on the theoretical side we develop a method for the optimization of the likelihood_based on expectation_maximization em the method is constructed for linlog models but is more generally_applicable to other approximate kinetic_models whose identification can be formulated as a regression_problem in particular we derive analytical expressions for the expectation step that are well suited for numerical maximization this guarantees the applicability of the approach even when modeling large_networks we show by means of simulation_experiments on synthetic data that our approach
