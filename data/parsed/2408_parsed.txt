structural_bioinformatics improving your target template alignment with modalign modalign is an interactive web_based aimed at helping protein_structure modelers to inspect and manually modify the alignment between the sequences of a target protein and of its template s it interactively computes displays and upon modification of the target template alignment updates the multiple_sequence of the two protein_families their conservation score secondary_structure and solvent_accessibility values and local quality_scores of the implied three_dimensional model s although it has been designed to simplify the target template alignment step in modeling it is suitable for all cases where a sequence_alignment needs to be inspected in the context of other biological_information availability_and freely_available on the web atprotein sequence_alignment is a key_step in most if not all applications of protein bioinformatics evolutionary_analysis functional assignment and comparative modeling projects all heavily rely on an accurate sequence_alignment the alignment plays a particularly pivotal_role in comparative modeling if the targettemplate alignment contains errors it is extremely_difficult to correct them in either the model_building or the refinement stage in the case of difficult comparative modeling tasks there can be several regions that have structurally diverged between the target and the template s to optimize the alignment in such regions expert modelers take into account as much information as possible this includes sequence_conservation patterns in multiple_sequence of the target and template evolutionary families secondary_structure states and often their expert biological_knowledge moreover to find potential_errors in the alignment several models based on different alignment versions are usually built and analyzed in terms of parameters such as unfavorable burial of charged_residues combining all this information during alignment optimization is often difficult and time consuming and without thorough inspection of the sequence and structural_parameters can lead to unspotted errors and inaccurate models to whom correspondence should be addressed here we describe an interactive web_based alignment editor that makes alignment optimization simpler it works as a dashboard for computing displaying inspecting and updating alignment related information in real_time the tool also automatically builds models according to the alignment that is being inspected without modeling insertions and allows the quantitative assessment of their global and local quality finally the edited alignment can be directly used for building a full_length three_dimensional model using modeller
