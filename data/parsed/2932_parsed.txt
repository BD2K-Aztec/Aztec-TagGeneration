genome_analysis methyl analyzer whole_genome dna_methylation methyl analyzer is a python_package that analyzes genome_wide data produced by the methyl maps methylation mapping analysis by paired_end method methyl maps is an enzymatic based method that uses both methylation sensitive and dependent_enzymes covering of cpg_dinucleotides within mammalian_genomes it combines enzymatic based_approaches with high_throughput next_generation to provide whole_genome dna_methylation profiles methyl analyzer processes and integrates sequencing_reads from methylated and unmethylated compartments and estimates cpg_methylation probabilities at single_base availability_and methyl analyzer is available atdna methylation plays_a in gene_silencing and chromatin_remodeling dna_methylation is also involved in the transcriptional_repression of retrotransposons genomic_imprinting and x_chromosome in females in mammals methylcytosine occurs predominately in cpg_dinucleotides in recent_years a variety of methods including dna bisulfite_conversion enzymatic_digestion and methylated_dna enrichment have adapted high_throughput second generation sequencing to delineate dna_methylation profiles this presents a bioinformatics challenge in accounting for experimental biases in genome_wide approaches for a comprehensive_review see essentially the concern is the impact of these biases on estimation of cpg_methylation probabilities which is highly dependent on the experimental assay used for dna_methylation noted above methyl analyzer was developed to analyze data from the methyl maps assay methyl maps utilizes both methylation_sensitive enzymes re yes
