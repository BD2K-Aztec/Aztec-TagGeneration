structural_bioinformatics proqm resample improved model_quality for membrane_proteins by limited conformational_sampling model_quality programs mqaps are used to predict the quality of modeled protein_structures these usually use two approaches methods using consensus of many alternative_models and methods requiring only a single model to do its prediction the consensus methods are useful to improve overall accuracy however they frequently fail to pick out the best possible model and cannot be used to generate and score new structures single model methods on the other hand do not have these inherent shortcomings and can be used to both sample new structures and improve existing consensus methods here we present proqm resample a membrane_protein specific single model mqap that couples side chain resam pling with mqap rescoring by proqm to improve model_selection the side chain resampling is able to improve side chain packing for of all models and improve model_selection by as measured by the sum of the z_score for the first ranked model from to even better than the state of the art consensus method pcons the improved model_selection can be attributed to the improved side chain quality which enables the mqap to rescue good backbone models with poor side chain packing availability_and http proqm wallnerlab org down load protein_structure modeling represents a fundamental challenge in structural_bioinformatics and is crucial for a detailed understanding of the structure and biological_function of molecules it can be used to guide and explain experiments as well as for prediction of proteins whose structure in particular for membrane_proteins for the most part is unknown membrane_protein in the protein_data in most genomes a common technique in structure modeling is to generate many alternative_models and use a model_quality program mqap to select the best model alternatively an mqap can also be used to assess the absolute quality of a single model i e a measure that is related to similarity to true native_structure proqm is an mqap that uses a support_vector to predict the quality of a membrane_protein model by combining structural and sequence_based features calculated from the model in its original implementation external programs were used to calculate features e g psi_blast psipred naccess hubbard and stride proqres zpred topcons mprap illergard and svm light these dependencies made it difficult to distribute the program run large batches and use it in conformational_sampling therefore proqm has only been available as a webserver for small_scale use to overcome these issues proqm was incorporated as scoring_function in the rosetta modeling framework this gives in one hand full access to the modeling machinery within rosetta and allows for easy integration with any rosetta protocol in particular proqm resample uses the repack protocol to sample side chain conformations followed by rescoring using proqm to improve model_selection first the proqm implementation in rosetta was compared with the original proqm webserver version they should be similar but because of different implementations of naccess and dssp versus stride and the fixing of some minor bugs the results will not be identical still there is a clear correlation r between proqm rosetta and proqm webserver and the prediction_performance is also maintained r to true answer data not shown the benchmark on the evfold membrane set showed that model_selection is significantly_improved by resampling the side_chains already without any sampling proqm selects slightly better models than evfold mqap z versus side chain sampling increases the performance significantly to z and levels out at around resamples per model surpassing even the state of the art consensus pcons this demonstrates the usefulness of single model mqaps in model_selection it also highlights the need to include sidechain sampling into the mqap procedure to avoid losing good backbone models suffering from poor side chain packing a possible reason for the improved selection is the fact that almost all models improved the side chain packing after resampling supplementary before resampling the sidechain quality is roughly the same for all targets but after resampling the side chain improvement is larger for the set of targets that also show backbone improvement after resampling compared with targets that show no improvement in backbone indicating that improved side_chains help the mqap to select better backbone models overall target_selection for proqm resample measured by the sum of the z_score for first ranked models against the number of generated resampled models pcons proqm and evfold mqap are included as reference error_bars correspond to sd resulting from replicas these were also used to calculate the p values
