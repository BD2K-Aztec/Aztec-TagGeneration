data_and whide a web_tool for visual data_mining colocation patterns in multivariate bioimages motivation bioimaging techniques rapidly develop toward higher_resolution and dimension the increase in dimension is achieved by different techniques such as multitag fluorescence_imaging matrix_assisted maldi imaging or raman imaging which record for each pixel an n dimensional intensity array representing local abundances of molecules residues or interaction_patterns the analysis of such multivariate bioimages mbis calls for new approaches to support users in the analysis of both feature domains space i e sample morphology and molecular colocation or interaction in this article we present our approach whide web_based hyperbolic image data explorer that combines principles from computational learning dimension_reduction and visualization in a free web_application results we applied whide to a set of mbi recorded using the multitag fluorescence_imaging toponome imaging system the mbi show field of view in tissue_sections from a colon_cancer study and we compare tissue from normal healthy colon with tissue classified as tumor our results show that whide efficiently reduces the complexity of the data by mapping each of the pixels to a cluster referred to as molecular co expression phenotypes and provides a structural basis for a sophisticated multimodal visualization which combines topology preserving pseudocoloring with information_visualization the wide_range of whides applicability is demonstrated with examples from toponome imaging high content screens and maldi imaging shown in the supplementary_material availability_and the whide tool can be accessed via the bioimax websitebioimage informatics has been established as a new branch in the tree of bioinformatics fields of research in the last years the term bioimage comprises all kinds of images generated for to whom correspondence should be addressed biological_samples in a biological or biomedical_research context using a large diversity of imaging_techniques the techniques range from standard ones such as bright_field imaging or phase contrast to advanced technologies that enable recording many molecular variables for each resolvable volume unit the latter group of technologies can also be referred to as multivariate bioimages mbi belong to the so_called high_content techniques which apply high_resolution imaging in time and or space and or variables to close those open gaps in systems_biology which cannot be bridged by standard i e non spatial omics techniques while these can in principle resolve the almost complete molecular_composition in a sample on different levels genomics transciptomics proteomics and metabolomics they have to leave out the spatial_domain in contrast to that bioimaging approaches which usually work with a lower level of molecular resolution can relate molecular information to spatial features such as morphology typical examples for mbi are matrix_assisted maldi imaging vibrational_spectroscopy raman microscopy van or multiepitope ligand cartography melc toponome imaging system tis the first two techniques measure molecular_features and interactions in localized spectra arranged in a pixel grid the interpretation of the obtained images aims at the identification of pixel groups that share particular or similar spectral_features e g where as the final identification of molecules and a semantic interpretation remains an unsolved_problems for most applications in contrast to that melc tis for the sake of compactness we will refer to this technique with tis imaging aims at the imaging of a selected set of n proteins using a library of n fluorescent labeled antibodies lectins or other specific_ligands referred to as tags in general in combination with a cyclic protocol of staining fluorescence_imaging and soft bleaching to unfold the full potential of all these kinds of mbi new algorithms and software are needed that allow researchers to visually explore the data and to identify the hidden regularities in this article we will focus on images recorded using the tis technology however our method is definitely applicable to other mbi data recorded with a different multitag technology or maldi images as well for one selected field of view fov in the sample tis records one multivariate image t s which consists of a set of n aligned images g n with x y as pixel coordinates with s s s describing the id of the tis image fov and g the author s published_by this is an open_access the

built by extracting the multidimensional n intensity values for each pixel a h som was the results have been visually analyzed regarding different aspects first the topology preservation is qualitatively analyzed by moving the mouse cursor along the border of color disc one can observe the continuous changes in the mcep patterns while the color changes some example cipras are shown as bookmarks in one can see that with changing color from blue to green to yellow to red some markers go up such as dapi and some are going down and up again such as epcam or cd or vice_versa such as ki the color mapping did not show any strong distortions such as cipras with similar colors but different colocation pattern the second interesting aspect was how the whide tool reacts to strong noise in the data in image t n a strong noise signal can be observed for the cd marker showing a large star shaped group of fully saturated pixels such noise can be observed from time to time in tis imaging and from a data_mining point_of these signals form false outlier data clouds in the high_dimensional colocation signal space the right image of t n inshows this case and some magenta blue spike of the noise pattern can be observed in the right half of the image however the pattern does not have an influence on the global color mapping since both cases t n and t n show equivalent color mappings of their morphology and their mcep patterns third we investigated whides potential to reveal differences in mcep statistics and spatial distribution for cancer and normal_tissue to this end we apply the special whide feature of a continuous interactive tuning of the color mapping the color mapping is changed in two ways the color disc can be rotated as shown in where we rotate the color disc so some regions are drawn in yellow which are visible in t c and t c as a small number of cellular sub cellular objects marked with white ellipsoids the motivation to move these regions to yellow is that human_observers can perceive more color details in the green yellowred interval of the color spectrum than in the bluish region so the observer might discriminate more colors i e different mceps for these regions now in addition the mbius transform is applied to move the nodes from the yellow region toward the center thereby squeezing the opposing nodes all into the blue region of the color scale disc see a lower row on the right please note that the colors of the bookmarked cipras are adapted accordingly this transformation has two important consequences the majority of mceps are drawn blue with a low color contrast so the human_observer does not perceive many structural_features and the color contrast for a comparably small subregion of the dimensional colocation feature_space spanned by the rest of the mceps is strongly_enhanced the selected individual mceps of the selected regions can now be distinguished more easily and analyzed in detail this way we enable a kind of a zoom in an n dimensional_space which is interactive and continuously so the user does not loose the context in the upper row the four tis images t c t c t n and t n from left to right the bottom row shows a small set of selected bookmarked cipras on the right the color disc is shown with its control buttons below to change the coloring the user can combine two functions first using the rotate button the user can turn the color disc so that of the h som grid which is of less interest is mapped to the blue area since human_observers are more sensitive to non blue colors second the user can use the arrow buttons to change the mbius projection i e to move h som nodes toward the center and squeeze the opposing nodes into a small cloud in this example the nodes from the upper right are moved to enhance the color contrast for a chosen region of interest in one image marked with white ellipsoids for comparison we show results obtained with a principal_component pca the pca was performed on the same dataset and the feature_vectors were projected onto the eigenvectors of the three largest eigenvalues to map each pixel to three new coordinates v v v which were used for a rgb pseudocolor mapping for each image see_supplementary c while we again made the observation of a difference in colocation feature statistics between normal_tissue and cancer tissue the pca approach does not feature the structural advances of the h som which allow resolving non linear features and dynamic interactive manipulation of the colors the whide tool shows significant advantages compared with other approaches to mbi analysis first it is able to resolve and embed non linear data_structures this can be seen by browsing the cipras on the h som visualization on the color disc moving the cursor slowly across the discs shows the cipras of neighboring clusters the cipras show that similarity in cluster prototypes is reflected by vicinity in the h som grid i e the n dimensional data topology is preserved regarding local neighborhoods a second striking feature is the h som visualization using the mbius transform which allows change of zoom in the n dimensional feature_space by mapping a smaller number of neighboring clusters to a larger area in the color scale this way particular groups of mceps can be pseudocolored in higher color resolution whereas the rest of the tis image is colored with a very small part of the color scale i e with low contrast another positive feature of the whide approach is the reduction of the tis data using vector quantization as performed by the h som algorithm which has shown to resolve even small_clusters and organize the clusters in a hierarchical_structure if the cipra visualization is compared with two classic methods such as bar graphs and star glyphs it is evident that in the cipradue to advances in machine_learning research present day internet connection bandwidths and state of the art web graphics technology a new level of mbi analysis is enabled web technology allows a direct connection of researchers to the tools and the result visualizations independent from their whereabouts and their computer system modern ria technologies allow web_based visualizations to be interactive and dynamic which are prerequisites for the analysis of mbi data such as tis although we presented the whide tool in the context of tis analysis it is evident that the tool is applicable to other mbi data such as maldi images as well
