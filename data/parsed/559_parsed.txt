systems_biology a subpopulation model to analyze heterogeneous cell_differentiation dynamics motivation cell_differentiation is steered by extracellular signals that activate a cell_type transcriptional program molecular_mechanisms that drive the differentiation can be analyzed by combining mathematical_modeling with population average data for standard mathematical_models the population average data is informative only if the measurements come from a homogeneous cell_culture in practice however the differentiation efficiencies are always imperfect consequently cell_cultures are inherently mixtures of several cell_types which have different molecular_mechanisms and exhibit quantitatively different dynamics there is an urgent need for data_driven mathematical modeling_approaches that can detect possible heterogeneity and further recover the molecular_mechanisms from heterogeneous data results we develop a novel method that models a heterogeneous_population using homogeneous subpopulations that evolve in parallel different subpopulations can represent different cell_types and each subpopulation can have cell_type specific_molecular we present statistical methodology that can be used to quantify the effect of heterogeneity and to infer the subpopulation specific molecular_interactions after a proof_of study with simulated_data we apply our methodology to analyze the differentiation of human th cells using time course rna sequencing_data we construct putative molecular_networks driving the t cell activation and th differentiation and allow the cell_populations to be split into two subpopulations in the case of heterogeneous_samples our analysis shows that the heterogeneity indeed has a statistically_significant effect on observed dynamics and furthermore our statistical methodology can infer both the subpopulation specific_molecular and the effect of heterogeneity availability_and an implementation of the method is available atthe capability of a cell to transform from one cell_type to several more specialized cell_types is crucial for the development of any multicellular_organism besides developmental_processes cell specification is essential e g for the immune system particularly for its adaptive arm where t and b cells respond and differentiate upon external signals cell differentiation_processes are typically guided by extracellular signals which activate and control intracellular_mechanisms in a cell_type way and eventually change the cells gene_expression pattern towards the pattern of a more specialized cell_type given the central role of cell_differentiation in biology there is a keen interest to achieve a detailed understanding of the molecular_mechanisms that drive differentiation_processes and especially to understand the mechanisms that steer the activation of cell_type regulatory programs among other approaches mathematical_modeling has been used to learn and predict molecular_dynamics of cell differentiation_processes mathematical_modeling can be especially useful when it is combined with time course data by means of statistical_techniques using this approach different hypotheses about the underlying_molecular and interactions are quantitatively expressed in the form of mathematical_models and further the models can be objectively evaluated with respect to experimental_data using well defined statistical_methods in a typical setting the models are informed using population average measurements which are informative about the mechanisms of interest only if they come from a homogeneous cell_culture if the underlying cell_culture turns out to be heterogeneous the standard_approaches can fail or provide unreliable results in the context of cell_differentiation it is rather common that the cell_culture of interest is a mixture of several cell_types for instance if we consider a population of type a cells which are either activated to type b cells or stimulated to differentiate into type c cells it might be that only a fraction of the cells respond to the stimulation and the resulting cell_culture is a mixture of type b and c cells when these kinds of data are analyzed the possible heterogeneity needs to be taken into account properly the importance of heterogeneity modeling has been acknowledged also in other studies in their recent study developed ordinary_differential ode constrained mixture_models that can be used to detect dynamically distinct_subpopulations using population snapshot data such as facs measurements we also aim to detect dynamically distinct_subpopulations and use odes to model molecular_mechanisms however our approach is different in that we inform our models using population average sequencing_data and along with subpopulation detection we explicitly infer the subpopulation specific regulatory_mechanisms i e network_structures from data further we outline advanced statistical_tools that can be used to quantitatively assess the significance of the modeling results in summary we develop a novel modeling_approach that can be applied to analyze cell_differentiation dynamics in the presence of several co existing cell_types we show how this approach can be used to detect the heterogeneity of the underlying cell_culture and to infer cell_type molecular_interactions we derive our model for naive human cd helper t th cells that are induced to polarize towards th lineage but nevertheless our approach is fully general in our th cell_differentiation application we construct alternative_models for the core regulatory_network driving the th polarization in the form of ordinary_differential and combine the alternative_models with different hypotheses about the possible heterogeneity of underlying cell_culture to carry out quantitative model and parameter_inference we combine these models with time course rna_sequencing rna_seq using a recently_published statistical_framework that is specifically_designed for sequencing count_data our results show that the proposed modeling_approach works well for both simulated and experimental_data further to the best of our knowledge we are the first ones to analyze the regulatory_mechanisms that steer human th lineage_specification by means of data_driven mathematical_modeling
