speedb fast structural protein searches motivation interactions between amino_acids are important determinants of the structure stability and function of proteins several tools have been developed for the identification and analysis of such interactions in proteins based on the extensive studies carried_out on high_resolution structures from protein_data pdb although these tools allow users to identify and analyze interactions analysis can only be performed on one structure at a time this makes_it and time consuming to study the significance of these interactions on a large_scale results speedb is a web_based for the identification of protein_structures based on structural_properties speedb queries are executed on all structures in the pdb at once quickly enough for interactive use speedb includes standard queries based on published_criteria for identifying various structures disulphide_bonds catalytic triads and aromaticaromatic sulphuraromatic cation p and ionic_interactions users can also construct custom queries in the user_interface without any programming results can be downloaded in a comma separated value csv format for further analysis with other tools case studies presented in this article demonstrate how speedb can be used to answer various biological_questions analysis of human proteases revealed that disulphide_bonds are the predominant_type of interaction and are located close to the active_site where they promote substrate_specificity when comparing the two homologous g_protein and the two protein_kinase paralogs analyzed the differences in the types of interactions responsible for stability accounts for the differences in specificity and functionality of the structures availability_and speedb is available at http www parallelcomputing ca as a web_service the majority of biological_processes in living_organisms are carried_out by proteins proteins can function as enzymes which catalyze and regulate chemical_reactions some proteins transport and store essential biological_molecules such as oxygen metal_ions and glucose other proteins are found in connective_tissues and function as structural_elements collagen is an example of a structural protein which occurs in all multicellular_organisms and functions as the major stress bearing component of connective_tissues the function of proteins is determined by the correct folding of the amino_acid into a stable three_dimensional structure with so many different roles it is crucial that proteins are able to recognize and interact with their specific substrates in order to carry out their function interactions that occur between amino_acid are the main factors that determine the structure stability and function of proteins a number of v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com interactions have been associated with protein_stability and assembly into their native structures these include weak hydrogen_bonds ionic_interactions disulphide bridges aromatic interactions and hydrophobic_interactions being able to determine which interactions_occur in which proteins has many applications in characterizing protein_function including drug_design for example had to find a candidate protein with specific disulphide_bonds as a key_step in hiv drug_design the ability to support similar future work was a key motivation for speedb a key source of protein interactions is the protein_data pdb which currently has over resolved protein_structures with the relative d positions of each atom determined using experimental methods such as x_ray interactions are either explicitly annotated by the crystallographers or can be inferred by the proximity and configuration of amino_acids together with the amino_acid or atom properties the goal of this work is to present a tool that allows the entire pdb to be searched for a wide_variety of user specified interactions rapidly enough for interactive use once the desired query and filters have been specified the user can submit the query to see the structures that match the results are shown in a table displaying the pdb id name organism s family and resolution of the matching proteins for each entry clicking on the pdb id takes the user to a page displaying more details clicking on the organism name takes the user to the ncbi taxonomy page and clicking on the family name takes the user to the scop classification database speedb is an online resource that allows users to quickly identify proteins structures using different types of interaction queries speedb includes queries to identify various interactions including disulphide_bonds aromaticaromatic sulphuraromatic cationp and ionic_interactions additionally users can construct custom queries based on atom characteristics distances between atoms on different amino_acids and annotated connections described in the protein_structure files organism resolution and classification filters can be added to queries to filter out proteins of interest results can be shown as a web_page or downloaded in csv format the ability to process results in other tools via csv is particularly useful when analysing large result sets as shown in section the distribution of pdb matches to a query can be very informative however care must be taken in interpreting the distribution first although pdb is large it is not statistically representative since entries have been added to pdb ad_hoc as various researchers resolved structures moreover speedb searches all available structures and does not attempt to filter duplicate and near duplicate structures from the results in the future speedb may be enhanced to deal directly with these issues its current aim is to quickly find structures of interest and in conjunction with possible postprocessing of the results speedb is useful for answering new biological_questions as demonstrated by the case studies presented here witwatersrand for their support and constructive feedback through the development of this resource
