easyfig a genome comparison visualizer easyfig is a python application for creating linear comparison figures of multiple genomic_loci with an easy to use graphical_user blast comparisons between multiple genomic_regions ranging from single genes to whole prokaryote chromosomes can be generated visualized and interactively coloured enabling a rapid transition between analysis and the preparation of publication quality figures availability easyfig is freely_available under a gpl license for download for mac os x unix and microsoft windows from the sourceforge web_site http easyfig sourceforge net comparative_genomics involves the comparison of sequenced_genomes particularly for the identification of insertions deletions and variation in syntenic regions visualizing alignments between specific regions of multiple_genomes is a critical step in identifying genotypic_differences that underlie phenotypic changes between strains or species for example comparisons between related prokaryote genomes can highlight mobile_elements such as integrons prophage or pathogenicity islands preparation of clear and accurate images based on these genomic comparisons is typically accomplished ad_hoc by tedious manual compilation e g or using screensnapshots from analysis tools e g artemis comparison tool act and mauve are both examples of excellent comparative genome_analysis tools that are widely used to generate figures for publication but are not designed for this purpose and generally lose clarity when displaying several regions at once recently an elegant visualization_tool was developed however its dependence on r makes_it for users unfamiliar with scripting languages here we describe easyfig a python application for plotting comparison figures of multiple_genomes or genomic_regions from annotation files e g genbank and embl and tabular comparison files e g blast easyfig has been designed to enable any biologist to visualize comparisons between multiple_genomes or genomic_regions and produce clear publication quality images quickly and easily to whom the correspondence should be addressed
