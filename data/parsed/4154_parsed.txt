phylogenetics scriptree scripting phylogenetic graphics there is a large amount of tools for interactive display of phylogenetic_trees however there is a shortage of tools for the automation of tree rendering scripting phylogenetic graphics would enable the saving of graphical analyses_involving numerous and complex tree handling operations and would allow the automation of repetitive tasks scriptree is a tool intended to fill this gap it is an interpreter to be used in batch mode phylogenetic graphics instructions related to tree rendering as well as tree annotation are stored in a text_file and processed in a sequential way availability scriptree can be used online or downloaded at www scriptree org under the gpl license implementation scriptree written in tcl tk is a cross_platform application available for windows and unix like systems including os x it can be used either as a stand alone package or included in a bioinformatic pipeline and linked to a httpscriptree is a tool for scripting phylogenetic graphics it allows the management of multiple trees and usual kinds of annotations it can be used either as a stand alone package or included in a pipeline and linked to a http server scriptree is under continuous development and suggestions of new functionnalities are welcome
