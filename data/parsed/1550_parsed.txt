genome_analysis efficient learning of microbial genotype phenotype association_rules motivation finding biologically causative genotypephenotype associations from whole_genome data is difficult due to the large gene feature_space to mine the potential for interactions among genes and phylogenetic correlations between genomes associations within phylogentically distinct organisms with unusual molecular_mechanisms their phenotype may be particularly difficult to assess results we have developed a new genotypephenotype association approach that uses classification based on predictive association_rules cpar and compare it with netcar a recently_published association algorithm our implementation of cpar gave on average slightly_higher classification_accuracy with approximately time faster running_times given the influence of phylogenetic correlations in the extraction of genotypephenotype association_rules we furthermore propose a novel measure for downweighting the dependence among samples by modeling shared_ancestry using conditional mutual_information and demonstrate its complementary nature to traditional mining approaches variation in an organisms observed physical and environmental attributes known as its phenotype is determined in part by its gene composition known as its genotype organismal traits are often influenced not by a single gene but by combinations of genes comparing profiles of orthologous_genes or proteins with profiles of phenotypes is a common method for identifying gene correlations genes that confer a particular phenotype can be inherited from ancestors created through duplication of existing genes and mutation or acquired from other organisms through lateral_gene lgt events once thought to be restricted to a few exceptional events lgt is now known to have played a central role in bacterial evolution including in the emergence of traits such as to whom correspondence should be addressed thermophily photosynthesis and antibiotic_resistance the genomes of prokaryotic organisms typically contain genes many have studied methods of associating single genes or clusters of genes to phenotypes including with direct distribution comparisons analysis of neural_network parameters statistical_significance and mutual_information mi these approaches did not consider combinations of genes that do not share a similar pattern of distribution across genomes if there is a gene that is only important when other genes have already been taken into consideration it could be missed looked at several settheoretic methods of combining cluster profiles several studies used more advanced machine_learning to build up multigene associations such as recursive_feature and filter methods on cancer microarray_data recently used metabolic_profiles with wrapper filter and embedded methods of feature_selection depending on the classifier used wrapper methods can be computationally_expensive on feature rich datasets as a classifier must be trained multiple times on various subsets of features association_rule arm is an alternative method to mine multi feature associations arm is a data_mining technique that finds associations among features constructing rules of the general form classification using arm is the basis of netcar a mi based method of pruning the huge search_space of gene combinations to identify genotypephenotype relationships that would not be otherwise detected feature_selection is often used to find these predictive combinations of genes however good predictors do not necessarily have a causal influence on the property but can simply be correlated with it common correlated factors such as dependence among samples due to shared_ancestry can confound predictive analyses one of the strongest confounding patterns in phenotype prediction is the evolutionary ancestry of the organism the default mode of genetic_inheritance is vertical with organisms typically acquiring genes from their direct ancestors if a particular phenotypic trait is common or ubiquitous within a taxonomic_group then genes that correlate significantly with the presence of the trait may in fact be characteristic of the taxonomic_group rather than causal of the trait shows the uneven_distribution of temperature environment preference over bacteria and archaea subdivided by phylum in this grouped by phylum the bars represent the proportion of thermophiles dark and nonthermophiles light the number next to each bar is the number of microbes in that group the uneven_distribution of the phenotype class_labels over the taxonomic groupings demonstrates the dependence among samples dataset of thermophiles are within three phyla crenarchaeota eurarchaeota and firmicutes the other of thermophiles are unevenly_distributed from to over other phyla as identifying predictors is a needle in a haystack problem with tens_of of possible genes over only hundreds of examples ignoring confounding shared_ancestry can lead to predictors of overrepresented groups such as in this case the three main phyla clostridium_thermocellum is a thermophilic member of an otherwise mesophilic genus in this case we would like to pay particularly close attention to those differences between c thermocellum and the other clostridia by subtracting genes common among all close_relatives we amplify the importance of genes that are different among closely_related thermophiles and non thermophiles if these genes are present in other thermophiles they will be further emphasized by downweighting genes that are expected to be present due to common descent we emphasize the genes with unusual distributional patterns due to selective gene loss or lgt and may therefore play a particularly important determining role in the phenotype phylogenetic dependency networks have been used to mitigate shared_ancestry of hiv viral_proteins by constructing bayesian_networks conditioned on a phylogenetic_tree with our approach we do not depend on fine_grained and uncertain relationships within strict evolutionary hierarchies of microorganisms as may be necessary with closely_related viral samples such as hiv and instead allow the exploration of shared_ancestry within large_clusters at various taxonomic depths we apply a predictive rule mining approach which has not previously been tested on genotypephenotype mapping problems that achieves better predictive_accuracy than netcar and has lower running time to mitigate the effect of shared_ancestry we also propose a novel metric based on conditional mi cmi section for incorporating information regarding shared ancestral descent into genotypephenotype analyses while this approach does not improve the overall classification_accuracy it highlights sets of genes with relevant biological_functions and highlights the strong influence of phylogenetic correlation
