an efficient network_querying method based on conditional_random motivation a large amount of biomolecular network data for multiple species have been generated by high_throughput including undirected and directed networks such as proteinprotein_interaction gene_regulatory and metabolic_networks there are many conserved functionally_similar modules and pathways among multiple biomolecular networks in different species therefore it is important to analyze the similarity between the biomolecular networks network_querying approaches aim at efficiently discovering the similar subnetworks among different species however many existing_methods only partially solve this problem results in this article a novel approach for network_querying problem based on conditional_random crfs model is presented which can handle both undirected and directed networks acyclic and cyclic networks and any number of insertions_deletions the crf method is fast and can query pathways in a large network in seconds using a pc to evaluate the crf method extensive computational_experiments are conducted on the simulated_and and the results are compared with the existing network_querying methods all results show that the crf method is very useful and efficient to find the conserved functionally_similar modules and pathways in multiple biomolecular networks the high_throughput have been dramatically improved in past_decades and a large amount of biomolecular network data have been produced for example proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks are available in many databases such as dip which catalogs experimentally_determined protein interactions for many species including saccharomyces_cerevisiae drosophila_melanogaster escherichia_coli and caenorhabditis_elegans since the biomolecular networks contain many conserved functionally_similar modules and pathways to whom correspondence should be addressed it is important to analyze the similarity among multiple biomolecular networks to discover signaling_pathways find conserved modules and reveal new biological_function subnetworks network_querying approaches attempt to address this problem via optimally mapping the queried network into a subnetwork of the given biomolecular network there already exist many methods for network_querying in literature pathblast is a network_alignment and search tool for comparing ppi_networks but it only could be used to query a short protein path devised an algorithm called metapathwayhunter for querying metabolic_networks metapathwayhunter could find queries for more general pathways but it only could be applied to small networks without cycles qpath is a comprehensive framework for querying a linear pathway in a network of interest while qnet extends the type of queried network from the linear pathways to trees and networks of bounded tree width proposed an efficient framework for finding pathways based on hidden_markov hmms and it only could deal with the simple path the efficiency accuracy and capability to handle general network_structures are three major criteria for devising network_querying approaches many previous methods are either limited by the size of networks the types of networks or the maximum allowable number of insertions_deletions for example pathblast qpath and hmm method only consider the simple path i e linear_chain while metapathwayhunter and qnet cannot query the network with cycles some recent_approaches advanced the step to the network_querying problem with general network_structure saga is an approximate graph_matching technique that minimizes a subgraph distance_function with a parameter over all possible matchings to get the similar subgraph pathmatch graphmatch formally define the path matching and graph_matching problems and give algorithms for these problems respectively they reduced the path matching problem to find a longest weighted path in a directed_acyclic and the graph_matching problem to find the highest scoring subgraphs in a large graph mnaligner is a network alignment_method based on the integer quadratic_programming it only works well for the small network_alignment since solving the largescale integer quadratic_programming is time consuming torque is a topology free querying algorithm given a query torque finds a matching set of proteins that are sequence similar to the query and then span a connectedthe proposed crf method is implemented by using matlab the matlab toolbox ugm developed by mark schmidt http www di ens fr mschmidt software ugm html is used to solve the crf model and the lengths of shortest_paths for all pairs of nodes in the network g are calculated by the matlab toolbox matlabbgl http www stanford edu dgleich programs matlab bgl several simulated_and are used to evaluate the crf method on both undirected and directed network_querying problems in this study we set d c e and s
