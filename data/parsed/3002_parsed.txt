sequence_analysis mirseqviewer multi panel visualization of sequence structure and expression for analysis of microrna sequencing_data deep_sequencing of small_rnas has become a routine process in recent_years but no dedicated viewer is as yet available to explore the sequence_features simultaneously along with secondary_structure and gene_expression of microrna mirna we present a highly interactive application that visualizes the sequence_alignment secondary_structure and normalized read_counts in synchronous multi panel windows this helps users to easily examine the relationships between the structure of precursor and the sequences and abundance of final products and thereby will facilitate the studies on mirna bio genesis and regulation the project manager handles multiple samples of multiple groups the read_alignment is imported in bam file_format microrna sequencing mir seq is a powerful method to study virtually all aspects of mirna biology including biogenesis molecular_function and expression of mirnas with the advances in deep sequencing_technologies more laboratories are adopting mirna sequencing instead of microarrays or quantitative_pcr for such analyses typical procedure of analyzing mir seq data consists of preprocessing mapping quantification and identification of novel and or differentially_expressed as implemented in recent integrative platforms of magi and cap mirseq even though the sequence_variations such as uridylation iso mirs and rna_editing are known to be important in biogenesis and function of mirnas we still lack a dedicated alignment viewer to examine the details of sequence_features interactively and simultaneously with other features such as secondary_structure and read abundance to our knowledge mirspring is the only software to support analysis of sequence_variations but its visualization lacks interactive features here we present mirseqviewer a java_based standalone platform for visualizing mir seq data the read_alignment is concurrently displayed with the secondary_structure as well as the read_count table that indicates mirna_expression in multiple samples of multiple groups diverse features are implemented to enhance user convenience the analysis in addition it is important to use the identical reference_genome for read_alignment and for visualization we recommend using the genome_assemblies as specified in the mirbase in the alignment process for novel mirnas not included in the mirbase database users should identify novel mirnas in advance by running a program such as mirdeep and prepare a bed file containing the genomic_information on mirnas of interest the gui of mirseqviewer consists of project manager alignment window secondary_structure window and read_count table as illustrated in defining a project is the starting_point of every analysis we provide two wizards to define projects standard wizard allows users to specify organism groups of samples for comparison and alignment bam_files bed files for novel mirnas of interest quick wizard is useful for simple examination of sample data for known mirnas when no comparison between groups is necessary bam_file should be pre sorted and indexed in quick wizard mode the alignment window consists of navigation part alignment header and read_alignment parts users select a mirna or genomic_region to display the depth profile of read_alignment reference genome_sequence pre mirna sequence from mirbase and secondary_structure segments are shown in the alignment header reads in the alignment window can be sorted in various ways moved by drag and drop and edited secondary_structure of pre mirna is calculated using viennarna package in real_time the color code and cursor position are coincident with those in the alignment window this helps users to explore sequence_features along with secondary_structure information readily read_count table shows the normalized read_counts of each read for samples and groups as defined in the project the background color indicates relative_abundance we implemented four normalization_methods rpm tmm lowess and quantile as well as diverse sorting and display options highlighted row in the table is synchronized with the selected read in the alignment window several other features are implemented as well for user convenience filtering by read_count read_length or mismatches is supported exporting projects saves all alignment data and visualization parameters into a local file msv which can be shared with colleagues or imported at a later time the exported msv file contains all information for mirseqviewer function including read_alignment but the file size is much smaller because only mapped_reads are stored in fact the original bam_file is no longer used in mirseqviewer once the project is created we further provide a summary window that reports nucleotide propensity distribution of mismatches read_length etc in conclusion mirseqviewer provides a unique visualization platform optimized for interactive analysis of mirna deep sequencing_data supporting organisms in the mirbase database systems_biology infrastructure establishment grant through
