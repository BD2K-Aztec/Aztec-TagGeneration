using manifold embedding for assessing and predicting protein interactions from high_throughput experimental_data motivation high_throughput protein interaction data with ever increasing volume are becoming the foundation of many biological discoveries and thus high_quality proteinprotein_interaction ppi maps are critical for a deeper_understanding of cellular_processes however the unreliability and paucity of current available ppi data are key obstacles to the subsequent quantitative_studies it is therefore highly_desirable to develop an approach to deal with these issues from the computational perspective most previous_works for assessing and predicting protein interactions either need supporting evidences from multiple information resources or are severely impacted by the sparseness of ppi_networks results we developed a robust manifold embedding technique for assessing the reliability of interactions and predicting new interactions which purely utilizes the topological information of ppi_networks and can work on a sparse input protein interactome without requiring additional information types after transforming a given ppi_network into a low_dimensional metric space using manifold embedding based on isometric feature mapping isomap the problem of assessing and predicting protein interactions is recasted into the form of measuring similarity between points of its metric space then a reliability index a likelihood indicating the interaction of two proteins is assigned to each protein pair in the ppi_networks based on the similarity between the points in the embedded space validation of the proposed method is performed with extensive experiments on densely_connected and sparse ppi_network of yeast respectively results demonstrate that the interactions ranked top by our method have high functional homogeneity and localization coherence especially our method is very efficient for large sparse ppi_network with which the traditional algorithms fail therefore the proposed algorithm is a much more promising method to detect both false_positive interactions in ppi_networks availability matlab_code implementing the algorithm is available from the web siteover the last decade the development of novel high_throughput techniques has resulted in a rapid accumulation of data that provide a global description of the whole network of proteinprotein_interaction ppi for many organisms many essential_cellular such as cellular_metabolism controlling the function of enzymes transport and most regulatory_mechanisms rely on physical_interactions between proteins therefore the interactome analysis is expected to obtain biological_insights and enable us to collect comprehensive_knowledge for the control mechanism and organization of a living_cell this motivates researchers to utilize the interactome to study the disease mechanisms at a system level however the highthroughput methods are prone to a high rate of false_positives i e protein interactions which are identified by the experiment do not take place in the cell or interacting_protein can not be identified by current experiment technology for example it has shown that the false_positive fp rate of high_throughput yeast_two assays is the rate of false_negative fn is also very high thus it is highly desired to develop computational_techniques to assess the reliability of protein interactions and predict new interactions of ppi_network many such techniques have emerged recently currently the available methods for assessing and predicting protein interactions can be divided_into four categories i functional homogeneity or localization coherence based_methods the main idea of these approaches is to utilize the supporting evidence from the biological_perspective to assess the reliability of an interacting_protein pair for example if two proteins are localized in the same cellular_component or have a common cellular role the reliability that these two proteins interact with each other is high ii methods based on information integration for example via using bayesian_network approach li et_al combined multiple heterogeneous_biological evidences including gene_expression genome context functional_annotation interaction_domain and network_topology structure to assign reliability scores to the human ppis identifiedin this section we first quantify the success of embedding the ppi_network into the low_dimensional metric space through receiver_operator roc_curve and the probability densitythe euclidean_distance between protein pairs the probability density p similarity interaction p similarity non interaction in this article we have developed a robust technique to assess and predict protein interactions from high_throughput experimental_data using manifold embedding the proposed approach first transformed the ppi_network into a low_dimensional metric space based on isomap algorithm and then a ri which indicates the interacting likelihood of two proteins is assigned to every protein pair in the ppi_networks on the basis of the similarity between the points in the embedded space the experimental_results show our method outperforms the existing_methods no matter assessing or predicting interactions when a sparse ppi_network is used our method is better than ig and irap and has a comparable_performance with cd dist and fsweight method when a densely_connected ppi_network is used we demonstrate that the proposed approach might shed more light on assessing and predicting protein interaction in both densely_connected and sparse ppi_networks it should be noticed that our method solely use the ppi network_topology to assess and predict interactions it is a complementary to those page
