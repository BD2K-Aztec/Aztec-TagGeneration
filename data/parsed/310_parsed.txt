an efficient algorithm for the blocked pattern_matching motivation tandem_mass ms has become the method of choice for protein identification and quantification in the era of big_data biology tandem_mass are often searched against huge protein databases generated from genomes or rna_seq for peptide_identification however most existing_tools for ms based peptide_identification compare a tandem mass_spectrum against all peptides in a database whose molecular_masses are similar to the precursor mass of the spectrum making mass_spectral analysis slow for huge databases tag based_methods extract peptide sequence_tags from a tandem mass_spectrum and use them as a filter to reduce the number of candidate peptides thus speeding up the database_search recently gapped tags have been introduced into mass_spectral analysis because they improve the sensitivity of peptide_identification compared with sequence_tags however the blocked pattern matching bpm problem which is an essential step in gapped tag based peptide_identification has not been fully solved results in this article we propose a fast and memory_efficient algorithm for the bpm problem experiments on both simulated_and showed that the proposed algorithm achieved high_speed and high_sensitivity for peptide filtration in peptide_identification by database_search with the developments of high_throughput genomics transcriptomics and proteomics combining multiple omics_data provides a new way for studying complex_biological in multiple omics_data analysis tandem mass ms_ms are searched against protein databases generated from genomes or rna_seq for peptide_identification these protein databases are often huge for example in human microbiome_studies ms_ms are searched against databases containing protein_sequences generated from hundreds even thousands of genomes most mass_spectrometry ms based peptide_identification tools match an ms_ms spectrum against all peptides in a database whose molecular_masses are similar to the precursor mass of the spectrum these tools become slow when the database is large an alternative approach is based on peptide sequence_tags peptide sequence_tags are extracted from an ms_ms spectrum and searched against a database to identify a small number of candidate peptides that match at least one of the tags then a rescoring function is applied to report the highest scoring candidate peptide the trade_off between speed and sensitivity is an important problem in tagbased methods to increase the sensitivity it is essential that the set of sequence_tags extracted from a spectrum contains a correct one that matches the target peptide to increase the speed long sequence_tags length are preferred because they are efficient in filtering out incorrect peptides as a result correct long sequence_tags are extremely useful in tag based_methods because they speed up database_searches without losing sensitivity however correct long sequence_tags may not be found in ms_ms because of missing and noise peaks to utilize long sequence_tags proposed to generate a spectral dictionary containing full_length peptide constructions from an ms_ms spectrum for peptide_identification a drawback of this approach is that a spectral dictionary of an ms_ms spectrum with a large precursor mass may contain billions of peptides introduced gapped peptides to solve this problem since a gapped peptide represents many non gapped peptides the use of gapped peptides significantly_reduces the sizes of spectral dictionaries and speeds up peptide_identification without losing sensitivity similar to the method proposed by replacing sequence_tags with gapped tags can achieve both high_speed and high_sensitivity in tag based peptide_identification a gapped tag is represented by a sequence of mass values instead of amino_acids each mass value is the mass of one amino_acid or the sum of the masses of several consecutive amino_acid many ms_ms do not contain long sequence_tags because of missing peaks but contain long gapped tags gapped tags and gapped peptides give rise to the blocked pattern matching bpm problem in which a blocked pattern generated from a gapped tag is searched against a text to find matched substrings proposed an o m algorithm for querying a blocked pattern of length m against a text of length n however the time and space needed for the preprocessing_step of the algorithm is o k where k is the length of the longest substring to identify when k the preprocessing_step is slow and the space required by the algorithm is huge to whom correspondence should be addressed in this article we present a fast and memory_efficient algorithm for the bpm problem the time and space complexity of the preprocessing_step of the algorithm is o n in the application of ms based peptide_identification the time complexity for querying a blocked pattern is sublinear in n experiments on both simulated and real ms_ms data_sets showed that the proposed algorithm achieved high_speed and high_sensitivity for peptide filtration in peptide_identification by database_search we implemented the bpm algorithm in java and tested it on both simulated_and all the tests were performed on a linux bit desktop pc with a ghz cpu and gb ram we were not able to compare the bpm algorithm with that described inbecause it is not available
