databases_and lncrnator a comprehensive resource for functional investigation of long_non motivation a number of long_non lncrnas have been identified by deep_sequencing methods but their molecular and cellular_functions are known only for a limited number of lncrnas current databases on lncrnas are mostly for cataloging purpose without providing in depth_information required to infer functions a comprehensive resource on lncrna function is an immediate need results we present a database for functional investigation of lncrnas that encompasses annotation sequence_analysis gene_expression protein binding and phylogenetic conservation we have compiled lncrnas for six species human mouse zebrafish fruit_fly worm and yeast from ensembl hgnc mgi and lncrnadb each lncrna was analyzed for coding potential and phylogenetic conservation in different lineages gene_expression data of rna_seq studies samples collected from geo encode modencode and tcga databases were used to provide expression_profiles in various tissues diseases and developmental_stages importantly we analyzed rna_seq to identify coexpressed mrnas that would provide ample insights on lncrna functions the resulting gene_list can be subject to enrichment_analysis such as gene_ontology or kegg_pathways furthermore we compiled proteinlncrna interactions by collecting and analyzing publicly_available clip_seq or par_clip sequencing_data finally we explored evolutionarily_conserved lncrnas with correlated expression between human and six other organisms to identify functional lncrnas the whole contents are provided in a_user availability_and lncrnator is available at http long_non lncrnas are nonprotein coding transcripts nt many lncrnas have been reported to play important molecular and cellular_functions despite of not producing protein products they typically recruit proteins to help or disturb formation of ribonucleoprotein rnp complexes depending on the role of interacting_proteins lncrnas play_central in a wide_range of cellular_processes an illustrative example is rmst a brain specific lncrna which physically interacts with sox and plays_a in transcriptional_regulation of neurogenic transcription_factors several lncrnas were implicated in various types of cancers malat was reported to be a critical regulator of the metastasis phenotype of lung cancer_cells and ccat was shown to promote tumor_growth metastasis and chromosomal_instability in wnt dependent_fashion in colon_cancer in fact lncrnas are expected to be involved in every stage of hallmarks of cancer thereby serving as critical regulators and therapeutic_targets in many cases owing to the development_of thousands of lncrnas have been recently_discovered from rna_seq however the biological and molecular_characteristics of the large majority of lncrnas remain_unknown databases or tools that facilitate functional investigation of lncrnas would be of great value to identify important lncrnas based on understanding of biological_roles several databases on lncrnas have already been developed for various purposes lncipedia lncrnadb and lncrnome are mostly for annotation databases based on literature evidence nred and noncode v provide microarray expression_profiles in various tissues for human and mouse some of these databases contain additional useful information on function such as the rna_secondary microrna binding and protein lncrna interactions but they are mostly limited for human furthermore rna_seq the most useful source of lncrna properties have never been systematically collected and mined for functional investigation yet thus we still lack a comprehensive resource to cover sequence characteristics and function related data organized in a systematic way here we introduce lncrnator to perform in depth functional analysis of lncrnas by combining sequence characteristics gene_expression data and proteinlncrna interactions to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to compile massive rnaseq_data with the support of downstream_analysis such as to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as coexpression and gene_set covering six important model_organisms
