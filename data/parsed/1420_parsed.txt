sequence_analysis discriminative motif optimization based on perceptron training motivation generating accurate transcription_factor tf_binding motifs from data generated using the next_generation especially chip_seq is challenging the challenge arises because a typical experiment reports a large number of sequences bound by a tf and the length of each sequence is relatively long most traditional motif finders are slow in handling such enormous amount of data to overcome_this tools have been developed that compromise accuracy with speed by using heuristic discrete search_strategies or limited optimization of identified seed motifs however such strategies may not fully use the information in input_sequences to generate motifs such motifs often form good seeds and can be further improved with appropriate scoring_functions and rapid optimization results we report a tool named discriminative motif optimizer dimo dimo takes a seed motif along with a positive and a negative database and improves the motif based on a discriminative strategy we use area_under auc as a measure of discriminating_power of motifs and a strategy based on perceptron training that maximizes auc rapidly in a discriminative manner using dimo on a large test_set of tfs from human dros ophila and yeast we show that it is possible to significantly improve motifs identified by nine motif finders the motifs are generated optimized using training_sets and evaluated on test_sets the auc is improved for almost of the tfs on test_sets and the magnitude of increase is up to availability_and dimo is available at http stormo transcription_factors tfs can modulate gene_expression and hence are key components of cellular regulatory_networks tfs bind to dna in a sequence specific_manner the relative preference of tfs to various nucleotide_sequences is conveniently expressed in the form of position weight or frequency matrices pwm or pfm respectively often referred as tf_binding motifs a typical experiment to determine tf specificity especially using next_generation generates information about binding_sites at a relatively low_resolution the binding_site is identified within a region of the genome that is significantly_larger than tf_binding identified peaks can be as long as few hundreds to thousands of base_pairs and the total number of peaks can also be in a similar range most traditional motif finders are slow to identify motifs from such an enormous amount of unaligned sequences as an attempt to overcome this problem a few hundreds of top scored peaks are used for identifying tf_binding motifs leaving a large number of sequences unused to generate accurate motifs alternatively in recent_years motif finders have been developed that can handle relatively large amount of sequences and identify motifs faster with the use of some approximations for example a recently_developed method discriminative regular expression motif elicitation dreme rapidly identifies multiple short eukaryotic motifs for a large number of sequences to achieve_higher speed it searches for motifs over degenerate sequence iupac space and estimates fishers pvalue rather than rescanning input_sequences another method discriminative motif enumerator dme is fast in identifying motifs by use of precomputed matrices however the number of precomputed matrices increases significantly and speed decreases for identification of motifs at fine resolutions mdscan uses few sequences from large input_set to identify motifs and calculates significance on a number of sequences that are larger than those used for finding motifs automated motif_discovery amd uses multistep processing and filtering to identify significant core motifs in iupac space the core motifs are then extended and refined based on selected_sites with one mutation from core motifs deconvolved discriminative motif_discovery decod uses a heuristic hill climbing approach to identify enriched motifs from a limited set of k_mers specified by motif cardinality all these methods can identify significant seeds motifs from a large database leaving room for further optimization like a few other methods contrast motif finder cmf uses two step strategies seed identification and iterative_optimization both steps use z_score to identify significant motifs discriminative pwm search dips one of the earliest discriminative motif finder uses an iterative optimization_process to find a set of sites that maximizes discrimination score xxmotif is a recently_developed method that uses three step proceduresseed finding merging and refinementto find motifs enriched in positive sequences both seed searching and refinement are performed based on enrichment p value peak motifs of regulatory sequence_analysis tool rsat are fast and capable of handling several thousands of sequences it also generates user_friendly and rich output it rapidly searches overrepresented hexa heptamer followed by merging significant patterns dips cmf and xxmotif compared with dme and mdscan are slower for an input of several hundred sequences to whom correspondence should be addressed however they can handle small number of sequences efficiently and produce motif models such motifs can again be used as seeds and further re optimized on a larger set of sequences in addition to these several other methods are developed using discriminative principle based on different scoring_functions and search procedures da and vary on a scale of computational_efficiency in this article we present a discriminative motif optimizer dimo that takes seed motifs described earlier in the text and upgrades them with a systematic rapid and local_search dimo can be used for the same number of sequences that is used for identifying motifs or on larger databases dimo uses intuitive auc under roc_curve as a measure of discrimination by a motif and improves it using a strategy based on the logic of perceptron learning with the use of dimo statistically_significant improvements in aucs were achieved on a large test_set of tfs motifs the motifs generated using multiple software on sequences from chip_seq and chip_chip experiments on human k cell_lines drosophila and yeast were improved in addition applicability of dimo in generating more complete motifs by optimizing width of motifs is also suggested in addition to this dimo is fast and converges in median of nine epochs when seed motifs were optimized with same motif lengths
