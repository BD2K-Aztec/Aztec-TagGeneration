enrichnet network based gene_set motivation assessing functional_associations between an experimentally_derived gene or protein set of interest and a database of known gene protein_sets is a common task in the analysis of large_scale functional_genomics data for this purpose a frequently used approach is to apply an over representation based enrichment_analysis however this approach has four drawbacks i it can only score functional_associations of overlapping gene proteins sets ii it disregards genes with missing annotations iii it does not take into account the network_structure of physical_interactions between the gene protein_sets of interest and iv tissue_specific gene protein set associations cannot be recognized results to address these limitations we introduce an integrative_analysis approach and web_application called enrichnet it combines a novel graph_based statistic with an interactive sub network_visualization to accomplish two complementary goals improving the prioritization of putative_functional gene protein set associations by exploiting information from molecular_interaction and tissue_specific gene_expression data and enabling a direct biological_interpretation of the results by using the approach to analyse sets of genes with known involvement in human_diseases new pathway associations are identified reflecting a dense sub network of interactions between their corresponding proteins availability enrichnet is freely_available www enrichnet org the analysis of functional_genomics data from high_throughput experiments often involves the assessment of potential functional_associations between a gene or protein set of interest e g differentially_expressed in a microarray study and known gene protein_sets representing cellular_processes and pathways to identify and prioritize these putative associations a wide_range of enrichment_analysis tools have been developed in recent_years to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as including three basic types of methods seefor a more comprehensive_review over representation analysis ora techniques assessing the statistical overrepresentation of a user_defined pre selected gene protein list of interest in a reference list of known gene protein_sets using a statistical_test e g the one sided fishers_exact or the hypergeometric_distribution gene_set gsea methods which in contrast to classical annotation enrichment_analyses incorporate expression_level measurements from an unfiltered dataset including non parametric approaches such as gsea catmap erminej and genetrail and parametric approaches such as page mego fatiscan and gage integrative and modular enrichment_analysis mea approaches which account for dependencies between genes and proteins inferred from biological_networks and ontology graphs e g ontologizer and genecodis or by combining multiple types of annotations e g david most of these approaches provide a ranking list of known gene protein_sets as output scoring the evidence for their association with a user_defined target_gene protein list of interest although these prioritized putative functional_associations are a useful starting_point for further experimental_validation and analysis they also have the following major limitations among others bullet ora techniques tend to have low discriminative_power for a target gene_set several reference gene_sets receive the same or similar significance scores e g see and the scores vary_considerably with small changes in the overlap size bullet functional information captured in the graph_structure of a molecular_interaction connecting the gene protein_sets of interest is disregarded bullet genes and proteins in the network neighbourhood in particular those with missing annotations are not taken into account bullet the recognition of tissue_specific gene protein set associations is often statistically infeasible
