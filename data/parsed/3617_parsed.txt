systems_biology positional integratomic approach in identification of genomic candidate_regions for parkinson's_disease motivation recent abundance of data from studies_employing high_throughput to reveal alterations in human disease on genomic transcriptomic proteomic and other levels offer the possibility to integrate this information into a comprehensive picture of molecular_events occurring in human disease diversity of data originating from these studies presents a methodological obstacle in the integration_process also due to difficulties in choosing the optimal unified denominator that would allow inclusion of variables from various types of studies we present a novel approach for integration of such multi origin data based on positions of genetic_alterations occurring in human_diseases parkinsons disease pd was chosen as a model for evaluation of our methodology methods datasets from various types of studies in pd linkage genome_wide association transcriptomic and proteomic_studies were obtained from online repositories or were extracted from available research_papers subsequently human genome_assembly was subdivided into kb regions and significant signals from aforementioned studies were arranged into their corresponding regions according to their genomic_position for each region rank product values were calculated and significance values were estimated by permuting the original dataset results altogether regions representing contiguous genomic_regions had significant accumulation of signals when p value cutoff was set at identified regions with significant accumulation of signals contained plausible candidate_genes for pd in conclusion we present a novel approach for identification of candidate_regions and genes for various human_disorders based on the positional integration of data across various types of omic studies it has been anticipated that development of highly_parallel technologies would significantly improve our knowledge of several unresolved_issues regarding the etiology of human disease including details of its pathogenesis and the role of contributing risk_factors to whom correspondence should be addressed consequently several attempts at discerning alterations in genomic_sequence gene_expression and protein_profiles leading to onset of various diseases have been performed employing high_throughput methodologies however results from these studies have still not clarified disease_etiology and pathophysiology satisfactorily and have provided a multiplicity of results that are complex to interpret in addition the inherent difficulty of these studies is frequent occurrence of false_positive due to multiple testing issues usually small numbers of samples investigated and generally low technical and statistical reproducibility of obtained results in order to facilitate discovery of biologically_significant genetic_alterations based on such data an integrative_analysis of publicly_available datasets from studies that investigate global alterations in human disease on different biological layers genome transcriptome proteome and phenomeis proposed integrative approach is based on the assumption that genes consistently associated with a disease on different biological layers in different large_scale study types are likely to reflect biologically_relevant associations with disease investigated in biological sense alterations in genomic_sequence can be reflected in changes of gene_expression and consequently in alterations of proteomic_profile that ultimately lead to observed phenotypes the probability of a selected gene being associated to a disease as a consequence of a noisy false_positive result would therefore be reduced by using integrative approach as it is unlikely that a same false_positive gene has been discovered simultaneously in different study types if we assume that there is no bias toward selecting a certain group of false_positive genes in all these studies considerable difficulties may arise when combining different types of biological_information multiple_attempts at integration of such heterogeneous data have already been reported in the literature and approaches to such prioritization of genes have been based either on candidate_genes functional_similarity to a set of predefined training genes with known biological role in a disease under investigation or on experimental_data from studies_investigating specific alterations in the disease_state in the approach proposed byand implemented in endeavour software the prioritization of candidate_genes was performed by investigating their similarity to a training_set of genes based on multiple sources of data including various annotation expression interaction phenotype and other databases followed by global ranking using order_statistics in our study we have performed a positional integratomic search for candidate genomic_regions and candidate_genes based onthe integration of data originating studies that investigated global alterations in pd on different biological layers from largescale studies in pd regions were selected by demonstrating significantly_increased aggregation of signals across at least four different biological layers of data from large_scale studies in pd recent_technological have enabled identification of molecular_alterations occurring in human_diseases on a global scale however these approaches are intrinsically burdened by the high_dimensionality of data leading to multiple testing issues usually small numbers of samples investigated and generally low technical and statistical reproducibility of obtained results we therefore hypothesized that an integrated approach involving several layers of biological_information interconnected by flow of information defined by central dogma of molecular_biology could provide_additional events occurring in complex_diseases it is not uncommon that intermediate and minor alterations found in various large_scale studies are disregarded in further studies as they are interpreted as non specific noise in the data however a proportion of these alterations could nevertheless represent biologically relevant_information consistent observation of such alterations in various types of large_scale studies may suggest a biologically_important signal although they may only reach intermediate or minor significance_levels in separate studies therefore this additional level of complexity may provide a more complete insight into disease_pathogenesis and assist in searching for optimal disease_biomarkers for pd and other complex_disorders integration of data from various sources has previously been employed to select for genes with consistently highest significance scores from various different studies previous integration studies have utilized genecentric approaches combining information from various types of studies using gene names or accessions as a common_denominator however several issues may arise when using gene centric approach to integration of multi sourced data first difficulties may arise due to inconsistencies in gene_annotation used for reporting of results in various types of large_scale studies results of these studies are often provided using differing
