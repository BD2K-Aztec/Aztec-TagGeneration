systems_biology cellminer companion an interactive web_application to explore cellminer nci_data the nci human tumor cell_line panel is an invaluable resource for cancer researchers providing drug_sensitivity molecular and phenotypic_data for a range of cancer_types cellminer is a web_resource that provides tools for the acquisition and analysis of quality controlled nci_data cellminer supports queries of up to drugs or genes but the output is an excel file for each drug or gene this output format makes_it for researchers to explore the data from large queries cellminer companion is a web_application that facilitates the exploration and visual ization of output from cellminer further increasing the accessibility of nci_data availability_and the web_application is freely_accessible at https pul bioinfor_matics shinyapps io cellminercompanion the r source_code can be downloaded at https github com pepascuzzi cellminercompanion git the national_cancer developmental therapeutics program initiated a human tumor cell_line nci anticancer drug_screen over two decades_ago the nci database includes drug_sensitivity data from more than compounds and molecular data such as gene_expression mirna_expression protein expression genetic_variation and dna_copy the nci_data have been used to determine drug mode of action and potential molecular_targets the nci_data have also been used to develop predictive_models for drug_sensitivity the cellminer database http discover nci nih gov cellminer provides access to quality controlled nci pharmacological and molecular data cellminer also provides analysis tools to explore the nci_data the pattern comparison tool enables the discovery of drugs or genes with similar patterns of sensitivity or expression across the nci panel the query output is a spreadsheet that includes a pearson_correlation between the query drug s or gene s and every other drug and gene in the database researchers can then submit up to of these identifiers to cellminer to obtain additional data in a single query the result is multiple spreadsheets making integrative_analysis of the results difficult for researchers that lack computer programming_skills the recent r package rcellminer provides a powerful programmatic interface to the nci_data duplicating and enhancing the tools on the cellminer website however rcellminer is designed for experienced r users here we present cellminer companion a web_application that enables researchers to explore the output of cellminer queries the data from multiple files is summarized assembled into a single data matrix z_score normalized clustered and visualized both as a heatmap and dendrogram users can interactively change many parameters to explore the relationship among drugs or genes across the v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com nci cell_lines importantly this tool increases the accessibility of the nci_data to those lacking programming_skills further cellminer companion could be incorporated easily into workflows that use rcellminer
