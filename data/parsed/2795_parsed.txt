mapping networks of light_dark transition in lov photoreceptors motivation in optogenetics designing modules of long or short signaling state lifetime is necessary for control over precise cellular_events a critical parameter for designing artificial or synthetic photoreceptors is the signaling state lifetime of photosensor modules design and engineering of biologically_relevant artificial photoreceptors is based on signaling_mechanisms characteristic of naturally_occurring photoreceptors therefore identifying residues important for lightdark transition is a definite first step towards rational_design of synthetic photoreceptors a thorough grasp of detailed mechanisms of photo induced signaling_process would be immensely helpful in understanding the behaviour of organisms results herein we introduce the technique of differential_networks we identify key biological_interactions using light oxygen voltage domains of all organisms whose dark and light state crystal_structures are simultaneously available even though structural_differences between dark and light states are subtle other than the covalent_bond formation between flavin chromophore and active_site cysteine our results successfully capture functionally_relevant residues and are in complete_agreement with experimental_findings from literature additionally using sequence structure alignments we predict functional significance of interactions found to be important from network perspective yet awaiting experimental_validation our approach would not only help in minimizing extensive photo cycle kinetics procedure but is also helpful in providing first hand information on the fundamentals of photo adaptation and rational_design of synthetic photoreceptors in optogenetics optogenetics aims to confer light_sensitivity to genetically_encoded molecules thus controlling multifarious organismal functionalities with great spatiotemporal precision while the initial motivation might have been the targeting of neuronal pathologies using natural photoreceptors or photosensors optogenetics has grown beyond the use of naturally existing photoreceptors with clever accommodation of biologically_inspired design of artificial photosensors optogenetics is now being used extensively to target any significant cellular_event to decipher the synchronization of molecular_events among the components of the signaling_network it is essential to understand the signaling states of photosensors in utmost detail light_sensitive modular proteins usually consist of two parts photosensor or input domain that absorbs light and effector or output domain that executes biological_function of that particular protein and thus enable them to carry out the desired physiological_activities such as phototropism plant morphogenesis visual_perception in animals and so on combination of x_ray protein_crystallography ultrafast spectroscopic_techniques and mutagenesis_studies have identified and validated some of themajor contributing amino_acid responsible for lightdark transition elaborated later however the individuality of photosensors in terms of direction of signal flow distinct topological arrangement specially in light oxygen voltage lov terminals demands further investigation lov domains first discovered in a thaliana have served as candidate sensors for designing light_regulated proteins molecules lov domains are part of per arnt sim pas super family of receptor_proteins which control varied biological_functions in plants animals and prokaryotes lov photoreceptors absorb blue_light by binding to an organic non protein component namely flavin chromophore fmn or fad to initiate photo cycle which is usually reversible in nature photon_absorption leads to formation of cysteine flavin adduct state commonly known as light state resulting in a cascade of signaling_processes within the domain this thermally activated signaling state may sustain itself for timescales of few seconds to few hours and then converts back to the non signaling state or the so_called dark state the most prominent effect of photon_absorption is the formation of cysteine flavin adduct though this is well established for many plant lovs a detailed comprehension of the underlying mechanism of the ensuing signal_transduction is still in its preliminary stage for reasons aforementioned flavin mono nucleotide fmn chromophore has not been taken into consideration during network construction and subsequently the conserved cysteine_residue that bonds with fmn chromophore does not feature in the present analysis the goal of this work is to identify important residues in pathway s of long_range transmission of structural changes that originate in the chromophore and its immediate environment upon absorption of a photon by introducing new techniques herein we introduce the technique of differential_networks knowledge of the aforementioned residues in photoreceptors and their importance is obtained from these differential_networks we successfully_identify functionally_important for the lightdark transition which are in total agreement with experimental_findings from previous_literature we also submit predictions on specific functionally_important which can be experimentally_verified thus the methods proposed here should be helpful in mitigating the need of extensive mutagenesis_studies moreover precise idea on such participating residues in this transition would greatly benefit the understanding of molecular_mechanisms behind photo adaptation as well as rational_design of synthetic photoreceptors for use in optogenetics network_theory has been applied to many biological_systems including macromolecules and even towards diagnostics and biomedical devices however it has never been applied before to study transition of signaling states in photosensors these studies are usually based on structure of the entire protein not all interactions maybe of equivalent energetic stability remarkably our results demonstrate that at least to a first approximation overlooking specifics of energetics in interactions which of course are implicitly included through structural changes during the transition still leads to good agreement with known experimental_findings for example for the well researched ytva and vvd lov this agreement is and respectively both light and dark state crystal_structures of any natural or synthetic full_length photoreceptor not merely the photosensor domain is simultaneously unavailable till_date it is well known that upon photon_absorption fmn binding site_located in lov undergoes a major conformational_change leading to loss or gain of new interactions in both light and dark states therefore we restrict ourselves to model only the lov sensor domain rather than the whole protein as a network of amino_acid it is reasonable to presume that the predicted amino_acid found to be important for isolated lov domains might not be too different from full_length structures as well preservation of coiled_coil signaling j a helix has been evidenced in both the isolated lov domain of ytva and in the only crystal_structure of full_length synthetic photoreceptor structure crystal_structures of core lov domains show almost no structural difference in dark and light state however within the same lov subfamily that share significant structural_homology in core_region there is wide variation in photo cycle kinetics and conformational orientation of the flanking signalling helices hence the sequences and structures are considered individually to account for these subtle structural_differences and to transcend this limitation herein we introduce the technique of differential_networks we demonstrate that changes arising upon illumination of the lov sensor domain leading to lightdark transition can be effectively captured by this approach we show that the combined effect of interactions which are lost or gained during lightdark transition plays an important role in signalling detailed_analyses of biologically_significant interactions among these yield valuable information fmn fad based blue_light responsive lov photoreceptors are present across all kingdoms of life this indicates their indispensability and diverse function in many crucial biological signaling_events photon_absorption leads to signal propagation accompanied by structural_alterations downstream or upstream which eventually affects the behavioral_pattern of the organism since our study is completely dependent on crystal_structure it should be noted that photo induced dynamics amidst static nature might vary with data_collection at different temperature further crystallography artefacts might also mildly affect network construction from different chains even from one single structure nevertheless by introducing the notion of differential network our study successfully identifies important interactions and residues with functional significance as attested by experiments as well as sequence structure homology thus it would be helpful in guiding future_experiments our network based_approach is not only useful in understanding photo adaptability in natural photoreceptors but will be extremely_helpful in rational_design of novel and complex photoreceptors with interesting light responsive functions
