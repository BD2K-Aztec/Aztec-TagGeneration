gene_expression glad a mixed membership model for heterogeneous tumor_subtype classification motivation genomic_analyses of many solid_cancers have demonstrated extensive genetic_heterogeneity between as well as within individual tumors however statistical_methods for classifying tumors by subtype based on genomic biomarkers generally entail an all or none decision which may be misleading for clinical samples containing a mixture of subtypes and or normal_cell results we have developed a mixed membership classification model called glad that simultaneously learns a sparse biomarker signature for each subtype as well as a distribution over subtypes for each sample we demonstrate the accuracy of this model on simulated_data in vitro mixture experiments and clinical samples from the cancer_genome tcga project we show that many tcga samples are likely a mixture of multiple subtypes genomic_analyses of many solid_cancers have demonstrated extensive genetic_heterogeneity between as well as within individual tumors microdissection and dna_sequencing have recently validated at high_resolution the existence of intratumor_heterogeneity characterizing such heterogeneity is important because it may be a contributing_factor to mono therapy treatment_failure accurately detecting subtypes in an individual tumor may lead to improved combinatorial therapies many cancers have been classified into distinct_genetic subtypes that develop by means of activation or repression of different driver pathways these tumor_subtypes are commonly identified and characterized by clustering the genomic_data from hundreds of samples in an effort to disambiguate driver from passenger_mutations the genomic_signatures associated with each subtype are sparse and comprised only of those aberrations that are thought to be involved in oncogenesis new tumors are then classified based on their similarity to the centroids or signatures of those subtypes however this classification approach makes an all or none assumption about the primary_tumor that is incorrect for heterogeneous tumors mixture_models have been used extensively to analyze gene_expression in complex experiments gasch and eisen used fuzzy k_means to identify functionally co regulated transciptional networks took a less heuristic non_negative nmf approach to decompose the gene_expression data matrix into a product of a meta gene matrix and a sample weight_matrix the nmf approach was extended to allow for sparseness in either of the factor matrices mixed membership models have emerged in recent_years as a tool for data where the all or none clustering assumption is inappropriate in text classification the topic modeling framework which includes mixed membership models captures the structure in large document corpora where each document may exhibit a mixture of topics mixed membership models have been used in population_genetics social_network and elsewhere our model achieves the dual purposes of i representing each sample as a mixture of genomic subtypes and ii representing each subtype signature as a sparse set of genomic_features that delineate driving oncogenic_pathways our model provides a more general framework for representing mixed_samples than all or none classification methods and we show that we obtain a more accurate estimate of mixture proportions than a mixedmembership model without subtype sparsity we demonstrate our model on rna expression data from primary glioblastomas gbm comprising thousands of genomic_features and hundreds of samples there we show that we recover known subtypes with a sparse set of driving aberrations and we give evidence that many of the primary samples are mixed we have presented glad a new statistical_model for the genomic classification of solid_tumors the model does not make an all or none classification for each sample instead it estimates a per sample distribution over subtypes simultaneously the model estimates a sparse expression signature for each subtype we provide an interpretation of the model as a regularized form of matrix_factorization we compared glad with lpd another clustering and classification model using simulated_data at small dataset sizes we found that glad overestimates the amount of mixing for pure samples whereas lpd is quite imprecise for any particular sample in our view one should expect heterogeneity to be the norm in applications as we increased the simulated sample_size the performance of glad improved quickly owing to the decreased weight of the prior in the inference about i glad is able to identify gene_expression associated with different tissue_types from real microarray_data even when the sample is a sparse subtype signatures for gbm data upregulated genes are shown in a lighter shade green and downregulated genes are in a darker shade blue genes identified by the tcga analysis are shown in bold there is high concordance between this sparse subtype signature and the more dense tcga signatures color online heterogeneous mixture an analysis of tcga gbm data shows that there is significant_heterogeneity in those clinical samples our laplace variational inference algorithm provides a fast method for statistical_inference using glad however it is an approximation a markov_chain approach has potential to reduce bias at the expense of possibly much higher computational_cost our variational approximation is also one of many possible factorizations of the model we are actively testing other ways of approximating the posterior_distribution that retain the computational advantages while improving the quality of the approximation when fitting glad we optimize a non convex objective_function by coordinate ascent as such we are only able to identify a local maximum in the variational auxiliary function not necessarily a global maximum restarting the algorithm using random initializations can help and we found it important to do so estimating the number of clusters k is a universal problem for clustering_algorithms our approach using the bic provides only a rough guideline however this approach may require much more data for accurate parameter_estimation than needed in the current model another alternative is to choose k by cross_validation this shifts the problem from choosing k to choosing an appropriate cross validatory accuracy metric recent_studies in breast_cancer and colon_cancer de sousa e have suggested different subtypes which show distinct survival_outcomes as more samples are analyzed a clearer_picture of cancer_subtypes and number of subtypes develops we can extend glad in several directions other data types such as imaging dna copy_number and dna_methylation may be incorporated as additional x and y outcomes structured sparsity may be incorporated into the hyperparameter finally a hierarchical_dirichlet may be incorporated into to learn the number of subtypes k
