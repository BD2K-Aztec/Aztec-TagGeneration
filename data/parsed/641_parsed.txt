gene_expression backclip a tool to identify common background presence in par_clip datasets motivation par_clip a clip_seq protocol derives a transcriptome_wide set of binding_sites for rna_binding even though the protocol uses stringent washing to remove experimental_noise some of it remains a recent study measured three sets of non specific rna backgrounds which are present in several par_clip datasets however a tool to identify the presence of common background in par_clip datasets is not yet available results we used the measured sets of non specific rna backgrounds to build a common background set each element from the common background set has a score that reflects its presence in several par_clip datasets we present a tool that uses this score to identify the amount of common backgrounds present in a par_clip dataset and we provide the user the option to use or remove it we used the proposed_strategy in par_clip datasets from nine proteins it is possible to identify the presence of common backgrounds in a dataset and identify differences in datasets for the same protein this method is the first step in the process of completely removing such backgrounds availability the tool was implemented in python the common background set and the supplementary data are available at https github com phrh backclip contact rna_binding rbps have important roles in rna regulation the first step to understand rbps specific functions is to identify the rna_targets for each rbp the introduction of protocols combining clip uv crosslinking and immunoprecipitation and high_throughput commonly known as clip_seq protocols have made it possible to obtain sets of binding_sites for rbps at a transcriptome_wide scale however each clip_seq protocol introduces distinct modifications to reduce the presence of background non crosslinked rna par_clip a frequently used clip_seq protocol uses photo activatable nucleosides to label the transcripts in addition to an enhanced crosslinking these modifications induce specific nucleotides transitions that facilitate the recognition of the crosslinked sites the presence of a common background in par_clip datasets has been noted this non specific rna background must be taken into account when processing par_clip data because it can interfere with the distinction of the specific characteristics recognized by the rbps and therefore the identification and understanding of binding targets and protein_function a recent study experimentally_measured three background sets and demonstrated that background rna is common in several par_clip datasets this background rna mainly originates from false binding_sites it is worth noting that par_clip induced transitions were also present in several sites from the measured background sets thus it is difficult to distinguish background rna although computational_tools exist specifically for clip_seq data reyes only a few proposals address the background issue these computational_tools use mathematical_models to distinguish binding_sites from the rna background based on characteristics such as read_counts or the number of induced transitions but these characteristics are measured from whole datasets both background and binding_sites friedersdorf and keene present an alternative strategy for background correction it consists on removing sites from the par_clip dataset that overlap by one or more nucleotides with the sites present in one of three known background rna sets however a limitation of this strategy is that it may remove sites that incidentally overlap with the background the datasets of non specific rna background constitute a valuable reference resource for the quantification of the amount of background present in a par_clip dataset here we build on this resource to develop a computational_tool backclip to identify the presence of common background rna in par_clip datasets
