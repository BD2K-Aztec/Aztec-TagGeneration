a new statistical_framework to assess structural alignment_quality using information compression motivation progress in protein biology depends on the reliability of results from a handful of computational_techniques structural_alignments being one recent_reviews have highlighted substantial inconsistencies and differences between alignment results generated by the ever growing stock of structural_alignment programs the lack of consensus on how the quality of structural_alignments must be assessed has been identified as the main cause for the observed differences current methods assess structural alignment_quality by constructing a scoring_function that attempts to balance conflicting criteria mainly alignment coverage and fidelity of structures under superposition this traditional approach to measuring alignment_quality the subject of considerable literature has failed to solve the problem further development along the same lines is unlikely to rectify the current deficiencies in the field results this paper proposes a new statistical_framework to assess structural alignment_quality and significance based on lossless information compression this is a radical departure from the traditional approach of formulating scoring_functions it links the structural_alignment problem to the general class of statistical inductive inference problems solved using the information_theoretic criterion of minimum message length based on this we developed an efficient and reliable measure of structural alignment_quality i value the performance of i value is demonstrated in comparison with a number of popular scoring_functions on a large collection of competing alignments our analysis shows that i value provides a rigorous and reliable quantification of structural alignment_quality addressing a major gap in the field a protein structural_alignment is an assignment of residueresidue correspondences between the amino_acids of two or more proteins based on their d structure protein structural_alignments support basic_and in molecular_biology for example they reveal how protein_families evolve identify patterns of conservation in amino_acid that fold into similar structures facilitate comparative modelling of structures from sequence and guide experimental solutions to structures using crystallographic molecular_replacement the last four decades have seen the development of many methods aimed at generating biologically_meaningful structural_alignments while the number of new methods is estimated to be doubling roughly every five years several comparative_studies have observed many inconsistencies and paradoxes when comparing the alignments generated by existing_methods noteworthy among these studies are those by michael levitt liisa holm and manfred sippl and colleagues a common_theme emerging from all these studies is the need for a systematic framework to asses the quality of structural_alignments while a handful of quantitatively rigorous statistical_models for structure comparison have been proposed for this there is no consensus regarding their usefulness this is in stark_contrast to the state of the art in the closely_related problem of aligning protein_sequences where many rigorous statistical_models have been proposed to quantitatively assess sequence alignment_quality this has in turn helped standardize the task of measuring sequence alignment_quality and thus the task of generating meaningful sequence_alignments in this work we begin by examining the foundations of how structural_alignments are currently assessed guided by good biological_insights current structural aligners use a scoring_function to quantify the structural alignment_quality this has traditionally been achieved by combining the contributions of a small number of important criteria into an easy to compute scoring_function for a comprehensive list of commonly used scoring_functions see overwhelmingly the two key criteria that various current measures use are coverage and fidelity typically coverage measures the number of correspondences or equivalences in an alignment and in some cases also considers the number of gaps fidelity measures how similarly positioned the aligned residues are this is commonly but not always based on the root_mean rmsd computed after the best rigid_body transformation of corresponding residues is found to search for the best structural_alignment the goal of the aligners is to simultaneously maximize coverage and fidelity however these two objectives are in direct conflict with each other we observe that most of the current proliferation of structural_alignment scoring_functions arise from attempts to reconcile this conflict that is existing scoring_functions differ mainly in how they combine these two criteria as the reviews show existing scoring_functions do not generate consistent results even when aligning structures that have only moderately diverged in evolution to whom

extensively over the last four decades further development along the same lines is unlikely to provide any major breakthrough therefore this field will stand to benefit by departing from the traditional approaches and exploring radically new ones this paper is a step in this direction structural_alignment as an inductive inference problem the goal of inductive inference is to propose a theory or hypothesis that is able to best explain the observed data structural_alignment can thus be seen an instance of the general class of inference problems in this context an alignment i e residueresidue correspondence is a hypothesis that attempts to explain the residue residue relationships between two protein_structures whose observed data is the x y z coordinates of the structures in general any hypothesis has a certain descriptive complexity a complex hypothesis with more free_parameters can predict or fit explain a greater variety of observed data than a simpler hypothesis therefore in order to choose the best hypothesis for any inference problem one is confronted with a trade_off between hypothesis complexity and its fit with the observations for structural_alignments this trade_off is related to the conflict between coverage and fidelity coverage in various forms handled in the current scoring_functions is a crude approximation of the alignment hypothesis complexity similarly the fidelity or goodness_of with the observed data of a structural_alignment is approximated using rmsd of superposition or using some distance measure these rudimentary approximations cause the existing scoring_functions to introduce several tunable parameters in an attempt to balance the contributions between coverage and fidelity of structural_alignments this has been a major source of the inconsistencies observed in alignments the field of statistical_learning and inference provides rigorous approaches to address this trade_off systematically in the early s several landmark papers proposed links between inductive inference and information_theory the minimum message length mml principle provided the first practical information_theoretic criterion for hypothesis selection based on observations it is used here to rigorously assess structural alignment_quality and reliably differentiate between competing alignments structural alignment_quality and lossless information compression the pioneering work of claude e shannon provides the means to quantify information the length of the shortest code required to transmit losslessly an observed event this can be understood as the length of the shortest message needed to communicate the event losslessly between an imaginary sender alice and receiver bob in this context the structural_alignment problem can be rationalized as a communication process between alice and bob where alice has access to the x y z coordinates of two protein_structures and she wants to encode and transmit this information to bob losslessly two possible scenarios then arise i if the two are unrelated to each other structurally alice cannot do better than to encode and transmit the information of the two structures independently one after another that is knowledge of one structure called reference or s does not provide information about the other called target or t and thus knowledge of s cannot be used to compress t this form of independent transmission is termed here as the null_model message ii on the other hand if the two structures are structurally_related i e there is a meaningful alignment between the two knowledge of s reveals information about t the more similar the structures the more information one reveals about the other alice can use this similarity to compress and transmit the information of the target structure using the information of the reference for bob to decode the information of the target losslessly i e to the precision with which alice sees it he will require the structural_information of the reference structure plus the information of its proposed relationship i e the structural_alignment with the target this will allow alice to encode the target more concisely than stating the target structure using a null_model we call this form of transmission the alignment model message to contrast it with the null_model message where the structures are transmitted independently we note that this information_theoretic framework for structural_alignment is intuitive if the proposed alignment relationship is a poor one then the encoded alignment model message will be inefficient i e long alternatively if the alignment relationship is a good one then the transmission of the target becomes efficient i e short therefore the total message length of the lossless transmission of coordinate information using an alignment hypothesis forms an excellent measure to assess structural alignment_quality it follows that the best alignment is the one with the shortest total message length of lossless transmission while we have intuitively rationalized this framework as a communication process this message paradigm is also backed by mathematical rigour formally let a denote some alignment between structural coordinates s and t using the product rule of probability over three events a s and t we have pa s t pa psja ptjs a pa ps ptjs a where pa s t gives the joint probability of alignment a for structures s and t pa the prior probability of the alignment ptjs a the likelihood of t given s and a note psja is p s because s and a are assumed to be independent shannons mathematical theory of communication gives the relationship between the shortest message length i e to communicate losslessly any observation e and its probability p e as ie log pe technically i e denotes the shannon information content of e restating equation in terms of information content we obtain
