inferring single_cell gene_expression mechanisms using stochastic_simulation motivation stochastic promoter switching between transcriptionally_active on and inactive off states is a major source of noise in gene_expression it is often implicitly assumed that transitions between promoter states are memoryless i e promoters spend an exponentially_distributed time interval in each of the two states however increasing evidence suggests that promoter on off times can be non exponential hinting at more complex transcriptional_regulatory architec tures given the essential role of gene_expression in all cellular_functions efficient computational_techniques for characterizing promoter architectures are critically needed results we have developed a novel model reduction for promoters with arbitrary numbers of on and off states allowing us to approximate complex promoter switching behavior with weibull distributed on off times using this model reduction we created bursty monte_carlo expectation_maximization with modified cross entropy method bursty mcem an efficient parameter_estimation and model_selection technique for inferring the number and configuration of promoter states from single_cell application of bursty mcem to data from the en dogenous mouse glutaminase promoter reveals nearly deterministic promoter off times consistent with a multi_step activation mechanism consisting of or more inactive states our novel approach to modeling promoter fluctuations together with bursty mcem provides powerful_tools for characterizing transcriptional bursting across genes under different environmental_conditions availability_and r source_code implementing bursty mcem is available upon request the process of gene expressionwhereby the information contained in a dna_sequence is converted into rna and proteinsplays an essential role in the execution of nearly all cellular_functions as a result the misregulation of this process underlies a large number of human_diseases diabetes and neurological_disorders despite its importance the mechanistic_details of gene_expression are still not well understood in particular we lack a comprehensive molecular level

related processes such as bacterial phenotype switching and hiv activation recent_advances in single_cell monitoring and single_molecule detection have made possible the experimental_characterization

two state model of promoter architecture this commonly used random telegraph model assumes that each promoter can exist in one of two stateson or offwith synthesis of rna only possible in the on state because of intrinsic noise exhibited by the small numbers of molecules involved in transcription e g copies of dna few available copies of transcriptional_regulators the promoter produces expression bursts by switching randomly between the transcriptionally_active on and inactive off states according to kinetic_parameters rate_constants that can be estimated from single_cell time series data although conceptually useful and amenable to analytical characterization the random telegraph model is an oversimplification of the architecture of most promoters because of simultaneous regulation by multiple transcription_factors as well as chromatin_modifications the effective number of states for most promoters is thought to be larger than two a recent study of the human prolactin gene supports this assertion where the distribution of time its promoter spent in an inactive_state was inferred to be strongly non exponential and thus indicative of multiple sequential off states classical examples of multi state promoters include that of p rm in phage_lambda whose complex mechanism of regulation gives rise to regulatory states and the endo gene in sea_urchin whose cisregulatory domain contains binding_sites for different proteins that perform combinatorial regulation in light of these observations and the increasing availability of single_cell expression data computational_methods are needed for characterizing complex promoter architectures and efficiently simulating their behavior an ideal candidate for such a method would i leverage the intrinsic noise of the system to better identify underlying_mechanisms ii simultaneously infer both the configuration of promoter states and the associated kinetic_parameters needed for predictive simulation and iii provide computationally_efficient performance for a wide_range of architectures currently existing_methods satisfy only a subset of these requirements performed hidden_markov parameter_inference for two and three state promoter architectures but their models assume constant noise_free promoter_activity and rna levels between discretely observed time points and they do not provide an efficient means to characterize architectures with larger numbers of states we previously_developed monte_carlo expectationmaximization mcem with modified cross entropy method mcem which uses statistically exact stochastic_simulations to infer kinetic_parameters from single_cell time series data however the original_version of mcem does not enable characterization of promoter architecture developed an approximate_bayesian based method for inferring both parameters and model structure using stochastic_simulations unfortunately when using this method to discriminate between promoter models with increasing numbers of states the addition of each state increases the number of unknown kinetic_parameters e g switching rates in the presence of limited amounts of experimental_data this quickly renders more complex and thus more realistic models non identifiable we note that this drawback applies to any inference_method that represents transitions between individual promoter states explicitly finally stochastic_simulation of multi state promoter architectures suffers from a linear increase in computational_cost with the addition of each promoter state making the study of more complex models difficult because of the limitations described above our goal in this work was to develop a computationally_efficient method for characterizing gene_expression bursts by inferring the number and configuration of promoter states from single_cell time series data our results are structured as follows we first devise a novel model reduction strategy that represents arbitrary numbers of promoter states by a single state accompanied by a time dependent switching rate as we demonstrate below this strategy enables both efficient_simulation and parameter_inference next we incorporate this model reduction into mcem and augment the method to perform model_selection for configuration of promoter states we demonstrate the resulting approachbursty mcem by inferring the effective numbers of promoter states underlying simulated singlecell expression data in addition we use bursty mcem to characterize the architecture of the endogenous_mouse glutaminase promoter given experimentally_observed time series data in this work we present a novel model reduction for multi state promoters along with an efficient computational technique for inferring the number and configuration of promoter states from singlecell gene_expression data specifically we first developed a timedependent reaction propensity function for transcriptional bursting that generates weibull distributed on off promoter state dwell_times using this function we demonstrated an ability to closely approximate the behavior of promoters undergoing multi_step transitions between off and on states next we created bursty mcem which when combined with our model reduction allows for computationally_efficient parameter_inference and model_selection across a wide_range of promoter architectures as an example of the computational savings conferred we note that modeling a promoter transitioning between nine off states and one on state requires specification of switching parameters and simulation of chemical_reactions per transcriptional cycle in contrast use of our time dependent propensity function introduces only three parameters and requires the simulation of only two reactions per cycle these computational and parametric savings increase_linearly with the number of promoter states modeled enabling efficient analysis of arbitrarily complex promoter architectures with bursty mcem through a simulation_study we demonstrated the ability of bursty mcem to correctly identify the number of promoter states used to generate single_cell time series trajectories in addition we showed that our method accurately infers the values of kinetic_parameters within the chosen promoter model we then applied bursty mcem to experimental time lapse microscopy data from a reporter_gene driven by the endogenous_mouse glutaminase promoter our results suggest that rather than occupying two or three states as previously described the glutaminase promoter likely traverses through or more off states before transcribing mrna from an on state we hypothesize that a distinct advantage of a promoter architecture with states lies in its potential noise buffering properties as the number of states increases promoter off times become more deterministic leading to more consistent rates of mrna production as shown in this leads to less variable protein levels over time particularly at lower levels which can confer more robust behavior in response to stochastic perturbations because of the intrinsic noise present in the transcriptional and translational machinery we note that the confidence_interval accompanying our estimated number of glutaminase promoter off states is somewhat large the addition of measurements at later time points would certainly help reduce this uncertainty however if protein measurements were replaced with direct quantification of mrna we would expect a much more precise estimate since translational noise would no longer affect our analysis results from the simulation_study support this where we obtained more precise estimates of numbers of promoter states by performing inference on mrna data when discussing particular numbers of promoter states within our model reduction it is important to note that these values represent effective numbers of states rather than distinct biochemical configurations in particular since the correspondence between the parameters of the weibull distribution and the number of promoter states is most accurate when the switching rates are equal the effective number of states is likely an underestimation of the true number this follows from the observation that as the switching rates depart from equality the slowest promoter transitions become ratelimiting and thus mask the presence of faster transitions given that two and three state promoter models exhibit more variable off times than state promoter model values of c and c used for each model version are shown one of our goals in this work was to demonstrate that mammalian promoters occupy more than two or three states this discrepancy only strengthens the conclusions drawn from our results in conclusion we anticipate that our novel approach to modeling promoter fluctuations together with bursty mcem provides powerful_tools for characterizing transcriptional bursting across genes under different environmental_conditions future work will focus on discovering general transcriptional_regulatory principles by applying these methods to single_cell expression data from a wide_range of promoters
