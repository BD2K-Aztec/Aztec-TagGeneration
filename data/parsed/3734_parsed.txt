systems_biology propy a tool to generate various modes of chou's pseaac sequence derived structural and physiochemical features have been frequently used for analysing and predicting structural functional expression and interaction profiles of proteins and pep tides to facilitate extensive studies of proteins and peptides we developed a freely_available open_source python_package called protein in python propy for calculating the widely used structural and physi cochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino_acid it computes five feature groups composed of features including amino_acid dipeptide composition tripeptide composition normalized moreaubroto autocorrelation moran auto correlation geary autocorrelation sequence_order coupling number quasi sequence_order descriptors composition transition and distribution of various structural and physicochemical_properties and two types of pseudo amino_acid pseaac descriptors these features could be generally regarded as different chous pseaac modes in addition it can also easily compute the previous descriptors based on user_defined properties which are automatically available from the aaindex database availability the python_package propy is freely_available viasequence derived structural and physicochemical features have been widely used in the development of machine_learning for predicting protein structural and functional_classes proteinprotein_interactions proteinligand_interactions subcellular_locations and peptides of specific properties these features are highly useful for representing and distinguishing proteins or peptides of different structural functional and interaction profiles currently these structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides were routinely used to characterize target_proteins in drugtarget_pairs and predict new drugtarget associations to identify potential_drug following the spirit of chemogenomics several programs for computing protein structural and physicochemical features have been developed however they are not comprehensive and can only be limited to a certain kind of features additionally these are not freely and easily_accessible we implemented a selection of sophisticated protein features and provide them as a package for the free_and environment python the propy package aims at providing the user with comprehensive implementations of these descriptors in a unified_framework to allow easy and transparent computation to our knowledge propy is the first open_source package computing a large number of protein features based on user_defined structural and physicochemical_properties we recommend propy to analyse and represent the proteins or peptides under investigation further we hope that the package will be helpful when exploring questions concerning the structures functions and interactions of proteins and peptides in the context of systems_biology sequence_analysis of proteins and peptides has become more and more important in various bioinformatics fields apart from the prediction of structural and functional_classes of proteins or peptides there exist a few stand alone applications to calculate protein peptide descriptors which are designed to work with drug descriptors in the chemogenomics framework propy contains a selection of various chous pseaac descriptors to analyse classify and compare complex proteins and peptides they facilitate to exploit machine_learning to drive hypothesis from complex protein or peptide_datasets the usefulness of the features covered by propy for computing the structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides has been validated by a number of published_studies the propy implementation of each of these algorithms was extensively tested by using a number of test sequences the computed descriptor values were compared with the known values for these sequences to ensure that our computation is accurate propy is a powerful open_source package for the extraction of features of proteins and peptides in our future work we plan toapply the integrated features on various biological research_questions and extend the range of functions with new promising descriptors for the coming versions of propy
