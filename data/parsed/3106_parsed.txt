gene_expression mrnastab a web_application for mrna_stability analysis eukaryotic gene_expression is regulated both at the transcription and the mrna_degradation levels the implementation of functional_genomics methods that allow the simultaneous measurement of transcription tr and degradation dr rates for thousands of mrnas is a huge improvement in this field one of the best established methods for mrna_stability determination is genomic run on gro it allows the measurement of dr tr and mrna_levels during cell dynamic responses here we offer a software_package that provides improved algorithms for determination of mrna_stability during dynamic gro experiments availability_and the program mrnastab is freely_accessible atmrna is the messenger molecule transferring information from genes to proteins it is by its own nature and function unstable see parker perezperez ortnfor discussion there is a variable turnover that depends on synthesis transcription_rate tr conducted by rna_polymerase and degradation_rate dr conducted by a complex system of rnases and other proteins or rnas the importance of tr in determining the levels of mrnas is widely documented however the parallel importance of dr in it is only starting to be recognized perezperez ortn there are several methods currently available for dr determination some of them are able to measure mrna stabilities genome_wide seeand supplementary data for a critical description and comparison the most popular although prone to mistakes and biases is the transcription shut off and subsequent determination of mrna_decay assuming first order kinetics the degradation constant k d and the mrna half_life hl ln k d can be calculated the tr and mrna concentrations can be determined genome_wide by using a genomic run on protocol gro which allows to estimate the hls of mrnas even under non steady_state conditions this possibility is extremely interesting because it allows to determine tr mrna_levels and hls in a single experiment during the fast transcriptional_response to an imposed environmental_change castells roca et_al and references therein this is the simplest protocol currently available for monitoring mrna turnover in dynamic situations however it involves complex numerical_analysis and costly computing now we describe here the mrnastab package that offers two alternative algorithms programs stepk and rampk for determining mrna hls from data generated by gro experiments additionally it also includes a program shutoff to calculate k d from simple decay experiments all three programs are devised to cope with genome_wide data tr and or mrna time sequences for thousands of genes
