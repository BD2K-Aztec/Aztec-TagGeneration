cd cell graphs of hodgkin_lymphoma are not scale_free an image_analysis approach downloaded from motivation hodgkin_lymphoma hl is a type of b_cell to diagnose the subtypes biopsies are taken and immunostained the slides are scanned to produce high_resolution digital whole slide images wsi pathologists manually inspect the spatial distribution of cells but little is known on the statistical_properties of cell distributions in wsis such properties would give valuable information for the construction of theoretical_models that describe the invasion of malignant_cells in the lymph_node and the intercellular interactions results in this work we define and discuss hl cell graphs we identify cd cells in hl wsis bringing together the fields of digital_imaging and network_analysis we define special graphs based on the positions of the immunostained cells we present an automatic_analysis of complete wsis to determine significant morphological and immunohistochemical features of hl_cells and their spatial distribution in the lymph_node under three different medical_conditions lymph adenitis la and two types of hl we analyze the vertex degree distributions of cd cell graphs and compare them to a null_model cd cell graphs show higher vertex degrees than expected by a random unit disk graph suggesting clustering of the cells we found that a gamma_distribution is suitable to model the vertex degree distributions of cd cell graphs meaning that they are not scale_free moreover we compare the graphs for la and two subtypes of hl la and classical hl showed different vertex degree distributions the vertex degree distributions of the two hl sub types nschl and mixed_cellularity hl mxchl were similar availability_and the cellprofiler pipeline used for cell detection is available at https sourceforge net_projects cellgraphs hodgkin_lymphoma hl is one of the most common types of lymphoid_malignancies and one of the most common cancer_types in adolescents and younger_adults hl can be divided_into classical hl chl and the rare nodular lymphocyte predominant hl forms in chl the tumor_cells are called hodgkin and reed_sternberg hrs cells hrs cells are often large and multinucleated with a diameter of up to lm the mononucleated forms are smaller with a diameter of about lm hrs cells usually originate from b cells in hl tumor_cells are distributed in the lymphoid_tissue and make up about of the infiltrating_cells in a background of reactive bystander cells such as t cells b cells histiocytes and others the hrs cells are known to express cd and usually cd they also produce various chemokines and cytokines which shape the microenvironment according to their needs a review of hl biology can be found in k ppers et_al hrs cells can easily be detected by an antibody which is specific for cd it is used for diagnosis of the subtypes cd is a member of the tumor_necrosis family and a marker for hl malignant_lymphomas are diagnostically defined by morphology histological samples are visualized by light_microscopy and are interpreted by a trained pathologist according to the rules of the world_health in the context of experience in the diagnostic field nschl and mxchl are differentiated by the presence of sclerotic bands in nschl which confine at least one nodular compartment containing typical hrs cells in the absence of these sclerotic bands a case is assigned to the mxchl category cd is present not only in lymphoid_neoplasms but also on virus infected lymphocytes and special types of activated t cells thus the hrs cells form a subset of the cd cells this explains that cd cells are also found in lymphadenitis la la with abundant cd blasts and hl can be hard to distinguish because of the spread of digital pathology public_databases of hl whole slide images wsis like the cancer digital slide archive as well as internal databases at hospitals and institutes like the dr senckenbergisches institut f r pathologie are currently emerging for some example wsis see supplementary figures s s in the supplementary_material here we were interested in the distribution of cd cells in wsis of hl biopsies to detect significant patterns of hrs cells in the tissue we wanted to explore the biological_behavior of cd cells under neoplastic hl and reactive la conditions we focused on hl because the clinical co authors provided the data and have more than years of experience with hl we defined cd cell graphs based on cd cell positions see section for the exact definition of a cells position many biological_phenomena can be represented as graphs and graphs have also been applied to model cell distributions and cancer in the authors have considered graphs based on all cells in low_resolution brain tissue_samples and have applied them to classify the samples into tumor inflammatory and healthy_tissue for automated cancer diagnosis an augmented version of the method using weighted graphs has been published representing cell clusters instead of single cells b in features extracted from nucleiand cytoplasm based cell graphs have been used in combination with other descriptors to grade follicular_lymphoma texture based_methods have been used to describe clinically_relevant characteristics of tissue texture based_methods do not explicitly determine cell positions while cell detection is a very common task in biology only a few studies have tried to detect all cells in wsis in neuroblastomas have been classified based on wsis to the best of our knowledge no systematic analysis of wsis exists for hl our approach uses cell positions to create cell graphs of cd cells in wsis we use individual cells due to the low_density of cd cells in hl in contrast to other graph based_methods we analyzed high_resolution images and did not rely on pre selected regions this gave us the opportunity to gather data on the whole lymph_node in contrast to restrict the analysis to a specific region for reasons of clarity and comprehensibility we divided the section into five parts a definition of cell graphs is given in section section considers scale freeness afterward we describe a null_model in section section introduces the image format and the three image sets we analyzed we briefly describe our imaging pipeline and its implementation in section section_presents a validation of the imaging pipeline and the analysis of the vertex degree distributions of the cell graphs in this article we describe the first systematic graph_based exploration of stained cancer tissue here of cd stained tissues of hl our contributions are i the automated analysis of wsis using an own image pipeline ii the definition of a graph_based data_structure the cd cell graphs to abstract from images which enables for computational_analysis iii the statistical_analysis of the cell graphs which shows that they differ significantly from randomly_generated cell graphs iv the analysis of vertex degree distributions in the cell graphs which follow a gamma_distribution and are thus not scale_free which is unusual for biological_networks and v the application to hl subtypes which shows unexpected_results we performed an image_analysis on a dataset of hl images to detect cd cells mxchl cases had the highest_average cell_density followed by nschl the la cases showed considerably_lower cd cell_densities than the two forms of chl we defined a new data_structure the cell graph which describes the spatial neighborhood of cells we analyzed the vertex degree distributions of cd cell graphs the comparisons with poisson distributions indicate that the distributions in cell graphs differ significantly from those of simulated unit disk graphs the vertex degree distributions of cell graphs follow a gamma_distribution for which moments of arbitrary degree exist this finding rules out the hypothesis of scale_free cell graph networks for the cell graph of an image of lymphadenitis a nodular sclerosis b and mixed_cellularity c the filled circles depict the observed degree_distribution the distribution deviates significantly from the corresponding poisson_distribution null_model dotted line but is much better described by the gamma_distribution solid line we simulated unit disk graphs according to the null_model the error_bars illustrate the mean and standard_deviation of simulations the rate parameter b and shape parameter a of the gamma_distribution fitted to observed vertex degree distributions each data point represents a wsi of mxchl la or nschl cd cell graphs of hl are not scale freescale free network models e g the barabasialbert model are not suitable to describe the complex cooperative system of cells in the hl tissue this means that no key_regulators exist in the network of hl_cells the lack of key_regulators could mean that the distribution of cd cells is mainly influenced by external_factors e g the lymph_node structure or the microenvironment if the cd cells shape the network_topology they all show a similar behavior we found that the cd cells cluster in the tissue and the clustering is usually high for nschl and low for la the reason is unknown we discuss several possible scenarios high proliferation and rather immobile cells or mobile cells which are attracted to each other or to certain lymph_node regions for nschl the sclerotic bands may increase the clustering of cd cells in the nonsclerotic lymph_node we demonstrate that cell graphs enable the analysis of hl tissue properties the investigation of the vertex degree distributions in cell graphs already gave new insights the cell graph concept can be extended by data on locations of other cell_types from the tumor micro environment and blood_vessels to help in better understanding how tumor_cells spread through the lymph system findings of this investigation provide objective parameters for cd cells in hl the method can be extended for different immuno cell_types their shapes and localizations as well as their interactions these data can be used for a deeper_understanding of the biological meaning of interactions between cd tumor_cells and possibly also in the future to assess the impact of antitumor_drugs help with the prognosis and develop new therapies
