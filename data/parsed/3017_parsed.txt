gene_expression mmad microarray microdissection with analysis of differences is a computational_tool for deconvoluting cell_type contributions from tissue_samples background one of the significant obstacles in the development of clinically_relevant microarray derived biomarkers and classifiers is tissue_heterogeneity physical cell separation techniques such as cell_sorting and laser_capture can enrich samples for cell_types of interest but are costly labor_intensive and can limit investigation of important interactions between different cell_types results we developed a new computational_approach called micro array microdissection with analysis of differences mmad which performs microdissection in silico notably mmad i allows for simultaneous estimation of cell_fractions and gene_expression of contributing cell_types ii adjusts for microarray normalization bias iii uses the corrected akaike_information during model optimization to minimize overfitting and iv provides mechanisms for comparing gene_expression and cell_fractions between samples in different classes computational microdissection of simulated and experimental tissue mixture datasets showed tight correlations between predicted and measured gene_expression of pure tissues as well as tight correlations between reported and estimated cell fraction for each of the individual cell_types in simulation_studies mmad showed superior_ability to detect differentially_expressed in mixed tissue_samples when compared with standard metrics including both significance analysis of microarrays and cell_type significance analysis of microarrays conclusions we have developed a new computational_tool called mmad which is capable of performing robust tissue microdissection in silico and which can improve the detection of differentially_expressed mmad software as implemented in matlab is publically available for download at http sourceforge net_projects mmad gene_expression have yielded valuable biological and medical insight into many disease processes and have been heavily researched especially in the investigation of cancer_biology however standard_approaches to microarray_analysis can be easily confounded by cellular_heterogeneity in tissue_samples and by variability in cell_type composition this may introduce false_positive correlations but more importantly may also mask changes in gene_expression within a given cell_type of interest of particular concern is impact of sample_heterogeneity on developing and validating microarray_based predictive and prognostic_models for human_diseases physical cell separation_methods such as cell_sorting and or laser_capture can enrich samples for the cell_type of interest but such methods are time and resource_intensive and can affect the quantity and quality of rna available for subsequent analysis computational microdissection using various statistical_approaches has consequently been a subject of interest for several groups most techniques extend on the linear_model of which estimates the final measured gene_expression as the sum of gene_expression of the contributing cell_types several approaches estimate relative fractions of individual cell_types within a sample using gene_expression that are characteristic for each cell_type whereas other models estimate the characteristic gene_expression of each cell_type using measured cell_type fractions simultaneous estimates of cell_type expression_profiles and cell_type fraction analogous to principal_components have also been proposed a software_package that incorporates several of these methodologies in a unified interface has recently been made available we developed a flexible new model microarray microdissection with analysis of differences mmad which incorporates several features of the previously described approaches in addition to several novel features designed to improve performance and utility these include adjustments for reporting bias and to whom correspondence should be addressed normalization bias incorporation of information_theory criteria to minimize overfitting and methods for comparing gene_expression between classes either globally or on a cell specific basis an overview of mmad is provided in supplementary we present a method for the in silico microdissection of tissue_samples into component cell_types that is both flexible and robust
