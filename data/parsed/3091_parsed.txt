motifs tree a new method for predicting post_translational motivation post_translational ptms are important_steps in the maturation of proteins several models exist to predict specific ptms from manually detected patterns to machine_learning on one hand the manual detection of patterns does not provide the most efficient classifiers and requires an important work load and on the other hand models_built by machine_learning are hard to interpret and do not increase biological_knowledge therefore we developed a novel method based on patterns discovery and decision_trees to predict ptms the proposed algorithm builds a decision_tree by coupling the c algorithm with genetic_algorithms producing high performance white box classifiers our method was tested on the initiator methionine cleavage imc and n_terminal acetylation n ac two of the most common ptms results the resulting classifiers perform well when compared with existing_models on a set of eukaryotic_proteins they display a cross_validated matthews correlation_coefficient of imc and n ac when used to predict potential substrates of n_terminal acetyltransferaseb and n_terminal acetyltransferasec our classifiers display better performance than the state of the art moreover we present an analysis of the model predicting imc for homo_sapiens proteins and demonstrate that we are able to extract experimentally known facts without prior_knowledge those results validate the fact that our method_produces white box models availability_and predictors for imc and n ac and all datasets are freely_available atpost translational modifications ptms are modifications occurring during protein maturation or biosynthesis these modifications can consist of attachments of functional_groups e g methylation changes of the chemical nature e g deamidation cleavage of one or more residues e g initiator methionine cleavage or structural changes e g disulfide_bonds the ptms broaden the diversity of functional_groups of the standard amino_acids thus producing diverse forms of proteins that cannot be derived only from its genes because the mature form of a protein cannot be inferred only by genes the knowledge of a proteins ptms helps to understand the roles the possible interactions or the activity of a protein numerous predictors for ptms have been developed based on different machine_learning for example artificial_neural have been widely used to predict various ptms like phosphorylation n_terminal myristoylation and c mannosylation more recently random_forest method has been succesfully used to predict ptm_sites for ubiquitination carboxylation and glycosylation_sites although some of these predictors provide good prediction capabilities for the problem they tackle they often are black boxes their mathematical complexity makes them hard to interpret in terms of biological meaning unfortunately this restricts the application of these models for biological_problems which in our opinion require a model providing explanations for the prediction the purpose of this article is to introduce a new method to automatically build a ptm predictor using only the information contained in the proteins primary structure and which can be interpreted by biologists we focused on two ptms first the n_terminal acetylation n ac a ptm involving the transfer of an acetyl_group to the n_terminal residue amino_group it is one of the most common covalent irreversible modifications and occurs in of yeast proteins and of human proteins in eukaryotes n ac is catalyzed by n_terminal acetyltransferases nats six nats have been identified natanatf each acetylating specific n_terminal substrates because n ac can occur on proteins having their initiator methionine cleaved or not it is also required to know if the initiator methionine cleavage imc occurs to produce an accurate predictor for n ac hence the second ptm studied is the imc which is catalyzed by methionine aminopeptidases metaps as pointed by it is unlikely to discover a unique pattern describing the requirement of all enzymes because there is no biological sense to build an acetylation predictor based on an average motif as no enzyme recognizes this average motif our main idea is to combine several discriminant motifs optimized with genetic_algorithms ga these motifs are combined using a binary decision_tree dt our choice is mainly motivated by the need for white box models that is to say classifiers that are interpretable by biologists to help identifying the required biological_features the method described in this article is tested by evaluating its capacity to predict the imc and the n ac of eukaryotic_proteins the choice of predicting those ptms has been made because several methods to predict n ac have been published which allow us to test the efficiency of our method by comparison the published_methods range from black_box machine_learning ml e g support_vector and artificial_neural to manual pattern detection by eye for example cai and lu and more recentlypredicted ptms using manually extracted rules based only on the information provided by the first two or three amino_acids in the sequence which may be insufficient to predict correctly the ptms in this section we first assess the learning capability of our method by evaluating the quality of the predictions obtained with the datasets extracted from uniprotkb we then compare our predictors with the state of the art used to predict imc and n ac we presented a new method to predict ptms called motifs tree the method was tested for the imc and n ac by building a classifier for proteins in different taxa the resulting models are accurate on our datasets and perform as well as the previously_published state of the art results namely terminator moreover our results are cross_validated showing that our model can build classifiers with good generalization capabilities we did not compare our model with netacet because it has been trained only on a small dataset restricted to nata substrates from s cerevisiae also we have shown that our n ac classifier can take into account subtle information allowing it to improve the classification of potential natb and natc substrates which is a feature that is lacking in terminator and netacet as with all machine_learning the quality of the predictor depends on the quality of the dataset in biology negative sets are difficult to build because they rely on the non observation of a phenomenon which is not directly annotated in databases to confirm that our predictor was not biased because of noise in the dataset we have used a hold out test_set this set is only composed of experimentally confirmed non acetylated eukaryotic_proteins all proteins in the hold out test_set were not seen during training the eukaryota motifs tree produce a specificity of on this hold out test_set which is above the cross_validated specificity this good result illustrates that our algorithm induces correct rules to predict non acetlyation probably because our methodology can cope with noise in the dataset or because our dataset is clean enough to produce accurate predictors we add that the ability to learn with noise is a desirable feature for a ml method for more details see supplementary_information a validation for n_terminal acetylation classifiers also our method_produces a white box model that shows how features are used to classify sequences in a preliminary_analysis we have illustrated that our model can provide_helpful information about the composition of sequences that promote or inhibit a ptm this is also a valuable advantage versus the predictors presented inand liu and lin which is hard or impossible to interpret we are convinced that a model used for classification in biology should be readable by experts models used in machine_learning are able to capture characteristics that are hard to see in the data those characteristics or features may be exploited to understand the studied biological_process the purpose of this first analysis was only to validate the white box quality of our model by retrieving experimentally known biological facts from our motifs trees however in the future we may be able to use the motifs tree as a tool to propose new biological hypothesis that could be tested_experimentally
