structural_bioinformatics smurflite combining simplified markov_random with simulated evolution improves remote_homology for beta structural proteins into the twilight zone motivation one of the most successful methods to date for recognizing protein_sequences that are evolutionarily_related has been profile_hidden hmms however these models do not capture pairwise statistical preferences of residues that are hydrogen_bonded in beta_sheets these dependencies have been partially captured in the hmm setting by simulated evolution in the training phase and can be fully captured by markov_random mrfs however the mrfs can be computationally prohibitive when beta_strands are interleaved in complex topologies we introduce smurflite a method that combines both simplified mrfs and simulated evolution to substantially_improve remote_homology for beta structures unlike previous mrf based_methods smurflite is computationally_feasible on any beta structural_motif results we test smurflite on all propeller and barrel folds in the mainly beta class of the scop hierarchy in stringent cross_validation experiments we show a mean median improvement in area_under auc for beta structural_motif recognition as compared with hmmer a well known hmm method and a mean median improvement as compared with raptor a well known threading method and even a mean median improvement in auc over hhpred a profileprofile hmm method despite hhpreds use of extensive additional_training data we demonstrate smurflites ability to scale to whole genomes by running a smurflite library of beta structural scop superfamilies against the entire_genome of thermotoga_maritima and make over a new fold predictions availability and implementaion a webserver that runs smurflitemany researchers use hidden_markov hmms to annotate proteins according to homology with popular systems such as pfam and superfamily based on hmm methods integrated into uniprot however hmms are limited in their power to recognize remote_homologs because of to whom correspondence should be addressed their inability to model statistical_dependencies between amino_acid that are close in space but far apart in sequence for this reason many have suggested that more powerful markov_random mrfs be used mrfs employ an auxiliary dependency graph which allows them to model more complex statistical_dependencies including statistical_dependencies that occur between amino_acid that are hydrogen_bonded in beta_sheets however as the dependency graph becomes more complex major design difficulties emerge first the mrf becomes more difficult to train second it quickly becomes computationally_intractable to find the optimal scoring parse of the target to the model we have built a fully_automated system smurflite that combines the power of mrfs with kumar and cowens simulated evolution which offloads information about pairwise dependencies in beta_sheets into new artificial training data in order to build the first mrf models that are computationally_tractable for all beta structural proteins even those with limited training data the smurflite system builds in part on the smurf mrf which uses multidimensional dynamic_programming to simultaneously capture both standard hmm models and the pairwise interactions between amino_acid bonded together in beta_sheets unlike the full smurf mrf where the computational requirements of the random field become prohibitive on folds with deeply interleaved beta_strand pairs such as barrels smurflite is tractable on all beta structural proteins smurflite enables researchers to trade modeling power for computational_cost by tuning an interleave threshold the interleave threshold represents the maximum number of unrelated beta_strands that can occur in linear sequence between the beta_strands hydrogen_bonded in a beta_sheet while still being retained as pairwise dependencies in the mrf as the interleave threshold increases computation time increases but so does the power of the mrf see we first test smurflite on all propeller and barrel folds in the mainly beta class of the scop hierarchy in stringent crossvalidation experiments we show a mean median improvement in area_under auc for beta structural_motif recognition as compared with hmmer a popular hmm method and a mean median improvement as smurflite a closed beta_barrel pdb id bw a barwin domain from the superfamily barwin like endoglucanases to illustrate interleaving of strand pairs beta_strands a and b which close the barrel have interleave whereas strands c and d which are adjacent in sequence have interleave strands b and c have interleave compared with raptor a well known threading method and even a mean median improvement in auc over hhpred a profileprofile hmm method despite hhpreds use of extensive additional_training data we demonstrate smurflites ability to scale to whole genomes by running a smurflite library of beta structural scop superfamilies against the entire_genome of t maritima and make over a new fold predictions available at http smurf cs tufts edu smurflite the majority of these predictions are for genes that display very little sequence_similarity with any proteins of known structure demonstrating the power of smurflite to recognize remote_homologs we offer an online server http smurf cs tufts edu smurflite for predicting remote_homologs from our library of mainly beta superfamilies using smurflite the online server sets the interleave threshold the parameter that determines the complexity of the mrf to we have also shown that increasing the interleave number for smurflite can dramatically improve performance but at a great computational_cost while the primary intent of using simulated evolution in conjunction with simplified mrfs is to compensate for the removal of highly interleaved betastrand pairs required for computational feasibility we surprisingly find that simulated evolution can still improve full fledged smurf in cases of sparse training data for instance the bladed beta propellers have only three superfamilies in scop two of which contain only one family we find that for the bladed beta propeller fold combining smurf and simulated evolution improves auc from for full smurf alone to
