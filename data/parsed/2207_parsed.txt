hispod probe design for functional dna_microarrays motivation the use of dnamicrobes mediate almost every conceivable biological_process on the planet it is estimated that about bacterial and archaeal cells are involved in these tremendous metabolic potentialities to access to this wide metabolic diversity environmental functional gene arrays fgas are high_throughput tools which allow analyzing the presence or the expression of thousands of genes_encoding key enzymes involved in many metabolic process in only one experiment however designing to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as dna_microarray probes to encompass the full diversity of gene_family sequences encountered in nature and not yet identified is still one of the most difficult challenges in addition the difficulty to obtain sufficient nucleic_acid materials for microarray_studies from environmental_samples requires the development of highly_sensitive probes currently the most complete fga available to monitor bacterial_metabolism in complex ecosystems is geochip with a latest_version covering gene variants from more than gene categories geochip has already demonstrated its power in assessing in situ bacterial activity reinforcing the idea that functional microarray are an efficient approach however the main_problem that must be faced for functional microarray applications is the complexity of the oligonucleotide design step which hinders their development many parameters such as probe length melting_temperature t m gc complexity or still potential cross hybridizations evaluation percent similarity and identity stretch between probe and nontargeted sequences must be taken into account to ensure the selection of the oligonucleotides offering the best compromise between specificity and sensitivity fortunately numerous bioinformatics_tools which estimate most of these parameters have been developed to perform this crucial probe design step currently the most popular software for fga probe design are oligowiz commoligo also named oligostar or yoda however these softwares were developed for use on whole_genome data or on specific sets of genes so cross_hybridization research is performed only against a reduced set of sequences thus probe specificity must be checked against databases containing a very large set of sequences while staying within a reasonable time for the design a second critical obstacle when dealing with environmental studies is the difficulty to design probes able to cover all the gene variants encoding proteins having a same function although hierarchical probe design and prodesign softwares propose clusteringhispod takes_into a greater number of criteria to select more efficient probes compared with most popular softwares used for oligonucleotide_probe design for fgas the entire software_suite is available through web_services to produce the dna_probes users can enter their sequences of interest and set the required parameters furthermore our software can be applied to both individual nucleotide gene sequences and degenerated consensus_sequences produced by multiple_alignments of gene sequences belonging to a same gene_family therefore the user has the possibility to identify specific probes either at the gene or at the gene_family level for this last case design methods previously_reported are based on sequence_clustering or on the use of mismatch probes which constrain the selection of probes in the most conserved_regions in contrast hispod allows considering regions generating the least number of cross hybridizations even if they are more variable within the gene_family because all sequence combinations for each degenerate probe are re created for the dna_microarray synthesis some of them could detect new gene sequences not yet available in international databases furthermore as the number of probes per array is no longer a constraint given the development of very high_density microarrays several million probes proposed by nimblegen designing microarray to encompass the full diversity of sequence_variants encountered in the environment or in specific metabolic process is now feasible by this aspect the hispod method is then a pioneer explorative approach to the design of probes dedicated to fgas today the only probe design software described to allow an exploratory study of environmental_samples using degenerate probes is phylarray but it is dedicated to phylogenetic oligonucleotide_microarrays poas cross hybridizations with non target_sequences can be a significant contribution to the hybridization signal potentially introducing substantial error according to they represent one of the most critical limits of dna_microarray approach when dealing with complex environmental_samples of unknown composition however over the past_two new sequencing_technology developments and the trend of declining sequencing_costs allowed an exponential_growth of public dna sequence_data data analysis has revealed an extraordinary gene_diversity and a huge nucleic sequence_polymorphism for all investigated environmental microbial habitats especially by metagenomics approach this extraordinary resource can now be mined for dna_microarrays applications to assess the potential cross hybridizations currently hispod is the most suitable tool to take into account this wide_diversity to limit crosshybridations with a test of specificity conducted against envexbase a large and representative database of all prokaryotic fungal and environmental sequences this database includes all known potential cdss and their putative utrs however as the hispod algorithm extracts all probes by incrementing the constant defined probe size in a window along the sequence the time required for evaluating their specificity can be quite long several hours per gene especially for highly degenerate oligonucleotide_probes so hispod is greatly dependent on the performance of mpiblast program used in the specificity test step currently we are focusing our efforts to increase the program performance by deploying it on a larger cluster infrastructure and on a computing grid given the exponential_increase in the number of sequences in databases the dna_microarrays will be upgraded regularly with novel probes allowing the targeting of either new variants of the targeted genes or genes newly_discovered in addition envexbase component of the hispod software will be updated regularly an page of the database structure consisting in a split into multiple sub databases according to particular ecosystems soil marine freshwater atmosphere etc is also under development it will provide an enhanced usability of the program with a faster speed and an elimination of unneeded cross_hybridization information currently no known software offers the opportunity to test for specificity on such a large database furthermore no tested software i e oligowiz commoligo and yoda is able to integrate this database to perform the specificity test with it this is probably due to an inadequate performance optimization of these algorithms which systematically crashed when using a large database in addition the clustering of cross_hybridization sequences using blastclust tool is another original approach proposed by our software to define gene sequence families that may induce potential cross hybridizations and so to facilitate selection of the most appropriate probes probe sensitivity is another crucial parameter particularly for environmental studies where biomass can be low so design process allowing the selection of oligonucleotide_probes need to be optimized generally microarray_based hybridization presents a low detection_limit for example mer probe fga detection_limit was estimated to be in the range of ng of gdna in the absence of background dna and was about fold lower in its presence in this last case target_sequences were extrapolated to represent genomic material from of the total community of an environment for mrna no detection_limit is currently assessed in environmental sample it remains hard to solve the sensitivity issue despite the existence of some protocols bringing those limits down in this study we demonstrated the ability of probes designed with hispod to detect mrna retrieved from environmental_samples with a high_sensitivity e g copies ng of rna for pcea furthermore expression profiles_obtained were comparable with those of qrt_pcr assays suggesting the semi_quantitative aspect of the microarray elaborated using this software we demonstrate that the microarray developed in this study provides a powerful_tool to monitor chlorinated ethene biodegradation capabilities in complex_environments this tool will be now used for a wider study incorporating several industrial polluted_sites where a more or less complete_degradation of chlorinated solvents was observed however certain limitations still remain indeed numerous authors have highlighted the problem of signal variability obtained with probes targeting different regions of the same gene certainly when linked with probe thermodynamic_properties and or target secondary_structure the function of these parameters is still difficult to evaluate and to visualize in the microarray_results although their calculation is time consuming they will be taken into account in the next version of hispod in this study the new software was shown to be particularly accurate to design probes dedicated to microbial_ecology the experimental_validation of the oligonucleotide_probe set designated using hispod was performed with mrna extracted from a pce tce contaminated aquifer where pollutant biodegradation was observed site description and chemical analysis in supplementary_material and these pollutants undergo biodegradation through two different pathways i use as an electron_acceptor reductive_dechlorination and ii cometabolism where degradation of the chlorinated solvent is simply fortuitous and provides no benefit to the microorganism the first being the major process for the natural biodegradation of chlorinated solvents in this study the most recognized gene sequences involved in these two metabolic_processes where extracted from international databases and were used for probe design the microarray presented here is to our knowledge the most complete high_throughput molecular tool describing these pathways with probes covering sequence_variants of genes and in addition with an explorative side by comparison geochip mentioned probes targeting genes characteristics of pce tce biodegradation pathways in the context of industrial site rehabilitation it could be also applied as a diagnostic_tool to detect microbial activities before during and after bioremediation treatment moreover this explorative highthroughput tool could be used to monitor the distribution of these catabolic_pathways along non contaminated ecosystems in order to better understand the origin of these fascinating microbial functions in summary we present a novel probe design software called hispod dedicated to fga developments hispod allows probe design at both specific gene and gene_family levels through an original approach based on degenerated probe determination moreover specificity test was conducted against a large formatted database composed of all known cds retrieved from the taxonomic divisions pro fun and env of the embl databank in order to avoid cross_hybridization events finally the user_friendly web_interface developed simplifies greatly the user access to the program
