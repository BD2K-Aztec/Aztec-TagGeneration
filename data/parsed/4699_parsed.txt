toppic a software_tool for top_down mass_spectrometry based proteoform identification and characterization top_down mass_spectrometry enables the observation of whole complex proteoforms in biological_samples and provides crucial information complementary to bottom up mass spec trometry because of the complexity of top_down mass_spectra and proteoforms it is a challenging_problem to efficiently interpret top_down tandem_mass in high_throughput proteome level proteomics_studies we present toppic a tool that efficiently identifies and characterizes complex proteoforms with unknown_primary structure alterations such as amino_acid and post_translational by searching top_down tandem_mass against a protein database in the past_decade top_down mass_spectrometry ms has rapidly developed because of the advances in protein_separation and mass_spectrometry it has unique advantages in identifying and characterizing proteoforms with primary structure alterations such as amino_acid and post_translational ptms because top_down tandem_mass cover whole proteoform sequences although several software_tools such as prosightpc and ptop have been developed for top_down ms data analysis efficient interpretation of high_throughput top_down ms data is still a challenging computational_problem because intact proteoforms often contain unknown_primary structure alterations compared with the unmodified forms in the protein database we developed toppic top_down mass_spectrometry based proteoform identification and characterization a software_tool for high_throughput proteome_wide proteoform identification and characterization by top_down ms which integrates algorithms for protein filtering spectral alignment e value computation and bayesian_models for characterization of unknown amino_acid and ptms in addition a user_friendly web browser_based interface is provided toppic focuses on the identification and characterization of unknown_primary structure alterations and the discovery of novel proteoforms the performances of toppic with various parameter_settings were evaluated on a top_down tandem_mass ms_ms data_set of escherichia_coli k mg toppic was tested on a data_set of e coli ec k mg with collision_induced cid and electrontransfer dissociation etd top_down ms_ms which were generated by an ltq_orbitrap velos mass_spectrometer using the alternating fragmentation mode the details of the ms experiment are given in the supplementary_material the tests were performed on a desktop computer with an intel r core i ghz cpu and gb_memory the maximum number of allowed unknown_mass in a proteoform is a main parameter that determines the search_space and sensitivity of toppic we compared the performances of toppic with three settings for the parameter and the target_decoy approach was used to filter out low quantity matches all other parameters were set as the default values in the supplementary_material in the supplementary_material shows an example of the web_pages for the visualization of prsms the running_times were and seconds and the numbers of identified prsms with a spectrum level false_discovery fdr were and for at most and unknown_mass respectively supplementary tables s s the prsms were mapped to proteins the maximum number and the average number of matched spectra for a protein were and respectively when four threads in the cpu were used the running time was s for at most two unknown_mass the maximum memory_usage was about gb toppic achieved a balance between the speed and the number of identifications when the maximum number of unknown_mass was set as of the identified prsms at most two unknown_mass were allowed contain one unknown mass shift and contain two unknown_mass supplementary the miscore method identified and localized modification_sites with an miscore from mass shifts by using four common ptms acetylation methylation oxidation and phosphorylation supplementary the lookup table approach is faster but less accurate than the extended generating function approach for computing e values of prsms the two approaches were compared in speed and the number of identifications on the ec data_set using the same parameter_settings as the previous test the maximum number of unknown_mass was set as the running_times for e value computation were and s and the numbers of identifications with a spectrum level fdr were and for the lookup table approach and the generating function approach respectively supplementary tables s and s the multiple spectra mode of toppic is capable of combining spectral pairs in proteoform identification we compared the sequence_coverage of prsms reported by single cid and etd spectra as well as combined spectral pairs using the default parameter_settings except that at most two unknown_mass were allowed and the target_decoy approach was used supplementary tables s s a total of spectral pairs were identified by all three approaches with a spectrum level fdr the average peptide_bond coverage percentages were and for the cid only etd only and combined approaches respectively the results demonstrated that the combined approach significantly_increased the sequence_coverage in identified proteoforms ms align was employed to analyze the same data_set and compared with toppic in the two tools the target_decoy approach was used at most two unknown_mass were allowed in a prsm and all other parameters were set as the default values tables and in the supplementary_material ms align identified prsms with a spectrum level fdr its running time was s about h and its memory_usage was about gb compared with ms align toppic significantly_reduced the memory_usage and achieved about and times speedup for at most and unknown_mass respectively when at most two unknown_mass were allowed toppic identified prsms missed by msalign the main_reason is that the filtering algorithms inin the supplementary_material and missed only prsms identified by ms align in the supplementary_material all of which are not highly confident identifications toppic focuses on identifying proteoforms with unknown_primary structure alterations and characterizing unknown modifications it includes many useful features such as proteoform identification by combining spectral pairs or triplets generated by the alternating fragmentation mode of mass_spectrometers it is much faster and more memory_efficient compared with ms align in addition a web_server based graphical_user is provided toppic is capable of identifying proteoforms with primary structure alterations but it still has limitations in the analysis of very complex proteoforms first the filtering algorithms in toppic are based on finding protein segments without alterations that match to a part of the query spectrum with a large number of matched fragment masses when a proteoform has many alterations toppic may fail to identify it because the filtering algorithms cannot find such a segment in the target protein second variable ptms are not incorporated into database_search for proteoform identification a proteoform with several variable ptms such as oxidation may not be identified by toppic third a simple mass counting score is used as the scoring_function in toppic a scoring_function that takes_into peak_intensities can further improve the sensitivity of proteoform identification and the accuracy of modification characterization
