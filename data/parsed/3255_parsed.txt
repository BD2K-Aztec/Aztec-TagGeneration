sequence_analysis nextgenmap fast and accurate read_mapping in highly_polymorphic genomes when choosing a read_mapper one faces the trade_off between speed and the ability to map reads in highly_polymorphic regions here we report nextgenmap a fast and accurate read_mapper which reduces this dilemma nextgenmap aligns reads reliably to a reference_genome even when the sequence difference between target and reference_genome is large i e highly_polymorphic genome at the same time nextgenmap outperforms current mapping methods with respect to runtime and to the number of correctly mapped_reads high_throughput produce several million_reads per run with read_lengths ranging from to bp the increasing read_length and the advent of technologies like ion_torrent and miseq drive the need for new efficient read_mapping methods in addition the demand increases for methods that can cope with high sequence_divergence and at the same time are user_friendly two main groups of read_mapping programs are distinguished based on their indexing methods first burrows_wheeler transformation bwt based_methods e g bwa which are fast but optimized for short_reads and genomes with low polymorphism second hashbased methods like stampy which are slow but also suited for highly_polymorphic genomes thus a method that combines speed and accuracy provides a quantitative and qualitative improvement of current methods to this end we introduce nextgenmap a method that is faster than current bwt based_methods and at the same time handles short and long_reads independent of the number of differences between reads and reference_genomes nextgenmap implements new techniques to efficiently identify genomic_regions in the reference_genome that share a sequence_similarity with a read to achieve a short runtime and to reliably map the reads nextgenmap automatically estimates important parameters like the number of alignment score computations required for each read additionally nextgenmap makes use of multicore cpus and if available any opencl enabled graphic card gpu nextgenmap supports fasta fastq sam and bam as input_formats and outputs sam and bam_files furthermore nextgenmap maps single_end and paired_end data offers a local smith_waterman and an end_to alignment mode and supports aligning bisulfite treated reads the peak memory_consumption of nextgenmap ranged from to gb depending on the read_length here we showed with real and simulated_data that nextgenmap maps high_throughput sequencing_reads accurately and fast at the same time this fact was already exploited in studies of mirna and bisulfite treated data finally the automatized estimation of the required number of alignment score computations per read and the automatic adaptation to the hardware result in a reliable and fast read_mapper that requires minimal_user this allows nextgenmap to reliably map reads even to highly_polymorphic genomes thus it may also be used to map reads from nonstandard organism to a phylogenetically close reference_genome or to apply it to metagenomics_data divergencemapped a percentage of correctly solid and incorrectly dashed mapped_reads and b running_times for different degree of genomic polymorphisms between read and reference_genome for five million bp a thaliana reads a a ngm nextgenmap
