sequence_analysis an alignment_free model for comparison of regulatory_sequences motivation some recent comparative_studies have revealed that regulatory_regions can retain function over large evolutionary_distances even though the dna_sequences are divergent and difficult to align it is also known that such enhancers can drive very similar expression_patterns this poses a challenge for the in silico detection of biologically related sequences as they can only be discovered using alignment_free results here we present a new computational framework called regulatory_region scoring rrs model for the detection of functional_conservation of regulatory_sequences using predicted occupancy levels of transcription_factors of interest we demonstrate that our model can detect the functional and or evolutionary links between some non alignable enhancers with a strong statistical_significance we also identify groups of enhancers that are likely to be similarly_regulated our model is motivated by previous work on prediction of expression_patterns and it can capture similarity by strong binding_sites weak binding_sites and even the statistically_significant absence of sites our results support the hypothesis that weak binding_sites contribute to the functional_similarity of sequences our model fills a gap between two families of models detailed data intensive models for the prediction of precise spatio_temporal expression_patterns on the one side and crude generally_applicable models on the other side our model borrows some of the strengths of each group and addresses their drawbacks availability the rrs source_code is freely_available upon publication of this manuscript http www warwick ac uk fac sci systemsbiology staff ott tools and software rrs contactcis regulatory_modules crms can drive precise spatio_temporal gene_expression some recent_studies show that crms may function similarly in different species despite substantial sequence_divergence this implies that first alignment based sequence comparison tools are not applicable for further decoding the conserved function of such crms and to whom correspondence should be addressed second some crms must share_common patterns that drive almost identical regulatory outputs but possibly with different arrangements of binding_sites when different but functionally_related enhancer loci in the same species are considered then alignment based tools are not normally suitable for regulatory sequence_comparisons as these sequences are not orthologous here we present an alignment_free regulatory_sequence comparison model called regulatory_region scoring rrs model which is based on the potential distribution of transcription_factors tfs our goals are to be able to detect functionally_similar enhancer regions even if the enhancer regions do not align to find groups of similar enhancers and determine relevant sequence_features shared among enhancers within a group
