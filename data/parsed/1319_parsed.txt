de_novo identification of replication_timing domains in the human_genome by deep_learning motivation the de_novo identification of the initiation and termination zonesregions that replicate earlier or later than their upstream and downstream neighbours respectivelyremains a key challenge in dna_replication results building on advances in deep_learning we developed a novel hybrid architecture combining a pre trained deep neural_network and a hidden_markov dnn hmm for the de_novo identification of replication domains using replication_timing profiles our results demonstrate that dnn hmm can significantly_outperform strong discriminatively trained gaussian mixture modelhmm gmm hmm systems and other six reported methods that can be applied to this challenge we applied our trained dnn hmm to identify distinct replication domain types namely the early replication domain erd the down transition_zone dtz the late replication domain lrd and the up transition_zone utz using newly replicated dna_sequencing repli seq data across human cells a subsequent integrative_analysis revealed that these replication domains harbour unique genomic and epigenetic patterns transcriptional_activity and higher_order chromosomal_structure our findings support the replication domain model which states that erds and lrds connected by utzs and dtzs are spatially compartmentalized structural and functional_units of higher_order chromosomal_structure that the adjacent dtz utz pairs form chromatin_loops and that intra interactions within erds and lrds tend to be short range and long_range respectively our model reveals an important chromatin organizational principle of the human_genome and represents a critical step towards understanding the mechanisms_regulating replication_timing availability_and our dnn hmm method and three additional algorithms can be freely accessed at https github comcomplete and accurate chromosomal dna_replication is crucial for proper cell_division and maintenance of the genetic integrity in all organisms in eukaryotes dna_replication begins and ends at multiple genomic_regions designated the replication_initiation and termination zones respectively according to a tightly_controlled spatiotemporal order dysregulation of initiation or termination may delay genomic replication resulting in various diseases and even cancer the initiation and termination zones may be identified from the replication_timing profiles as regions that replicate earlier or later respectively than their upstream and downstream neighbours the timing of the replication of a given dna_sequence is determined by its distance from the local active replication origin and by the timing of the firing of that origin during the s phase genome_wide replication_timing profiles have been used to identify replication_origins throughout saccharomyces_cerevisiae and in higher_eukaryotes including drosophila mice and human these studies revealed that the timing of dna_replication is associated with transcriptional_activity epigenetic patterns and higher_order nuclear structures however the genomic epigenetic and transcriptional signatures that define the early late replication domain erds and late replication domain lrd in the human_genome have not been fully elucidated in particular the strengths of the correlations between replication_timing and the chromatin status within erd and lrd across diverse human cell_types remain_unclear furthermore the molecular_mechanisms through which the chromatin patterns are established and maintained within the erd and lrd in the human_genome remain_poorly resolving these questions completely depends on the precise identification of the erd and lrd in the human_genome which remains one of the greatest challenges in bioinformatics_research to date very few bioinformatics_methods have been proposed for the de_novo identification of replication domains using replication_timing profiles recently deep_learning approaches have surpassed the stateof the art performance of previous methods for many tasks due to their powerful capacity to automatically learn features at multiple levels of abstraction directly from data without using human crafted features or rules the deep neural_network dnn was developed from the artificial_neural ann with the advent of the deep_learning algorithm compared with a shallowlearning model that included an ann and gaussian_mixture gmm the deep_learning model i e dnn consists of multiple hidden layers showing significantly greater_power to representation data than the shallow model and is widely_applied in computer vision dimensionality_reduction and speech_recognition in addition hidden_markov hmms are well known for their effectiveness in the modelling of sequential patterns of data and have been extensively applied in computational_biology specifically in biological sequence_analysis copy_number detection motif_finding breakpoints identification and chromatin_state discovery these advances triggered our interest in developing a novel hybrid architecture between a pre trained dnn and an hmm for the de_novo identification of replication domains using replication_timing profiles in this study we present the first dnnhmm hybrid model which combines the representational power of dnns and the sequential modelling capacity of hmms to successfully resolve the challenge of the de_novo identification of replication domains using newly replicated dna_sequencing repli seq data we demonstrate that dnn hmms can significantly_outperform strong discriminatively trained gmmhmm systems and other six reported methods that can be applied to this challenge we applied our trained dnnhmm to the identification of distinct types of replication domains including the erd the down transition_zone dtz the lrd and the up transition_zone utz using repli seq data across human cell_types a subsequent integrative_analysis based on encode data revealed that the replication domains of distinct types harbour unique genomic and epigenetic patterns transcriptional_activity and higher_order chromosomal_structure our findings support the replicationdomain model which states that erds and lrds connected by utzs and dtzs are spatially compartmentalized structural and functional_units of higher_order chromosomal_structure in our model the adjacent dtz utz pairs form a chromatin loop and intra interactions within erds and lrds tend to be short and long_range respectively our model reveals an important chromatin organizational principle of the human_genome and represents a critical step towards increasing our understanding of the mechanisms_regulating replication_timing in this study we propose a pre trained dnnhmm hybrid model and present its first successful application for de_novo identification of replication domains with replication_timing profiles from repliseq data our approach has two key_characteristics that distinguish it from earlier methods first we adopted a deeper more expressive dnnhmm hybrid architecture and thus employed the unsupervised dbn pre training and subsequent supervised fine_tuning strategy which made the training more effective second we used posterior_probabilities of states as the output of dnn which made the training more informative subsequent performance assessments demonstrated that our dnnhmm approach achieves substantial improvements in identification_accuracy and robustness over discriminatively trained pure gmmhmm systems generatively trained traditional dnn algorithms and other six reported methods despite these promising results there are many aspects of using dnnhmm for practical scalability in computational_biology that require further study these aspects include investigation of the parallelization of dnn training which may require a better theoretical understanding of deep_learning and the exploration of more optimal algorithms to training dnnhmm rather than the embedded suboptimal viterbi algorithm there is also a need to explore the vast improvement space in the dnnhmm hybrid model including adopting a full sequence training of the dbn using the meancovariance rbm and even absorbing the insights gained from generative modelling research in both neural_networks and speech and phone recognition recently brendan j frey and his colleagues applied a dnn to investigate the human and mouse splicing codes and demonstrated the superior advantages of this deep architecture over the previous bayesian_method for predicting the patterns of alternative_splicing compared with their dnn structure of a two layer neural_network with only hidden units our dnnhmm hybrid architecture is much more complex and flexible regardless their work and ours represent a critical process of applying deep_learning in computational_biology in particular with the exponentially rapid_growth in the volume of multi omic_data such as genomics transcriptomics epigenomics proteomics and chromatin interactomics our hybrid architecture employing dnn and hmm has the potential to produce meaningful and hierarchical representations that can be efficiently used to describe complex biological_phenomena for example dnnhmms may be useful for modelling multiple_stages of a regulatory_network at the sequence level and at higher levels of abstraction in addition dnnhmm can be applied to the identification of functional_elements and regions such as enhancers insulators and promoters and the identification of chromatin_states we applied our dnnhmm algorithm to de_novo identification of distinct types of replication domains including erd dtz lrd and utz using repli seq data across human cell_types we performed a systematic and integrative_analysis of these domains using diverse encode data and unravelled the replication domains of distinct types that harbour unique genomic and epigenetic patterns transcriptional_activity and higher_order chromosomal_structure our results support a unifying model in which the human_genome is generally organized into large replication domains of distinct types that constitute stable regulatory units of replication_timing in our replication domain model dna replicates early within erds that acquire permissive chromatin signatures and active regulators meanwhile replication gradually moves forward into adjacent lrds that contain repressive chromatin features and repressive regulators this gradual progression forms dtzs or utzs that connect the boundaries of erds and lrds dtzs were characterized by the sharp_decrease increase of active repressive chromatin markers identifying replication_timing domains by deep learningwhereas utzs were characterized by the sharp_increase decrease of active repressive chromatin markers our replication domain model agrees well with the previously presented fractal globule a knot free polymer conformation in our model spatially_separated fractal globules are equivalent to temporally separated erds and lrds that are connected by utzs and dtzs the adjacent dtz utz pairs separated by an erd or lrd form a chromatin loop for each erd and lrd through the acquisition of much stronger contacts most importantly we found that in the chromatin_loops formed by adjacent dtzutz pairs lrds prefer to be more densely_packed and in long_range intra interactions whereas erds tend to be more loosely packed and in short range intra interactions lrds demarcated by dtzs and utzs are spatially compartmentalized structural and functional_units of higher_order chromosomal_structure and are dynamically associated with the nuclear_lamina in this model the erd is an open loosely packed transcriptionally active_chromatin domain located far from the nuclear_membrane and occupied by active epigenetic markers and active regulators whereas the lrd is a closed densely_packed transcriptionally_inactive chromatin domain located near the nuclear_membrane and occupied by repressive epigenetic markers and repressive regulators the erd and lrd are spatially_separated by the dtz and utz which are transition zones enriched with h_k and occupied by ctcf the adjacent dtz utz pairs form chromatin_loops and intra interactions within erds and lrds tend to be short and long_range respectively
