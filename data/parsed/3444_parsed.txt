sequence_analysis pathogen_detection using short_rna deep_sequencing subtraction and assembly motivation early and accurate detection of human pathogen_infection is critical for treatment and therapeutics here we describe pathogen identification using short_rna subtraction and assembly srsa a detection method that overcomes the requirement of prior_knowledge and culturing of pathogens by using degraded small_rna and deep sequencing_technology we prove our approachs efficiency through identification of a combined viral and bacterial_infection in human cells early and accurate detection of microbial_pathogens in both clinical and environmental_samples is critical for effective public_health treatment and therapeutics most pathogen_detection methods polymerase_chain pcr_amplification or microarrays rely on prior_knowledge of the exact sequence of the potential pathogen or the ability to cultivate the pathogen for microbial cultures which is unreasonable in many cases an alternative detection technique recently offered which circumvents these limitations is the sequencing of infected_cells and the subsequent comparison of these sequences to a reference pathogen library for identification given the massive increase in nucleic_acid sequence_databases of all organisms and the advancement in massive_parallel technologies sequencing possibly infected samples evolves as an increasingly prominent and logical alternative for pathogen characterization the major_advantages of this approach are the unbiased detection of all known pathogens overcoming the requirement for cultivation of slow_growing and fastidious microbial agents the ability to recognize pathogens even at minute expression levels simultaneous identification of several microbial agents in a co infected sample and the rapid turnaround and processing
