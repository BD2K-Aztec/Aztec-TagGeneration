genome_analysis prokka rapid prokaryotic genome_annotation the multiplex capability and high yield of current day dna_sequencing instruments has made bacterial whole_genome sequen_cing a routine affair the subsequent de_novo of reads into contigs has been well addressed the final step of annotating all relevant genomic_features on those contigs can be achieved slowly using existing web and email based systems but these are not applicable for sensitive data or integrating into computational_pipelines here we introduce prokka a command_line software_tool to fully annotate a draft bacterial_genome in about min on a typical desktop computer it produces standards compliant output_files for further analysis or viewing in genome_browsers availability_and prokka is implemented in perl and is freely_available under an open_source gplv_license from http genome_annotation is the process of identifying and labeling all the relevant_features on a genome_sequence at minimum this should include coordinates of predicted coding_regions and their putative products but it is desirable to go beyond this to non_coding signal_peptides and so on there are various online annotation servers the ncbi provides a prokaryotic_genomes automatic annotation_pipeline service via email with a turn around time measured in days rast is a web_server for annotating bacterial and archaeal genomes that provides annotation results in under a day and xbase does similar in a few hours these classes of tools are valuable but they are not useful where throughput or privacy is critical here we present prokka a command_line software_tool that can be installed on any unix system prokka coordinates a suite of existing software_tools to achieve a rich and reliable annotation of genomic bacterial sequences where possible it will exploit multiple processing cores and a typical bacterial_genome can be annotated in min on a quad core desktop computer it is well suited to iterative models of sequence_analysis and integration into genomic software pipelines prokka was designed to be both accurate and fast to assess accuracy we compared the annotations of prokka rast and xbase for the highly curated escherichia_coli k genome all methods were told it was an e coli_genome shows that prokka produced an overall better annotation than both rast and xbase this result could vary for less well studied or draft_genomes prokka uses parallel processing to decrease running time on multicore computers the most time consuming steps are blast and hmmscan which both support multiple cpus natively however prokka is more efficient if it runs multiple single_cpu threads on subsets of the data which it achieves using gnu parallel experiments on our core amd opteron server on single genomes show linear speedup with up to eight cores and sublinear gain thereafter however for much larger bacterial meta genome datasets linear speedup is observed for many more cpus to annotate the e coli k genome on a typical quad core desktop computer takes about min the bold denotes the best performing tool column for that attribute row the italics are subsets of the total cds section ribosomal_rna rrna aragorn transfer_rna genes signalp signal leader peptides infernal non coding rna
