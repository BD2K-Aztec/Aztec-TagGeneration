sequence_analysis spliceseq a resource for analysis and visualization of rna_seq on alternative_splicing and its functional_impacts spliceseq is a resource for rna_seq that provides a clear view of alternative_splicing and identifies potential functional changes that result from splice variation it displays intuitive visualiza tions and prioritized lists of results that highlight splicing_events and their biological_consequences spliceseq unambiguously aligns reads to gene splice_graphs facilitating accurate analysis of large complex transcript variants that cannot be adequately represented in other formats availability_and spliceseq is freely_available atthe majority of human genes can express alternative transcripts as a function of tissue type developmental_stage or physiological context and aberrant_splicing patterns can lead to disease notably cancer nonetheless most analysis_pipelines remain tied to a one gene one protein one function model despite the incisive high_resolution data now provided by next_generation our web_based splicecenter resource provides the laboratory biologist with a user_friendly resource for visually analyzing the impact of splice variation on such technologies as reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr microarrays rnai and peptide agents however it does not provide tools for detailed analysis and visualization of the rich new data from rna_seq hence we have developed spliceseq to fill that gap several other analytical_approaches have been used to analyze the relative_abundance of various transcript_isoforms in a sample using the short_reads provided by rna_seq see e g those methods have generally predicted isoform_expression levels by making probabilistic assignments of reads to matching isoforms paying particular attention to reads that cross splice_junctions some also include inferences from paired_end insert length those approaches have delivered ground breaking results but there are limitations for example many rna_seq analysis tools lack detailed protein annotations that can identify functional_impacts of alternative_splicing most serious they do not readily handle genes with many densely_distributed alternative splice paths or splice events separated by more than the read_length or insert length of paired_end those difficult cases seemed rare when we originally explored transcript databases such as refseq but more comprehensive databases now show complex splicing patterns for the majority of multi exon genes in our own database of alternative_splice of human genes have multiple alternative splice events separated by bases the average paired_end insert length instead of probabilistically assigning reads across isoforms we base our analysis on splice_graphs splice_graphs with exons as nodes and splices as edges have been used previously in transcriptome_analysis for assembly of ests and short_reads we use them here because short_reads can be mapped unambiguously to the graph providing an intuitive composite view of alternative_splicing furthermore recursive graph traversal weighted by depth of read provides a prediction of the protein_sequences produced by the isoforms and uniprot annotations indicate functional_elements impacted by the splicing our initial_implementation of spliceseq includes only human genes and is designed to detect only known exons and splices however the algorithms are equally applicable to other species and can be extended to detect novel splice events those extensions are in development
