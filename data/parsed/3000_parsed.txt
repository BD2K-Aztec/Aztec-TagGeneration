systems_biology mirror a combinatorial analysis web_tool for ensembles of micrornas and their targets the mirror application provides insights on microrna mirna regulation it is based on the notion of a combinatorial regulation by an ensemble of mirnas or genes mirror integrates predictions from a dozen of mirna resources that are based on complementary algorithms into a unified statistical_framework for mirnas set as input the online tool provides a ranked_list of targets based on set of resources selected by the user according to their significance of being coordinately_regulated symmetrically a set of genes can be used as input to suggest a set of mirnas the user can restrict the analysis for the preferred tissue or cell_line mirror is suitable for analyzing results from mirnas profiling proteomics and gene_expression arrays recent mirna discovery techniques confirmed the presence of hundreds of mirnas in healthy and diseased tissues currently approximately mirnas are reported in human and approximately in mouse it was shown that mirna_binding are not confined solely to untranslated_regions utrs but also are found in coding_regions and introns furthermore multiple features were shown to be imperative in regulation by mirnas this led to a growing number of resources and algorithms that predict the pairing of mirnas and their targets currently mirbase is the most exhaustive collection of mirnas with over approximately mature mirna sequences mirbase collection is based on microcosm algorithm additional exhaustive mirna_targets predictors include targetscan and pictar other large_scale resources for micrornatarget pairing includes pita microrna org that is based on miranda algorithm diana microt mirdb and elmmo mirz for to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as a subset of mirnastarget pairs in vivo experimental_validation is available in tarbase database we have developed mirror an interactive tool for analyzing experimental_results under the notion of coordination in mirnas regulation a coordinated regulation by several mirnas was proposed see discussion for a set of mirnas mirror outputs a ranked_list of gene_targets according to their likelihood to be targeted by the mirna ensemble and vice_versa for a set of regulated_genes mirror converts all predictor resources results into a unified platform by incorporating a statistical measure according to the hypergeometrical distribution for example in mirnas overexpressing experiments in human cells genes mir and genes mir were downregulated and were used as input for mirror the original mirnas were identified as the top candidates with a p value e and with of the genes marked as targets for the relevant mirna similar_results by using only of the gene_lists supporting the robustness of the mirror platform
