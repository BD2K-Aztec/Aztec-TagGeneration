systems_biology a novel bi level meta_analysis approach applied to biological_pathway analysis motivation the accumulation of high_throughput data in public_repositories creates a pressing need for integrative_analysis of multiple datasets from independent experiments however study heterogeneity study bias outliers and the lack of power of available methods present real challenge in integrating genomic_data one practical drawback of many p value based meta_analysis methods including fishers stouffers minp and maxp is that they are sensitive to outliers another drawback is that because they perform just one statistical_test for each individual experiment they may not fully_exploit the potentially large number of samples within each study results we propose a novel bi level meta_analysis approach that employs the additive method and the central_limit within each individual experiment and also across multiple experiments we prove that the bi level framework is robust against bias less sensitive to outliers than other methods and more sensitive to small changes in signal for comparative_analysis we demonstrate that the intra experiment analysis has more power than the equivalent statistical_test performed on a single large experiment for pathway analysis we compare the proposed_framework versus classical meta_analysis approaches fishers stouffers and the additive method as well as against a dedicated pathway meta_analysis package metapath using samples from data_sets related to three human_diseases acute_myeloid datasets type_ii data_sets and alzheimers_disease datasets our framework outperforms its competitors to correctly identify pathways relevant to the phenotypes the framework is sufficiently general to be applied to any type of statistical meta_analysis with rapid advances in high_throughput the generation of various kinds of high_throughput is prevalent in most biomedical_research advanced_techniques in sequencing e g rna_seq mirna seq dna_seq and microarray assays e g gene_expression methylation have transformed biological_research by enabling comprehensive monitoring of biological_systems vast_amounts of data of all types have accumulated in many public_repositories such as gene_expression geo array express and the cancer_genome tcga http cancergenome nih gov gene_expression data as measured by microarray and high_throughput are particularly abundant in public_repositories such that many diseases are represented by half a dozen studies or more it would be tremendously beneficial if all datasets associated with a given condition could be analyzed together because of the increase in power expected to be associated with the much larger number of measurements in the combined dataset however batch_effects patient heterogeneity and disease complexity all complicate the integration of data from different sources indeed for the same disease different studies produce different sets of differentially_expressed de genes and we will show that this problem is not resolved at the systems level as pathway analysis results are often inconsistent as well meta_analysis techniques which are statistical_methods for the quantitative analysis of independent but related studies have already proven to be very useful for combining gene_expression studies and will be critical to decipher the biological_knowledge contained in vast_amounts of often conflicting studies independent of the data type in this manuscript we describe a novel meta_analysis and apply it to gene_expression data in the context of pathway analysis meta_analysis of gene_expression data has primarily been used for de gene detection early meta_analyses simply performed the intersection or union of de gene_lists obtained from individual studies resulting in a single list which is either too conservative or too inclusive respectively were among the earliest to apply sophisticated meta_analysis methods for de gene detection in their work p values from multiple prostate_cancer datasets were combined using fishers method since then other p value based meta_analysis methods have been applied such as stouffers method minp maxp weighted fishers method and latent_variable approaches a recent literature_review revealed that p value based meta_analysis for gene detection accounts for approximately twice as many studies as any other type of meta_analysis and is favored for its simplicity and extensibility therefore we will focus on this type of p value based meta_analysis investigate its limitations and address them with our new approach pathway analysis belongs to a family of statistical_hypothesis methods that have been developed to leverage molecular pathway_knowledge bases such as the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg or reactome these knowledge bases contain graphs that describe how genes interact together to accomplish specific biological_processes overrepresentation analysis ora gene_set gsea gene_set gsa and impact analysis draghicidra are examples of approaches designed to identify the pathways that are relevant in a given condition all of them take gene_expression changes and a list of pathways as input and produce a ranked_list of pathways along with their p values recently meta_analysis has also been used to combine multiple experiments at the pathway level the work in uses classical_methods such as fishers method and stouffers method to combine p values of pathways from independent studies the work in named metapath is a dedicated approach that performs meta_analysis at both the gene and pathway level separately and then combines the results to give the final p value and ranking of pathways for gene level analysis metapath calculates a t statistic for each gene in each study then combines them using the maxp method a pathway enrichment score is calculated using these genes for each pathway using a kolmogorovsmirnov test and assessed for significance with a sample wise permutation_test at the pathway level metapath calculates pathway enrichment for each individual study then combines the p values again using the maxp method finally p values from the gene and pathway level are integrated using minp to give the final p value and ranking of pathways one practical drawback of many p value based meta_analysis methods including fishers stouffers minp and maxp is that they are sensitive to outliers for example fishers method employs the log product of individual p values and thus a single p value of zero in one individual case will result in a combined p value of zero regardless of the other p values this can be a serious problem for pathway analysis methods that employ a finite number of iterations to construct an empirical distribution of a statistic which is then used to calculate an empirical p value if the observed value of the statistic is more extreme than any of the values obtained by the iterations such methods may report a p value of zero which will in turn dramatically influence the meta p value another drawback of most p value based meta_analysis approaches is that because they perform just one statistical_test for each individual experiment they may not fully_exploit the potentially large number of samples within each study a statistical_test which is not powerful enough to reject the null_hypothesis in one individual experiment can only derive power by amassing a large number of experiments low power in the case of a single experiment can be due in part to a mathematical design which favors a moderate number of samples but may fail to fully_exploit large_sample for example the basic t test is designed to do well even with a small number of samples in each group while the power of the t test increases as the number of samples increases a set of experiments with samples each has more power than a single experiment comprised of the same samples seein supplementary_materials here we propose a p value based meta_analysis framework which addresses the mentioned shortcomings and thus provides more reliable results as we will demonstrate the proposed method is not sensitive to outliers to gain power from the large number of samples within each experiment the proposed meta_analysis integrates multiple independent studies on two levels an intra experiment analysis and an inter experiment analysis first for each individual experiment the intra experiment analysis splits the dataset into smaller datasets performs a statistical_test on each of the newly created small_datasets then combines the p values next the inter experiment analysis combines those processed p values from each of the individual experiments we demonstrate the power of our bi level meta_analysis in the context of pathway analysis we illustrate our approach using one of the most popular statistical_methods for pathway analysis gene_set gsea applying it to kegg_pathways and public gene_expression conducted in independent laboratories from three conditions acute_myeloid datasets type_ii datasets and alzheimers_disease datasets we compare the result of the proposed_framework with three classical meta_analysis methods fishers stouffers and the additive method plus the standalone meta_analysis methodmetapath for all three conditions our framework outperforms other approaches and correctly identifies the pathways designed to describe the biological_processes responsible for these diseases in this article we present a novel meta_analysis approach that combines multiple studies to gain more statistical_power the new framework exploits not only the vast number of studies performed in independent laboratories but also makes better use of the results of combining gsea p values using meta
