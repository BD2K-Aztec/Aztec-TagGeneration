spmm estimating infection duration of multivariant hiv_infections motivation illustrating how hiv is transmitted and how it evolves in the following weeks is an important step for developing_effective vaccination and prevention_strategies it is currently possible through dna_sequencing to account for the diverse_array of viral_strains within an infected individual this provides an unprecedented opportunity to pinpoint when each patient was infected and which viruses were transmitted results here we develop a mathematical tool for early hiv evolution within a subject whose infection originates either from a single or multiple viral_variants the shifted poisson_mixture spmm provides a quantitative guideline for segregating viral lineages which in turn enables us to assess when a subject was infected the infection duration estimated by spmm showed a statistically_significant linear relationship with that by fiebig laboratory staging p among acutely_infected subjects our tool provides a functional approach to understanding early genetic_diversity one of the most important parameters for deciphering hiv_transmission and predicting the rate of disease_progression availability_and spmm webserver is available at http www hayounlee org web_tools html a genetic bottleneck during hiv_transmission has been reported in a number of studies comparing sequence_variants among transmission partners the hiv_transmission bottleneck has been recently linked to a fitness bottleneck preferentially transmitting high fitness viruses whereas a single strain infection is prevalent in heterosexuals intravenous_drug idus show a higher chance of being productively infected by more than one virus even within the same risk_category additional clinical_variables may create a significantly different transmission landscape which can in turn affect the frequency of multiple founder infections for example the presence of a genital infection may lead to a more permissive_environment for multiple founder infections early genetic_diversity typically associated with the number of transmitted strains has been shown as a significant indicator of hiv disease_progression greater diversity among the infecting virus population was correlated with an increased_risk ahigher steady_state level of hiv viremia and a faster cd t cell decline multiplicity of infection has been linked to increased transmission_risk therefore addressing the diversity of viral_variants at transmission is an important task that may help evaluate viral evolution and predict clinical_outcomes recent_advances in sequencing_technology provide an accurate representation of the hiv sequence population within an infected individual early hiv evolution has been quantitatively addressed accomplishing tasks such as identifying transmitted founder viruses estimating infection duration and calculating the rate and timing of the viral escape from the first t cell responses however success has been limited because current_tools have been specifically_designed for the analysis of infections originating from a single transmitted virus early viral diversity arising from multiple founder lineages should be interpreted with caution because viral diversity due to early random evolution is intertwined with sequence heterogeneity caused by distinct founder viruses tree based_methods have been useful for segregating viral_sequences into multivariant founder lineages here we develop an alternative framework to systematically estimate the duration of infection originating from multiple founders based on the characteristics of hiv_transmission and early evolution we use this tool called shifted poisson_mixture spmm to characterize early hiv evolution within acutely_infected subjects
