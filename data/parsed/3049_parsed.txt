modeling rna loops using sequence_homology and geometric constraints rna loop_regions are essential structural_elements of rna_molecules influencing both their structural_and we developed rloom a web_application for homology_based modeling of rna loops utilizing template structures extracted from the pdb rloom allows the insertion and replacement of loop structures of a desired sequence into an existing rna_structure furthermore a comprehensive database of loops in rna_structures can be accessed through the web_interface availability_and the application was implemented in python mysql and apache a web_interface to the database and loop modeling application is freely_available atloop structures i e regions without secondary_structure are not only essential structural_elements accounting for the flexibility and structural_diversity of rna_molecules they are also important functional_elements for example they frequently represent the site at which ligands are bound to the rna_molecule the lack of canonical base_pair formation in these regions makes them accessible for intra e g tertiary_structure contact formation and intermolecular contacts e g binding of small_molecules or other biomolecules the disparity between the number of available rna_sequences on the one side and experimentally_verified d structures on the other calls for an application of computational structure modeling to bridge this gap recently we reported results from a comprehensive survey of rna loop structures and established the basis for the application of homology_modeling to rna loops sequence similar loops were found to fold into very similar structures as a critical sequence_identity threshold beyond which this relationship no longer holds sequence_identity was determined here we present a web_based application for rna loop structure modeling utilizing available structures extracted from the protein_data pdb in contrast to the existing rna d structure modeling applications mc sym mc fold nast c s and farna das to whom correspondence should be addressed and and rna d structure databases rnajunction frabase and scor our approach is specifically tailored to the application to rna loop structures we reported rloom a structure modeling web_server for rna loop modeling based on sequence_homology and geometric constraints dictated by the site of insertion via anchor nucleotides the server uses loop templates extracted from experimentally_verified structures in the pdb a performed benchmark showed that homology modeling_approach as implemented in rloom yielded more accurate structural predictions than an ab_initio based modeling server the ifoldrna webserver for target_sequences with available sequencesimilar template structures for nine selected examples covering various loop sizes and types our homology based_approach yielded significantly better results as judged by rmsd than obtained by using ifoldrna cf supplementary evidently for target loop_sequences with no suitable structural example in the database no prediction can be made however with the structural database steadily growing this modeling gap is expected to shrink substantially over the coming_years rloom was designed to harness the wealth of structural_information already available for applications in rna modeling rloom is expected to find many applications in rna engineering and design
