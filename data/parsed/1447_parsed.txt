dlrs gene_tree evolution in light of a species_tree prime dlrs or colloquially delirious is a phylogenetic software_tool to simultaneously infer and reconcile a gene_tree given a species_tree it accounts for duplication and loss events a relaxed molecular_clock and is intended for the study of homologous gene_families for example in a comparative_genomics setting involving multiple species prime dlrs uses a bayesian mcmc framework where the input is a known species_tree with divergence times and a multiple_sequence and the output is a posterior_distribution over gene_trees and model_parameters availability_and prime dlrs is available for java se under the new bsd_license and jar files and source_code can be downloaded fromthe surge in bayesian phylogenetic_methods over the last decade can be attributed to their ability to achieve more realistic models as well as a solid track record for resolving outstanding biological issues recently the interplay between gene_family evolution and species phylogenies has gained particular attention partly owing to the information that gene_trees may confer on unresolved species relationships and also because it can shed light on orthology and paralogy of genes with sophisticated conventional phylogenetic_models burgeoning it is therefore not surprising that there is a growing interest to extend them to a setting entailing both gene_trees and species_trees by incorporating information on the species_tree prime dlrs significantly_improves on conventional species_tree unaware approaches when inferring gene_trees in a kerborg et_al the method was shown to be self consistent on artificial data generated in accordance with the model in the same article the significance of species_tree guidance and a relaxed molecular_clock was demonstrated on biological data utilizing a predicted whole_genome in yeast these findings have been further corroborated by the ability to classify syntenic one to one orthologs in drosophila supplementary_material unlike certain similar approaches that take the species_tree into consideration e g prime dlrs requires no a priori derivation of clock relaxation parameters and can be run on individual gene_families moreover as demonstrated in the supplementary_material by inferring and the model can provide estimates of genome_wide evolutionary duplication and loss rates the bayesian property of yielding a posterior_distribution not only implicitly brings forth a confidence measure on gene_trees but also provides an important step toward probabilistic orthology analysis when considering the reconciliation of the gene_trees with the species_tree and supplementary_material
