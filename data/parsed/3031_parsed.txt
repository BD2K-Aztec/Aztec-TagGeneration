gene_expression model_based of microarray_expression via latent gaussian_mixture motivation in recent_years work has been carried_out on clustering gene_expression microarray_data some approaches are developed from an algorithmic viewpoint whereas others are developed via the application of mixture_models in this article a family of eight mixture_models which utilizes the factor_analysis covariance_structure is extended to models and applied to gene_expression microarray_data this modelling approach builds on previous work by introducing a modified factor_analysis covariance_structure leading to a family of mixture_models including parsimonious models this family of models allows for the modelling of the correlation between gene_expression levels even when the number of samples is small parameter_estimation is carried_out using a variant of the expectationmaximization algorithm and model_selection is achieved using the bayesian_information this expanded family of gaussian_mixture known as the expanded parsimonious gaussian_mixture epgmm family is then applied to two well known gene_expression data_sets results the performance of the epgmm family of models is quantified using the adjusted rand index this family of models gives very good performance relative to existing popular clustering techniques when applied to real gene_expression microarray_data the epgmm family of models has been shown to give good clustering performance when applied to gene_expression microarray_data these applications concerning leukaemia and colon tissue data respectively were conducted as genuine clustering examples that is no information on the true tissue classification was used for parameter_estimation or model_selection in fact this information was only used to assess the performance of the selected model in this context the clustering performance of the epgmm family can be looked upon favourably moreover the performance of thethe epgmm family of mixture_models has been introduced and used for the model_based of gene_expression microarray_data this family of models is an extension of the pgmm family of models which in turn is an extension of the mixtures of factor analysers model the epgmm family of models are very well suited to the analysis of high_dimensional the reason for this suitability is fold first each member of the epgmm family has a number of covariance parameters that is linear in the data dimensionality second as shown herein the woodbury identity can be used to avoid the inversion of any non diagonal pp matrices leading to efficient computation thirdly as shown byin the context of the pgmm family these models are trivially parallelizable opening up the possibility of even more efficient parameter_estimation using parallel_computing the epgmm family was applied to two well known gene_expression microarray_data in both cases the epgmm family performed well and gave much better clusterings than several popular clustering techniques herein we took g for all of the analysis but future work will focus on the selection of g
