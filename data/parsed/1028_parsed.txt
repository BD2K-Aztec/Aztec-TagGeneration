structural_bioinformatics coarse_grained versus atomistic simulations realistic interaction free_energies for real proteins motivation to assess whether two proteins will interact under physiological_conditions information on the interaction free_energy is needed statistical_learning techniques and docking methods for predicting proteinprotein_interactions cannot quantitatively estimate binding_free full atomistic molecular simulation_methods do have this potential but are completely unfeasible for large_scale applications in terms of computational_cost required here we investigate whether applying coarse_grained cg molecular_dynamics simulations is a viable alternative for complexes of known structure results we calculate the free_energy with respect to the bound_state based on molecular_dynamics simulations using both a full atomistic and a cg force_field for the tcrpmhc complex and the mp p scaffolding complex we find that the free energy_barriers from the cg simulations are of similar accuracy as those from the full atomistic ones while achieving a speedup of fold we also observe that extensive sampling is extremely_important to obtain accurate free energy_barriers which is only within reach for the cg models finally we show that the cg model preserves biological_relevance of the interactions i we observe a strong correlation between evolutionary likelihood of mutations and the impact on the free_energy with respect to the bound_state and ii we confirm the dominant role of the interface core in these interactions therefore our results suggest that cg molecular_simulations can realistically be used for the accurate prediction of proteinprotein interaction_strength availability_and the python analysis framework and data_files are available for download at http www ibi vu nl downloads bioinformatics btt tgz proteinprotein_interactions ppi are at the heart of all processes in life to understand living_systems beyond the genome comprehensive_knowledge of ppi is therefore essential experimental_techniques prediction from sequence and proteinprotein_docking methods all have their specific limitations to assess the likelihood of two proteins interacting under physiological interactions we need to know both the concentrations and the dissociation_constant or binding_free of the proteins involved although it seems that the identification of the interface region is rather successful major open challenges are the accurate determination of interaction_strength the incorporation of protein_flexibility and accounting for water and small solute entropic effects most importantly kastritis andshow that there is a poor correlation between binding_affinity and scores for all nine commonly used docking algorithms they tested on complexes with known binding_affinity molecular_simulations using atomic pairwise interaction potentials are much more accurate for estimating interaction_strength than docking scoring_functions though computationally much more expensive nevertheless an immediate bonus of molecular_simulation is that it addresses all three challenges mentioned above interaction_strength flexibility and entropic effects for biomolecular simulation in general the solvent water is the major_obstacle to improve computational_efficiency due to the large number of water_molecules needed to solvate the protein many possible approaches to overcome this problem exist for recent_reviews see among the fastest available are the mean field or implicit_solvent methods however one of the main drawbacks is the lack of accurate estimation of the solute entropy especially in combination with charged solutes by lumping together small_molecules e g water_molecules or to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as molecular segments into meta particles coarse_grained cg force_fields retain the explicit description of the system including the solvent several cg models for water are available each with their particular strengths_and compared with atomistic force_fields cg models provide increased computational_efficiency at sufficient levels of accuracy therefore for the calculation of molecular_interactions thermodynamic integration based on atomistic simulations with explicit water is both theoretically well founded and the most accurate solution available to date in this work we investigate the option of addressing the high_computational of atomistic molecular_simulations by the use of a cg force_field for such simulations for this we will use the martini cg protein force_field for molecular_dynamics md_simulations this force_field was developed for cg simulations of biological membraneprotein systems and has recently been used to simulate the spontaneous association of gpcr proteins in a lipid_bilayer the martini force_field does not capture structural_rearrangements such as changes in secondary_structure we will assess its applicability and accuracy for the calculation of interaction strengths for a pair of protein_structures in a water_environment from constraint force profiles by applying the martini cg force_field we first show that we are able to estimate the free_energy with respect to the bound_state g off with similar accuracy compared with atomistic force_field calculations and in good agreement with experimental_data but at fold increased computational speed for this we selected two test cases a tcrpmhc and an mp p scaffolding complex both of which were previously studied with atomistic models respectively we then show that calculated contributions of surface_residues to the interaction_strength are sensitive to changes in the amino_acid involved random_mutations at the interface core yield major changes in calculated interaction strengths whereas mutations at the partially solvated interface rim yield only minor changes random_mutations at the rest of the surface on average hardly affect the interaction_strength at all moreover we find that the evolutionarily most likely mutations as assessed by standard residue exchange propensities at the interface core also have a negligible influence on the interaction_strength whereas evolutionarily unlikely mutations disrupt favourable ppi considerably this behaviour with respect to mutations is consistent with what we would expect from a biological point_of finally we discuss future implications of our finding that the major_contributions to the interaction_strength within our cg approach arise from the interface core
