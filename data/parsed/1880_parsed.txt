frameshift alignment statistics and post genomic applications motivation the alignment of dna_sequences to proteins allowing for frameshifts is a classic method in sequence_analysis it can help identify pseudogenes which accumulate mutations analyze raw dna and rna sequence_data which may have frameshift sequencing_errors investigate ribosomal frameshifts etc often however only ad_hoc approximations or simulations are available to provide the statistical_significance of a frameshift alignment score results we describe a method to estimate statistical_significance of frameshift alignments similar to classic blast statistics blast presently does not permit its alignments to include frameshifts we also illustrate the continuing usefulness of frameshift alignment with two post genomic applications i when finding pseudogenes within the human_genome frameshift alignments show that most anciently conserved non coding human elements are recent pseudogenes with conserved ancestral genes and ii when analyzing metagenomic dna_reads from polluted soil frameshift alignments show that most alignable metagenomic_reads contain frameshifts suggesting that metagenomic_analysis needs to use frameshift alignment to derive accurate results availability_and the statistical calculation is available in falpalthough the pairwise_alignment of dna and protein is a classical problem in bioinformatics it presents new challenges as next_generation ngs of dna supplants sanger_sequencing the per base error of sanger_sequencing is as low as but ngs can produce per base errors of ngs can also make frequent insertion and deletion errors e g sequencing in hiv produced occasional per base insertion and deletion error_rates of almost more recent sequencing methods such as pacbio also have high indel rates the insertion and deletion errors cause frequent frameshifts when dna is annotated by electronic translation and alignment to proteins this article studies the statistics of frameshift alignment a pairwise_alignment of translated dna and a protein with particular attention to frameshift errors frameshift alignment has been used for protein domain classification determining exact gene start position discovering distant protein homologies predicting exonintron structure and so on large post genomic_datasets require fast sequence comparison tools there are several tools that can compare dna_sequences with proteins including ncbi_blast usearch rapsearch pauda and ghostm but none of these consider frameshifts the fasta package has excellent support for frameshifts but is not designed for large searches such as whole meta genomes versus all known proteins last has supported frameshift alignment since and is designed for large searches we should also mention haxat which accurately aligns roche dna_sequences to proteins allowing for frameshifts but is not designed for largescale searches some studies have focused on developing frameshift alignment_algorithms few have focused on the accurate estimation of e values for frameshift alignment scores in alignments without frameshifts errors in approximate e values can usually be controlled with frameshifts errors are rarely controlled on one hand fastx y calculates alignment p values with z scores on the other hand blast tools comparing translated dna to protein do not consider frameshifts rather they consider six alignment reading frames calculating their e values as though only one reading_frame was explored with ngs supplanting sanger_sequencing the need for accurate frameshift alignment p values has increased because users require an e value accounting for frequent frameshifts to decide which sequences are true homologs the ascending ladder program alp was developed for real_time computation of the statistical parameters in blast it is based on an importance sampling method using a global_alignment of two simulated sequences generated by a markov_chain heuristic modeling of the ascending alignment scores of the global_alignment as a markov additive to whom correspondence should be addressed we presented a new program falp that assesses the statistical_significance of a frameshift alignment score in the algorithm section we assumed that a nucleotide insertion or deletion occurs only between two consecutive codons however falp can easily handle general error models because falp is based on a markov_chain simply we define insertion or deletion error events as markov states and add the corresponding markov states to the current seven states in the markov state_space we suggested a simple way of roughly annotating pseudogenes in a genome by frameshift alignment search of a protein database these annotations are highly informative even without tackling the hard question of distinguishing pseudogenes from real genes in particular these annotations overlap and explain most apparently conserved non coding elements this enables us to focus on the remaining unexplained conserved elements which are likely to have important biological_roles such as regulation on the other hand ultraconserved elements are not pseudogenessee the supplement we also analyzed one metagenomic dna dataset by alignment to known proteins and surprisingly found that most alignable reads exhibit frameshifts this fact testifies to the importance of analyzing such data with frameshift alignments some frameshifts might not be sequencing_errors but could indicate interesting evolutionary_events since frameshift alignment is rarely used we suspect that there is a lot to discover with it frameshift alignment may improve taxonomic identification of metagenomic_sequences that lack close_relatives in the database this is because protein is typically more conserved than dna and so frameshift alignment should be able to find more distant relationships than the usual dna level alignment it is also likely to improve gene prediction where it is critical to get the correct reading_frame this study demonstrates that statistically_rigorous large_scale frameshift alignment can be done easily and we hope it will encourage renewed interest in this powerful technique
