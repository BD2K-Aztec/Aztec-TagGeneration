genetics_and biogranat ig a network_analysis tool to suggest mechanisms of genetic_heterogeneity from exome sequencing_data recent exome_sequencing have successfully identified disease_causing sequence_variants for several rare mono genic diseases by examining variants common to a group of patients however the current data analysis strategies are only insufficiently able to deal with confounding_factors such as genetic_heterogeneity incomplete_penetrance individuals lacking data and involvement of several genes results we introduce biogranat ig an analysis strategy that incorporates the information contained in biological_networks to the analysis of exome_sequencing to identify genes that may have a disease_causing role we label all nodes of the network according to the individuals that are carrying a sequence variant and subsequently identify small subnetworks linked to all or most individuals using simulated exome_sequencing we demonstrate that biogranat ig is able to recover the genes responsible for two diseases known to be caused by variants in an underlying complex we also examine the performance of biogranat ig under various conditions likely to be faced by the user and show that its network based_approach is more powerful than a set cover based_approach availability we implemented our methods in java as biogranat ig a bundle within our biogranat graph analysis and visualization_tool www biogranat org improvements in sequencing_technology have made sequencing the entire human exome both practical and affordable this has led to considerable successes in the identification of diseasecausing sequence_variants for several rare mendelian_diseases such as kabuki_syndrome and hajducheney syndrome typically whole_exome is undertaken for a small number of patients comparison with a reference_genome yields for each individual a list of genes carrying sequence_variants these lists are filtered by removing for example genes in which all mutations are predicted to be without severe impact on protein_function in which mutations occur too frequently relative to the prevalence of the disease or in which no mutations were observed when sequencing affected relatives finally the filtered lists can be inspected to find their intersection in the best cases only one remaining gene is shared between all affected_individuals becoming a natural candidate for experimental follow_up studies for examples see and the review paper however depending on the disease one might not observe any genes in the intersection of the filtered lists one phenomenon that can cause this is genetic_heterogeneity where one phenotypic outcome results from any one of a number of possible mutations possibly in different loci an example would be two genes that are functionally_related through their protein products both playing a critical role in some cellular function and such that a mutation in either gene leads to the failure of that function one possible way to deal with this problem would be to look for the smallest set of genes such that all individuals carry a sequence variant in the set this frames the problem as one of minimal set cover and will not guarantee any biological meaning or functional relatedness for the set of genes found instead in this article we present biogranat ig biogranat individuals grouping a tool that uses the additional structure found in biological_networks to analyse sequence_data for multiple_individuals and suggest possible sources of genetic_heterogeneity biological_networks connect genes or proteins for which a functional relationship is knownor predictedto exist these networks can be represented as graphs for example an edge in a proteinprotein_interaction graph connects two nodes genes where the proteins coded by those genes interact other possible graphs might connect genes based on co expression genomic location or cell_signalling text_mining of published_literature or integrated evidence for interaction based on several of the above measures several tools such as genemania and string exist that use biological_networks to suggest additional functionally_related for a given input gene_list conversely our tool will use the networks to focus on which of the input genes are likely to be causative and provide a relatively short list of candidate_genes for follow_up study to whom correspondence should be addressed the premise behind biogranat ig is that if a disease has an underlying mechanism of genetic_heterogeneity the genes involved may be functionally_related and therefore closely connected in a biological_network if not directly connected they might be interacting with one or more common neighbours to identify disease gene_candidates given a number of individuals and for each individual a list of genes with sequence_variants filtered as described above we mark each node in our network with the individuals who carry a mutant version of that gene subsequently we seek the smallest connected subnetwork marked with all individuals our network thus consists of marked nodes representing genes where a sequence variant was observed in some individual and empty nodes where no mutation was observed for any individual as an additional constraint on the subnetwork we seek we require that each marked node is connected to another marked node via at most one empty node that is the subnetwork is allowed to incorporate jumps of one empty node but not more see the rationale underlying this is that biological_networks tend to exhibit the small_world phenomenon meaning that the average path_length between any two nodes is short typically four to six edges we are therefore interested only in localized connections and allowing too many empty nodes into our subnetwork could reduce the chance of it having any biological meaning this constraint allows a computationally_efficient implementation making it possible to run biogranat ig on large sets of permuted data to establish statistical_significance we will present the methods implemented by biogranat ig and demonstrate the validity of our approach using simulated exome sequence output we then analyse the performance of the tool under various conditions before considering the outstanding challenges of this approach to our knowledge biogranat ig is the first tool developed to tackle the problem of finding disease_causing from exomesequence data for mendelian_diseases with heterogenetic background while finding dysregulated subgraphs is an intensively_studied problem few approaches consider data for individuals separately rather most approaches work with summary_statistics notably approaches by degas and keypathwayminer use differential_expression data for individuals to find subnetworks containing genes_differentially in patients versus controls while for differential_gene data one usually expects to find clusters of co expressed functionally_related our problem differs because we expect all individuals to carry only a limited number probably less than tens of disease_causing hidden among a large number hundreds of variants not related to the disease of interest therefore the problem addressed by keypathwayminer and degas is similar to the problem we address here in general but there are important differences in the detail that have an impact on the algorithm design the dapple tool prioritizes genes in genomic_regions associated with a disease using a network based_approach conceptually related to biogranat ig however dapple is designed to improve understanding of disease associated loci and is not readily_applicable to the sequencing problem we describe in this section we firstly demonstrate that the principle underlying biogranat ig is sound and that the program produces valid results using two diseases known to have a basis of genetic_heterogeneity we show that biogranat ig can recover the genes responsible for acne inversa ai andpseudohypoaldosteronism type i pha i using simulated exome_sequencing we then examine the performance of biogranat ig under various conditions including the nature of the underlying_disease complex and the amount and quality of input_data all testing has been performed on a human proteinprotein_interaction huppi derived as described earlier by integration of data from six public_databases it is undirected self loops have been removed and each interaction has been reported in two or more scientific_publications seefor network_properties the choice of network to use with biogranat ig as with other network based analysis methods involves consideration of competing factors there is typically a trade_off between network coverage number of genes represented in the network and the degree of confidence that can be placed on network interactions the choice of network will also be influenced by whether a particular type of genetic mechanism is predicted and by the sequence_data available when sequencing small groups of affected_individuals it makes sense to run biogranat ig on smaller high_quality networks initially this minimizes the risk of connecting the individuals using falsepositive connections as would be more likely in a larger network and proceed to larger_networks if no positive results are found smaller networks also have the added advantage of reduced computation time the huppi network is a high_confidence network but note that the tests on simulated ai and pha i data were repeated in a range of other networks of varying_size with comparable results see the supplementary_material for additional results
