genome_analysis tssi an r package for transcription_start identification from mrna tag data high_throughput has become an essential experimental approach for the investigation of transcriptional_mechanisms for some applications like chip_seq several approaches for the prediction of peak locations exist however these methods are not designed for the identification of transcription_start tsss because such datasets contain qualitatively different noise in this application note the r package tssi is presented which provides a heuristic framework for the identification of tsss based on mrna tag data probabilistic assumptions for the distribution of the data i e for the observed positions of the mapped_reads as well as for systematic errors i e for reads which map closely but not exactly to a real tss are made and can be adapted by the user the framework also comprises a regularization procedure which can be applied as a preprocessing_step to decrease the noise and thereby reduce the number of false predictions availability the r package tssi is available from the bioconductor web sitehigh throughput sequencing has become an essential experimental approach to investigate genomes and transcriptional processes the core of most applications is a peak finding algorithm which is required to identify regions of interest these algorithms are designed application specifically because the requirements depend on characteristics of the measurements as well as on the questions of interest while cdna sequencing rna_seq using random priming and or fragmentation of cdna will result in a shallow distribution of reads typically biased toward the end approaches like capcapture enrich ends of mrnas and result in distinguishable peaks around the transcription_start s tsss similar methods to whom correspondence should be addressed can also be applied to specifically target ends of mrnas the resolution and utility of the multitude of end tagging methods have been tremendously increased in recent_years by the application of next_generation which allow or digital gene_expression at genome_scale when applied to sequencing of dna_fragments isolated by immunoprecipitation chip_seq broad and almost unimodal densities without gaps are obtained around a target_position which depending on the protein used for immunoprecipitation usually represents a transcription_factor or provides insight into chromatin_structure for such applications several approaches have been proposed although benchmark problems show that these algorithms still work insufficiently in some cases references are provided in the supplementary_material predicting the location of tsss is complicated by the possible existence of an unknown number of multiple alternative tsss furthermore the transcription of many genes in eukaryotic_genomes is initiated at not well defined sharp or peaked sites but in more fuzzily defined broad transcription start regions see references in the supplementary_material in addition as illustrated in the measurements typically contain background reads i e false_positives not originating from real tsss therefore only the counts which are significantly_larger than an expected number of background reads are intended to be predicted as tsss the end tag data used as a test_set for our study see section comprises reads mapping to genomic positions this vastly exceeds the expected number of tsss indicating the existence of reads not originating from real tsss such reads cluster to certain genomic positions i e the level of background_noise seems to be proportional to proximate measurements yielding false_positive reads preferably in regions of transcriptional_activity it is yet unclear whether these are artifacts introduced from the experimental_procedure or whether there is a biological meaning to this noise as currently there is no error_model available describing such noise an heuristic approach is introduced for an automated and flexible prediction of tsss in the following
