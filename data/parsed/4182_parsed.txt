semi_automated ontology generation within obo edit motivation ontologies and taxonomies have proven highly_beneficial for biocuration the open biomedical ontology obo_foundry alone lists over ontologies mainly built with obo edit creating and maintaining such ontologies is a labour_intensive difficult manual process automating parts of it is of great_importance for the further development of ontologies and for biocuration results we have developed the dresden ontology generator for directed_acyclic dog dag a system which supports the creation and extension of obo ontologies by semi automatically generating terms definitions and parentchild relations from text in pubmed the web and pdf repositories dog dag is seamlessly integrated into obo edit it generates terms by identifying statistically_significant noun phrases in text for definitions and parentchild relations it employs pattern based web searches we systematically evaluate each generation step using manually validated benchmarks the term generation leads to high_quality terms also found in manually created ontologies up to of definitions are valid and up to of childancestor relations can be retrieved there is no other validated system that achieves comparable results by combining the prediction of high_quality terms definitions and parentchild relations with the ontology editor obo edit we contribute a thoroughly validated tool for all obo ontology engineers availability dog dag is available within obo edit atthe advent of controlled_vocabularies used for gene_product annotation has had a deep impact on life_science research since it was a prerequisite for the analysis of high_throughput and the cross_referencing between databases of different model_organisms and different types of data successful vocabularies in the life_sciences range from formal ontologies defined in description logics such as snomed_ct via directed_acyclic representing is a and part of relations such as the gene_ontology go to hierarchical terminologies which define narrower and broader terms such as mesh over the past_years numerous ontologies have been created as evidenced by over ontologies listed by the open biomedical ontology obo_foundry creating ontologies is a labour_intensive difficult manual process which is supported by dedicated ontology editors such as protgand obo edit to whom correspondence should be addressed recently there have been efforts to alleviate these difficulties through text_mining which comprises a host of techniques from natural_language to statistics one such system is the protg plug in termine which suggests terms by analyzing the frequencies of word tuples in a text for a given query overall text_mining has to address three problems to support ontology creation and extension i generation of relevant ontology_terms ii their definitions and iii relationships between them tables summarize the current state of the art for these three problems shows that a number of systems have integrated linguistic and statistical filtering with machine_learning achieving either high_precision or recall shows the success_rates of definition generation systems in particular the definitional question answering task in the trec information_retrieval competition serves as a good evaluation benchmark existing_systems achieved success_rates of over the most difficult problem is taxonomy induction since it requires the identification of entities and their relations in text shows recent results with success_rates usually besides evaluating ontology creation against benchmarks one can assess how well semi_automated ontology creation and extension adheres to design_guidelines as put forward among others by this article is organized as follows first we introduce dog dag the first tool for ontology generation within obo edit second we introduce the approach and system and then evaluate the quality of term definition and relationship generation finally we discuss how the system supports the design_guidelines inand its limits
