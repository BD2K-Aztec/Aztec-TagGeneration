data_and semmeddb a pubmed scale repository of biomedical semantic predications effective access to the vast biomedical knowledge present in the scientific_literature is challenging semantic relations are increasingly used in knowledge_management applications supporting bio medical_research to help address this challenge we describe semmeddb a repository of semantic predications subjectpredi cateobject triples extracted from the entire set of pubmed citations we propose the repository as a knowledge resource that can assist in hypothesis_generation and literature based discovery in biomedicine as well as in clinical_decision support availability_and the semmeddb repository is available as a mysql_database for non commercial use at http skr nlm nih gov semmeddb an umls metathesaurus license is required contact scientific_discoveries depend on synthesis of knowledge from the literature and generation of novel hypotheses for testing in biomedicine the overwhelming size of literature makes_it for researchers to identify promising new avenues which may involve insights from seemingly unrelated subfields of the domain large_scale information_extraction in the form of semantic relations is increasingly proposed for advanced knowledge_management and discovery systems in this note we describe semmeddb a repository of semantic predications extracted from the titles_and of all pubmed citations by semrep a rule_based semantic interpreter elements of semantic predications are drawn from the unified_medical umls knowledge sources the subject and object pair corresponds to metathesaurus concepts and the predicate to a relation type in an extended version of the semantic network for example semrep extracts the predication infection causes guillain_barre from the sentence infections can trigger gbs by normalizing the free_text describing a relation to umls domain_knowledge semrep provides the ability to combine and link knowledge from various sources as well as aggregate knowledge at pubmed scale semrep extracts predicate types largely relating to clinical_medicine e g treats diagnoses administered to process of substance interactions e g interacts with inhibits stimulates genetic_etiology of disease e g associated with causes predisposes and pharmacogenomics e g affects augments disrupts for a full list and descriptions of these predicate types we refer the reader to several evaluations have focused on different domains and linguistic structures results are summarized in numbers in the first column indicate the number of predications evaluated the semmeddb repository consists of information regarding semantic predications extracted from pubmed citations by preprocessing and stored for efficient access the repository underpins semantic medline http skr nlm nih gov semmed a web_application that incorporates pubmed based information_retrieval with semantic predications automatic summarization and visualization in this note we propose the repository as a stand alone large_scale knowledge resource that can be exploited independently of semantic medline with the ability to access the full extent of the repository the users can circumvent the search summarizevisualize model of semantic medline and apply advanced data_mining algorithms directly to support biomedical_research as well as clinical practice for hypothesis_generation and literature based discovery we described the semmeddb repository which makes the semantic content of all pubmed citations as extracted by semrep available to the research_community the utility of the repository for hypothesis_generation literature based discovery and clinical_decision has so_far been demonstrated from within the semantic medline paradigm and independently given its scale and size this repository can further serve as the basis of advanced data_mining and assist in uncovering novel relationships in biomedicine
