sequence_analysis mtr taxonomic annotation of short metagenomic_reads using clustering at multiple taxonomic ranks motivation metagenomics is a recent field of biology that studies microbial_communities by analyzing their genomic content directly sequenced from the environment a metagenomic_dataset consists of many short dna or rna_fragments called reads one interesting problem in metagenomic_data analysis is the discovery of the taxonomic_composition of a given dataset a simple method for this task called the lowest_common lca is employed in state of the art computational_tools for metagenomic_data analysis of very short_reads about bp however lca has two main drawbacks it possibly assigns many reads to high taxonomic ranks and it discards a high number of reads results we present mtr a new method for tackling these drawbacks using clustering at multiple taxonomic ranks unlike lca which processes the reads one by one mtr exploits information shared by reads specifically mtr consists of two main phases first for each taxonomic rank a collection of potential clusters of reads is generated and each potential cluster is associated to a taxon at that rank next a small number of clusters is selected at each rank using a combinatorial optimization_algorithm the effectiveness of the resulting method is tested on a large number of simulated and real_life metagenomes results of experiments show that mtr improves on lca by discarding a significantly_smaller number of reads and by assigning much more reads at lower taxonomic ranks moreover mtr provides a more faithful taxonomic characterization of the metagenome population_distribution availability matlab and c source codes of the method available atnew sequencing_technologies and the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing have boosted the development of metagenomics a new discipline that studies dna and rna_sequences sampled from genomic material present in a microbial_community metagenomics has gained popularity because it allows to whom correspondence should be addressed researchers to study the large amount of microbes that cannot be cultured and their role in the environment for instance in term of interaction with other organisms sequencing a sample produces a collection of dna or rna_fragments called reads belonging to the different genomes present in the sample a metagenomic_dataset is a collection of these sampled reads until recently shotgun sanger_sequencing was the main technology used in metagenomics producing reads of length ranging between and bp nowadays other less expensive technologies like roche and illumina platforms generate reads of bp and bp respectively such new sequencing_technologies produce very large_datasets containing short_reads computational_analysis techniques are indispensable to extract knowledge from these datasets in this article we focus on the taxonomic_assignment of very short_reads about bp to putative taxa taxonomic_assignment is a way to assess species_diversity and to understand what the different populations are doing it is also used for improving reads assembly computational_approaches for taxonomic_assignment can be divided_into two main groups composition based and similarity based composition based annotation methods cluster the reads according to their gc_content codon_usage and other oligonucleotide frequencies these methods cannot be directly applied to short_reads because of the local variation of nucleotides distribution across a genome moreover external environmental_factors seem to influence the gc nucleotide_composition of a community suggesting that it may be even harder to distinguish the reads of different organisms relying on gc_content similarity based taxonomic annotation methods assign reads to organisms or taxa using similarities of reads to reference_sequences of a given database similarity is usually measured by means of sequence_alignment tools like blast this approach is useful when most reads in the sample have significant similarities to reference_sequences from known operational_taxonomic the incompleteness of the information contained in reference_databases and the bias toward cultivable species constitute inherent_limitations of the similarity based_approach nevertheless similarity based techniques have beenfor all datasets a small percentage of reads had at least one highquality hit supplementary an expected phenomenon related to the incompleteness of the information contained in the database of reference these reads were selected for taxonomic_assignment we assessed comparatively the performance of lca and mtr with respect to the number of reads assigned and the taxa detected moreover we compared mtr and lca in term of their characterization of the taxonomic population_distribution at ranks order and genus for real_life datasets the characterizations were performed also at ranks phylum and class finally on simulated_datasets where the true taxonomic_assignment is known by construction we compared the quality of the assignments given by mtr and lca using taxon accuracy i e the percentage of taxa correctly_detected taxon sensitivity i e the number of taxa correctly_detected by the algorithm divided by the total number of true taxa and accuracy i e the percentage of reads correctly assigned results of our study on simulated and real_life datasets indicate that mtr is better than lca with respect to the number of assigned reads the total number of reads assigned increases as well as the number of reads assigned at lower ranks with respect to correctness of the assignment results indicate higher accuracy of lca however these results are computed on sets of different size where much greater sets of reads are used for computing accuracy of mtr therefore accuracy results should be interpreted with care for instance on the simulated metagenome m mtr assigns on the average more reads than lca at rank genus with a small loss of accuracy on the average accuracy reduction of mtr on m at rank genus is but the method assigns more reads than lca on m at rank genus mtr assigns more reads than lca with an accuracy
