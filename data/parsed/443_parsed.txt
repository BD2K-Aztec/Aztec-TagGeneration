application of the mafft sequence_alignment program to large data reexamination of the usefulness of chained_guide motivation large multiple_sequence msas consisting of thousands of sequences are becoming more and more common due to advances in sequencing_technologies the mafft msa program has several options for building large msas but their performances have not been sufficiently assessed yet because realistic benchmarking of large msas has been difficult recently such assessments have been made possible through the homfam and conttest benchmark protein datasets along with the development of these datasets an interesting theory was proposed chained_guide increase the accuracy of msas of structurally conserved_regions this theory challenges the basis of progressive alignment_methods and needs to be examined by being compared with other known methods including computationally_intensive ones results we used homfam conttest and oxfam an extended version of oxbench to evaluate several methods enabled in mafft a progressive method with approximate guide trees a progressive method with chained_guide a combination of an iterative refinement method and a progressive method and a less approximate progressive method that uses a rigorous guide_tree and consistency score other programs clustal omega and upp available for large msas were also included into the comparison the effect of method chained_guide was positive in conttest but negative in homfam and oxfam methods and increased the benchmark scores more consistently than method for the three datasets suggesting that they are safer to use availability and implementationa large number of biological_sequences have rapidly accumulated due to advances in sequencing_technology a multiple_sequence msa consisting of thousands of sequences is frequently needed e g but the calculation of such large msas is a challenging_problem mafft is one of the most popular msa programs and has several options for this scale data input however it is unclear which option should be used in such situations to answer_this solid benchmarks based on empirical data are critical recently a new benchmark based on real protein data conttest was proposed by a remarkable advantage of conttest is that it is directly linked to a v c the author published_by
