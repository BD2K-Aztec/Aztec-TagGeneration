systems_biology bayesian_network webserver a comprehensive tool for biological_network modeling the bayesian_network webserver bnw is a platform for comprehensive network modeling of systems_genetics and other biological_datasets it allows users to quickly and seamlessly upload a dataset learn the structure of the network model that best explains the data and use the model to understand relationships between network variables many datasets including those used to create genetic network models contain both discrete e g genotype and continuous e g gene_expression variables and bnw allows for modeling hybrid datasets users of bnw can incorporate_prior during structure_learning through an easy to use structural constraint interface after structure_learning users are immediately presented with an interactive network model which can be used to make test able hypotheses about network relationships availability_and bnw including a downloadable structure_learning package is available at http compbio uthsc edu bnw the bnw interface for adding structural constraints uses html features that are not supported by current version of internet explorer we suggest using other browsers e g google chrome or mozilla firefox when accessing bnw bayesian_network modeling has been successfully_applied to many biological_problems ranging from assessment of disease risk to identifying cellular_interactions that link genotypes with complex phenotypes however widespread use of bayesian_networks by biologists has been hindered by a lack of easy to use tools that can perform all of the steps needed to create a bayesian_network model and use it to make predictions in particular while several tools for bayesian_network structure_learning from data exist e g wilczynski they often require additional tools to make predictions with the models increasing both the learning_curve for inexperienced users and the time required to perform modeling in response we have created the bayesian_network webserver bnw to provide a web_based for comprehensive bayesian_network modeling bnw allows users to load a text_file containing a dataset identify the structure of the network that best explains the data perform parameter learning of the network and use the network to make predictions these predictions are a crucial step in bayesian_network modeling as they provide testable_hypotheses that can be used to assess model structures and fully understand the relationships between variables in the network for any node in the network and the value of k when identifying the k best network_structures additionally a drag and drop interface is available for incorporating prior_knowledge about interactions between variables in the network search in addition to banning or requiring specific interactions between pairs of variables users can assign variables to different tiers and then denote interactions that are allowed within and between tiers for example the variables in a systems_genetics dataset containing genotypes intermediate traits e g gene_expression and phenotypes can be assigned to tiers to require that networks begin with genotypes and terminate with phenotypes also shown on the structural constraint interface page is an estimate of the time required for structure_learning in bnw that is updated in real_time based on user settings and the number of nodes and samples in the network finally users can download a structure_learning package to more easily learn structures of larger_networks or larger values of k the output of the downloadable structure_learning package can be uploaded to the bnw web_site to visualize the network and make predictions
