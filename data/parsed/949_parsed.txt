data_and chemical rule_based filtering of ms_ms motivation identification of proteins by mass spectrometrybased proteomics requires automated interpretation of peptide tandem_mass spectra the effectiveness of peptide_identification can be greatly_improved by filtering out extraneous noise peaks before the subsequent database_searching steps results here we present a novel chemical rule_based filtering algorithm termed crf which makes use of the predictable patterns rules of collision induced peptide fragmentation the algorithm selects peak pairs that obey the common fragmentation rules within plausible limits of mass tolerance as well as peak_intensity and produces spectra that can be subsequently submitted to any search_engine crf increases the positive_predictive and decreases the number of random matches and thus improves_performance by in terms of pep tide annotation using search_engines such as x tandem importantly the algorithm also achieves data compression_rates of availability the matlab_source and a web_server are available at http hydrax icgeb trieste it crfilter identifying proteins from the mass_spectra of their proteolytic peptides has become a standard method for analyzing complex biological_samples in a typical experiment mass_spectra obtained via liquid chromatography_coupled ms_ms are compared with theoretical spectra derived from a sequence database in this work we address the filtering of preprocessed spectra which consist of a series of monoisotopic peaks that are characterized by their fragmentation mass m z ratio and their intensity the goal of filtering is to increase the quality of the data while reducing the size of the dataset under analysis because the analysis capacity of instruments is constantly increasing there is a growing need for fast and efficient filtering strategies briefly filtering_methods fall into two large categories spectrum filtering approaches and peak filtering approaches spectrum filtering approaches seek to identify low quality spectra based on their peculiar intensity or m z distributions and subsequently exclude these spectra from further analysis one general_strategy is to use peptide fragmentation rules to identify high_quality spectra there are many ways to incorporate peptide fragmentation rules into spectrum annotation and in a broad sense all de_novo algorithms and sequence tagging algorithms use fragmentation rules peak filtering approaches meanwhile seek to discard unwanted peaks from the spectra of a particular experiment such unwanted peaks are identified by their low_intensities and or by the fact that they do not obey the fragmentation rules of a given experiment although technically incorrect any peak that is deemed superfluous for a particular data_processing workflow can be discarded from the spectrum as noise for instance we can simply retain only the top most intense peaks or discard peaks with intensities of the maximum intensity a number of laboratories have reported on the use of such classical signal to noise filters that also reduce the number of peaks in a spectrum the advantage of noise filtering_methods is that they can produce cleaner spectra these can then be further analyzed with any search_engine however the signal to noise filters are typically equally destructive to all low_intensity peaks regardless of whether or not they follow the expected fragmentation rules to address this problem we developed a set of spectral processing filters designed to reduce the number of uninformative peaks in peptide fragmentation spectra the motivation is to use the chemical rules of gas_phase peptide fragmentation to produce filtered spectra which can then be further analyzed by any search_engine of to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com choice importantly the filters presented here remove peaks that do not form by ax cz pairs or are not separated by the mass of an amino_acid in contrast to spectrum filtering_methods that use related principles for controlling spectrum quality our strategy only discards peaks deemed to be uninformative rather than discarding entire spectra this peak by peak strategy has negligible computational costs results in data compression_rates of and a substantial improvement in the number of the annotated spectra at the same false_discovery fdr level as compared with unfiltered data the article is structured as follows section_describes the data and the general computational_methods section_describes the results i e the principle the algorithm and the tests conducted on the method and section contains the discussion and conclusions we have developed a spectrum filtering method based on the gas_phase chemistry of peptide fragmentation and we therefore refer to this strategy as crf the main goal of this filtering strategy is to enrich for peaks that most search_engines recognize as coming from fragmented peptides we have used a series of rules one based on finding by complementary pairs one based on finding peaks separated by the mass of an amino_acid amino_acid neighbors and a third one that is a combination of the first two we found that crf filtering improves peptide annotation by at the same fdr level and provides an compression of the data we have tested the crf on data collected with maldi_tof ion_trap and orbitrap ion_trap hybrid instruments we have found that the crf approach also improves the search_engine performance with respect to these data however data compression and search_engine performance gains with ion trapthe numbers represent the number of the identified spectra or the number of the identified unique peptide_sequences as indicated at fdr
