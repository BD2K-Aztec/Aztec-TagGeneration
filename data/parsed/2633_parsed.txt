karect accurate correction of substitution insertion and deletion errors for next_generation next_generation generates large_amounts of data affected by errors in the form of substitutions insertions_or of bases error_correction based on the high coverage_information typically improves de_novo most existing_tools can correct substitution_errors only some support insertions_and but accuracy in many cases is low results we present karect a novel error_correction technique based on multiple_alignment our approach supports substitution insertion and deletion errors it can handle non uniform coverage as well as moderately covered areas of the sequenced_genome experiments with data from illumina flx and ion_torrent sequencing_machines demonstrate that karect is more accurate than previous methods both in terms of correcting individual bases errors up to increase in accuracy gain and post de_novo assembly_quality up to increase in nga we also introduce an improved framework for evaluating the quality of error_correction availability_and karect is available at http aminallam github io karect next_generation ngs_technologies generate at decreasing costs large_amounts of data for tasks such as de_novo resequencing single_nucleotide discovery dnaprotein interaction discovery and identification of chromosomal_rearrangements reads produced by ngs_technologies suffer from sequencing_errors in the form of substitutions insertions_and of bases which complicate further processing summarizes the types of errors in recent ngs_technologies error_correction methods utilize the high data coverage to correct the erroneous bases in reads existing_methods are classified in five categories i k spectrum based_methods such as lighter blue trowel hector bless musket reptile quake hammer and the works ofthat decompose reads into the set of all k_mers error_correction is based on the k_mer frequencies variants of these methods are used as preprocessing stages in several assemblers such as soapdenovo allpaths_lg sga and spades suffix_array tree based_methods such as shrec hshrec and hitec are generalizations of k spectrum methods that support multiple k values they build a suffix_array tree of all read suffixes and correct errors using the k_mer frequency weights associated with the suffix_tree nodes whereas racer is based on the same concepts without explicitly using a suffix_array fiona utilizes partial suffix_trees along with statistical_methods iii multiple_sequence msa based_methods consider each read r as reference and perform multiple_alignment of reads that share at least one k_mer with r coral creates a consensus_sequence after each alignment with r dagcon uses a directed_acyclic instead of a consensus_sequence echo computes consensus bases expectation_maximization that by performing pairwise_alignment among reads sharing at least one k_mer muffinkmeans groups reads based on spectral clustering before applying msa iv filtering_methods such as diginorm exclude a substantial number of reads classified as erroneous based on k_mer frequencies v hybrid methods such as lordec proovread lsc and pbcr specifically target the correction of pacific_biosciences reads which are very long and chimeric using illumina_reads read_error has two major key_challenges i correcting reads associated with low covered regions of the genome reads having high_error and reads that can be mapped to inexact repeat regions ii handling insertion and deletion errors most methods consider only substitution_errors at the time of writing this article blue fiona hector muffinkmeans dagcon coral and hshrec support insertion and deletion errors the current_implementation of bless supports substitution_errors only hybrid methods target specifically pacific_biosciences reads this is important since sequencing_machines that produce long_reads which are useful for obtaining high_quality assemblies suffer from such errors we propose karect kaust assembly read_error tool karect belongs to the msa category it considers each read r as reference performs multiple_alignment for a set of reads similar to r and stores the accumulated results in a partial order graph pog compared with existing_approaches karect introduces novel methods to select an optimized set of reads similar to r represent reads in the graph compute weights for the graph edges and construct corrected reads karect has the following advantages i it supports substitution_errors called mismatches insertion and deletion errors called indels and is compatible with most ngs_technologies ii it is fast supports parallel execution on multi core cpus and can work with limited memory iii it is effective against low coverage regions high_error regions and inexact repeat regions iv experiments on data from several genomes sequenced by various sequencing_technologies show that karect consistently outperforms existing techniques in terms of both individual bases error_correction up to increase in accuracy gain and post de_novo assembly_quality up to increase in nga this article also introduces an improved framework for evaluating the quality of error_correction methods we compare the error_correction quality of karect against the state_ofthe tools for substitution_errors namely lighter trowel bless musket racer sga quake reptile and diginorm we also compare against the top performing tools that support insertion and deletion errors namely blue fiona dagcon coral muffinkmeans and hshrec we employ a linux machine with core intel cpus at ghz and gb ram we presented karect a novel error_correction technique for ngs_data karect is based on multiple_alignment supports substitution insertion and deletion errors and handles effectively non uniform coverage as well as moderately covered areas extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that karect achieves superior error_correction compared to existing state of the art methods karect also enables substantially improved assemblies when used as preprocessing_step for modern assemblers currently we do not support pacific_biosciences data because of chimeric reads we are working on this issue
