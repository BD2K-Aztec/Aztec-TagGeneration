data_and phasetank genome_wide computational_identification of phasirnas and their regulatory cascades emerging evidence has revealed phased sirnas phasirnas as important endogenous regulators in plants however the integrated prediction_tools for phasirnas are still limited in this article we introduce a stand alone package phasetank for systematically characterizing phasirnas and their regulatory_networks i it can identify phasirnas tasirnas functional cascades mirna phasirna phas loci phasirna target with high_sensitivity ii by one command analysis it generates comprehensive annotation and quantification of the predicted phas genes from any given sequences iii phasetank has no restriction with regards to prior information of sequence_homology of unrestricted organism origins availability_and phasetank is a free_and tool the package is available at http phasetank sourcesecondary phased sirnas phasirnas play crucial roles in post_transcriptional regulatory_networks in plants well characterized trans_acting sirnas as a special subgroup of phasirnas are initiated by mirna mediated_cleavage and converted to dsrna yielding sirnas in a nt phase currently eight tas loci have been identified in arabidopsis and tas is experimentally_validated to suppress the juvenileto adult transition moreover phasirnamediated regulation of nb lrr encoding disease_resistance proteins appears to be widespread in dicots however the significance and broad roles of phasirnas remain_unclear in plants next_generation provides a powerful_tool for genome_wide screening of phasirnas and several methods were proposed correspondingly however no methods could systematically identify phasirnas and their regulatory cascades and none reports the detailed annotation and quantification of candidate phas loci in this study we present a novel tool phasetank to identify phas loci which contains our new sights and also incorporates the advantages of the previous methods we propose that the relative small_rnas production rsrp of phas loci is higher than that of the transcripts processed by random cleavage inasmuch as the phas loci should generate considerable phasirnas to maintain their biological_functions in our method the phased ratio abundance and number of a phasirna cluster are considered as three main_contributors to score a candidate phas loci additionally phasetank could detect both triggered mirnas and phasirna targets for predicted phas loci therefore phasetank employs a new filter and scoring system to perform de_novo prediction of phas loci and their regulatory cascades on a genome_wide scale in conclusion our results demonstrate that phasetank is an effective and highly applicable tool for comprehensive annotation and quantification of regulatory cascades involved in phasirna pathways therefore phasetank would help to elucidate the function and evolution of this special class of small_rnas in land_plants
