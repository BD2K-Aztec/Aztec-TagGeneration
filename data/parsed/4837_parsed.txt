genome_analysis varb a variation browsing and analysis tool for variants derived from next_generation data there is an immediate need for tools to both analyse and visualize in real_time single_nucleotide insertions_and and other structural_variants from new sequence file_formats we have developed varb software that can be used to visualize variant_call files in real_time as well as identify regions under balancing_selection and informative markers to differentiate user_defined groups e g populations we demonstrate its utility using sequence_data from plasmodium_falciparum isolates comprising two different continents and confirm known signals from gen_omic regions that contain important antigenic and anti_malarial drug_resistance genes availability_and the c based software varb and user_manual are available from www pathogenseq org varb massively_parallel mps technologies are providing whole_genome data on organisms that cause or have disease these data are being used to catalogue genomic_diversity and in the context of research in humans inform genome_wide and fine_scale mapping projects the technologies are capable of sequencing a small number of human_genomes in a single run making high_throughput of human_genomes technically possible pathogen genomes are much smaller making them tractable for large genome diversity studies enabling the tracking of their evolution over time and space they are also more amenable for whole_genome association studies leading to the identification of variants associated with phenotypes such as drug_resistance to take full advantage of genetic_variation exposed by whole_genome across pathogen and other organisms the development of interactive analysis and real_time visualization_tools is essential the variant_call vcf has become the recognized data type for listing genomic_variants including single_nucleotide snps and insertions_and indels usually derived from processing alignment files the vcf format was developed by the genomes_project and has been adopted by large_scale genome_projects e g uk k dbsnp it facilitates multi sample curation and identification of snps short indels and other types of structural_variants and sample meta_data the software_suite vcftools implement utilities for processing files software to visualize vcf files is available but they perform limited or no population and statistical genetic_analyses in real_time directly from multi sample files new tools are urgently required because of the increasing use of mps technologies in genomic epidemiological_studies and the need to rapidly translate the sequence_variation into further experiments this need has motivated the development of an all in one variant browsing and analysis softwarevarb under a non random_process including directional_selection low negative_values or balancing_selection high positive values the population_differentiation fst measure is also implemented and quantifies allele_frequency differences between user specified populations with values ranging between no difference and complete differentiation it is possible to export the graphics and analysis outputs varb was developed using the qt cross_platform and user_interface framework qt project org the translation of sequence_variation into further laboratory experiments treatments and point of care interventions requires the ability to interrogate genomic_data varb processes files of vcf format displays the variants by position and quality as well as comparing them between groups to establish informative genetic_markers and regions under selection an advantage of the software is that it performs population and statistical_analysis in real_time and does not require calculations to be performed elsewhere we have presented data from pf isolates to demonstrate the utility of the software and highlighted regions with differing allele_frequencies that coincide with known drug_resistance loci e g pfcrt as well as known vaccine_candidates arising from considering regions under balancing_selection e g msp it is possible to process many hundreds of pf or smaller genomes e g bacterial simultaneously however to aid processing of numerous much larger genomes such as human the software is capable of reading in single chromosomes the modular computing architecture provides the flexibility to incorporate a number of extensions these include the capacity to process bcf bcf files reading in informative meta tracks e g genomic uniqueness calculating other population_genetic statistics and performing tests of association with a phenotype increased utility will also be possible through updates to the vcf format to identify and annotate variants of greater size such as large_deletions
