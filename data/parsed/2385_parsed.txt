improving compound protein interaction prediction by building up highly credible negative samples motivation computational_prediction of compoundprotein interactions cpis is of great_importance for drug_design and development as genome_scale experimental_validation of cpis is not only time consuming but also prohibitively_expensive with the availability of an increasing number of validated interactions the performance of computational prediction_approaches is severely impended by the lack of reliable negative cpi samples a systematic method of screening reliable negative sample becomes critical to improving the performance of in silico prediction_methods results this article aims at building up a set of highly credible negative samples of cpis via an in silico screening method as most existing computational_models assume that similar compounds are likely to interact with similar target_proteins and achieve remarkable performance it is rational to identify potential negative samples based on the converse negative proposition that the proteins dissimilar to every known predicted target of a compound are not much likely to be targeted by the compound and vice_versa we integrated various resources including chemical_structures chemical expression_profiles and side_effects of compounds amino_acid proteinprotein_interaction and functional_annotations of proteins into a systematic_screening framework we first tested the screened negative samples on six classical classifiers and all these classifiers achieved remarkably_higher performance on our negative samples than on randomly_generated negative samples for both human and caenorhabditis_elegans we then verified the negative samples on three existing prediction_models including bipartite local model gaussian_kernel profile and bayesian matrix_factorization and found that the performances of these models are also significantly_improved on the screened negative samples moreover we validated the screened negative samples on a drug bioactivity dataset finally we derived two sets of new interactions by training an support_vector classifier on the positive interactions annotated in drugbank and our screened negative interactions the screened negative samples and the predicted interactions provide the research_community with a useful resource for identifying new drug_targets and a helpful supplement to the current curated compoundprotein databases compoundprotein interactions cpis are crucial to the discovery of new drugs by screening candidate compounds and are also helpful for understanding the causes of side_effects of existing_drugs although various biological_assays are available experimental_validation of cpis remains time consuming and expensive therefore there is a strong incentive to develop computational_methods to detect cpis accurately meanwhile with the rapid_growth of public chemical and biological_databases such as the pubchem drugbank sider stitch string and gene_ontology go various kinds of resources including drug features such as chemical_structures side_effects and gene_expression under drug_treatments and protein features such as amino_acid proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks and functional_annotations become available to the research_community and consolidate the basis of computational cpi prediction traditional computational_approaches fall roughly into two categories structure based and ligand based the structure based_methods depend on the structural_information of target_proteins that are often unavailable for most protein_families ligand based_methods get poor_performance for those proteins having few or none of the known ligands recently a variety of machine learningbased methods have been proposed and achieved a considerable success by taking the viewpoint of chemogenomics which integrates the chemical attributes of drug_compounds the genomic attributes of proteins and the known cpis into a unified mathematical framework the main rationale underlying the chemogenomics approaches is that similar compounds tend to bind similar proteins so that the lack of known ligands for a given protein can be compensated by the availability of known ligands of similar proteins and vice_versa following the philosophy of chemogenomics many methods have been proposed by exploiting various types of features and classification algorithms with the chemical_structure similarity and protein_sequence similarity_measures bleakley andproposed the bipartite local model blm to infer cpis by training local support_vector svm classifiers based on known interactions vanproposed gaussian interaction profile gip kernels that exploit the topology of cpi networks however these methods still suffer from the lack of known interactions between the drugs and proteins of interest which often leads to the failure of prediction therefore improved blm by exploiting the known interactions of neighbors to compensate the lack of interaction information vanalso used the interaction profiles of weighted nearest_neighbors to improve the gip method instead of utilizing the attributes of drugs and proteins separately more and more researchers combined these attributes into a single feature_vector by the concatenation or tensor product operators and then built classifiers based on the integrated features and known cpis for example proposed svm classifiers with pairwise kernels that were derived respectively from similarity_measures of drugs and proteins proposed the bipartite_graph inference that maps drugs and proteins into a unified euclidean feature_space in which the distances between drugs and proteins linked by known interactions are minimized and otherwise maximized the network_based originally proposed for personal recommendation was also used to identify cpis other methods including kernel_based data fusion kernelized bayesian matrix_factorization with twin kernels kbmf k restricted boltzmann machine and semi_supervised methods were successively proposed in addition to chemical_structures and protein_sequences researchers also resorted to other attributes of drugs and proteins to reveal their interacting associations including the drug expression_profiles functional_groups and side_effects of drugs signaling_pathways and go annotations of proteins or even the combination of these attributes most previous_approaches used experimentally_validated cpis as positive samples and randomly_generated negative samples to learn the prediction_models however the randomly_generated negative samples may include real positive samples not yet known a classifier trained by using such randomly_generated negative samples may yield high cross_validation accuracy but very possibly has poor_performance on independent real test datasets screening highly_reliable negative samples is therefore critical to improving the accuracy of computational_prediction the importance of truenegative interactions was recently highlighted as one of the future_developments in predicting drugtarget_interactions motivated by this we set about to screen in silico highly credible negative samples of cpis an assumption underlying most computational_methods for predicting cpis is that similar drug_compounds are likely to interact with similar target_proteins our method is based on the converse negative proposition i e the proteins that are dissimilar to every known predicted target of a given compound are not much likely to be targeted by the compound and vice_versa we integrated various resources of compounds and proteins including chemical_structures chemical expression_profiles and side_effects of compounds amino_acid ppi_networks and go functional_annotations of proteins to a systematic_screening framework we evaluated our method on both human and caenorhabditis_elegans data we first tested our screened negative samples on six classical classifiers including random_forest l and l regularized logistic_regression naive_bayes svm and k nearest_neighbor knn all these classifiers achieved remarkably_higher performance on our negative samples than on randomly_generated negative samples we also verified our negative samples on three existing prediction_models including blm gaussian_kernel profile van and bayesian matrix_factorization and found that the performances of these models are also significantly_improved on the screened negative samples furthermore we validated our screened negative samples with a drug bioactivity dataset finally we derived two sets of new cpis by training an svm classifier on the positive interactions annotated in drugbank and our screened negative interactions these screened negative samples and the predicted interactions can serve the research_community as a useful resource for identifying new drug_targets and as a helpful supplement to the current curated compoundprotein databases
