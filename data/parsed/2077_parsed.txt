databases_and glycocd a repository for carbohydrate related cd antigens the open_access comprehensive glycocd database application is for representation and retrieval of carbohydrate related clusters of differentiation cds the main objective of this database platform is to provide information about interactions of carbohydrate_moieties with proteins that are important for identification of specific cell_surface molecule with a focus on the integration of data from carbohydrate microarray databases glycocd database comprises two sections the carbohydrate recognition cd and glycan cd it allows easy access through a_user to all carbohydrate defined cds and those that interact with carbohydrates along with other relevant_information availability the database is freely_available atthe clusters of differentiation cd antigens are cell surfaceexpressed antigens defined by monoclonal_antibodies the great value of the cd nomenclature validated and approved as part of the international_union of immunological societies nomenclature is to provide a unified system of classified antigens useful both for biomedical research_and the cd antibodies have been categorized during the past_years in human leucocyte differentiation antigens hlda workshops the cd antigens are expressed on human hematopoietic_cells t and b lymphocytes natural_killer myeloid_cells erythrocytes and platelets specific types of endothelial and epithelial_cells the information for cd antigens expands from cellular and tissue expression to biochemical structure genetic_background and to its functional impact in a given cellular_environment the interactions of the immune system are mediated by cell_surface and glycolipids most of the cd antibodies recognize the protein_moiety of surface membrane integral macromolecules but some of them detect oligosaccharide structures that are linked to either glycoproteins or glycosphingolipids during the hlda conference a separate workshop on carbohydrate and lectin cds was established considering the increasing interest and advance in research in unraveling cellular proteinglycan interactions the objective was to initiate a more comprehensive compilation of monoclonal_antibody defined carbohydrate structures and lectins differentially_expressed on human leucocytes and to provide an appropriate classification within the cd nomenclature some carbohydrate cd antibodies were re organized into subgroups of cds because of their reactivity with variations of certain oligosaccharide structures for example cd blood_group lewis x le x received_additional subgroups of cd s sialyl_lewis cd u sulfo lewis x and cd su sulfo sialyl_lewis cd was subdivided into cd a the oligosaccharide structure of the disialo ganglioside gd and related glycans cd b o acetylated sialic_acid gd and cd c o acetylated sialic_acid gd cd comprises lactosaminyl sequences into cd non sialylated lactosamines and cd s sialylated lactosamines the oligosaccharides of the cd s subgroup have a different functional impact as modulators of adhesion to certain lectins such as siglecs due to the high_complexity of oligosaccharide structures antibodies of a particular carbohydrate cd may bind to variations of the same oligosaccharide type and consequently display different cellular staining_patterns for instance this may be due to variations in the linkage of the terminal sialic_acid versus to oligosaccharide chains which extend the glycan epitope glycotope recognized by the respective antibody or by varying expression of the glycotope on different glycosphingolipids and or glycoproteins on a specific cell_type in general most carbohydrate cds define histo blood_group which are characterized either by their different fucosylation or sialylation this glycocd database now endeavours to provide in depth_information about glycan cd antigens and those cd defined surface receptors lectins which bind to glycan_structures
