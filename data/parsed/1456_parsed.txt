structural_bioinformatics dockafm benchmarking protein_structures by docking under afm topographs proteins can adopt a variety of conformations we present a simple server for scoring the agreement between d atomic_structures and experimental envelopes obtained by atomic force micros copy three different structures of immunoglobulins igg or blood coagulation_factor v activated were tested and their agreement with several topographical surfaces was computed this approach can be used to test structural_variability within a family of proteins availability_and dockafm is available at http two examples are presented in in the first case afm_images of single_molecules of antibodies were obtained the question asked to dockafm server was to show which known d structures of complete antibodies pdb codes for t shape igt y shape igy or intermediate hzh fit better the afm_images in the second case afm image of human blood coagulation_factor v activated fva was obtained to whom correspondence should be addressed because no complete structure of fva exists the question asked to dockafm is to show which of the three available model of fva fits better the afm image the three models used for fva are a comparative model fv a partial crystal_structure sdd and a more recent completed fva model which uses the c domains orientations according to the partial crystal_structure fva both afm_images were obtained on a multimode v microscope using the peakforce tapping mode in air bruker axs the igg image was scaled four times by linear_interpolation to a resolution of a px using gwyddion whereas the fva image was used at the raw resolution of a px for the docking a cubic matrix of nodes with a step of a and a favorable layer of a was used for igg whereas a cubic matrix of nodes with a step of a and a favorable layer of a was used for fva among the multiple individual_molecules on the afm_images several were cropped and selected each tested structure was docked individually in each crop image results for a single crop in both molecular_systems are shown in full information is available in supplementary_material supplementary figs s and s the output of dockafm is indicated in for each crop and for each structure docking energy and the offset relative to the center is given best docking solutions are highlighted in yellow first column docking solutions having acceptable offsets are highlighted in cyan second column i e those with a maximum deviation between the center of the docked molecule and that of the topographic image was of the image lateral size finally the most probable fitted structures are highlighted in green third column and correspond to those having the lowest energy with well centering into the topographic surface in the two cases presented here the structure igt is the most probable conformation found in the igg image whereas the model fv fits better the fva afm image show each individual topographic surface used for running dockafm b afm topographic surfaces used for docking protein_structures are shown in gray_scale as well as three different docked structures are shown for both igg and fva systems bottom side view c for each system the docking score as well as the shift of the docked structure from the center of the topographic surface are shown the most favorable structure is chosen as that having the smallest shift from the center counting most favorable structures is used for the benchmarking purpose of dockafm
