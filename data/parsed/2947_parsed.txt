data_and metriculator quality_assessment for mass_spectrometry quality_control in mass_spectrometry remains subjective labor_intensive and inconsistent between laboratories we introduce metriculator a software_designed to facilitate long_term storage of extensive performance_metrics as introduced by nist in metriculator features a web_interface that generates interactive comparison plots for contextual understanding of metric values and an automated metric generation toolkit the comparison plots are designed for at a glance determination of outliers and trends in the datasets together with relevant statistical comparisons easy to use quantitative comparisons and a framework for integration plugins will encourage a culture of quality_assurance within the prote omics community availability_and available under the mit_license atas omics level experiments increase in size and complexity assessing the quality of a dataset can be a laborious undertaking this is particularly true of mass_spectrometry ms based proteomics where the spectrometer and associated chromatography exhibit variableand sometimes erraticperformance researchers would like to analyze more samples and in greater_depth i e fractionation but maintaining high_quality across the setand knowing that the set is of high qualityis a mounting challenge in proteomics typically highly_trained technicians spend significant time adjusting capillary plumbing working to achieve stable nanoelectrospray and calibrating and tuning the mass_spectrometer the quality of a large analysis is then assessed by visual_inspection of the d or d ion trace assessing reproducibility is particularly challenging when datasets involve runs collected over a period of weeks or months furthermore human assessment of quality is both time consuming and a potential source of bias software_tools to aid in quality_assessment are needed and can improve confidence in published proteomic_datasets an extensive set of quality performance_metrics was introduced by nist to begin to assess data_quality in ms proteomics these metrics include measures of chromatographic performance ion_source stability ion signal_intensity and data dependent sampling efficiency these measures can significantly augment manual interpretation of data_quality but their utility depends on contextual comparisons between datasets comparing metrics over time is the key to leveraging them for quality_assessment subsequent work has attempted to expand metrics across vendor platforms and to provide curated metrics such as those demonstrated by quameter indicating the value of metrics to the proteomics community a similar suite of software_designed to monitor lock mass and quality_control evaluation at the instrument and identification level called simpatiqco was recently released it provides a similar web_based interface designed to assist instrument operators in monitoring quality_control samples yet it lacks interactive graphing and comparison capabilities which enable applicability to any questions of performance differences as well as augmentation to existent workflows additionally there is a commercial product massqc which provides a utility for submitting metric information for longitudinal comparison but does not provide automation there remains a need for an open_source configurable method for tracking and comparing performance_metrics as well as integration into a proteomics workflow
