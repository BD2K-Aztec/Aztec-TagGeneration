the chemical component dictionary complete descriptions of constituent molecules in experimentally_determined d macromolecules in the protein_data the chemical component dictionary ccd is a chemical reference data resource that describes all residue and small_molecule components found in protein_data pdb entries the ccd contains detailed chemical descriptions for standard and modified amino_acids nucleotides small_molecule ligands and solvent_molecules each chemical definition includes descriptions of chemical_properties such as stereochemical assignments chemical descriptors systematic chemical names and idealized coordinates the content preparation validation and distribution of this ccd chemical reference dataset are described availability_and the ccd is updated regularly in conjunction with the scheduled weekly release of new pdb structure data the ccd and amino_acid variant reference datasets are hosted in the public pdb ftp repository at ftpthe protein_data pdb is the single worldwide repository of information about the d structures of biological_macromolecules pdb structures of macromolecules and macromolecularligand complexes provide direct experimental insights into protein_function these structures provide_essential for the understanding of biochemical_processes and are critical data for structure_based studies pdb structure data are also central to the understanding the energetics of intermolecular_interactions among proteins and nucleic_acids structure classification and structure_prediction the knowledge obtained through the study of d structure data is key to deducing the role of a protein or nucleic_acid in human_health and disease to enable this rich interpretation of structural data requires accurate and consistent annotation of the chemical identities and nomenclatures for all of the constituent molecules in the pdb archive the individual monomers within a polymer individual ligands and solvent_molecules form the principal building_blocks or chemical_components within a pdb entry these chemical_components form the basis for the high_level macromolecular descriptions of which consists of organizations that act as deposition data_processing and distribution centers for pdb data the wwpdb partners are the rcsb_pdb pdb in europe pdbe pdb in japan pdbj and biomagresbank bmrb
