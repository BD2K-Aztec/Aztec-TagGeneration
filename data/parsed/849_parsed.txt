campways constrained alignment framework for the comparative_analysis of a pair of metabolic_pathways motivation given a pair of metabolic_pathways an alignment of the pathways corresponds to a mapping between similar substructures of the pair successful alignments may provide useful applications in phylogenetic_tree drug_design and overall may enhance our understanding of cellular_metabolism results we consider the problem of providing one to many alignments of reactions in a pair of metabolic_pathways we first provide a constrained alignment framework applicable to the problem we show that the constrained alignment problem even in a primitive setting is computationally_intractable which justifies efforts for designing efficient heuristics we present our constrained alignment of metabolic_pathways campways algorithm designed for this purpose through extensive experiments involving a large pathway database we demonstrate that when compared with a state of the art alternative the campways algorithm provides better alignment results on metabolic_networks as far as measures based on same pathway inclusion and biochemical significance are concerned the execution speed of our algorithm constitutes yet another important improvement over alternative algorithms availability open_source codes executable binary useful scripts all the experimental_data and the results are freely_available as part of the supplementary_material atmetabolic pathways consisting of metabolites biochemical_reactions transforming a set of metabolites to others and enzymes catalyzing these reactions provide_valuable regarding material processing centers of a functioning cell and cellular_metabolism in general several online_databases including kegg and biocyc provide access to metabolic_pathways of various organisms a comparative_analysis of pathways from different organisms provides insights for understanding evolution speciation phylogenic reconstruction and drug_target pharmaceutical drug testing is usually implemented on animals most of the time on mice before human testing in such an application it is usually crucial to know whether specific pathway_components of the two species exhibit similar properties a successful pathway alignment would prove useful for determining whether test results on one species could be transferred to another without incurring complications furthermore such an analysis is not limited to that between different organisms it may also be applied between pathways of cancer_types and those of healthy cell_types to enhance our understanding of cancer specific metabolic_features a common method for comparative_analysis of pathways and biological_networks in general is through network_alignment given a pair of biological_networks either from different species or from different tissues within the same species the goal of network_alignment is to map components in one of the networks to their similar counterparts in the other with regard to alignments targeting specifically metabolic_pathways several methods have been suggested in an alignment_method based on enzyme hierarchies and enzyme ec_number similarity was suggested for the alignment of possibly more than two pathways path matching and graph_matching to query certain metabolic_pathways in an input graph was provided by sets of reactions in multiple pathways were compared omitting the connectivity between the reactions in heymans and singh created an enzyme graph and obtained a one to one mapping between the enzymes of two input pathways via maximum_weight bipartite matching similar enzyme graph construction was used in an integer quadratic_programming based method was suggested by similar to metabolic_pathway alignment is the problem of proteinprotein_interaction ppi network_alignment the graph models used in the latter are undirected whereas the former usually aligns directed_graphs however as far as general graph_matching and alignment is concerned most of the time the techniques can be extended in both directions and mainly similar approaches are proposed two versions of network_alignment have been suggested in related work in local_network the goal is to identify from the input networks subnetworks that closely match in terms of network_topology and or sequence_similarities approaches proposed for this version of the problem include pathblast networkblast mawish and graemlin in global_network on the other hand the goal is to align the networks as a whole providing unambiguous mappings between the nodes of different networks starting with isorank several global network algorithms using similar definitions have been suggested we provide a constrained alignment framework and a metabolic_pathway alignment algorithm campways our algorithm is inspired by the model suggested in within this to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access

please_contact permissions_oup com general model the goal is to find a global one to many alignment of the pathways such that a node may be mapped to a connected subgraph of many nodes the model is justified by the fact that biologically_meaningful mappings may exist when different organisms perform the same function through varying number of steps therefore it appropriately handles the gaps mismatches inherent in alignment problems an issue arising in both sequence related and network wise alignment such is the motivation behind the ppi network_alignment approach of liao et_al as well although this general model of one to many alignments is the same our method diverges from that ofafter this point the novelties of the current work are fold first of all we provide a novel constrained alignment framework appropriate for the one to many alignments model this framework has not been used in biological network_alignment previously second we show that even the simplest version of the alignment problem within this framework is computationally hard based on this computational intractability result we finally provide a novel algorithm campways which appropriately and efficiently implements this framework through experimental_evaluations based on reverse_engineering pathways and biochemical significance measured through functional_group conversion hierarchy of kegg we demonstrate that the campways algorithm provides higher quality alignments than the state of the art approaches furthermore a second major advantage of the campways algorithm is in terms of its much faster execution speeds as compared with the alternatives
