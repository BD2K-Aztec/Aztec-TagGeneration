structural_bioinformatics exploring protein domain_organization by recognition of secondary_structure packing interfaces motivation protein_domains are fundamental units of protein_structure function and evolution thus it is critical to gain a deep_understanding of protein domain_organization previous_works have attempted to identify key_residues involved in organization of domain_architecture because one of the most important characteristics of domain_architecture is the arrangement of secondary_structure sses here we present a picture of domain_organization through an integrated consideration of sse arrangements and residue contact networks results in this work by representing sses as main_chain scaffolds and side chain interfaces and through construction of residue contact networks we have identified the sse interfaces well packed within protein_domains as sse packing clusters in total sse packing clusters were recognized from structural_classification of proteins domains of sequence_identity the similar sse packing clusters were observed not only among domains of the same folds but also among domains of different folds indicating their roles as common scaffolds for organization of protein_domains further analysis of small single_domain reveals a high correlation between the sse packing clusters and the folding nuclei consistent with their important roles in domain_organization sse packing clusters were found to be more conserved than other regions within the same proteins the d structure of a protein is crucial for understanding its physiological_function in living_cells since numerous efforts have been spent on determination of protein_structures and the number of proteins with known structure is increasing with an exponential speed by the end of over protein_structures have been determined and deposited in the protein_data http www rcsb org pdb given the complexity of protein_structures researchers have attempted to decompose them to compact and fundamental units so_called domains and thus several databases including cath and structural_classification of proteins scop have been generated to provide valuable resources for the understanding of protein_structure and function at domain level as the fundamental units of proteins understanding the organization of domain_architectures would deepen our insight into the relationship between protein_structure and function which could further facilitate protein_structure design and simulation previously a number of efforts have been devoted to identifying key_residues involved in organization of domain_architecture and these works could fall into two categories one was to identify a specific group of residues based on structural_features like hydrophobicity and compactness for example examined the compactness of hydrophobic clusters within proteins and revealed a certain correlation between the hydrophobic clusters and protein_folding units the other attempted to characterize domain_architecture by identifying tertiary packing motifs within domains based on geometric properties for example applied the delaunay tessellation to define the tetrahedral packing motifs within proteins and found the general repetitive tetrahedral packing motifs in protein tertiary_structures all of these works mainly focused on residuelevel contacts but they did not explicitly consider the important roles of sse packing in the organization of domain_architectures as we know one of the most important characteristics of domain_architecture is the spatial_arrangement of secondary_structure sse especially of these regular ones like helix and strand the sse arrangements have been well explored in many protein_families including helix_turn in a class of dna_binding called bzip family proteins four helix bundles present in many hormones and the rossmann fold unit present in nucleotide binding_proteins many works have been developed in mining sse motifs in protein_structures however most of them treated an sse as a to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as simplified vector representation and did not uncover the details of underlying residues mediating sse packing to gain a comprehensive picture of domain_organization our work integrated the previous_efforts at both residue_level and sse level by considering the sse interfaces as the basic units for packing of sses we first constructed an effective contact network among side_chains within a protein domain and then identified the well packed sse interfaces within the network as an sse packing cluster such sse packing clusters not only characterize the domain_organization but also shed lights into the molecular_mechanisms domain formation in this study through recognition of interfaces mediating sse packing we have attempted to identify the structural and physicochemical features underlying the organization of domain_architecture the packing clusters identified not only depicted thepie chart showing the distribution of pc sites within different value classes three value classes low with value medium with value between and and high with value were colored with blue purple and red respectively b histogram showing the percentages of

value colored with purple and high value colored with red arrangement of structure elements in domain_architecture but could also capture the underlying residues mediating sse packing patterns in domain formation previously hydrophobic cores have been analyzed within domains we compared the structure model for recognition of hydrophobic_core left panel of supplementary with that for identification of sse packing clusters right panel of supplementary a hydrophobic_core usually consists of densely_packed hydrophobic_residues within a protein domain while in sse packing clusters only the residue pairs in effect contact are considered see section and thus the hydrophobic_residues involved are less densely_packed comparing left and right panels of supplementary moreover as shown in supplementary for a protein domain with complex architecture sse packing clusters can give a better structural delineation than hydrophobic cores do there arose an interesting phenomenon when domain_architectures were decomposed into sse packing clusters it was found that of domains of different folds in scop could be related by sharing at least one sse packing pattern resulting in a high connectivity network in protein fold space supplementary the sse packing clusters could also be derived based on cath database and we found that the recognition of sse packing clusters is not drastically affected by different domain assign algorithm see supplementary results for details so what puzzles us is why the sse packing patterns are commonly shared among domains of different fold because the domains of different folds usually originate from different ancestors and perform different functions the sharing of sse packing clusters across domains of different fold could indicate the important role of physical constraints rather than evolutionary or functional constraints on formation of sse packing clusters as common structural scaffolds furthermore we observed a high correlation between the sse packing clusters and the folding nuclei for single_domain as most of the small single_domain used in this study was found to fold via a nucleation condensation mechanism n olting and several key_residues would form a folding nucleus that serves as a scaffold for directing the rapid folding of the whole domain the good correspondence between sse packing clusters identified and folding nuclei for these single_domain suggest the important roles of the sse packing clusters in initiating folding and organizing structure elements moreover through investigation of the distribution of disease related mutations on differentthe distribution of conservation scores for sse packing clusters within different families is displayed as a solid line compared with that of other regions shown as a dash line kinase domains it was observed that sse packing clusters could account for of of previously_reported diseaserelated mutations on kinases the association between sse packing clusters and diseases reinforces the importance of sse packing clusters in domain_organization not only in terms of structural scaffolds but also in terms of functionality in this work by considering the sse interfaces as the basic interaction units for the packing of sses we developed a new descriptor named sse packing cluster to characterize domains of different fold moreover our analysis showed that sse packing clusters were more conserved in domain_architectures and corresponded well with folding nuclei in small single_domain therefore sse packing clusters could be regarded as common structural scaffolds underlying the diverse protein_structure space
