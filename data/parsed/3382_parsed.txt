systems_biology orca a cobra toolbox extension for model driven discovery and analysis over past_decades constraint based modelling has emerged as an important approach to obtain referential information about mechanisms behind biological phenotypes and identify physiological and perturbed metabolic_states at genome_scale however application of this novel approach to systems_biology in biotechnology is still hindered by the functionalities of the existing modelling software to augment the usability of the constraint based_approach for various use scenarios we present orca a matlab_package which extends the scope of established constraint based reconstruction and analysis metabolic modelling and includes three unique functionalities i a framework method integrating three analyses of multi_objective robustness analysis and fractional benefit analysis ii metabolic_pathways identification with futile loop elimination and iii a dynamic flux_balance framework incorporating kinetic constraints availability_and orca is freely_available to academic users and is downloadable from https sourceforge net_projects exorca a mini tutorial is supplied in the package for training purposes as well as a software manual the recent_advance in high_throughput technology has vastly increased the availability of the biological_information for reconstruction of genome_scale gsms these can serve as a detailed representation of biological reaction_networks and their functional_states for investigating gsms in both academic and industrial settings the constraint based reconstruction and analysis cobra software has been established as a popular tool since nevertheless the systematic application of gsms for modeldriven discovery has much scope to be further developed for example although the original cobra toolbox does include a variety of methods for modelling gsms it still lacks ready made functions for users to model the competition between multiobjectives commonly_encountered in bioengineering this indicates that there is an urgent need to develop novel simulation methodologies and tools to interrogate and interpret the information in the gsms in integrative systemic and meaningful ways to facilitate this emerging direction in research we have developed a number of matlab functions collectively packaged and named as orca model driven discovery and analysis toolbox supplementary to the existing cobra functions these orca functions are intended to take advantage of existing cobra models for us to i obtain information on the capability of an interesting microorganism for desired metabolite_production ii understand the correlation between the perturbation of the surrounding metabolism and the preferable metabolite synthesis and iii investigate how dynamic changes of external metabolite_concentrations in the environment affect the yield of desirable metabolites in a reactor the tool has been used to elucidate the inherent potential of several promising biocatalysts for microbial_fuel electricity production and some of the base mathematics of orca have been discussed in the literature b c
