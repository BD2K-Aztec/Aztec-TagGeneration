gene_expression semi_supervised recursively partitioned mixture_models for identifying cancer_subtypes motivation patients with identical cancer_diagnoses often progress differently the disparity we see in disease_progression and treatment response can be attributed to the idea that two histologically_similar cancers may be completely different diseases on the molecular level methods for identifying cancer_subtypes associated with patient_survival have the capacity to be powerful instruments for understanding the biochemical_processes that underlie disease_progression as well as providing an initial step toward more personalized_therapy for cancer patients we propose a method called semi_supervised recursively partitioned mixture_models ss_rpmm that utilizes array based genetic and patient level clinical data for finding cancer_subtypes that are associated with patient_survival results in the proposed ss_rpmm cancer_subtypes are identified using a selected subset of genes that are associated with survival time since survival information is used in the gene selection_step this method is semi_supervised unlike other semi_supervised clustering classification methods ss_rpmm does not require specification of the number of cancer_subtypes which is often unknown in a simulation_study our proposed method compared favorably with other competing semi_supervised methods including semi_supervised clustering and supervised principal_components furthermore an analysis of mesothelioma cancer data using ss_rpmm revealed at least two distinct methylation profiles that are informative for survival availability the analyses implemented in this article were carried_out using r http www r project org there are approximately known types of cancer although they may be overly general as the same type of cancer can have very different trajectories in different people for example it is not unusual for a tumor to proliferate in one patient and stabilize or regress in another even though their tumors are indistinguishable at a microscopic level traditionally researchers diagnosed and treated cancer based on an analysis of cell_shape and size a method that is substantially challenging for closely_related cancers in recent_years information regarding molecular_alterations in cancer has contributed to defining cancer_subtypes based on the underlying molecular_signature of a tumor such molecular_pathology has contributed to the discovery of subtypes of several different tumor_types and has successfully identified patients with different survival_times more recently there has been substantial interest in the use of methylation profiling for understanding the effect of epigenetic_alterations on disease_susceptibility as well as to characterize cancer_subtypes based on methylation patterns however such associations work best when cancer_subtypes based on genetic profiles are already known if subtype membership is known then a number of different supervised_classification procedures such as support_vector svms discriminant_analysis multinomial_logistic or ensemble based procedures can be used to build a statistical_model to diagnose such cancers in future patients in most instances however neither the different subtypes nor patient specific subtypes are known consequently attempts have been made to identify cancer_subtypes many of which use either fully unsupervised_learning or fully supervised_learning techniques unsupervised analyses for identifying cancer_subtypes is often addressed using hierarchical_clustering where cancer_subtypes are identified using only array based genetic data asreport hierarchical_clustering can be an effective method for identifying clinically_relevant cancer_subtypes although one major_limitation of unsupervised_learning procedures is that they may identify cancer_subtypes that are unrelated to patient_survival or other clinical_outcomes of interest especially when they are applied to high_dimensional sincepage motivated by the ss clust approach of bair and tibshirani ss_rpmm utilizes array based genetic data and patientlevel clinical information to identify biologically and clinically_meaningful cancer_subtypes we begin our procedure by prescreening array based genetic data to identify loci that are associated with the primary_outcome of interest with the idea of guiding the subsequent clustering_algorithm toward a solution that is prognostically_relevant we then develop a classifier that can be used to predict cancer outcome for future patients while the originally proposed version of ss clust requires specification of the number of assumed classes k our proposed method estimates this number directly since the number of classes is often not known ss_rpmm can be viewed as an improvement upon the ss clust approach it should be pointed_out that when the assumption that the expression of each gene or loci is independent conditional on class_membership is satisfied rpmm and the model_based algorithm of fraley and raftery tend to produce identical results however the latter method sequentially fits mixture_models for different numbers of assumed classes and consequently is computationally less efficient than the corresponding rpmm solution the analysis of the mesothelioma data using ss_rpmm revealed promising results using out of available of the loci available in the mesothelioma dataset we were able to find two distinct survival profiles among the three classes predicted in our testing_set a number of the loci identified supplementary as demonstrating altered dna_methylation related to survival in mesothelioma are involved in processes known to be critical in carcinogenesis and to effect patient outcome these include a number of genes considered oncogenic growth_factors or growth_factor such as fgr met ifngr fgf grb plg and fgfr as well as tumor_suppressor involved in cellcycle control p ink a s a apoptosis casp and dna_repair tdg also identified as a critical predictor of survival was sfrp which has been previously shown to be downregulated in mesothelioma and to be associated with more aggressive_disease thus there is strong biologic plausibility to the genes identified in the ss_rpmm methodology using an additional random splits of the full mesothelioma data into training and testing sets we were able to gain insight into the performance on average as well as the variability in performance of ss_rpmm ss clust and spca despite using a fewer number of loci on average ss_rpmm outperformed ssclust and showed a modest improvement compared with spca in discovering methylation profiles that are informative for survival as evidenced through a larger average pseudo r and smaller average aic this finding is significant in that ss_rpmm identifies discrete cancer_subtypes which are often of interest from both a biological and clinical perspective with no loss in predictive_accuracy compared with spca in summary ss_rpmm appears to be a promising method for identifying cancer_subtypes relevant to patient_survival our approach_combines the strengths of the semi_supervised approaches of bair andwith the ability of rpmm to determine the number of clusters in a robust and computationally_efficient manner
