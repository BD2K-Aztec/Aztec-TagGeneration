gene_expression a statistical_framework for illumina dna_methylation arrays motivation the illumina beadarray is a popular platform for profiling dna_methylation an important epigenetic event associated with gene_silencing and chromosomal_instability however current approaches rely on an arbitrary detection p value cutoff for excluding probes and samples from subsequent analysis as a quality_control step which results in missing observations and information_loss it is desirable to have an approach that incorporates the whole data but accounts for the different quality of individual observations results we first investigate and propose a statistical_framework for removing the source of biases in illumina methylation beadarray based on several positive control samples we then introduce a weighted model_based called lumiwcluster for illumina beadarray that weights each observation according to the detection p values systematically and avoids discarding subsets of the data lumiwcluster allows for discovery of distinct methylation patterns and automatic selection of informative cpg loci we demonstrate the advantages of lumiwcluster on two publicly_available illumina goldengate methylation datasets ovarian_cancer and hepatocellular_carcinoma availability r package lumiwcluster can be downloaded fromdna methylation is an important epigenetic_modification and plays critical roles in transcriptional_regulation chromosomal stability genomic_imprinting and x inactivation numerous literatures have established the influence of dna_methylation in transcriptional aberrations in human_diseases including various types of cancer dna_methylation occurs in cytosines of cpg_dinucleotides in human in a non random fashion across the genome in particular cpg rich regions known as cpg islands are usually hypomethylated whereas repetitive genomic_sequences are hypermethylated in normal cells over the past_decade there has been vast research in studying alterations of to whom correspondence should be addressed dna_methylation in cancer a general observed trend of perturbed dna_methylation includes hypomethylation of oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor_suppressor leading to genomic_instability and tumorigenesis several platforms are available for dna_methylation that includes high_throughput arrays and more recently the nextgeneration_sequencing instruments the experimental_approaches in high_throughput array based methylation include bisulfite_conversion based_methods restriction_enzyme based_methods and immunoprecipitation based_methods a popular robust methylation profiling platform via bisulfite_conversion is the illumina goldengate and infinium methylation assays based on the beadarray technology this technology utilizes m silica_beads which are replicated times on the array and has emerged as an attractive platform for genotyping expression and methylation analysis this technology requires less sample input but produces high_quality data thereby reducing the cost of array experiments the increasing_popularity of illumina beadarray technology is apparent given the numerous scientific_publications since however there is only a handful of statistical_framework for analyzing illumina beadarray gene_expression and limited work is available for methylation array counterpart existing work for gene_expression beadarray falls into the categories of data preprocessing and differential_expression detection this includes background correction methods variance stabilizing techniques and modified test_statistics for differential_gene in illumina beadarray most of the framework for gene_expression analysis is based on the assumption that the majority of the genes are not differentially_expressed in contrast many sites are expected to be methylated and therefore the assumptions in gene_expression are not applicable to methylation experiments the goal of our article is to provide a statistical_framework for arraybased methylation profiling on illumina beadarray technology by studying the source of biases and the data generating mechanism of illumina methylation assays specifically we propose a model for correcting the source of biases in illumina methylation beadarray and introduce a weighted model based_approach for clustering the methylation profiles the framework of our weighted model_based can also be directly applied to other illumina beadarray platforms e g gene_expression beadchip because it does not rely on the assumption that most beads are from the null_distribution of no differential_expression in the next section we describe thepage methylation_levels in illumina methylation assays are quantified by the beta value using the ratio of intensities between methylated m and unmethylated u alleles specifically beta max m max m max u where m and u are the red and green dyes respectively for the goldengate and veracode methylation assays whereas for infinium assay m and u are signals a and b produced by two different bead types and reported in the same color respectively the constant is to regularize beta when both m and u values are small the beta values are continuous and range from unmethylated to completely methylated each locus reports an average beta value obtained from the average of ms and us across approximately bead replicates and individual beadlevel measurements are not readily available a standard summary output from beadstudio illumina software to process raw intensities includes four columns for each sample i e average beta average m average u and detection p values for each locus therefore our proposed_framework will be based on the average beta values for convenience the detection p value reported by beadstudio can be used as a quality_control measure of probe performance the detection p value is defined as p value computed from the background model characterizing the chance that the signal was distinguishable from negative controls supplementary_materials standard protocol by illumina recommends excluding probes that have a detection p value greater than an arbitrary cutoff of on the other hand excluded samples that consist of observations with detection p values as well as probes cpg loci with median detection p values whereas hernandezexcluded probes with detection p values in of the samples in section we will introduce a modeling framework that avoids arbitrary choice of detection p value threshold we will now explore and illustrate the source of biases present in illumina methylation beadarray based on the data generated by the thomas conway lab at unc chapel hill the methylation experiment is performed on the goldengate cancer panel i methylation panel which interrogates cpg loci probes associated with cancer_related tumor_suppressor oncogenes genes involved in dna_repair cell_cycle control differentiation apoptosis x linked and imprinted_genes where contain one cpg_site per gene contain two cpg_sites and have three or more sites the probe length varies between bp and bp with median bp whereas the number of cg dinucleotides for each probe varies between and a pair of allele specific oligonucleotide aso and locusspecific oligonucleotide lso measures the methylation_level of a specific cg dinucleotide for a probe under the assumption that flanking cg dinucleotides within the same probe exhibit similar methylation status in other words the observed methylation_level for the measured cg dinucleotide should not be affected by the number of flanking cg dinucleotides to investigate the potentialsource of biases in illumina methylation assays we utilize six positive control samples from our dataset in which all the cytosines in cg dinucleotides are expected to be methylated and any deviation from methylated status indicates the presence of technical biases we apply quantile normalization to these six positive control samples compare the pairwise_correlations among these positive controls before and after normalization respectively both plots show the high correlations among the positive controls with improvement after normalization in addition array based technology are known to be affected by the sequence and thermodynamic_properties e g melting_temperature and gc_content in proteindna binding and gene_expression experiments in we plot the quantile normalized average beta values pooled from all positive controls against probe length number of cg dinucleotides within each probe melting_temperature and gc_content individual plots for each positive control sample are given in supplementary_materials melting_temperature is computed according to whereas gc_content is the percentage of c and g nucleotides for a given probe as evident from the observed methylation_level is influenced by the sequence and thermodynamics properties of the probes sequence_length bias in methylation array is also observed in since melting_temperature is a function of gc_content and sequence_length and gc_content is highly_correlated with the number of cg dinucleotides our modeling framework will incorporate sequence_length and gc_content in gene_expression and proteindna binding arrays gc_content exhibits increasing trend with intensities due to the three hydrogen_bonds compared with two hydrogen_bonds in at pairs however the decreasing_trend observed in methylation arrays can be attributed to the loss of efficiency in binding for a probe with more cg dinucleotides because the cg dinucleotides within a probe are expected to have similar methylation status although cg dinucleotides yield a more straightforward interpretation we choose gc_content which has more distinct values for better function approximation the delineation of dna_methylation is important in understanding how these epigenetic changes might lead to aberrant expression_patterns and disease advancements in biotechnology have enabled high_throughput profiling of dna_methylation including the illumina goldengate and infinium beadarray via bisulphite conversion these platforms are robust highly_reproducible and require less starting_materials in the first part of this study we illustrated the source of biases present in illumina methylation arrays and proposed a model for correcting these biases a common approach in analyzing illumina methylation data includes omitting cpg loci and samples that exhibit detection p values larger than an arbitrary cutoff this hard thresholding step often results in missing observations and information_loss by discarding a subset of probes we proposed a weighted model based approach_called lumiwcluster that weights each cpg locus sample by its detection p values for clustering dna_methylation profiles in this article we set the weights as the median detection p values across samples or cpg loci which appears to perform well in the two case studies optimal selection of weight functions is beyond the scope of this article and will be an interesting future_research direction
