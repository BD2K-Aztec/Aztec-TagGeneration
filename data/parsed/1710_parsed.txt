structural_bioinformatics exposing the co adaptive potential of protein_protein through computational sequence design motivation in nature proteinprotein_interactions are constantly_evolving under various selective_pressures nonetheless it is expected that crucial interactions are maintained through compensatory mutations between interacting_proteins thus many studies have used evolutionary sequence_data to extract such occurrences of correlated mutation however this research is confounded by other evolutionary pressures that contribute to sequence covariance such as common_ancestry results here we focus exclusively on the compensatory mutations deriving from physical protein interactions by performing large_scale computational mutagenesis experiments for proteinprotein_interfaces we investigate the potential for co adaptability present in protein pairs that are always found together in nature obligate and those that are occasionally in complex transient by modeling each complex both in bound and unbound forms we find that naturally transient complexes possess greater relative capacity for correlated mutation than obligate complexes even when differences in interface size are taken into account regions that are important for the function and structure of proteins tend to be highly_conserved thus many methods have been developed to measure functional and structural constraints in proteins identifying correlated_mutations cms is one of the most direct measures for revealing the evolutionary_constraints that have shaped protein_structures and their interaction specificity the idea is simple for mutations to survive purifying_selection after one protein has mutated the fitness of its partner proteins must be rescued through compensatory mutations thus a pair of positions is considered to have a cm if the amino_acid at the position in the first protein are correlated with the amino_acid in the partner_protein several computational_approaches have been developed to to whom correspondence should be addressed predict coevolved residues cm pairs have been observed both at the intra_molecular and intermolecular levels however the cm signal is often too weak to be detected as it is masked by the large number of non coevolving residues thus the study of cm in proteins is often based on some assumption regarding the mechanisms that have led to the cm such as the rate of mutations evolutionary time scale distances between the residues and more which has often led to a case by case understanding to overcome the low signal of cm some studies focused on very large superfamilies such as g_protein or hemoglobin however concluded that current methodologies for detecting cm are not suitable for large_scale inter molecular contact_prediction one explanation for this poor_performance is that it is difficult to separate the effects of physical_interactions within protein_complexes co adaptation from other forces that can also create global patterns of co evolution nonetheless some recent research does improve these results through various normalization and filtration schemes in addition by analyzing lattice model proteins it was found that cm patterns are often consistent with the requirement for thermal_stability on the other hand the rapid_growth in the number of available d protein_complexes provides a unique_opportunity to extract statistical trends for the interfaces of protein_complexes such statistics have been used e g for improving predictive docking in the work of it was shown that protein interfaces are indeed under selection that can be traced by a cm approach in that study a large set of heteromeric complexes was carefully compiled and manually partitioned into transient and obligate interactions the authors found that the interfaces of transient complexes have very little signal of cm whereas obligate complexes show strong trends of compensatory mutations in this study our goal was to leverage the power of large structural datasets and recent_advances in efficient modeling of protein_structures to focus exclusively on the co adaptation resultingpage structural_modeling of correlated_mutations in transient and obligate proteinprotein_complexes modeling of the a two state and b one state scenarios using multi state computational_protein is illustrated for the ran importin complex pdb code ibr interface positions are colored in yellow and green for ran and importin respectively c each structure is modeled as a graph where nodes correspond to residues and the edges between them contain their atomic_level energetic interactions summed over all atoms for simplicity only inter molecular edges are depicted the belief_propagation algorithm is used to derive globally consistent amino_acid probabilities for each pair of positions across the interface d three general scenarios of mutations for two positions on opposite sides of the proteinprotein interface only the first one describes correlated_mutations between the positions with a mi of for the latter two scenarios the mi is due to a lack of correlation or a lack of mutation respectively from physical_interaction thus we set out to investigate from so_called first principles the degree to which the energetic stability of a natural proteinprotein_complex underlies the phenomenon of the co adaptability of its interface furthermore our method enables us to focus on those pairs that demonstrate strong potential for co adaptivity beyond a naive consideration of all pairs within spatial_proximity on the other hand since our analysis is performed using a fixed backbone procedure and enumeration of pair_wise adaptivity section we do not expect to see many pairs of co adapting residues that are distant in the native_structure we provide an unbiased view of a dataset of protein_complexes consisting of both obligate and transient heterodimeric complexes in brief we adopt a structural and physical energy based model for which the lowest energy amino_acid and their side chain rotamers occur with higher probability in the past this model has been successfully employed to detect both the top sequence predictions for protein design and also the probability of assigning particular amino_acids at any residue this approach bypasses the need for evolutionary sequence_alignments instead the detailed d structure for each complex is used to predict the boltzmann_distribution weighted pairwise amino_acid probabilities without sequence_alignment based estimation of cm as a measure of cm we utilize the well known mutual_information mi score which quantifies to what degree the amino_acid at a specific residue increase our knowledge regarding the amino_acids at another residue in the partner_protein we measured the mi for all pairs of positions in all proteinprotein_interfaces and we find that naturally transient complexes possess greater relative capacity for cm than naturally obligate complexes when modeled identically in addition we analyzed a set of homodimeric complexes and find that despite having interface sizes similar to the obligate complexes they exhibit a large co adaptive potential similar to that measured for transient complexes for each particular proteinprotein_complex we modeled it in two alternative scenarios in the two state scenario the two proteins can either be in their native dimeric complex or as unbound monomers where these two states are weighted uniformly in the one state scenario the two proteins are only allowed to exist in a single state as a bound dimer the motivation behind these alternative scenarios is to model obligate like behavior as one state where the two proteins are always in complex on the other hand transient like behavior requires that the proteins be physically stable both in complex and as isolated monomers our goal was to analyze the consequences of modeling each complex in both the one and two state scenarios and compare these analyses between the obligate and transient complexes to model the interface of a particular pair of proteins in either scenario the structures of all states are simulated using a probabilistic_graphical in the model nodes correspond to interface residues and the edges between them consist of pseudo physical atomic interaction_energies we employ the belief_propagation algorithm to calculate all pair_wise amino_acid amino probabilities from which we determine if each particular pair exhibits cm by calculating the mi score where higher mi values_correspond to larger degrees of correlated variability between the positions for full details see section as was previously observed by us and others there are many cases for which standard off_the all purpose protein design calculations fail indeed we found here that the design_procedure often over predicts certain amino_acids such as serine s threonine t and glycine g nevertheless the unbiased simulation of over protein_complexes comprising designed inter molecular pairs of positions allowed us to overcome this shortcoming obtaining an abundance of high_level information that is both consistent and statistically_significant in our analysis we studied a total of non redundant heterodimeric complexes naturally transient complexes and naturally obligate complexes for each such complex the interface positions were defined as those in contact with positions in the opposing protein for illustration we consider pdb code kzy as an example of a transient complex kzy is the naturally transient heteromer of tumor_suppressor p complexed with the tandem brct region of p binding_protein bp the d structure is composed of two p chains and two bp chains we modeled the interface between one of each of these protein_chains kzy chains a and c this complex is of special interest as residues of the p dna_binding are often mutated in cancer_cells past analysis of experimental mutations has contributed to the estimation of the conservation levels and features of the interface shows the evolutionary profile hssp for each of the positions in kzy as well as the designed profiles in the oneand two state scenarios the number of cm increases from the modeling of the two state scenario to the one state scenario from to specifically we observe that cm pairs found in the twostate scenario are almost always present in the one state scenario as well albeit with higher mi values gray arrows and there are new cm not observed in the two state scenario which appear only in the one state scenario blue arrows in addition several general_trends for the interface residues can be drawn from this example and others i sequences predicted by computational fixed backbone design are only moderately similar to natural sequences with sequence_identity remaining at ii furthermore the evolutionary profile is often significantly less diverse than the mutational profiles derived from the computational_design approach with only a few of the designed interface positions remaining highly_conserved iii an interface that is naturally rich in charged_residues often retains its charged nature although the positions at which specific amino_acids appear are not always conserved iv the number of glycine and serine and to a lesser extent threonine tends to increase relative to the hssp profile page the evolutionary positional sequence_profiles hssp as well as the predicted profiles for the two and one state scenarios are shown representative examples of the predicted inter molecular cm are demonstrated where cm present in both the twoand one state scenarios are depicted in gray and those unique to the one state scenario are depicted in blue in this example there are six cm pairs in the two state scenario and cm pairs in the one state scenario the main finding of this article is that the interaction interface of obligate proteinprotein heterodimers has significantly less potential for co optimization across the complex than that of transient heterodimers and homodimers we hypothesize that this may derive from the fact that evolutionary_processes have selected for transient interfaces with structures that have consistently maintained their ability to adapt as new partners are added to their binding repertoire and existing partners are removed indeed the energetic consideration of protein interfaces in determining their specificity fromer and shifman fromer and yanover has provided insight into the participation of these proteins in rich interactions with multiple_partners and in networks in general we propose that the unused potential for compensatory mutations observed in transient interfaces does not derive solely from the fact that these two proteins are not always found together if this were the case then we would expect that modeling a transient complex in the one state scenario would not yield a larger relative increase in cm than when performing the same procedure for obligate complexes thus we hypothesize that the increased concerted capacity for adaptation present in transient dimers is an intrinsic requirement of the structures of such interfacese g so that they possess the means to dynamically adapt to new interactions this greater potential for pair_wise adaptability across transient interfaces is also consistent_with where it was found that transient complexes have greater optimization for electrostatic stability charge pairing across the interface moreover we have shown that the properties of the interfaces of obligate and transient complexes do not extend to the entire proteins we found that other properties of the complexes such as intramolecular cm modeling the absolute_size of the protein dimers and the number of additional chains present in the solved d structures are not correlated with the properties of the coadaptive potential previously in a study on protein_complexes resulting from duplication_events in yeast cm signals could not be detected on the other hand we argue that by using a protein set that covers complexes including homodimers from a broad range of environmental and phylogenetic contexts we recover a statistically_robust signal of potential biophysical cm for protein interfaces here we also performed a study of protein homodimers obligate and transient while the global interface properties size resemble the obligate set the cm properties resemble that of protein_complexes that are transient in nature the evolution of a homodimer is often associated with a large and extended interface mainly for the purpose of geometric complementarity therefore we find it interesting that the co adaptive potential is still strong enough for multiple mutations to occur experimentally or by computational_design without forfeiting energetic stability in summary we note that several high_level principles have been proposed for the evolution of structurally functional protein_complexes those that are obligate or transient this study having multiple_partners and maintaining partners from a similar superfamily or fold it is an intriguing possibility that the transient like nature of homodimers and their predicted adaptability to mutations may also underlie the evolution of heterodimers that share the same fold
