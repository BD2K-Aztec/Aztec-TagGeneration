sequence_analysis dlocalmotif a discriminative approach for discovering local motifs in protein_sequences motivation local motifs are patterns of dna or protein_sequences that occur within a sequence interval relative to a biologically defined anchor or landmark current protein motif_discovery methods do not adequately consider such constraints to identify biologically_significant motifs that are only weakly over represented but spatially confined using negatives i e sequences known to not contain a local motif can further increase the specificity of their discovery results this article introduces the method dlocalmotif that makes use of positional_information and negative data for local motif_discovery in protein_sequences dlocalmotif combines three scoring_functions measuring degrees of motif over representation entropy and spatial_confinement specifically_designed to discriminatively exploit the availability of negative data the method is shown to outperform current methods that use only a subset of these motif characteristics we apply the method to several biological_datasets the analysis of peroxisomal targeting signals uncovers several novel motifs that occur immediately_upstream of the dominant peroxisomal_targeting signal the analysis of proline tyrosine nuclear local ization signals uncovers multiple novel motifs that overlap with c h zinc_finger we also evaluate the method on classical nuclear_localization and endoplasmic_reticulum retention signals and find that dlocalmotif successfully recovers biologically_relevant sequence properties local motifs are patterns in dna or protein_sequences that occur in a short sequence interval relative to a sequence anchor or landmark for example the peroxisomal_targeting pts defined by the consensus krh occurs at the c terminus of many proteins that localize to the peroxisome however up to residues found upstream of pts are important for localization but as of yet no motif is known another example is the proline tyrosine nuclear_localization py nls that is recognized by a specific nuclear_import factor kap the py nls contains a highly_conserved py at the c terminus of the motif but residues upstream of this motif are required for the interaction with kap additionally proteins are retained in the endoplasmic_reticulum er owing to the presence of the motifdel local to the c terminus elrod we aim to discover multiple local motifs that co occur with these anchors existing motif_discovery methods typically aim to discover over represented motifs in dna and protein_sequences but do not usually account for positional_information and negative data the few methods that do use sequence distance or position as a feature operate on dna_sequences and are thus unsuitable for proteins discriminative motif_finding methods distinguish functional_motifs from randomly occurring sequence_patterns by using functionally unrelated negative sequences in which sought motifs are absent or present owing to chance alone to our knowledge none of the available protein motif_discovery methods make use of both types of information several local motif_discovery methods are designed for inferring motifs that define gene_regulatory recently developed localmotif for discovering nucleotide motifs that occur in a short sequence interval relative to transcription_start they introduced a novel scoring_function to determine the spatial_confinement of a dna_motif using human promoter data the authors demonstrated that their method outperformed several other tools such as amadeus trawler weeder and meme on discovering transcription_factor in chip data the spatial_confinement score does not adequately deal with sparse_data with few samples the spatial_confinement score is high at singular counts to make matters worse at low numbers of samples under observation the method to whom correspondence should be addressed the author s published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com for determining statistical_significance is inaccurate localmotif is therefore incapable of distinguishing between real and spurious low count motifs in this article we develop a new method inspired by localmotif that works for the symbol amino_acid alphabet enabling protein motif_discovery it uses negative data enabling discriminative motif_discovery and statistically identifies local motifs at realistically low counts our new method dlocalmotif discovers motifs in a set of protein_sequences that are aligned relative to a defined landmark we use three scoring_functions namely motif spatial_confinement msc motif over representation mor and motif relative entropy mre to deal with spurious matches we use pseudo counts for probabilities in the scoring_functions maximum a posteriori estimates tend to reasonable values when there is little data the scoring_functions collectively establish whether a motif is enriched in a constrained sequence interval in the positive dataset relative to the negative dataset to uncover only significant spatially confined motifs p values are determined by a corrected binomial_test of motif location within matched sequences we believe that dlocalmotif is the only tool for discovering local motifs in protein_sequences we expect that several methods including trawler and amadeus could be reworked to operate on proteins but the efficiency and accuracy are yet unknown we use synthetic datasets to characterize the accuracy of our method and to compare it with alternative_methods the results indicate that dlocalmotif has superior accuracy on protein_sequences largely because of its ability to use positional_information and negative data in addition dlocalmotif finds the most favourable position of each discovery we apply our method to several biological_datasets and uncover novel motifs that co occur with a variety of protein_localization signals in this article we address the motif_discovery problem when motifs are only weakly enriched overall but biological expertise suggests that they are confined to an approximate but defined position for example structural constraints of protein conformation make fragments distant in sequence come together in space dlocalmotif discovers such local motifs in a set of protein_sequences that are aligned to a predefined anchor and their appearance is linked to their position within the alignment unlike similar current methods dlocalmotif is specifically_designed for proteins and to solve problems where negative data are available to evaluate the performance of the proposed method we investigated a series of protein translocation problems where targeting signals are assisted by additional often spatially related but otherwise more subtle properties to enable dlocalmotif to adequately deal with sparse_data we re designed the scoring_functions of narang et_al by introducing pseudo counts we formulated three discriminative scoring features msc mor and mre these features establish whether a motif is positioned in a sequence interval in positive data and is generally absent in negative data the new formulation gives a quantitative evaluation of a motifs relevance considering its over representation relative entropy and spatial_confinement importantly our search_strategy removed all motifs with non significant spatial_confinement p values determined using a robust binomial_test of motif location although dlocalmotif has many parameters that can be tuned we have shown that default_parameters settings are effective for discovering biologically_significant motifs to examine the performance of dlocalmotif we planted random negative and decoy motifs in artificial datasets the results underscored that dlocalmotif is able to accurately discover the location of a planted motifs occurrence independently of sequence_length the results also demonstrated that dlocalmotif will outperform standard motif_discovery here represented by meme deme and nestedmica when motifs are spatially confined it is important to note however that standard motif_discovery are not expected to discover local motifs any better than non local motifs and their performance thus degrades with the increase in sequence_length on biological data with limited over representation of motifs dlocalmotif discovered multiple local motifs we present seven novel pts local motifs some of which appear to be species distinct dlocalmotif discovered three entirely novel py nls local motifs that overlap with c h zf domains associated with nuclear trafficking we believe these motifs may further our understanding of py nls mediated translocation dlocalmotif successfully recovered er retention motifs and the bipartite nls despite the absence of negative data specifically in er retention data we found a motif consisting of acidic_residues that occurs immediately_upstream the classical er retention signal literature indicates that the same motif may contribute to the efficiency of er retention with many motif_discovery tools unable to deal with large motifs with variable linker regions dlocalmotif offers a compromise by detecting multiple smaller but spatially interlinked motifs conflict of interest none declared
