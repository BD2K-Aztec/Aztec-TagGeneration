genome_analysis ale a generic assembly likelihood evaluation framework for assessing the accuracy of genome and metagenome assemblies motivation researchers need general_purpose methods for objectively evaluating the accuracy of single and metagenome assemblies and for automatically detecting any errors they may contain current methods do not fully meet this need because they require a reference only consider one of the many aspects of assembly_quality or lack statistical justification and none are designed to evaluate metagen ome assemblies results in this article we present an assembly likelihood evaluation ale framework that overcomes these limitations systematically evaluating the accuracy of an assembly in a reference independent_manner using rigorous statistical_methods this framework is comprehensive and integrates read quality mate_pair orientation and insert length for paired_end sequencing_coverage read_alignment and k_mer frequency ale pinpoints synthetic errors in both single and metagenomic assemblies including single base errors inser tions deletions genome_rearrangements and chimeric assemblies presented in metagenomes at the genome level with real_world data ale identifies three large misassemblies from the spirochaeta smaragdinae finished genome which were all independently validated by pacific_biosciences sequencing at the single base level with illumina data ale recovers of single_nucleotide in a training_set from a gc_rich rhodobacter_sphaeroides genome using real pacific_biosciences data ale identifies of synthetic errors in a lambda phage genome surpassing even pacific_biosciences own variant caller evicons in summary the ale framework provides a comprehensive reference independent and statistically_rigorous measure of single_genome and metagenome_assembly accuracy which can be used to identify misassemblies or to optimize the assembly process availability ale is released as open_source under the uoi recent_advances in next generation high_throughput have dramatically_reduced the cost of sequencing with the development of genome_assemblers able to use large volumes of sequence_data reference_genomes are now rapidly produced using the whole_genome shotgun strategy from small simple microbial_genomes to large complex plant or mammalian_genomes meanwhile genomes are also being generated directly from complex communities using culture independent approaches including singe cell genome_sequencing and metagenome sequencing the ability to assemble a metagenome is particularly important because resolving the genomes of individual species or at least the most abundant from a complex community is crucial to exploring inter_species interactions and understanding the communitys structure dynamics and function assembly of individual_genomes from ngs_datasets poses_significant informatics challenges including short read_length noisy_data and large data volume owing to these challenges errors widely exist in single genome_assemblies derived from ngs_datasets with different specific errors commonly associated with particular datasets genomes and tools beyond the challenges_faced in assembling single genomes metagenome_assembly poses unique additional challenges first although the sequence depth of a single_genome should be approximately uniform the sequence depth of genomes in a metagenome varies_greatly second the difficulty of resolving repetitive_regions within a single_genome is exacerbated in metagenome_assembly because conserved genomic_regions and lateral_gene greatly_increase the portion of falsely identified repetitive genomic_regions despite these unique challenges assemblers designed for single genomes are being applied to metagenome data without being significantly modified to systematically address errors introduced in this way several tools have been developed to detect errors in single genome_assemblies if a reference_genome for the targeted organism is available or one is available from a closely_related erroneous insertions deletions or large gaps can be detected by to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com comparative_analysis of the reference and the genome_assembly in question if a reference is unavailable the alignment of the raw_reads with their assembly provides indirect_measures of assembly_quality such as coverage depth and mate_pair consistency this information can then be used to detect single base changes repeat condensation or expansion false segmental_duplications and other misassemblies despite this progress researchers still lack a method that integrates indirect_measures of read alignment_quality in a quantitative comprehensive and statistically well founded manner to systematically detect errors in single genome_assemblies moreover metrics suitable for evaluating metagenome_assembly accuracy and associated quantitative methods for detecting errors in metagenome assemblies have yet to be developed in this work we develop a novel statistical_model for evaluating assembly accuracy in a reference independent_manner using bayesian statistics we give an expression for the probability that an assembly is correct and provide an automated software_tool assembly likelihood evaluation ale based on this expression the provided tool may be used in three ways first it allows examining the contribution to this probability of correctness from each base in the assembly which can be used to identify specific errors and their locations this is particularly useful for genome finishing second it provides an overall score for different assemblies of the same genome or metagenome thereby enabling comparison of these assemblies and optimization of the assembly process third when applying re sequencing_data to a reference_genome ale can detect structural_variations ale facilitates the rapid discovery of many types of errors in genome_assemblies including metagenomes it does this by applying a rigorous statistical_model calculating the likelihood of observing a specific assembly given the reads that were used to generate it and calculating the contribution to this likelihood from each position in the assembly this allows ale to determine specific regions within a proposed assembly that are poorly supported by the reads by integrating several aspects of the assembly and the reads including k_mer composition sequence depth insert length and how well individual bases map ale is able to find errors as small as a single substitution error or indel as well as large copy_number errors and chimeric metagenome assemblies this framework can serve as a guide in optimizing genome_assemblies in the following two ways first total ale scores can be used to identify the best assembly from those generated by different assembly protocols second by modifying the regions in which ale reports low sub scores more accurate genomes can be constructed the space of possible corrections to an input genome is too large to allow the current_implementation of ale to be used as an independent assembler but it could be used to compare and combine the results from different assemblers and produce an assembly that is most likely to be correct ale could also be used to present an alternative method for ale calculating assembly accuracy in local_assembly algorithms such as genovo when used with a reference_genome and resequencing data ale can discover structural_variations as shown in the cases of spirochaeta smaragdinae and r sphaeroides ale readily detects structural_variations whose sizes vary from a single base to several hundred kilobases ale currently does not classify the type of assembly errors future work is needed to determine the profile of each type of assembly errors in a dataset specific_manner once ale has this capability it could guide an auto correction algorithm to automatically fix problematic regions the effectiveness of ale is influenced by the quality of its input the read data and the alignments of those reads onto the a b ale identifies regions with potential assembly errors a cumulative plots showing the percentage of assembly errors detected by ale at different sensitivity thresholds detected assembly break_points break sensitivity and novel
