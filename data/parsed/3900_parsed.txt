rchemcpp a web_service for structural analoging in chembl drugbank and the connectivity_map we have developed rchempp a web_service that identifies structurally_similar compounds structural analogs in large_scale molecule databases the service allows compounds to be queried in the widely used chembl drugbank and the connectivity_map databases rchemcpp utilizes the best performing similarity functions i e molecule kernels as measures for structural_similarity molecule kernels have proven superior_performance over other similarity_measures and are currently excelling at machine_learning challenges to considerably reduce computational time and thereby make it feasible as a web_service a novel efficient prefiltering strategy has been developed which maintains the sensitivity of the method by exploiting information contained in public_databases the web_service facilitates many applications crucial for the drug_development process such as prioritizing compounds after screening or reducing adverse_side during late phases rchemcpp was used in the deeptox pipeline that has won the tox data challenge and is frequently used by researchers in pharmaceutical_companies availability_and the web_service and the r package are freely_available viaone strategy to remedy the steadily declining efficiency of the drug_development process is to utilize the vast information on chemical_compounds that is already present in public and internal databases to this end compounds that are structurally_similar to the current drug_candidate have to be identified in public_databases this structural analoging step can enhance the drug_development process at different phases after high_throughput a number of compounds are selected of which typically very little information about their biological_effects is available querying these compounds in a database can yield similar compounds that have already been measured in various biological_experiments and provide relevant_information this information can improve the drug_development process at various stages and decreases the risk of late failures the best performing similarity_measures for identifying structurally_similar compounds in a database are molecule kernels molecule kernels have been developed for similarity based machine_learning such as support_vector and their efficiency and precision have been demonstrated in various tasks the drawback of molecule kernels is that they are computationally_demanding since they consider all possible common substructures of a compound to reach a query time of a few seconds which is desired for web_services we have v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com developed a novel and computationally fast criterion that maintains the sensitivity of the molecule kernels we have extensively tested the presented software in our computational_pipeline for prediction of toxic_effects of chemical_compounds this computational_pipeline deeptox has won both the tox data challenge http www ncats nih gov news and events features tox challenge winners html and the prediction of average cytotoxicity at the niehs ncats unc dream toxicogenetics challenge https www synapse org synapse syn wiki we provide a web_service called rchemcpp to identify structurally_similar compounds in chembl drugbank and the connectivity_map this provides researchers with various types of information about chemical_compounds and thereby helps to prioritize structures and facilitates decisions based on biological measurements rchemcpp combines efficiently implemented molecule kernels with a new prefiltering strategy and offers a user_friendly interface to adjust the kernel parameters rchemcpp is a valuable_tool for researchers in many areas in particular in drug_design toxicity prediction and cancer research the web_service rchemcpp has many advantages over a programming library for molecule kernels to use molecule kernels requires extensive programming efforts therefore many researchers are restricted to database queries provided by the database interfaces which are based on simple substructure searches we provide molecule kernels as a hands on tool for researchers of all areas and backgrounds furthermore the preparation curation and clean up of the databases that is necessary for applying molecule kernels is included the rchemcpp web_service additionally the problem of high computational power that restricts queries in the large_databases such as the chembl has been solved by our prefiltering strategy
