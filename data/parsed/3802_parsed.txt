systems_biology pycorrfit generic data evaluation for fluorescence_correlation we present a graphical_user pycorrfit for the fitting of theoretical_model functions to experimental_data obtained by fluorescence_correlation fcs the program supports many data file_formats and features a set of tools specialized in fcs data evaluation availability_and the python source_code is freely_available for download from the pycorrfit web_page at http pycorrfit craban de we offer binaries for ubuntu linux mac os x and microsoft windows fluorescence imaging_applications provide a wealth of information about the spatiotemporal distribution of fluorescent molecules in tissues or cells however time lapsed imaging and related protocols e g fluorescence_recovery frap operate with a temporal_resolution of sub seconds which is not fast enough to access free diffusion of mid sized proteins about a decade_ago it was demonstrated that a confocal_imaging setup can be extended by a fluorescence_correlation fcs unit such a fluorescence fluctuation microscope can be used to measure binding and diffusion at specific positions with a sub microsecond resolution since then most of the major microscope companies developed fcs extensions for their products and fluorescence fluctuation analysis became an integral part of the analytical repertoire in biomedical_research fcs is based on the temporal correlation_analysis of a fluctuating fluorescence_signal using microscopes with multiple detection channels a measurement generates a set of autoand cross_correlation curves which contains information about dynamic molecular_processes associated with the fluorescence_emission from a femtoliter sized detection volume correlation curves are interpreted by means of theoretical_model functions describing the underlying physical_processes for example diffusion driven fluctuations must be evaluated for a particular geometry of the detection volume in addition molecular behavior like reversible_binding at sites within the detection volume the population of photophysical dark states due to triplet or blinking phenomena and photobleaching simultaneously affect the measured shape of the correlation curves and must therefore be theoretically treated in practice experimental correlation data are evaluated by fitting appropriate model functions thereby extracting parameters that describe the spatial and dynamical_properties of the system custom made evaluation scripts for a particular fcs instrument are usually designed for its specific optics confocal total_internal etc and often contain only a limited set of model functions the underlying rationale for defining parameters and models may not be well described leaving the user with uncertainties for interpretation furthermore the revision and parameter tweaking of correlation data from different sources can be a time consuming procedure raising the demand for a framework that is capable of dealing with any conceivable scenario in which correlation curves need to be processed pycorrfit offers such a framework focusing on four major notions i the use of established fitting algorithms ii the possibility to implement customized model functions and data file_formats iii a comprehensive annotation of the evaluation dataset and iv a user_friendly environment
