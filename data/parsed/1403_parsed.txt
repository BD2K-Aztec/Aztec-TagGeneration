discovering drug_drug a text_mining and reasoning approach based on properties of drug_metabolism motivation identifying drugdrug_interactions ddis is a critical process in drug_administration and drug_development clinical support tools often provide comprehensive lists of ddis but they usually lack the supporting scientific_evidences and different tools can return inconsistent results in this article we propose a novel approach that integrates text_mining and automated reasoning to derive ddis through the extraction of various facts of drug_metabolism not only the ddis that are explicitly mentioned in text can be extracted but also the potential interactions that can be inferred by reasoning results our approach was able to find several potential_ddis that are not present in drugbank we manually evaluated these interactions based on their supporting evidences and our analysis revealed that of these interactions are determined to be correct this suggests that our approach can uncover potential_ddis with scientific_evidences explaining the mechanism of the interactions one of the challenges in drug_administration and drug_development is the need to identify and avoid_potential drugdrug_interactions ddis when several drugs are being administered there is a possibility of adverse_drug as one drug can increase or decrease the effect of another drug during the course of drug_development it is vital to identify possible drug_interactions with the new drug compound that is being investigated revealing the mechanism behind the drug_interactions can provide the necessary scientific_evidences for further investigation of the drug compound the ability to find ddis and their scientific_evidences efficiently and economically can have an impact on the current approach in drug_administration and drug_development a common source of finding ddis is through the use of commercial databases such as the thomson micromedex drugdex system micromedex or online freely_available drug databases such as drugbank while such databases provide_extensive lists of ddis it is typical that scientific_evidences are not provided as part of the information for ddis this becomes an issue when a recent study showed that there are of disagreements between two drug compendia the lack of scientific_evidences complicates the process of verifying to whom correspondence should be addressed the discrepancies an ideal resource not only should provide a comprehensive list of ddis in a cost efficient manner but also the mechanism behind the interactions text_mining of medline_abstracts is a logical choice to identify ddis as much of the scientific_information is frequently available in biomedical articles in addition text_mining has the potential of finding large number of ddis from text in a cost effective_manner in this article we propose a novel approach of discovering ddis through the integration of biological domain_knowledge with biological facts from medline_abstracts and curated sources our work is one of the few that utilizes biological domain_knowledge in their applications such as the generation of metabolic_networks based on stoichiometric constraints hypothesis_generation in signaling_pathways and synthesis of pharmacokinetic pathways in this work the biological domain_knowledge includes the mechanism of how drug a influences the effect of drug b through the induction or inhibition the enzymes that are responsible for the metabolism of b with the domain_knowledge the other component is to find the biological facts to support specific ddis examples of biological facts from medline_abstracts include the identification of which enzymes are induced or inhibited by drugs as well as the enzymes that are responsible for the metabolism of drugs curated sources such as uniprot http www uniprot org and gene_ontology go annotations http www geneontology org are utilized to identify protein_families such as enzymes and transcription_factors integrating the biological domain_knowledge with the biological facts allows us to derive ddis this step is achieved through the use of logic representation of the domain_knowledge and automated reasoning it is important to note that our approach differs from typical extraction approach which focuses on the extraction of interactions that are stated explicitly in the text in our approach various properties can be extracted from different publications so that the system utilizes the extracted properties to derive potential_ddis this enables us to discover potential_ddis that are yet to be annotated in comprehensive resources about ddis such as drugbank the rest of the article is outlined as follows we describe the basic_properties of ddis that we encode in our system in section in section the processes of acquiring the necessary facts and interactions from existing knowledge bases and medline_abstracts are described in addition the reasoning component is illustrated in how the properties of drug_metabolism are encoded in order to derive ddis in section we describe the possible scenarios of applying our approach to drug_administration and drug_design we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by illustrating thewe used drugbank to assess the performance of our approach in finding ddis we selected drugs and found the interactions among these drugs this results in a gold_standard of ddis with description stating that one drug increases or decreases the effect of another drug we call these set of drug_interactions as the drugbank gold_standard we first evaluated the performance of the extraction of explicit ddis the results are summarized in an explicit drug interaction is extracted from a single sentence in a medline abstract our extraction queries for explicit drug_interactions are specific to the drugs that we selected as the drugbank gold_standard and the extraction queries result in drug_interactions we found that of the extracted drug_interactions i e a precision of are indeed correct based on their originating sentences and of them i e an overlap of are annotated in the drugbank gold_standard the results indicate that there is a potentially large number of published drug_interactions that are not captured by drugbank on the other hand the small overlap between our extracted drug_interactions and the interactions in the drugbank gold_standard also indicates that there is room for improvement in extracting drug_interactions with the extraction of implicit ddis we expect to achieve a higher number of inferred interactions and overlap with the drugbank gold_standard the extraction of implicit ddis is divided_into two parts i direct inhibition or induction of enzymes ii indirect inhibition or induction of enzymes the extraction of implicit ddis of i and ii from million medline_abstracts result in and interactions among the extracted interactions in i interactions coincide with the interactions in the drugbank gold_standard for the ones that are not found in the drugbank gold_standard we manually evaluated the interactions based on their supporting evidences in particular we evaluated interactions that are supported by at least two evidences for drug induces inhibits protein relations and four evidences for protein metabolizes drug relations we realized that or of the interactions are extracted with the correct evidences to support the ddis among the as an example in the case of creating the gold_standard for protein metabolizes drug relations we extracted sentences with co occurrences of drug and gene mentions together with one of the keywords metabolized metabolize metabolized metabolize substrate in the individual sentences we then examined which of the sentences indeed indicate protein metabolizes drug relations this results in evidence sentences that we use as a gold_standard for evaluating protein metabolizes drug relations it is important to note that in the creation of gold_standard we omit possible cross sentence relations in addition we relied on the named entity recognizers to identify sentences with co occurrences of drug and gene mentions the extraction performance for each individual interactions are illustrated in in the case of protein regulates protein relations our strategy is to extract co occurrences of cyp enzymes and one of the transcription_factors known for regulating xenobiotic enzymes i e ahr nr i nr i this restricted co occurrence query allows us to find high_quality relations for transcription_factors regulates enzymes the negation queries are for the extraction of negative relations for the various interactions listed in keywords such as no not are included in these queries we only evaluated the precision of the extraction of negative interactions by analyzing each of the extracted relation and its supporting evidence without creating a gold_standard
