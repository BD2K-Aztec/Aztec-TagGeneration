a non biased framework for the annotation and classification of the non mirna small_rna transcriptome motivation recent_progress in high_throughput has largely contributed to reveal a highly complex landscape of small_non srnas including novel non canonical srnas derived from long_non repeated elements transcription_start and splicing site regions among others the published frameworks for srna data analysis are focused on mirna detection and prediction ignoring further information in the dataset as a consequence tools for the identification and classification of the srnas not belonging to mirna family are currently lacking results here we present seqcluster an extension of the currently available seqbuster tool to identify and analyze at different levels the srnas not annotated or predicted as mirnas this new module deals with sequences mapping onto multiple_locations and permits a highly versatile and user_friendly interaction with the data in order to easily classify srna sequences with a putative functional_importance we were able to detect all known classes of srnas described to date using seqcluster with different srna datasets availability tool and video tutorials are available atsmall silencing rnas are the best known class of non_coding ncrnas of nt in length involved in gene_silencing by association to the argonaute family of proteins recent_progress in high_throughput has largely contributed to elucidate the remarkable landscape of srnas revealing new species of srnas with unknown_functions these novel srnas are classified according to their position in the genome and putative functions nowadays five major groups of srnas have been detected i tirnas located at the transcription_initiation of coding_genes ii spli rnas detected at splicing site of transcripts iii tasi rnas associated to gene termini iv srnas derived from trna and v srnas from non coding rna regions in the first process the adapter is trimmed from the raw sequences and subsequently sequences are mapped onto mirna and mirna precursor databases after that all sequences not annotated as mirnas or mirna_precursors are clustered in clustering step this step is performed according to two filters i sequence_similarity and ii genome location in the classification step usrnas are classified according to the genome context that will cover as many classes and subclasses as the users define once usrnas are defined and located on the genome all of them are classified according to the genome context that will cover as many classes as the users define being the more common types non_coding transposable_elements tes and genes see usrna classification in supplementary_material we have applied seqcluster extension to analyze small_rna datasets of human_brain samples sequenced by illumina g in our previous work and other public dataset from different species see seqcluster application to real_datasets in supplementary_material first we detected mirna sequences using seqbuster with default_parameters and the mirbase resource release we applied seqcluster extension to the rest of the data resulting in a total of and sequences annotated as usrnas in human_brain human stem_cells mouse fly and worm respectively
