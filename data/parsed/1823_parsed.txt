finding correct protein protein_docking models using proqdock motivation proteinprotein_interactions are a key in virtually all biological_processes for a detailed understanding of the biological_processes the structure of the protein complex is essential given the current experimental_techniques for structure_determination the vast_majority of all protein_complexes will never be solved by experimental_techniques in lack of experimental_data computational docking methods can be used to predict the structure of the protein complex a common strategy is to generate many alternative docking solutions atomic_models and then use a scoring_function to select the best the success of the computational docking technique is to a large degree dependent on the ability of the scoring_function to accurately rank and score the many alternative docking models results here we present proqdock a scoring_function that predicts the absolute quality of docking model measured by a novel protein_docking quality_score dockq proqdock uses support_vector trained to predict the quality of protein_docking models using features that can be calculated from the docking model itself by combining different types of features describing both the proteinprotein interface and the overall physical chemistry it was possible to improve the correlation with dockq from for the best individual feature electrostatic complementarity to for the final version of proqdock proqdock performed better than the state of the art methods zrank and zrank in terms of correlations ranking and finding correct models on an independent test_set finally we also demonstrate that it is possible to combine proqdock with zrank and zrank to improve performance even further availability_and http bioinfo ifm liu se proqdockproteinprotein interactions are crucial in almost all biological_processes to understand the mechanism of proteinprotein_interaction the structure of the protein complex is essential despite massive efforts in structure_determination the majority of protein_complexes are not and will never be available in the pdb thus there is a great need for computational_methods that are able to build models of protein_complexes using docking constructing models of protein_complexes is a fundamental challenge in structural_biology and despite years of investigation is still unsolved the problem can be divided_into sampling and scoring where sampling is the problem of generating realistic docking models and scoring is the problem of identifying the correct docking models among many incorrect ones a number of different approaches have been applied to this problem ranging from composite scoring describing the physics to methods derived from the statistics of structural databases methods based on interface composition and geometry or complementarity and methods based on machine_learning the different approaches provide different aspects of docking model quality and could potentially result in higher performance when combined together the multitude of approaches applied to the scoring problem highlights the difficulty in scoring protein_docking models at one end there are features that serve as critical filters for complex v c the author published_by
