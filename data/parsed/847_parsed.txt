systems_biology cam cm a signal deconvolution tool for in vivo dynamic_contrast imaging of complex tissues in vivo dynamic_contrast imaging_tools provide non_invasive methods for analyzing various functional changes associated with disease_initiation progression and responses to therapy the quantitative application of these tools has been hindered by its inability to accurately resolve and characterize targeted tissues due to spatially mixed tissue_heterogeneity convex analysis of mixtures compartment modeling cam cm signal deconvolution tool has been developed to automatically identify pure volume pixels located at the corners of the clustered pixel time series scatter simplex and subsequently estimate tissue_specific pharmacokinetic_parameters cam cm can dissect complex tissues into regions with differential tracer kinetics at pixel wise resolution and provide a systems_biology tool for defining imaging signatures predictive of phenotypes in vivo dynamic_contrast imaging_tools provide noninvasive_methods for analyzing various functional changes associated with disease_initiation progression and responses to therapy typical modalities include dynamic_contrast dcemri dynamic_contrast optical_imaging positron_emission and spectroscopic computed_tomography to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as these tools exploit the dynamics of contrast accumulation and washout to produce functionally_relevant images of vascular_perfusion and permeability metabolism or gene_expression and can potentially test novel hypotheses and predict drug efficacy however due to spatially mixed tissue_heterogeneity the precise imaging based phenotyping by these tools has been hindered by its inability to accurately resolve and characterize targeted functional tissue compartments this indistinction between contributions of different tissues to the mixed tracer signals could significantly confound subsequent pharmacokinetics compartmental_modeling cm and affect the accuracy of genotypephenotype association studies we developed convex analysis of mixtures compartment modeling cam cm signal deconvolution tool that enables geometrically principled unsupervised and accurate characterization and delineation of major functional tissue structures from dynamic_contrast imaging data not only dissecting complex tissue into regions with differential tracer kinetics at pixel wise resolution but also substantially improving tissue_specific pharmacokinetic parameter_estimation cam cm is supported by a well grounded mathematical framework and combines the advantages of multivariate clustering convex geometry analysis and compartmental_modeling the algorithm possesses a novel powerful feature allowing purevolume pixels to be readily identified from the measured pixel time series without any knowledge of the associated compartmental pharmacokinetics leading to a completely unsupervised_approach we provide cam cm software as an open_source standalone matlab application cam cm spatial_temporal analysis can be very effective at revealing multi compartment structure within dynamic contrastenhanced imaging data of complex tissues estimating tissue_specific kinetic parameter_values and characterizing the roles of different functional tissue compartments we would expect the cam cm method with publicly_available open_source software_package to be a very useful tool for the exploratory_analysis of dynamic functional_imaging data in many research and clinical_applications we plan to develop and deliver future versions of the software written in both r and java languages
