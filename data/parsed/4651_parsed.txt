sequence_analysis the uea srna workbench a suite of tools for analysing and visualizing next_generation microrna and small_rna datasets rna_silencing is a complex highly conserved_mechanism mediated by small_rnas srnas such as micrornas mirnas that is known to be involved in a diverse set of biological_functions including development pathogen control genome_maintenance and response to environmental_change advances in next_generation are producing increasingly large_numbers of srna reads per sample at a fraction of the cost of previous methods however many bioinformatics_tools do not scale accordingly are cumbersome or require extensive support from bioinformatics experts therefore researchers need user_friendly robust tools capable of not only processing large srna datasets in a reasonable time frame but also presenting the results in an intuitive fashion and visualizing srna genomic_features herein we present the uea srna workbench a suite of tools that is a successor to the web_based uea srna toolkit but in downloadable format and with several enhanced and additional features availability the program and help pages are available at http srnarna silencing is a complex highly conserved_mechanism mediated by small_rnas srnas srnas such as micro_rnas mirnas are typically nt in length and act as guide molecules to regulate_gene next_generation ngs_technologies have become the de facto way to generate srna datasets these datasets often come from several samples each consisting of millions of distinct reads therefore there is an increasing need for computational_tools for exploring and analysing such data the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as to whom correspondence should be addressed several tools have been developed for ngs srna analysis seefor a recent overview of tools for mirna analysis these are typically command_line driven focused on a specific application e g mirna detection and often require installation of supporting software_packages in addition many of them lack tools for visualizing results herein we present the uea srna workbench a suite of interactive java_based srna analysis tools which provides an easy to use well documented platform to create workflows for processing srna ngs_data the workbench is a successor to the web_based uea srna toolkit which since its establishment in has received an average of page views per month and processed over srna datasets as well as being downloadable the new workbench provides many improved features compared with the toolkit with new tools for visualizing data and processing multiple datasets in addition the workbench is limited only by local memory whereas the toolkit had strict datasize limits due to the nature of its web_based interfaces the workbench can also be command_line driven to allow users to easily plug it into existing pipelines the relative low_cost of ngs has generated an abundance of srna data necessitating a demand for dedicated bioinformatics support the srna workbench enables biologists to gain an understanding of the srnaome in plants and animals through the efficient processing of large ngs srna datasets complemented with easily_accessible visualization_tools it is hoped that these tools will enable biologists to shed light on the key molecular_pathways involved in rna_silencing
