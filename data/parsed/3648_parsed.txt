predicting protein contact_map using evolutionary and physical constraints by integer_programming motivation protein contact_map describes the pairwise spatial and functional relationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein_d although studied extensively it remains_challenging to predict contact_map using only sequence_information most existing_methods predict the contact_map matrix element by element ignoring correlation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole contact_map a couple of recent methods predict contact_map by using mutual_information taking_into contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity restraint but these methods demand for a very large number of sequence homologs for the protein under consideration and the resultant contact_map may be still physically infeasible results this article_presents a novel method phycmap for contact_map integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine_learning and integer_linear the evolutionary restraints are much more informative than mutual_information and the physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among contacts than the sparsity restraint as such our method greatly_reduces the solution_space of the contact_map matrix and thus significantly_improves prediction_accuracy experimental_results that phycmap outperforms currently popular_methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein under consideration availability in this article we say two residues of a protein are in contact if their euclidean_distance is a the distance of two residues can be calculated using c or c atoms corresponding to c or cbased contacts a protein contact_map is a binary l l matrix where l is the protein length in this matrix an element with value indicates the corresponding two residues are in contact otherwise they are not in contact protein contact_map describes the pairwise spatial and functional relationship of residues in a protein predicting contact_map using sequence_information has been an active research_topic in recent_years partially because contact_map is helpful for protein_d and protein model_quality protein contact_map has also been used to study protein_structure many machine_learning have been developed for protein contact_prediction in the past_decades for example svmseq uses support_vector for contact_prediction nncon uses a recursive neural_network svmcon also uses support_vector plus features derived from sequence homologs distill uses a d recursive neural_network recently cmappro di uses a multi_layer neural_network although different these methods are common in that they predict the contact_map matrix element by element ignoring the correlation among contacts and also physical feasibility of the whole contact_map physical constraints are not totally independent of contact correlation a special_type of physical constraint is that a contact_map matrix must be sparse i e the number of contacts in a protein is only linear in its length two recent methods psicov and evfold predict contacts by using only mutual_information mi derived from sequence homologs and enforcing the aforementioned sparsity constraint however both of them demand for a large number at least several hundreds of sequence homologs for the protein under prediction this makes the predicted contacts not useful in protein modeling as a globular protein with many sequence homologs usually has similar templates in pdb thus template based models are of good quality and hard to be further improved using predicted contacts conversely a protein without close templates in pdb which may require contact_prediction usually has few sequence homologs even if millions of protein_sequences are now available further these two methods enforce only a simple sparsity constraint i e the total number of contacts in a protein is small ignoring many more concrete constraints to name a few one residue can have only a small number of contacts depending on its secondary_structure and neighboring residues the number of contacts between two strands is bounded by the strand length astro fold possibly is the first method that applies physical constraints which implicitly imply the sparsity constraint used by psicov and evfold to contact_map however some of the physical constraints are too restrictive and possibly unrealistic for example it requires that a residue in one strand can only be in contact with a residue in another strand more importantly astro fold does not take into consideration evolutionary_information thus it significantly_reduces its prediction_accuracy in this article we present a novel method phycmap for contact_map by integrating both evolutionary and physical constraints using machine_learning which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com secondary_structure and distance_dependent statistical potential phycmap then infers a given number of top contacts based on predicted contact probabilities by enforcing a set of realistic physical constraints on the contact_map these restraints specify more concrete relationship among contacts and also imply the sparsity restraint used by psicov and evfold by combining both evolutionary and physical constraints our method greatly_reduces the solution_space of contact_map and leads to much better prediction_accuracy experimental_results that phycmap outperforms currently popular_methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein under prediction performance on the casp set as shown in on the hard casp_targets our phycmap exceeds the second best method cmappro by in terms of the accuracy of the top five l and l predicted contacts the advantage of phycmap over cmappro becomes smaller but still substantial when short range contacts are excluded from consideration phycmap significantly_outperforms nncon psicov and evfold no matter how many predicted contacts are evaluated psicov and evfold almost fail on these hard casp_targets by contrast cmappro nncon and phycmap still work although they do not perform as well as on the whole casp set note that both psicov and evfold two recent methods receiving a lot of attentions from the community do not perform well on the casp set this is partially because they require a large number of sequence homologs for the protein under prediction nevertheless most of the casp_targets especially the hard ones do not have so many sequence homologs because a protein with so many homologs likely has similar templates in pdb and thus were not used by casp relationship between prediction_accuracy and the number of sequence homologs we divide the casp_targets into five groups according to their logm eff values which contain and targets respectively meanwhile m eff is the number of non redundant sequence homologs for the protein under consideration see section for definition only medium and long_range are considered here and psicov both of which require a large number of sequence homologs we divide set into two subsets based on the amount of homologous information available for the protein under prediction the first subset is relatively easier containing proteins with m eff see section for definition all the proteins in this subset have sequence homologs which satisfies the requirement of psicov the second subset is more challenging to predict containing proteins with m eff as shown in even on the first subset phycmap still exceeds psicov and evfold although the advantage over psicov is not substantial for c contacts prediction when short range contacts are excluded from consideration phycmap also outperforms nncon and cmappro on this set as shown in on the second subset phycmap significantly_outperforms psicov and is slightly better than cmappro and nncon these results again confirm that our method applies to a protein without many sequence homologs on which psicov and evfold usually fail it should be noticed that cmappro used astral as its training_set which shares sequence_identity with proteins in set with m eff and with m eff to more fairly compare the prediction_methods we exclude the proteins from set that share_sequence with the cmappro training_set here the sequence_identity is calculated using cd_hit this results in a set of proteins with m eff and proteins m eff shows that phycmap greatly outperforms cmappro and evfold on the reduced dataset phycmap also outperforms the relationship between prediction_accuracy and the number of non redundant sequence homologs m eff x axis is logm eff and y axis is the mean accuracy of top l predicted contacts on the corresponding casp target group only medium and long_range are considerednote the c results are in gray rows
