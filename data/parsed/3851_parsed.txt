qure software for viral_quasispecies reconstruction from next_generation data next_generation ngs is an ideal framework for the characterization of highly_variable pathogens with a deep resolution able to capture minority variants however the reconstruction of all variants of a viral_population infecting a host is a challenging_task for genome_regions larger than the average ngs read_length qure is a program for viral_quasispecies reconstruction specifically developed to analyze long_read bp ngs_data the software performs alignments of sequence_fragments against a reference_genome finds an optimal division of the genome into sliding_windows based on coverage and diversity and attempts to reconstruct all the individual sequences of the viral quasispeciesalong with their prevalenceusing a heuristic_algorithm which matches multinomial distributions of distinct viral_variants overlapping across the genome division qure comes with a built in poisson error correction_method and a post reconstruction probabilistic clustering both parameterized on given error_rates in homopolymeric and non homopolymeric regions next_generation ngs techniques produce thousands to billions of sequence_fragments called reads composed of tens to hundreds of nucleotide_bases the current applications of ngs include de_novo sequencing re sequencing and metagenomics several technologies have been commercialized and while the purchase of a machine often is not possible by a clinical or research laboratory ngs services are available at a reasonable price from other facilities for genetic_studies or diagnostic purposes ngs assembly software has been designed to infer a unique genome from a read set one of the challenges of re sequencing and de_novo sequencing from ngs_data is the reconstruction of a viral_population or viral swarm also to whom correspondence should be addressed referred to as a quasispecies the current approach for quasispecies characterization uses clonal sanger_sequencing however ngs has the advantage to detect minority variants at a higher_resolution than sanger at a competitive price several theoretical approaches for the viral swarm reconstruction have been published validated both via simulations and real ngs_data b three software have been implemented and released shorah predicthaplo http www cs unibas ch personen roth volker hivhaplotyper and vispa all for unix linux platforms an extensive review of methods has been recently_published by we introduce here qure quasispecies reconstruction algorithm a platform independent multi_threaded java implementation of the method by qure reconstructs automatically a set of error_free full gene or full genome variants from a collection of ngs_reads it is based on a heuristic_algorithm that maps reads to a reference_genome and then matches distinct viral_variants across a partition of the reference into overlapping intervals using multinomial distributions however the performance of reconstruction algorithms may depend on many factors including quasispecies diversity rate of heterogeneity read_length and coverage it has been shown that qure has advantages over other methods in reducing the chance to reconstruct false in silico recombinants the software has been designed for ngs_technologies that produce long_reads bp such as roche life_sciences http www my com
