dudes a top_down taxonomic profiler for metagenomics motivation species identification and quantification are common tasks in metagenomics and pathogen_detection studies the most recent techniques are built on mapping the sequenced_reads against a reference_database e g whole genomes marker_genes proteins followed by application dependent analysis steps although these methods have been proven to be useful in many scenarios there is still room for improvement in species and strain level detection mainly for low abundant organisms results we propose a new method dudes a reference based taxonomic profiler that introduces a novel top_down approach to analyze metagenomic next_generation ngs samples rather than predicting an organism presence in the sample based only on relative_abundances dudes first identifies possible candidates by comparing the strength of the read_mapping in each node of the taxonomic tree in an iterative manner instead of using the lowest_common we propose a new approach the deepest uncommon descendent we showed in experiments that dudes works for single and multiple_organisms and can identify low abundant taxonomic_groups with high_precision the fast increase of complete_genome available on public_databases has allowed better predictions of the microbial content from sequenced environmental and clinical samples in addition the fast evolution and decreasing costs of high_throughput as well as the development of fast and precise bioinformatics_tools to handle huge_amounts of data e g read_mappers assemblers are enabling the integration of automated computational_methods in clinical practice taxonomic or community profiling are common terms to define the process of identification of organisms and their quantification given a targeted or whole shotgun metagenomic_sequencing characterizing the taxonomic diversity is an initial and fundamental step to understand complex biological_processes diversity and functions of a microbial_community and it can be applied for pathogen_detection studies several tools have been recently_developed for this characterization with different approaches and applications considering only the reference based_methods that is methods that use reference_sequences to guide their analysis and classify sequences in the sample community profiling is categorized in two sub groups composition and similarity based composition based_methods extract information from the composition of sequences from both sample and database e g gc_content codon_usage and search for similarities between reads and references similarity or homology_based techniques are built on mapping or aligning the sequenced_reads against reference_databases and performing further analysis despite significant performance_improvements in the last years similarity analysis is still computationally_challenging due to the extremely high_throughput v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com of modern sequencing_machines and the accelerated_growth of available genomic_sequences some tools address this problem by reducing the database space selecting only marker_genes or a specific subset of sequences this simplification can speed up analysis but at the same time reduces the complexity and diversification of the references decreasing precision for more specific identifications other methods use custom databases of partial or whole genome_sequences additionally very efficient k_mer based read binning tools can also be used in some extension for profiling communities by selecting the targets with more associated sequences despite the remarkable recent_advances in this area and a vast number of tools available there is still a number of challenges from sequencing methods to bioinformatics_tools to integrate computational and automated approaches into molecular and metagenomics diagnostics specifically for community profiling there is still room for improvement in species and strain level detection which can have very similar genomic content and at the same time low abundances the high discordant number of available sequenced genome_sequences among several taxonomic_groups tgs poses another common problem where some organisms e g pathogens model_organisms are more studied and therefore overrepresented in the public sequence_databases aiming to solve those limitations we propose a new method dudes a reference based taxonomic profiler which introduces a novel top_down approach to analyze metagenomics ngs samples rather than predicting an organism presence in the sample based only on relative_abundances dudes first identifies possible candidates by comparing the strength of the read_mapping in each node of the taxonomic tree in an iterative manner instead of using the lowest_common lca a commonly used bottom up approach to solve ambiguities in identifications we propose a new approach the deepest uncommon descendent dud while the lca method solves ambiguous identifications by going back in the taxonomic tree to the lca the dud approach starts at the root node and tries to go for deeper taxonomic_levels even when ambiguities are found that way it is possible to have less conservative identifications in higher taxonomic_levels besides when the provided data does not allow a specific identification on higher levels our method identifies a small set of probable candidates among dozens of possibilities e g instead of stopping at species identification dudes will provide highly likely strains out of permutation_tests are performed to estimate p values between tgs and to identify the presence of them on each level we show in experiments and comparisons with state of the art tools that dudes works well for single and multiple organism detection can handle unequally represented references in the database and identifies low abundant tgs with high_precision dudes is open_source and it is available at http sf net p dudeswe described here a new method for profiling metagenomics samples with a completely new approach to explore the taxonomic tree_structure in our experiments with mock communities dudes achieved high_accuracy even in lower taxonomic_levels in an extreme scenario using only of the data with very few reads for some organisms dudes was the best tool overcoming gottcha and metaphlan surprisingly kraken a read binning tool had an excellent_performance in this set but with the disadvantage of a high number_of as expected in this sort of application dudes achieved two times fewer false_positives than kraken with the best auc and sensitivity value among all tested tools in the hmp experiment with of the dataset dudes performed as well as with the full set of reads showing that it can be very precise and stable with small_sample in a broader synthetic community set with more than million_reads dudes performed equally well even with high organism diversity from those results we see two main advantages of our tool first the method can be applied to profile datasets with low abundant organisms identifying tgs with very few matches second selecting only part of the dataset poses as a good approach to reduce sample_size allowing faster analysis smaller samples and the application of digital normalization generated good results in the hmp datasets without information_loss supplementary this strategy can be useful with the increasing amount of data generated by ngs_technologies decreasing mapping and execution time as well as memory_usage in the meantime a thorough analysis is necessary to better estimate the effects of such techniques digital normalization can skew abundancesknown pathogens were discovered from conventional microbiology and computational metagenomics analysis all samples were generated with a single illumina_miseq run paired_end downwards and should be carefully used when there is no ground_truth available dudes also performed well when applied to outbreak samples for pathogen_detection our methods results corroborated previous_findings and could be used as a fast alternative or confirmation tool to the pathogen_detection problem dudes can also be a fine_tuning tool for posterior analysis of lca based_methods identifications when they cannot achieve high taxonomic_levels the candidate selection approach used in dudes is not unique to dud method and it could also be applied in lca tools however dudes provides this functionality out of the box in addition the choice is not based only in a presence of a certain taxon given by counting read matches but also based on a comparison against the other taxons of the same taxonomic_level giving more significance to the candidate selection by transforming the information from read_mapping to bins of the same size and subsequently selecting the same number of bins for comparisons we could ameliorate the fact that tgs are not evenly represented in the database this technique provides a fair comparison among tgs regardless of their number of reference_sequences the dud method implemented in dudes provides a new way to analyze the taxonomic tree_structure we see several advantages in this method first it provides a reliable way to identify the presence of tgs making a comparison on each taxonomic_level it also can solve ambiguities in a less conservative manner first by allowing concurrent identifications and second by selecting a set of candidates when a specific identification is not possible in comparison with lca based tools we can point out some methodological_differences kraken like many lca based_methods applies lca on a sequence level and set the presence of tgs after all sequences were classified in the lca system dudes uses the taxonomic information to guide the analysis and it does not use the dud algorithm directly on a sequence level but on a taxonomic_group level it is important to notice that those two methods have opposite approaches and at the same time have been applied in a different way dudes implementation of the dud method relies on permutations tests among bin scores of nodes of the tree with correction_for that introduces statistical_significance to our comparisons and decisions with a rigid control of type i errors values to avoid false identifications dudes is a flexible tool that does not rely on a specific or custom_built databases or read_mappers and it can run using any set of reference_sequences e g draft_genomes marker_genes proteins not only whole genomes sequences as here presented the creation of any other custom database is straightforward with dudesdb our tool also provides a possibility to analyze sub trees from the taxonomic tree_structure by setting a start node and a final taxonomic_level desired giving a guided and fast identification in conclusion dudes propose a novel approach to the taxonomic_profiling problem with a top_down technique to analyze taxonomic tree structures the dud can be less conservative than current methods for solving ambiguities in the identifications and showed superior_performance in our experiments compared with recent tools being very precise at low coverages additionally the tool provides a strain identification method that can propose one or more strains presents in a sample we believe that dudes can be useful for several applications from complete metagenomics profiling to pathogen_detection studies
