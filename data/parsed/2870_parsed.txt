mepsa minimum energy pathway analysis for energy_landscapes from conformational studies to atomistic descriptions of enzymatic_reactions potential and free_energy can be used to describe biomolecular systems in detail however extracting the relevant data of complex d energy surfaces can sometimes be laborious in this article we present mepsa minimum energy path surface analysis a cross_platform user_friendly for the analysis of energy_landscapes from a transition_state perspective some of its most relevant_features are identification of all the barriers and minima of the landscape at once description of maxima edge profiles detection of the lowest energy path connecting two minima and generation of transition_state diagrams along these paths in addition to a built in plotting system mepsa can save most of the generated data into easily parseable text_files allowing more versatile uses of mepsas output such as the generation of molecular_dynamics restraints from a calculated path the development of efficient conformational_space sampling methodologies coupled with a dramatic_increase in the computational capacities and capabilities has made the calculation of energy_landscapes significantly more accessible a d energy surface may provide a lot of detailed information about biomolecular processes such as protein or nucleotide folding ligand_binding or enzymatic_reactions but the extraction and analysis of such data are often cumbersome tasks mepsa minimum energy path surface analysis provides a gui based tool to analyse these landscapes from a transition_state point_of making the analysis of d energy_landscapes agile
