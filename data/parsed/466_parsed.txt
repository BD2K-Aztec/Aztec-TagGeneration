databases_and arapath a knowledgebase for pathway analysis in arabidopsis studying plants using high_throughput genomics technologies is becoming routine but interpretation of genome_wide expression data in terms of biological_pathways remains a challenge partly due to the lack of pathway_databases to create a knowledgebase for plant pathway analysis we collected lists of differentially_expressed from gene_expression studies which constitute a molecular_signature database of various genetic and environmental_perturbations of arabidopsis in addition we extracted gene_sets from various sources such as gene_ontology kegg aracyc plant ontology predicted target_genes of micrornas and transcription_factors and computational gene_clusters defined by meta_analysis with this knowledgebase we applied gene_set to an expression_profile of cold_acclimation and identified expected functional_categories and pathways our results suggest that the arapath database can be used to generate specific testable_hypotheses regarding plant molecular_pathways from gene_expression data the coverage and quality of gene_set databases are critical to the effectiveness of all pathway analysis programs the molecular_signatures msigdb is a collection of gene_sets for pathway analysis in mammals using gene_set gsea or other similar methods the most recent version of msigdb contains sets of genes from various sources in addition to existing annotation databases such as gene_ontology and kegg lists of differentially_expressed were manually collected from hundreds of published gene_expression studies of genetic and chemical perturbations inclusion of these gene_sets in the database enables the detection of co regulation of genes similar to those induced by chemical and genetic_perturbations reported in the literature this will be useful in identifying shared regulatory_mechanisms complementing existing_tools such as atcast hormonometer and sample angler bar utoronto ca to facilitate pathway analysis for plant genomics we sought to construct a database similar to the msigdb so that the various pathway analysis programs could be easily used to analyze plant genomic_data recently extracted gene_sets from several sources including go kegg traspath and trasfac so that they could use gsea within the genetrail software in this study we compiled a large publically available gene_sets database by extracting information from existing databases and by collecting gene_expression from the literature we focused on arabidopsis_thaliana a widely_studied plant model_organism with large_amounts of genetic biochemical physiological and genomic_data available this resource will form the basis for making similar resources for other plants and even more distant_species such as plasmodium_falciparum malaria_parasite
