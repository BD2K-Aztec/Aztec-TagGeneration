systems_biology a system level approach for deciphering the transcriptional_response to prion_infection motivation deciphering the response of a complex biological system to an insulting event at the gene expression_level requires adopting theoretical_models that are more sophisticated than a one to one comparison i e t test here we investigate the ability of a novel reverse engineering_approach system response inference to unveil non obvious transcriptional signatures of the system response induced by prion_infection results to this end we analyze previously_published gene_expression data from which we extrapolate a putative full scale model of transcriptional genegene dependencies in the mouse central_nervous then we use this nominal model to interpret the gene_expression changes caused by prion replication aiming at selecting the genes primarily influenced by this perturbation our method sheds light on the mode of action of prions by identifying_key transcripts that are the most likely to be responsible for the overall transcriptional rearrangement from a nominal regulatory_network as a first result of our inference we have been able to predict known targets of prions i e prp c and to unveil the potential role of previously_unsuspected genes a major_challenge in systems_biology is to provide a global and quantitative_understanding of complex_diseases by means of high_throughput in a system level approach the synergistic response dictated by the cooperation and interplay of all the components within an organism is considered as a fundamental concept in the interpretation of omics_data recent efforts employ model driven analysis and transcriptomic_data for studying neurodegenerative_diseases however while dna_microarrays have been extensively used to comprehensively characterize the differentially_expressed degs the application of more sophisticated models working beyond simple differential_expression detection is still an open to whom correspondence should be addressed challenge to this end the ability of reverse_engineering algorithms to infer putative genegene_interactions functional_relationships and genome_scale regulatory_networks has been already proven to be successful although the applications to multicellular_organisms are still sporadic this class of algorithms represents a promising approach toward genome_wide studies of complex_diseases our aim in this article is to propose a novel reverse_engineering strategy in order to investigate transcriptional changes induced by prion propagation in mouse_models among the various neurodegenerative_disorders prion_diseases have captured the attention of the scientific_community due to their infectious nature and transmissibility the cellular form of the prion_protein prp c is the substrate for an autocatalytic reaction that through its recruitment and modification acts in the propagation of a disease_causing form denominated prp sc or prion this autocatalytic process leads to the formation of fibrils and amyloid_deposits and is associated to a progressive fatal damage of the brain_tissue importantly experimental_evidence has demonstrated that prp knockout and prp anchorless mice are resistant to infection in spite of the many approaches aimed at unveiling its physiological_functions the degree of overlap between the pathogenic dysfunction of the protein in prion_diseases and its normal role is still largely_unknown for a review see in such a complicated puzzle it is widely_accepted that since prp c is a key mediator for the neurotoxicity of prp sc studying its biological_functions through the identification of its related molecular partners may help unraveling the mechanisms underling prion dependent neurodegeneration in light of this observation we integrate here a recently_published transcriptional dataset monitoring prion propagation in mouse brain_tissues with independent gene_expression experiments performed under many diverse conditions the computational framework introduced in this article aims at deciphering transcriptional variations in the context of a systemwide regulatory_network moving from a single gene perspective to a system level analysis the procedure is composed of three steps in the first step using a compendium of gene_expression we obtain a genome_scale interaction graph of the mouse_brain then in a second step we refine the initial model via a multiple_regression scheme in the third step this linear regressive model is used to investigate expression changes associated to prion_infection where for each gene we estimate the influence of prionand one downregulated green node while the remaining three do not show any changes grey nodes by knowing the corresponding genetic regulatory_network d we can discriminate the coherent variations from the unexpected ones as shown in the example two of the genes that showed a significant expression variations are consistent with model_predictions i e the expression changes of genes x and y can be explained by the variation of gene z this is reflected by a skew distribution of discrepancies i e residues between model_predictions and observed data centered around f at the same time one transcript w is not responding coherently to the initial model the fact that its expression is unchanged when it should have been increased might relate to an anomalous direct effect of the pathology preventing a synergistic response between all the genes in the system hence the list of perturbed genes can be sensibly different from the standard degs identified from individual fold_change analysis b e propagation on its transcriptional_regulation in other words we systematically identify the genes that result perturbed with respect to the nominal model by a prion_infection a remarkable outcome of our network based strategy is the ability to identify prp c among the predicted prion targets in agreement with its role of primary substrate for prion replication this result is even more important if we consider that to our knowledge prion_infection has never been noted to interfere with the transcriptional_regulation of the prnp gene moreover the comparison between the prp c partners inferred on the nominal model and the prp sc targets predicted from the perturbed model allows to estimate the significance of the overlap between the two in a recent work more than dna chips were collected monitoring the transcriptional changes associated to various disease_stages prion strains and mice backgrounds the authors interpreted differentially_regulated in light of the known network of proteinprotein_interactions and hypothesized a specific temporal_order of the biological_processes involved in our study the same dataset ofis integrated with a large compendium i e affymetrix experiments of gene_expression associated to various conditions we first trained a gene network model a c see section on this large compendium next on the background of this initial network we evaluated the impact of an independent dataset containing gene_expression variations caused by a perturbing event that can be either an external agent i e prion inoculation or an endogenous perturbation i e prnp knockout in our interaction_network inoculated prions were modeled as hidden_variables nodes while a gene_knockout was interpreted as a node deletion we then investigated the behavior of the system upon prion_infection or prnp deletion with special_attention our outcome was different from previous_studies such as because we allowed a gene to be significant regardless of its individual difference in expression between infected and normal samples rather systemic gene_expression alterations are here considered and used in order to estimate the expected expression changes of the singular transcript in a systemlevel response a global transcriptional rearrangement is expected to counter balance the new operating point equilibrium if this regulation is not taking_place or in other words if the gene is not able to properly respond enhancing or repressing its transcription its contribution in the disease_progression should be taken into account as well therefore our approach can be considered to be complementary to the analysis performed inare discussed subsequently we consulted a drug database in search for druggable targets among the first neighbors identified in the extrapolated network for prps finally an analysis performed across human mouse and rat samples revealed co expression_patterns that were highly_conserved across these species
