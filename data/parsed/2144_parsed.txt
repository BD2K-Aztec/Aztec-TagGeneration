sequence_analysis gt scan identifying unique genomic targets a number of technologies including crispr_cas transcription_activator and zinc_finger nucle ases allow the user to target a chosen locus for genome_editing or regulatory interference specificity however is a major_problem and the targeted locus must be chosen with care to avoid inadvertently affecting other loci off targets in the genome to address this we have created genome target scan gt scan a flexible web_based that ranks all potential targets in a user selected region of a genome in terms of how many off targets they have gt scan gives the user flexibility to define the desired characteristics of targets and off targets via a simple target rule and its interactive output allows detailed inspection of each of the most promising_candidate targets gt scan can be used to identify optimal targets for crispr_cas but its flexibility gives it potential to be adapted to other genome targeting technologies as well availability_and gt scan can be run via the web at http gt scan targeted genome_editing and targeted transcriptional_control are essential tools of modern_molecular currently popular approaches include crispr_cas transcription_activator talens and zinc_finger nucleases zfns each of these technologies allows the user to design a system to target a specific genomic_sequence however because of the limited or uncertain sequence_specificity of technologies based on crispr_cas talens and zfns it is crucial that the intended genomic target be as unique as possible within the genome ensuring target uniqueness will reduce the number of off targets in the genome and minimize unintended genome_editing or regulatory_effects the first step in the effective use of any genome targeting technology is therefore to identify the possible target s within the region of interest e g gene exon or promoter that have the fewest off targets the ideal targets are subsequences within the region of interest that have no exact copies elsewhere in the genome because targeting affinity is a continuum near exact copies that differ at one or a few positions from the intended target are also undesirable furthermore the positions of the mismatches in off targets may also affect their affinity for example in the crispr_cas system mismatches in positions are generally less disruptive than those in positions an exception is a single nucleotide near the end of the target which has little or no effect on specificity regardless of the base_pair present in that position in zfn targets a central spacer has little affect on affinity target_selection should therefore consider both exact and near exact_matches to the target as off targets as well as the positions of mismatches in off targets the particular genome_editing technology being used may place other constraints on the ideal targets in addition to uniqueness for example crispr_cas targets must contain a particular short sequence at the end called a protospacer adjacent motif pam target_selection must consider such constraints as well from the alphabet acgtnx to illustrate consider the nt rulepair target rule xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxngg off target filter nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnrg which is appropriate for crispr_cas this target rule specifies that candidate targets must be nt_long and end with the ngg pam it also encodes the information that the most positions are low_specificity positions and the following are high_specificity positions except for the special character n which denotes a no specificity position the off target filter is composed of letters in the standard iupac alphabet for dna and the letter case has no effect with the given off target filter gt scan ignores any potential off target not ending with either an ngg or nag pam an example of the interactive html output produced by gt scan is shown in the job details on the left show that the user provided gt scan with a bp region of dna and specified scanning of the ensembl human_genome version grch gt scan detected that the candidate_region matches the reference strand of chromosome from position to gt scan ran for s and found and evaluated candidate targets within the candidate_region that match the bp rule chosen by the user the best candidate_target found by gt scan is unique in the human_genome in the exact match column and no other loci exist that differ from it by either one or two mismatches in the mismatch and mismatches columns furthermore only six loci in the human_genome differ from the candidate by as few as three mismatches six in the mismatches column the second best candidate_target present in the candidate_region is similarly unique in the human_genome allowing up to one mismatch however one locus differs from it by only two mismatches clicking on a candidate_target in the upper table selects it and displays its potential off targets in the lower table the first column of the lower table shows the chosen candidates potential off targets with mismatches highlighted in bold high low and no specificity positions are denoted using orange blue and green respectively the remaining columns show the number of mismatches in the potential off target its chromosomal location its gc_content and a clickable link to its locus in a genome_browser the gt scan algorithm extends the approach of mali et_al to generalized target rules its first step is to convert the target rule into a regular expression by replacing x x and n with wildcards gt scan then finds all the candidate targets in the user specified genomic_region by scanning the input_sequence for matches to the regular expression next for each candidate_target gt scan generates a list of all possible off targets by listing all possible words that match the candidate_target except possibly at positions where the rule contains the no specificity character n note that the running time of gt scan therefore scales exponentially with the number of no specificity characters in the rule time proportional to n where n is the number of no specificity characters gt scan then combines the possible off targets for all targets into a single list of words and uses the bowtie algorithm to identify all matches to these words anywhere in the selected genome genomic_locations with up to three mismatches to any of the words in the list are reported by bowtie finally gt scan creates its interactive output report after determining which off target locations correspond to each of the candidate targets gt scans report which can be downloaded as an html file is retained on the server for at least days gt scan fills a gap in the existing toolset for identifying optimal genomic targets crispr design is specifically engineered for target_selection for the crispr_cas system does not allow for user_defined rules and currently limits the candidate_region to bp versus bp for gt scan cas offinder is also designed specifically for crispr_cas does not allow userspecified rules and requires the user to specify the candidate targets cas ot cannot currently be run via the web
