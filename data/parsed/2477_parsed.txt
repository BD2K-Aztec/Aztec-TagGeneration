informed kmer selection for de_novo transcriptome_assembly motivation de_novo transcriptome_assembly is an integral part for many rna_seq workflows common applications include sequencing of non model_organisms cancer or meta transcrip tomes most de_novo transcriptome assemblers use the de_bruijn dbg as the underlying data_structure the quality of the assemblies produced by such assemblers is highly influenced by the exact word length k as such no single kmer value leads to optimal results instead dbgs over different kmer values are built and the assemblies are merged to improve sensitivity however no studies have investigated thoroughly the problem of automatically learning at which kmer value to stop the assembly instead a suboptimal selection of kmer values is often used in practice results here we investigate the contribution of a single kmer value in a multi kmer based assembly approach we find that a comparative clustering of related assemblies can be used to estimate the importance of an additional kmer assembly using a model_fit based algorithm we predict the kmer value at which no further assemblies are necessary our approach is tested with different de_novo assemblers for datasets with different coverage values and read_lengths further we suggest a simple post_processing step that significantly_improves the quality of multi kmer assemblies conclusion we provide an automatic method for limiting the number of kmer values without a significant loss in assembly_quality but with savings in assembly time this is a step_forward to making multi kmer methods more reliable and easier to use availability_and a general implementation of our approach can be found under https github com schulzlab kreation with the massive_amounts of rna_seq produced for many non model_organisms the interest for de_novo analyses of rna_seq has increased over the last few years these analyses include the de_novo of full_length transcripts expression_level computation of novel transcripts detecting differentially_expressed transcripts and detection of related genes in close species or polymorphism detection due to the large number of applications several methods have been proposed for the de_novo transcriptome_assembly most of these methods are based on building a de_bruijn dbg from the rna_seq the nodes of the dbg are substring of length k also know as kmers obtained from the reads and two nodes are connected if they have k overlap after obtaining the dbg various heuristic_algorithms are used to predict alternative transcripts from each dbg component these algorithms either use a single kmer value or merge transcripts generated from multiple kmer values to obtain a final non redundant assembly a multi kmer based_approach outperforms a single kmer based_approach as one kmer size rarely fits all genes large kmer values resolve repeats and regions with many errors whereas small kmer values are necessary to connect lowly_expressed transcripts that have low coverage regions hence even for most single kmer methods it is beneficial to run the assembler for different kmer values and merge the final results but the question about the core_set of kmer sizes that are needed to achieve a good quality assembly has received_little for multi kmer methods currently approaches i use the default kmer series of the assembler which is tuned on a limited number of datasets ii select an arbitrary subset of kmer sizes or iii use all possible kmer sizes for the assembly in practice that means that most often the resulting assembly is suboptimal either important kmer sizes are missed cases and therefore the sensitivity is reduced or the complete assembly contains more misassemblies than necessary and has wasted computational_resources case selecting a suitable kmer size for de_novo has been previously explored in the context of genomic_sequencing for example devised a method to select the best kmer size for de_novo simpson devised a method to estimate a number of interesting characteristics like paths with variations or repeats in the dbg for different kmer sizes from a fmindex over the reads further computing an optimal kmer range for de_novo read_error was also proposed however all these methods assume a uniform coverage distribution and are not applicable to nonuniform rna_seq here we investigate in detail how the number of kmer assemblies can be minimized to save computational_resources without a large loss in sensitivity and without using a reference annotation for assembly quality_assessment we introduce the kreation kmer range estimation algorithm that is based on two novel contributions i a comparative clustering of single kmer assemblies to define extended clusters which gives a notion of the assembly_quality and ii a heuristic_model assessment that allows to predict the optimal stopping point for a multi kmer assembly method we show that our new de_novo strategy automates the choice of kmer sizes to explore while achieving close to optimal_performance
