predicting site_specific human selective_pressure using evolutionary signatures motivation the identification of non coding functional_regions of the human_genome remains one of the main challenges of genomics by observing how a given region evolved over time one can detect signs of negative or positive_selection hinting that the region may be functional with the quickly increasing number of vertebrate_genomes to compare with our own this type of approach is set to become extremely powerful provided the right analytical_tools are available results a large number of approaches have been proposed to measure signs of past selective_pressure usually in the form of reduced mutation_rate here we propose a radically different approach to the detection of non coding functional region instead of measuring past evolutionary_rates we build a machine_learning classifier to predict current substitution_rates in human based on the inferred evolutionary_events that affected the region during vertebrate evolution we show that different types of evolutionary_events occurring along different branches of the phylogenetic_tree bring very different amounts of information we propose a number of simple machine_learning and show that a support_vector svm predictor clearly outperforms existing_tools at predicting human non coding functional sites comparison to external evidences of selection and regulatory_function confirms that these svm predictions are more accurate than those of other approaches availability the predictor and predictions made are available atone of the central goals of comparative_genomics is to use the comparison of genomes from different species to delineate functional_regions in those genomes since most functional_regions are under various degrees of negative_selection they tend to exhibit_higher interspecies sequence_conservation than their flanking neutral regions although mutations occur randomly in the genome though at rates that may vary according to sequence_context the rate at which they become fixed in a population depends among other things on the fitness of the mutated individuals whereas non functional_regions of the genome evolve mostly due to neutral drift functional_regions are for the most part under negative_selection i e most mutations are deleterious a consequence of this is that over time to whom correspondence should be addressed more mutations become fixed in non functional_regions than in functional_regions this principle is the foundation of phylogenetic_footprinting whereby one can hope to distinguish functional from non functional_regions of a given genome based on the observed number of mutations they have undergone during the evolution of a set of species this approach has been used with success to identify all kinds of functional_regions of the human and drosophila genomes among others including protein_coding non coding rna genes and transcription_factor a number of generic approaches have been developed to identify sites that appear to be under negative_selection based on comparative_genomics after identifying and aligning orthologous regions from two or more related species e g using multiz or mlagan one can scan the alignment to identify regions where the sequence_conservation is higher than expected early approaches dealt with a small number of genomes and evaluated conservation based on a sliding_window strategy more recent_approaches such as the very popular phastcons approach use a tree hidden_markov hmm to assign sites to one of several rate categories a strength of this type of approach is that it can take advantage of the fact that most functional_regions involve several consecutive sites while avoiding the drawback of using a fixed size window this family of approaches has been used to identify likely functional_regions in all kinds of species including vertebrates yeast and drosophila among others although most of these regions remain functionally uncharacterized to date with the number of genomes being sequenced quickly increasing the prospect of accurately measuring evolutionary_rates and selective_pressure at individual sites became an achievable goal several approaches were developed for this purpose including scone and gerp which both attempt to evaluate selective_pressure on a site by site basis what these approaches lose in specificity because of the fact that they do not combine signals from neighboring sites they gain in sensitivity since they are able to detect very small regions under selection a significant drawback of all these approaches is their assumption that the mutation_rate in a given region or at a given site has not changed during the evolution of the set of species considered although negative_selection in species ancestral to human and in sister species is clearly informative about selection in human it is only an indirect predictor of it past results do not guaranteeour goal is to develop a machine_learning predictor that will estimate the probability that a given site of the humanchimp ancestor will undergo a substitution along the branch leading to human given the complete set of evolutionary_events that took_place in that region during vertebrate evolution but excluding recent human evolution because the only way to predict positions where substitutions will become fixed is to predict their effect on fitness sites that are predicted to remain conserved with high_probability are likely to be functional ones it may seem counterintuitive that in order to predict the selective_pressure on a site in human we purposefully ignore evolutionary_events having taken place along that branch in fact although events along the human branch are excluded from our feature_set they play a very important role in our training_set as they form the label of each training example we also underscore the fact that although a substitution along the human branch is a very strong indicator of the absence of selective_pressure at that site such events are also extremely_rare of sites thus events along the human branch are much more productively used as labeled of a artificially balanced training_set than as features
