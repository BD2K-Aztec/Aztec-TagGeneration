physical module networks an integrative approach for reconstructing transcription_regulation motivation deciphering the complex mechanisms by which regulatory_networks control gene_expression remains_a while some studies infer regulation from dependencies between the expression levels of putative regulators and their targets others focus on measured physical_interactions results here we present physical module networks a unified_framework that combines a bayesian_model describing modules of co expressed genes and their shared regulation programs and a physical_interaction graph describing the proteinprotein_interactions and protein dna binding_events that coherently underlie this regulation using synthetic data we demonstrate that a physical module network model has similar recall and improved precision compared to a simple module network as it omits many false positive_regulators finally we show the power of physical module networks to reconstruct meaningful regulatory_pathways in the genetically perturbed yeast and during the yeast_cell as well as during the response of primary epithelial human cells to infection with h n influenza availability the pmn software is available free for academic use attranscription regulation plays_a in controlling gene_expression and cell function despite intensive_research the topology and function of most regulatory_circuits remain_largely the increasing availability of large_scale datasets such as genomics sequence gene_expression and proteindna or proteinprotein_interaction data provides an opportunity to automatically infer regulatory_circuits on a genome_wide scale three main types of approaches have been used to infer regulatory models from genomic_data each suffering from substantial limitations observational models including bayesian_networks and their extensions e g rely on dependencies between the expression_profiles of regulators to those of their target_genes these can handle abundant expression data but often fail to distinguish true regulation from co expression perturbational models associate targets to factors based on the effect of the factors genetic_manipulation on gene_expression capaldi to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint these identify functional effects but may fail to correctly distinguish direct from indirect targets finally physical_models associate regulatory_factors with the targets whose promoters they bind or where a cis regulatory_site is present e g these identify molecular_targets but some of those may be functionally silent thus a major_challenge is to build a realistic molecular and functional model of gene_regulation that combines changes in gene_expression with the underlying physical_interactions previous attempts toward this goal have mostly introduced new hypotheses only at one level while using the other level to support them these include works that detect functional_modules by integrating phenotypic and physical data or that reconstruct or annotate signaling_pathways or binding_events a notable_exception integrated binding sequence and expression information in a bayesian_framework to identify both clusters of genes and their transcriptional_regulators however this work did not consider upstream signaling_pathways here we present physical module networks pmn a novel probabilistic graphical method that learns transcriptional_networks by combining gene_expression proteinprotein and proteindna binding data the pmn model based on module networks discovers modules of co expressed genes sets of regulators that control their activity and a path of physical_interactions that connects the regulators to their target module the modules regulators and paths are inferred simultaneously resulting in the most probable physical model of gene_regulation that underlies the observed data using synthetic data we show that the addition of physical_interactions to the simple module network mn model improves the models precision without compromising recall we evaluate the biological power of the model in two yeast systems gene perturbations and cell_cycle and a human dataset response of epithelial_cells to flu infection in each case the learned modules and pathways are biologically sound and lead to novel insights emphasizing the power of integrated probabilistic_models here we presented pmns a probabilistic graphical method that learns transcriptional_networks by combining phenotypic_effects changes in gene_expression with their underlying physical mechanism proteinprotein and proteindna_interactions we evaluated the model by comparing to a simple mn on synthetic data and by reconstructing coherent pathways and regulation in yeast and human data a pmn builds and subtantially extends on mns a special_case of a bayesian_network that is defined over a set of gene_modules rather than single genes the main_drawback of a simple mn is that each regulator is chosen solely based on its expression pattern limiting its ability to distinguish between true regulators and false_positives the pmn addresses this limitation by presenting additional constraints on the choice of regulators requiring a physical pathway that connects it to some of the target_genes indeed as we have shown on synthetic data the added physical_interactions increase the models precision without compromising recall furthermore the pmn presents a new hypothesis for the regulation_mechanism we showed that it can determine coherent pathways and regulatory_mechanisms that connect genetic_perturbations to target_genes in yeast and human data as well as coherent modules regulators and pathways in the yeast_cell system notably adding physical_interactions also carries disadvantages especially when interaction data are very partial and noisy pmn may miss a true regulator if a full regulation path is missing hurting recall the reconstructed pathways are sensitive to noise in the interaction measurements and certain types of interactions protein_modifications chromatin occupancy cellular_localization as well as alternative_splicing are not modeled in the simple interaction graph nevertheless pmns success in several realistic cases in yeast and human suggest that it provides an important advance toward reconstructing models of regulatory_circuits in eukaryotic_cells
