psekraac a flexible web_server for generating pseudo k tuple reduced amino_acids composition the reduced amino_acids perform powerful ability for both simplifying protein complexity and identifying_functional conserved_regions however dealing with different protein problems may need different kinds of cluster methods encouraged by the success of pseudo amino_acid pseaac algorithm we developed a freely_available web_server called psekraac the pseudo k tuple reduced amino_acids composition by implementing reduced amino_acid alphabets the protein complexity can be significantly simplified which leads to decrease chance of overfitting lower computational handicap and reduce information redundancy psekraac delivers more capability for protein research by incorporating three crucial parameters that describes protein composition users can easily generate many different modes of psekraac tailored to their needs by selecting various reduced amino_acids alphabets and other characteristic parameters it is anticipated that the psekraac web_server will become a very useful tool in computational proteomics and protein sequence_analysis with the emergence of big_data in the post genomic age an enormous amount of data had been generated which requires efficient computational_methods for rapid and effective identification of biological_features contained in sequences even more so in the study of proteomics because of the structure of protein_exhibits more complexity when compared to nucleotide due to the possible amino_acid peptides to the nucleic bases therefore the complexity and information content are expanded exponentially when polypeptides are formed also protein_sequence vary_widely in length which poses additional difficulty for incorporating the sequence_order information consistently in both dataset construction and algorithm formulation to overcome these obstacles the pseudo amino_acid pseaac algorithm was proposed in the year this concept has been widely utilized in nearly all areas of computational proteomics and was selected as one of the key topics in molecular science for drug_development and biomedicine encouraged by the success of this idea various approaches similar to pseaac had been simulated to deal with problems in protein and protein related systems including three powerful software programs for generating different modes of pseaac pseaac builder propy and pse in one when dealing with extremely_large dimensions can potentially cause overfitting or high_dimension disaster restrict by computation handicap and increase information redundancy which results in bad prediction_accuracy to solve this problem we present a convenient approaches based on the idea of pseudo reduced amino_acid pseraac and provide a flexible and user_friendly web_server for pseudo k tuple reduced amino_acids composition psekraac http bigdata imu edu cn psekraac where users can easily generate many different modes of psekraac tailored to their needs by selecting various reduced amino_acids alphabets and other characteristic parameters types of reduced amino_acid alphabets were proposed to generate various different modes of pseraac
