phocos inferring multi feature phenotypic crosstalk networks motivation quantification of cellular changes to perturbations can provide a powerful approach to infer crosstalk among molecular_components in biological_networks existing crosstalk inference methods conduct network structure_learning based on a single phenotypic feature e g abundance of a biomarker these approaches are insufficient for analyzing perturbation data that can contain information about multiple features e g abundance activity or localization of each biomarker results we propose a computational framework for inferring phenotypic crosstalk phocos that is suitable for high content microscopy or other modalities that capture multiple_phenotypes per biomarker phocos uses a robust graph learning paradigm to predict direct effects from potential indirect_effects and identify errors owing to noise or missing links the result is a multi feature sparse network that parsimoniously captures direct and strong interactions across phenotypic attributes of multiple_biomarkers we use simulated and biological data to demonstrate the ability of phocos to recover multi attribute crosstalk networks from cellular perturbation assays availability_and phocos is available in open_source at https github com a fundamental challenge in molecular_biology is to understand how information flows through complex signal_transduction networks targeted perturbation experiments provide a powerful approach for identifying evidence of crosstalk or influence between signaling_components or pathways generally these approaches allow one to assess whether perturbing one part of a signaling_pathway alters the behavior of another part investigation of crosstalk could be at the level of individual components e g specific genes or proteins or collections of components e g modules inferring crosstalk from experimental perturbation data conceptually requires two steps i quantification of perturbation induced changes among selected biomarkers of the network and ii application of statistical_approaches that convert these observed changes into a crosstalk graph most approaches for inferring crosstalk model interactions are based on a single attribute or feature of a biomarker this is sufficient for modeling interactions for many high_throughput assays for example rna abundance in transcriptomics is commonly_studied however this approach is not adequate in cases where it is possible or desired to investigate multiple different features per biomarker in the case of proteomics both abundance and level of modification e g phosphorylation could be simultaneously_measured per protein species in high_content assaysthe focus of our current studyhundreds of different features can be extracted for each biomarker per cell such features could include standard biomarker measurements such as intensity reflecting biomarker abundance or activity level or localization reflecting properties such as cytosolic versus nuclear levels or unpolarized versus polarized states as well as other measurements such as texture or statistical_properties of the brightest pixels thus the challenge is that perturbation assays can cause simultaneous changes to multiple phenotypic_features even on the same biomarker information can be lost when modeling crosstalk for a single_feature right cartoon when only examining the intensity feature a perturbation to biomarker a may have no effect on biomarker b however the perturbation may alter the localization of b from wild_type for example in the classic mapk signaling_cascade activated mapkkk protein may be observed to alter the activation level of its downstream mapkk partner whereas activated mapkk protein may be observed to alter both the activity levels and localization of its downstream transcription_factor mapk partner we propose phocos as a framework for inferring multi feature crosstalk networks from perturbation assays previous_approaches have been developed to analyze gene_regulatory from image readouts these approaches focused on single measurements on each biomarker to the best of our knowledge phocos is the first crosstalk inference_method that explicitly considers the potential interactions among different features attributes of biomarkers the contributions of phocos are summarized in the following three points first from the view of data analysis we conducted feature screening to identify common phenotypic classes from patterns of feature deviation profiles in particular for microscopy there are many possible features that could be extracted from images and it is often not obvious which features offer novel insights into crosstalk our feature screening step identified a small number of archetypical deviation patterns which helped reduce the complexity of graph inference second from the view of graph inference we proposed a dualsparse optimization framework for direct effect pursuit from experimental_observations the effectiveness of phocos was demonstrated by its ability to identify core direct effect motifs from missing links noise and indirect_effects from simulation_studies phocos handled difficult cases with noise and missing links well for directeffect graph learning while the phocos reduction method is motivated by the multi feature network problem it is based on a general framework that can be directly applied to other network_inference problems e g for gene or protein_interaction third from the view of systems_biology we applied phocos to study multiple phenotypic_responses across multiple modules and time periods defined within the neutrophil polarization network consistent with previous work we found that crosstalk can evolve dynamically and differently across different features more importantly we were able to identify novel cross feature interactions that were missed by single_feature graph learning approaches with the ability to infer multi feature crosstalk influence networks comes both increased resolution and increased complexity depending on the features selected some links may be immediately interpretable e g activity levels of a affect localization of b while others e g activity levels of a affect the texture of b may be difficult_to directly in terms of molecular_mechanisms and interactions as previously mentioned new techniques including optogenetics will allow perturbation of specific features while holding others constant these experimental_approaches will both inspire the development of multi feature crosstalk inference methods such as phocos and be invaluable for testing predictions phocos has the potential to help provide deeper insights into how biological_networks transduce information content rich approaches for monitoring cellular_phenotypes such as microcopy provide multi_dimensional views into how molecular_components respond to perturbations phocos can use these data to provide high_resolution views of which phenotypic attributes support interaction among biomarkers while phocos was developed and tested on microscopy_images it can be extended to infer crossfeature interactions for other biological_datasets that capture multiattributes per biomarker
