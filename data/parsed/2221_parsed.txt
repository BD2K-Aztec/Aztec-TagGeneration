databases_and hmchip a database and web_server for exploring publicly_available human and mouse chip_seq and chip_chip data hmchip is a database of genome_wide chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip data in human and mouse currently the database contains samples from chip_seq and chip_chip experiments representing a total of proteins and proteindna_interactions a web_server provides interface for database query proteindna binding intensities can be retrieved from individual samples for user provided genomic_regions the retrieved intensities can be used to cluster samples and genomic_regions to facilitate exploration of combinatorial patterns cell_type dependencies and cross sample variability of proteindna_interactions chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip followed by genome tiling_array hybridization chip_chip and chip coupled with massively_parallel chip_seq are powerful technologies to study genome_wide protein_dna large_amounts of chip_chip and chip_seq have been made publicly_available in the past_few these data contain rich_information which can be synthesized to make new discoveries or used to boost analysis of new datasets for example in order to study the role of a transcription_factor tf sox in mouse embryonic_stem mesc differentiation determined sox binding_sites in blastocyst derived extraembryonic stem_cells xen using chip_chip a question of interest is what other tfs can bind to the same cis_regulatory and potentially interact with sox while it is difficult for a single lab to experimentally test binding of hundreds of mouse tfs to sox binding_sites one can potentially answer the question by analyzing chip data in public domains representing diverse proteins and cell_types as another example c_myc has been extensively_studied by many labs by analyzing c_myc binding data from different cellular contexts collected by different labs one might be to whom correspondence should be addressed able to identify different classes of c_myc binding_sites based on their cell_type dependencies a prerequisite for utilizing the public chip data is the ability to freely query retrieve normalize and compare binding intensities from arbitrary samples and genomic_regions currently this is a daunting task for most researchers working on human and mouse existing raw data_repositories such as the ncbi gene_expression geo and sequence_read sra do not provide tools for interactively exploring the chip data the ucsc_genome provides functionalities for visualizing the data but its chip data_collection is limited although the browser is good at exploring one genomic_region at a time it is incapable of conveniently retrieving normalizing and comparing data from many genomic_regions the recently_developed chip x database has collected tf target gene_lists from published chip studies however it does not provide tools for retrieving and comparing binding intensities across samples hmchip is developed in this context to meet the pressing need for exploring proteindna binding intensities in publicly_available chip data peak list sample binding intensity profiles and a log_fold profile of the experiment generated by comparing chip and control binding intensities for each sample several quality_measures are provided including percentage of the genome covered by peaks average signal_to and total read_count in the sample if the sample is chip_seq method in supplementary_material from the query results users can select samples of interest provide a list of genomic_regions and provide an email address by clicking a run button binding intensities from the selected samples will be retrieved for the genomic_regions provided saved into a text_file and returned to users through email method in supplementary_material if no email address is provided the results will be returned through a web_page to facilitate crosssample comparisons intensity data from different samples will be normalized and the normalized data will be returned in a separate text_file a heat map showing the hierarchical_clustering of genomic_regions and samples based on the normalized intensities will be returned as well methods and in supplementary_material for each genomic_region and each peak list with samples selected hmchip will return a binary value to indicate the regions binding status in that peak list and a number measuring the log foldchange between chip and control binding intensities in the region method in supplementary_material data retrieved from hmchip can be fed into other software_tools to carry out further analyses such as customized clustering using dchip or correlating binding intensities with gene_expression data hmchip removes a major_hurdle for scientists to retrieve and utilize chip data in public domains in future it will be gradually enhanced to include more data and functionalities e g tools for exploring spatial binding_patterns across multiple chip samples our ultimate_goal is to turn it into a toolbox for biologists to efficiently integrate publicly_available chip_chip and chip_seq to study gene_regulation and make novel discoveries
