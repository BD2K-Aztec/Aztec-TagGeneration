data_and ict isotope correction toolbox isotope tracer experiments are an invaluable technique to analyze and study the metabolism of biological_systems however isotope labeling experiments are often affected by naturally abundant isotopes especially in cases where mass_spectrometric methods make use of derivatiza tion the correction of these additive interferencesin particular for complex isotopic systemsis numerically challenging and still an emerging field of research when positional_information is generated via collision_induced even more complex calculations for isotopic interference correction are necessary so_far no freely_available tools can handle tandem mass spectrom etry data we present isotope correction toolbox a program that corrects tandem mass_isotopomer data from tandem_mass experiments isotope correction toolbox is written in the multi_platform programming_language perl and therefore can be used on all commonly available computer platforms isotope labeling experiments play_a in exploring studying and understanding metabolic_pathways in biological_systems however the obtained isotopolog and tandem mass_isotopomer signals are biased by natural abundant isotopes of the native molecules and of atoms introduced via derivatization consequently the natural abundance results in a distortion of the experimental_data the correction of mass_spectrometry data is still an emerging field of research as it is non trivial and numerically challenging in particular if a large number of isotopes are considered during the correction procedure there exist several software_tools which are able to compute the contribution of intensities from the natural abundant isotopes on the measured intensities and hence are capable to correct the measured data pynac http files cesb uky edu software pynac is a correction software written in the programming_language python pynac benefits from the multi_platform capabilities of python is highly_flexible by using text_files for configuration and setup and can account for any number of isotopes however it is not able to correct data from tandem_mass experiments another prominent available program is isocor http metasys insa toulouse fr software isocor isocor is also implemented in python and is a fast and excellent tool to correct mass_spectrometry data it supports the correction of the natural abundance of the tracer at unlabeled positions and allows to take into account the isotopic purity of the labeling source furthermore in isocor any isotope and not only c can be used as tracer though isocor is also not able to deal with tandem mass_isotopomer data in this application note wepresent a novel software_tool named isotope correction toolbox ict which is also able to deal with ion fragmentation and hence can correct mass_spectra obtained by tandem_mass we have successfully used our program on linux mac os x and windows computers to verify the results of ict we performed numerous correction runs of non fragmentation mass_spectrometry data and compared them with results which we obtained by using isocor we found an excellent_agreement between the corrected data computed by ict and isocor the verification of the correction procedure for tandem_mass data was performed by comparing the results of ict with a large set of corrected data which we obtained by utilizing a slow and inefficient microsoft_excel based method typically the correction for a smaller problem takes a fraction of a second for instance running a batch of correction procedures taking_into the natural abundance of carbon and silicon for a variety of compounds such as amino_acids and low_molecular organic_acids took approximately s larger problems such as the correction of interferences caused by the natural abundance of carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and silicon for ethoximated trimethylsilylated sedoheptulose phosphate c h n o p si can usually be done within less than s
