systems_biology rulebender a visual interface for rule_based modeling rule_based modeling rbm is a powerful and increasingly popular_approach to modeling intracellular biochemistry current interfaces for rbm are predominantly text_based and command_line driven better visual tools are needed to make rbm accessible to a broad range of users to make specification of models less error_prone and to improve workflows we present rulebender an open_source visual interface that facilitates interactive debugging simulation and analysis of rbms availability rulebender is freely_available for mac windows and linux at http rulebender org rule_based modeling rbm enables precise and concise specification of biochemical_models by representing molecules as structured objects and molecular_interactions as rules for transforming the attributes of these objects the two most common languages for specifying rbms and the bionetgen language have nearly identical syntax and semantics based on graphs and graph rewriting each language and associated modeling framework has been used to construct a wide_variety of models of biochemical_processes in this article we focus on the bionetgen framework while the potential benefits of rbm to biology are outstanding building an rbm and detecting and correcting modeling errors i e debugging can be tedious and frustrating rbms are typically defined by the user via a text_file the user defines a set of molecules and proceeds to write rules_governing their interactions derived from specific knowledge about the system although individual rules are easy to write it is often difficult to fully grasp the implications of a set of rules the challenge in grasping the global perspective is particularly acute when trying to understand models written by different researchers this problem complicates debugging and reduces the accessibility of rbm especially for users with limited programming experience simulating and analyzing rbms pose additional challenges once a working_model has been defined an rbm can be simulated using a number of different approaches including ordinary_differential stochastic_simulations or particle based stochastic_simulations a visualization viewer window middle and a simulation_results viewer window right rulebenders main features include syntax checking syntax highlighting visual global model exploration integrated execution support for multiple simulation modules simulation journaling interactive plotting including comparison of multiple datasets and parameter scanning action of a rule selecting an edge brings up a list of all rules that create or destroy bonds between the linked components selecting one of these rules brings up bubble sets that highlight separately the components modified by the rule called the reaction_center and the components whose states are required to have specified values for the rule to be applied called the reaction context as shown_inand supplementary the contact_map provides global organization for a rule set and enables the user to browse the rules in a systematic fashion an alternative global view is the influence graph which shows interactions between the rules a rule can activate inhibit another rule by producing consuming a reactant required by the other rule selecting a rule node displays the rule text in the lower right information pane of the visualization window supplementary both visualizations enable quick identification of orphan molecules or rules that do not interact with other molecules rules thus further supporting understanding and debugging of the models simulation and results analysis bionetgen simulator commands can be performed on the model currently loaded in the editor window if the model is valid simulation_results are displayed in the simulation_results viewer otherwise syntax errors and other output are reported via the console in the lower section of the editor window parameter scanning supplementary which allows the researcher to interactively see the effects of varying the value of a single model parameter is also supported the simulation_results along with the model files parameters scan results etc are stored and managed by rulebender through a journaling system that allows users to distinguish simulation_results the simulation_results viewer contains an explorer in the upper left quadrant of the window right panel which makes it easy to retrieve the exact version of the model that produced a specific set of results network files generated from a model may be displayed with syntax highlighting supplementary charts in linear or log scale show the time series for concentrations of chemical_species and observables as seen in the far right window of any number of species and observables can be compared in the same chart supplementary furthermore multiple simulation runs can be compared in order to analyze the effects of changing the model supplementary a species and observables browser is also provided lower left of the results viewer in graph_based models of species and observables similar to the contact_map are displayed by selecting an observable in the simulation_results viewer supplementary rulebender is a powerful_tool for the development of rbms that makes rbm accessible to users with a wide_range of computational experience while providing a uniform interface across computing platforms the support of rbm creation debugging and interactive_visualization expedites the rbm learning_process and reduces model construction time while built in model_simulation and analysis with multiple linked views streamline the execution and analysis of newly created models and generated networks a development cycle that includes close interaction with expert users allows rulebender to better serve the needs of the systems_biology community
