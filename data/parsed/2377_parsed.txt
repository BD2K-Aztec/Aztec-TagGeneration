systems_biology improved structure function and compatibility for cellprofiler modular high_throughput image_analysis there is a strong and growing need in the biology research_community for accurate automated_image here we describe cellprofiler which has been engineered to meet the needs of its growing user base it is more robust and user_friendly with new algorithms and features to facilitate high_throughput work imagej plugins can now be run within a cellprofiler pipeline cellprofiler is freely_available open_source that enables researchers without training in computer programming to measure biological phenotypes quantitatively and automatically from thousands of images with an interface designed by biologists and underlying algorithms developed by computer scientists cellprofiler bridges the gap between advanced image_analysis algorithms and scientists who lack computational expertise in the years since its publication it has been rapidly adopted by the worldwide biological community and cited in more than articles roughly_half of its users are outside the usa cellprofiler was initially designed for high_throughput image_analysis but is often used for small_scale projects this highlights the trend toward quantifying information in images regardless of experiment size cellprofilers interface lets researchers build customized chains of interoperable image_analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects and features in images these modular pipelines can be saved and shared with colleagues cellprofiler has been used to measure individual cells colonies of cells and whole organisms in a wide_range of assays e g counting cells measuring staining intensities and scoring complex phenotypes with machine to whom correspondence should be addressed learning and at many experimental scales from a few to hundreds of thousands of images a variety of cell_types have been analyzed including budding_yeast drosophila mouse rat and dozens of human cell_types the diverse measurements generated by cellprofiler provide raw_material for machine_learning that can identify challenging phenotypes cellprofiler fills a unique role in the software landscape it is a modular high_throughput open_source biological image_analysis package and it won the bio it world best practices award in it informatics cellprofiler improves upon the design of the original_version resulting in professionally engineered software with improved usability and functionality as well as integration with other open_source image related software
