systems_biology a simulator for spatially extended kappa models spatial kappa is a simulator of models written in a variant of the rule_based stochastic modelling language kappa with spatial extensions availability the spatial kappa simulator is an open_source project licensed under the lgplv with java source binaries and manual available atwe have presented in this note sk a language and simulator to embed rule_based in space although equivalent features exist in other simulation tools the complete feature_set below is currently unique flexible compartment definitions support arbitrary dimensions and connectivity between compartments use of channels to simplify model construction defined once they can be used repeatedly within rules which involve a spatial element complex composition based diffusion_rates that can vary with size and composition of a complex to represent e g complexes diffusing more slowly as they grow larger multicompartment complexes allowing for large_aggregates or transmembrane arrangements diffusion of multicompartment complexes via special multisource channels the tool for the d d visualization of sk models see is available at https github com lptolik spkappar the formal description of the sk language examples and the grammar can be found in the user_manual distributed with the source_code
