gene_expression efficient rna isoform identification and quantification from rna_seq with network flows motivation several state of the art methods for isoform identification and quantification are based on regularized_regression such as the lasso however explicitly listing thepossibly exponentiallylarge set of candidate transcripts is intractable for genes with many exons for this reason existing_approaches using the penalty are either restricted to genes with few exons or only run the regression algorithm on a small set of preselected isoforms results we introduce a new technique called flipflop which can efficiently tackle the sparse estimation problem on the full set of candidate isoforms by using network flow optimization our technique removes the need of a preselection step leading to better isoform identification while keeping a low_computational experiments with synthetic and real rna_seq confirm that our approach is more accurate than alternative_methods and one of the fastest available availability_and source_code is freely_available as an r package from the bioconductor web_site www bioconductor org and more information is available atover the past_decade quantitation of mrna_molecules in a cell_population has become a popular_approach to study the effect of several factors on cellular activity typical applications include the detection of genes whose expression varies between two or more populations of samples differential analysis classification of samples based on gene_expression vant and clustering which consists of identifying a grouping structure in a sample set while probe based dna microarray_technologies only allow quantitating mrna_molecules whose sequence is known in advance the recent development of deep_sequencing has removed this restriction more precisely rna_seq technologies allow the sequencing of cdna molecules obtained by reverse transcription of rna_molecules present in the cell consequently any transcript can be sequenced and therefore quantitated even though its sequence might not be available a priori for designing a specific probe in addition to facilitating the study of non coding parts of known genomes and organisms whose genome has not been sequenced rna_seq technologies facilitate the quantitation of alternatively_spliced genes genes in eukaryote cells contain a succession of exon and intron sequences transcription results in a pre_mrna molecule from which most introns are removed and some exons are retained during a processing step called rna_splicing it is estimated that of multiexonic genes are subject to alternative_splicing the set of exons retained during splicing can vary resulting for the same gene in different versions of the mrna referred to as transcripts or isoforms identification and quantification of isoforms present in a sample is of outmost interest because different isoforms can later be translated as different proteins detection of isoforms whose presence or quantity varies between samples may lead to new biomarkers and highlight novel biological_processes invisible at the gene level sequencing_technologies are well suited to transcript quantitation as the read density observed along the different exons of a gene provide information on which alternatively_spliced mrnas were expressed in the sample and in which proportions because the read_length is typically smaller than the mrna molecule of a transcript identifying and quantifying the transcripts is however difficult an observed read_mapping to a particular exon may come from an mrna molecule of any transcript containing this exon some methods consider that the set of expressed isoforms or a candidate superset is known in advance in which case the only problem is to estimate their expression however little is known in practice about the possible isoforms of genes and restricting oneself to isoforms that have been described in the literature may lead to missing new ones two main paradigms have been used so_far to estimate expression at the transcript_level while allowing de_novo transcript discovery on the one hand the cufflinks software_package proceeds in two separate steps to identify expressed isoforms and estimate their abundance it first estimates the list of alternatively_spliced by building a small set of isoforms containing all observed exons and exon_junctions in a second step the expression of each transcript is quantified by likelihood_maximization given the list of transcripts identification and quantification are therefore done to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work independently on the other hand a second family of methods jointly estimates the set of transcripts and their expression using a penalized likelihood approach these methods model the likelihood of the expression of all possible transcripts possibly after some preselection and the penalty encourages sparse solutions that have a few expressed transcripts the two step approach of cufflinks is reasonably fast but does not exploit the observed read density along the gene which can be a valuable information to identify the set of transcripts this is a conclusion drawn experimentally using methods from the second paradigm see bohnert and r atsch to summarize the first paradigm is fast but can be statistically less powerful than the second one in some cases whereas the second paradigm suffers from the exponential number of candidate isoforms and becomes intractable for genes with many exons the contribution of this article is to allow penalized regression_methods from the second family to run efficiently without prefiltering the set of isoform candidates although they solve a nonsmooth optimization_problem over an exponential number of variables to do so we show that the penalized likelihood_maximization can be reformulated as a convex cost network flow problem which can be solved efficiently note that a significantly different approach was adopted byfor non convex penalty even though the problem they address is np_hard they perform simultaneous isoform identification and quantification without explicitly enumerating all possible transcripts by using mixed integer_programming techniques the article is organized as follows section introduces the statistical_model section and the penalized likelihood approach section we follow our model is similar to the one used by but properly models reads that cover more than two exons effectively taking_advantage of longer_reads we then reformulate the model as a path selection problem over a particular graph section and present our method in sections called flipflop fast lasso based isoform prediction as a flow problem for solving it efficiently section empirically compares our approach with the state of the art on simulated and real sequencing_data our experiments show that our approach has higher accuracy in isoform discovery than methods that treat discovery and abundance estimation as two separate steps and that it runs significantly_faster than methods explicitly listing the candidate isoforms we discuss the implications of our results in section simultaneously tackling identification and quantitation using penalized likelihood_maximization is known to be a powerful approach to estimate the set of expressed transcripts however existing regularized_regression techniques cannot deal with genes that contain too many exons as the set of candidate isoforms grows exponentially with the number n of exons by leveraging network flow optimization algorithms we discover a few expressed transcripts among the exponential number of
