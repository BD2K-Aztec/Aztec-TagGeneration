genome_analysis genome fusion_detection a novel method to detect fusion_genes from snp_array motivation fusion_genes result from genomic_rearrangements such as deletions amplifications and translocations such rearrangements can also frequently be observed in cancer and have been postulated as driving event in cancer development to detect them one needs to analyze the transition_region of two segments with different copy_number the location where fusions are known to occur finding fusion_genes is essential to understanding cancer development and may lead to new therapeutic_approaches results here we present a novel method the genomic fusion_detection algorithm to predict fusion_genes on a genomic_level based on snp_array this algorithm detects genes at the transition_region of segments with copy_number with the application of defined constraints certain properties of the detected genes are evaluated to predict whether they may be fused we evaluated our prediction by calculating the observed frequency of known fusions in both primary_cancers and cell_lines we tested a set of cell_lines positive for the bcr_abl and prostate_cancers positive for the tmprss_erg we could detect the fusions in all positive cell_lines but not in the negative controls availability the algorithm is available from the supplement genomic_alterations are changes within the genomic_sequence due to deletions amplifications translocations and other genomic_rearrangements these alterations can affect the balance of gene_regulation networks and thus the proliferation and survival of cells in consequence genomic_alterations are often observed in cancer now widely_accepted as a disease with a strong genetic_component based on the insight that cancer is almost always accompanied by rather severe changes on the genetic level research in the field of oncogenomics focuses on such mutation_events most likely to result in deregulation i e inactivation or activation of genes inactivation_of for example plays_a in cancer development the first detected functional fusion of two genes was found in chronic_myeloid cml it is a genomic translocation generated on chromosome by a translocation of the long_arm to chromosome causing a truncated chromosome the so_called philadelphia_chromosome and an elongated chromosome the resulting fusion is named after the two involved genes bcr_abl it was shown that this fusion plays an important role in the development of cml even though the relevance of translocation events in cancer development was pointed_out it was widely assumed that this is a unique feature of leukemia one reason for this was the lack of technologies to detect complex structural_rearrangements within the genome with high_resolution hence fusion_genes remained unexplored for some time this view changed with the decoding of the human_genome and the associated substantial progress in the development of laboratory and bioinformatics_methods the advent_of methods like rna_sequencing rna_seq and high_resolution microarrays have enabled accurate descriptions of structural changes within the genome this advancement in technology facilitated the detection of further fusions e g the eml_alk fusion in lung_cancer and the tmprss_erg in prostate_cancer their identification and characterization led to the conclusion that fusion_genes also play_an in solid_cancers dramatically changing the interest in fusion_genes as a consequence the available information on cancer_genomes and their chromosomal_aberrations has increased_significantly in the past_few leading to drugs for inhibiting and diagnostic kits for detecting them pfizer for example developed crizotinib a drug to inhibit the alk part of the eml_alk fusion novartis ag developed imatinib trade name glivec targeting the protein encoded by bcr_abl and inhibiting the activity of the tyrosine_kinase abl recently it was shown that sorafenib trade name nexavar developed by bayer ag also inhibits bcr_abl kinase_activities including the imatinibresistant e k and t i mutants of this fusion the fusion of the tmprss gene with e twenty six ets family genes like etv erg and etv occurs in up to of all prostate_cancers and is therefore a specific to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution

technologies http www china meditech com and kreatech http www kreatech com have developed kits to detect the fusion of tmprss with an ets family_member increasing the sensitivity of diagnosing prostate_cancer the importance of research in this field is shown by the high success_rate of these drugs and diagnostic kits the bcr_abl was predicted to exist in all bcr_abl positive cell_lines but not in the bcr_abl negative cell_line kg supplementary as there were no breakpoints in bcr or abl detected supplementary both segments of the bcr_abl within the bcrabl positive cell_lines differ in their cn the cn of both segments is inconsistent across the cell_lines most of them have a cn between two and five except k which sets itself apart from the others with a cn of for the bcr part and a cn of for the abl part the absolute correlation_coefficient is for the bcr_abl in all cell_lines an rms of can be observed for the crossover region of the bcr_abl in k owing to the high cn in the other cell_lines the rms is smaller given that the bcr_abl results from a translocation of the long_arm to chromosome and vice_versa there is a bcr_abl on chromosome and an abl bcr fusion on chromosome the abl bcr fusion was predicted in five of seven bcr_abl positive cell_lines the cn of all predictions is between one and three with a correlation_coefficient of at least it can be observed that the cn of both parts from the abl bcr fusion is continuously lower than in the cml characteristic fusion bcr_abl this is especially true for the cn of the abl bcr fusion in k which has a cn of three for the abl and two for the bcr part and a rms of the abl bcr fusion was predicted in six cell_lines shown in but there are only two subgroups with three and two members reported because the cell_line kcl is discarded owing to the constraint that the distance between two fusions of one group has to be at most of the median sequence_length also shows that the start and end positions of this fusion are conserved whereas the positions within the fusion border vary the positions of bv meg and k lie close together whereas the positions of em and lama differ from the other cell_lines this observation confirms the clustering analysis in the main differences are in the end position of the abl part leading to two groups of abl bcr fusions in the clustering to estimate the quality of snp based fusion prediction the results of gfd are compared with defuse an algorithm detecting fusion_proteins in rna_seq defuse detected fusions in cell_line k but only the bcr_abl was detected by both algorithms the start and end position of the bcr segment differ kb and bp respectively the abl segment differs kb at the start position and kb at the end position the fusion length is bp for the gfd prediction and bp for the defuse prediction which is a difference of bp defuse did not find the abl bcr fusion probe intensities of the bcr and the abl gene in k are shown in supplementary the main parts of bcr probes and abl probes define the bcr_abl whereas the abl bcr fusion is defined by the smaller remaining parts no common intrachromosomal fusion was found bcr_abl negative kg has no fusion in common with any other cell_line supplementary we found the tmprss_erg in nci h but not in any other prostate_cancer cell_line supplementary in the primary prostate samples we verified the fusion in all fusion positive samples i e sh p p p and p but not in any of the matched normal samples or in sample sh supplementary the latter harbors a deletion in q but not across q and required to constitute the fusion one of the primary prostate_cancer samples is seen as outlier in the clustering due to a violation of a constraint of the median sequence_length and no other sample with a fusion of similar length here we found an atypical stretch of the fusion across both genes not seen in any other sample for evaluation seven bcr_abl positive cml cell_lines and one bcr_abl negative aml cell_line were used it was shown that gfd predicts the bcr_abl in all bcr_abl positive cell_lines the breakpoint positions of bcr_abl within cell_line k on chromosome and chromosome found by gfd are close to the published positions the abl bcr fusion formed on chromosome was predicted in five of seven cell_lines there is a chance that a gene will still be normally expressed even though it participates in a fusion owing to a second copy of the same gene that is not involved in a fusion this could explain the cn difference within the segments of the bcr_abl and abl bcr fusions in the em cell_line the cn of the bcr part in both fusions is higher than cn of the abl part in both fusions this can also be observed within the bcr_abl and abl bcr fusion in k however in this case an rms of is observed in both fusions the difference in the border region indicates least one bcr and one abl gene expressing normal transcripts as expected tmprss_erg fusions could not be detected in negative prostate_cancer pc lncap du and rv but rather unexpectedly also not in vcap this cell_line is known to harbor at least one normal tmprss and erg gene making_it to study the fusion in vitro in a clinical dataset of primary prostate samples we could successfully_identify all previously described fusionpositive samples one of these samples contains the typical deletion but also unusually long parts of both fusion partners rendering it an outlier we have shown that gfd is able to detect functional fusion_genes deriving from unbalanced mutation_events in cancer in addition we have shown that gfd has a similar accuracy as an approach to detect fusion_genes based on rna_seq a future_application of gfd could be combined run with an rna_seq based algorithm in this case one can distinguish between functional and non functional fusions also transcriptional and translational position information of the fusion could be gained thus it would become possible to predictprediction of the abl bcr fusion subgroups it should be noted that start and end positions are based on ensembl version and may change slightly in other genome references without an effect on the prediction stretch across chromosome showing deletions in two primary prostate_cancer samples sh yields the characteristic deletion required to form the tmprss_erg whereas sh has only a partial deletion
