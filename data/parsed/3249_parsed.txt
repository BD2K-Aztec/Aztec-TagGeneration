data_and new kegg_pathway based interpretable features for classifying ageing related mouse proteins motivation the incidence of ageing related_diseases has been constantly increasing in the last decades raising the need for creating effective methods to analyze ageing related protein data these methods should have high predictive_accuracy and be easily_interpretable by ageing experts to enable this one needs interpretable classification_models supervised machine_learning and features with rich biological meaning in this paper we propose two interpretable feature_types based on kyoto_encyclopedia kegg_pathways and compare them with traditional feature_types in hierarchical classification a more challenging classification task regarding predictive_performance and binary_classification a classification task producing easier to interpret classification_models as far as we know this work is the first to i explore the potential of the kegg_pathway data in the hierarchical classification setting i use the graph_structure of kegg_pathways to create a feature_type that quantifies the influence of a current protein on another specific protein within a kegg_pathway graph and iii propose a method for interpreting the classification_models induced using kegg features results we performed tests measuring predictive_accuracy considering hierarchical and binary class_labels extracted from the mouse phenotype ontology one of the kegg feature_types leads to the highest predictive_accuracy among five individual feature_types across three hierarchical classification algorithms additionally the combination of the two kegg feature_types proposed in this work results in one of the best predictive accuracies when using the binary class version of our datasets at the same time enabling the extraction of knowledge from ageing related data using quantitative influence information ageing related_diseases are affecting an increasing number of people at the same time delaying ageing in humans seems to be more and more plausible in the not so distant future biologists can already extend the lifespan of several animal_species such as the fruit_fly and the mouse the potential economical benefit of investing on this type of research is clear it is projected that the economical value of adding extra healthy years to the human population is trillion dollars over years in the united_states alone one of the aims of ageing research is to treat ageing as a whole reducing the incidence of many different ageing related_diseases at the same time instead of focusing on individual diseases this approach promises to be much more effective than the current approach of treating individual diseases and has the potential of stopping the trend of increasing_costs of treating ageing related_diseases one way to study the ageing process holistically is to use data_mining algorithms to find connections between genes or proteins that are known to be ageing related and other genes or proteins that have unknown function using the ever increasing freely_accessible biological data two databases of interest for ageing experts are the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg and the mouse phenotype informatics mpi databases the mpi database contains among other data the definition of an ontology of ageing related terms that describe the phenotype of several allele mutations the kegg_database also contains several types of information about genes and proteins including pathway_information presented in a graphical way that allows biologists understanding the interactions of proteins in complex biological_processes we address two types of classification supervised machine learning_problems binary_classification where instances proteins are annotated with the presence_or of a class indicating if the protein is ageing related and hierarchical classification where the classes to be predicted protein functions are organized into a hierarchy where more generic functions are ancestors of more specific functions silla jr and freitas a note that this is a more complex but more rewarding problem than conventional classification since the latter ignores hierarchical relationships among classes we address the hierarchical classification task because the terms in the mpi ontology are hierarchical and address the binary_classification task because it produces classification_models easier to interpret from an ageing biology perspective in both tasks it is crucial to describe each instance protein by a set of features protein properties that has both good predictive_power and rich biological meaning the contributions of this work are three fold i the integration of data from the mpi and kegg databases to create a new numerical kegg feature_type with rich biological meaning this new feature_type quantifies how an instance protein influences other proteins the idea being that proteins that influence other proteins in a similar way have similar function i the new investigation of the use of the binary kegg feature_type in the context of hierarchical classification and i proposing a method for interpreting classification_models generated using kegg features the construction of specially tailored meaningful features for specific problems is part of the feature engineering process the objective is to introduce carefully crafted features for the type of problem being addressed in the bioinformatics field it has been common to use features that are easily extractable from the protein_sequence or from some database containing several protein properties these features although valuable often lack the preciseness an expert needs to reach a meaningful biological conclusion this works differs from current_practice by creating a new kegg_pathway based feature_type that encodes precise and meaningful relations between proteins this paper is organized as follows section_describes how we built our ageing related datasets including the proposed kegg features section reports the predictive_power of our features across hierarchical and binary_classification algorithms and the interpretation of a binary_classification model using some of the proposed features finally in section we discuss the results of our work and draw_conclusions we have presented the construction of two kegg feature_types for the classification of ageing related protein functions engineered specifically with the goal of predicting protein_function using interpretable features the advantages of using the kegg derived features types are two fold i the good predictive_performance of the models induced using these two features together and ii the improved interpretation potential of using richer features to represent the instances in fact the kegg_pathway seems to be a very appropriate database to use when interpretation is required since it is focused on integrating not only biological data from several sources but also concepts about the data the downside of relying on such rich source of data is that in order to compute values of the keggp and keggi features for an instance the corresponding gene or protein must first be characterized into some kegg_pathway which involves laborious wet_lab experimentation so an uncharacterized protein represented only by its amino_acid cannot be classified using keggp and keggi features nor using ppi and motif features in fact in this scenario out of the five feature_types used in this work only the numeric feature_type could be used which is arguably the most difficult_to due to its low_level of abstraction the kegg pertinence keggp feature_type used for the first time for hierarchical classification in this work had the best performance according to our statistical_analysis compared to three other feature_types and the keegi feature_type a new kegg feature_type proposed here the combined keggpi dataset using both keggp and keggi features had the best mean rank on the binary class dataset tied with the keggp feature_type although the keggp feature_type has a simpler interpretation if a richer more precise modelthe first column presents a keggi feature its name shows the uniprot id of the protein that is being potentially influenced by an instance and after the the id of the kegg_pathway where the influence can occur the next columns show binary keggp features indicating whether or not an instance belongs to the corresponding kegg_pathway the last two columns show the coverage and the accuracy of each rule due to lack of space we have suppressed the mmu prefix in the kegg_pathways ids each row shows the conditions that must be satisfied for a protein to be predicted as ageingrelated the selected kegg_pathways are mmu cell_cycle mmu pi_k mmu herpes_simplex infection mmu t cell receptor signaling_pathway mmu osteoclast_differentiation mmu tgf_beta signaling_pathway mmu prolactin signaling_pathway and mmu nucleotide_excision graphical_representation of the kegg_pathway mmu cell_cycle with highlighted interesting proteins and interactions the protein complex highlighted with a solid black line contains the protein cyclin_dependent cdk which occurs in the feature selected by the dt algorithm see the highlighted dashed grey proteins represent ageing related proteins that influence cdk the highlighted solid grey proteins represent nonageing related proteins that influence cdk solid grey edges represent all possible influence paths from a solid grey protein to cdk dashed grey edges represent all possible influence paths from the dashed grey protein to cdk new kegg_pathway based interpretable features for classifying ageing related mouse proteinsinterpretation is desired as it is the case here the combined keggpi feature_type is more suitable as it contains both the easier to interpret keggp feature_type at a higher_level of abstraction and the keggi feature_type with finer grain information to illustrate this point we have shown how the keggpi feature_type can be used for generating biological_knowledge using the decision table algorithm which generates interpretable classification_models we have also contrasted the interpretation of the keggi feature_type with the interpretation of the simpler keggp feature_type and concluded that the complementary nature of these two feature_types provides a good range of biological_information the keggi feature_type presents more precise information to the user enabling a richer interpretation of the classification model it quantifies the influence of a current reference protein on another specific protein in a given kegg_pathway on the other hand the keggp feature_type tells the user the higher_level information of which kegg_pathways are important for discriminating between ageing and non ageing related proteins
