genome_analysis efficient change_point detection for genomic_sequences of continuous_measurements motivation knowing the exact locations of multiple change_points in genomic_sequences serves several biological needs for instance when data represent acgh profiles and it is of interest to identify possibly damaged genes involved in cancer and other diseases only a few of the currently available methods deal explicitly with estimation of the number and location of change_points and moreover these methods may be somewhat vulnerable to deviations of model_assumptions usually employed results we present a computationally_efficient method to obtain estimates of the number and location of the change_points the method is based on a simple transformation of data and it provides results quite robust to model misspecifications the efficiency of the method guarantees moderate computational times regardless of the series length and the number of change_points availability the methods described in this article are implemented in the new r package cumseg available from the comprehensive_r at http cran r project org package cumseg statistical_analysis in biological_research is often faced with outcomes expressed by specific measurements for the gene_expression levels when these observed responses are ordered by their location on the genome the values form clouds with different observed means supposedly reflecting different mean levels by exploiting differences in the observed responses the statistical_analysis of these sequences aims at identifying chromosomal_regions with abnormal increased or decreased mean levels changes in the mean level at a particular genome location may be interesting for certain goals such as assessing the status not only of specific_loci like tumor_suppressors and oncogenes but also any structural genomic alteration resulting in genomic_imbalances involved in pathogenesis or in various observed abnormal phenotypes for instance detecting chromosomal_aberrations is crucial for the diagnosis of some diseases including mental_retardation and cancer e g to whom correspondence should be addressed often associated to aneuploidies deletions duplications and or amplifications in this respect the output of the array_comparative acgh experiment is a fluorescence color ratio understood to represent the dna_copy of the actual tumor_cells plus noise generated by the normal cells and by the experiment acgh analysis aims at finding abrupt changes in the mean of the fluorescence color ratios or usually their logarithms to detect chromosomal_aberrations the analysis of acgh data concerns one of the most important_applications involving change_point detection but more generally the analysis of genomic_sequences to detect abrupt changes is an important step in several areas of the biological_research recombination of viruses characterization of complete transcriptomes via high_density dna tiling microarrays or investigation of dna_sequences in general see karkin and for a wider discussion several authors have addressed the problem using different approaches within a likelihood_based or bayesian paradigms algorithms based on segmentation techniques_include works by hidden_markov have been presented in when mean levels are of main interest rather than the change_points bayesian approaches have been discussed in although comprehensive reviews and comparisons of some of the aforementioned methods are given byand willenbrock and the focus of the aforementioned procedures is into calling gains_and namely classification into damaged and non damaged genes in general little emphasis is given to the problem of estimating number and locations of the change_points especially when the stochastic terms are not simple gaussian independent identically distributed iid typical statistical_analyses assume iid gaussian_noise but there is no guarantee that this is always true in this article we present a new approach to detect and estimate change_points in genomic_sequences while associated mean levels can be obtained we are specifically interested in the change_points the main goal is to provide a procedure which works adequately well in different and real scenarios where the true error structure is usually unknown the method is conceptually_simple and it appears to be quite robust to departures from standard model_assumptions such as autocorrelation non normality and heteroscedasticity moreover page
