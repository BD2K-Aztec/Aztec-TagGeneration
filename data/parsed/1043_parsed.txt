combinatorial therapy discovery using mixed_integer motivation combinatorial therapies play increasingly important roles in combating complex_diseases owing to the huge cost associated with experimental methods in identifying optimal drug_combinations computational_approaches can provide a guide to limit the search_space and reduce_cost however few computational_approaches have been developed for this purpose and thus there is a great need of new algorithms for drug_combination prediction results here we proposed to formulate the optimal combinatorial therapy problem into two complementary mathematical algorithms balanced target set cover btsc and minimum off target set cover motsc given a disease gene_set btsc seeks a balanced solution that maximizes the coverage on the disease genes and minimizes the off target hits at the same time motsc seeks a full coverage on the disease gene_set while minimizing the off target set through simulation both btsc and motsc demonstrated a much faster running time over exhaustive_search with the same accuracy when applied to real disease gene_sets our algorithms not only identified known drug_combinations but also predicted novel drug_combinations that are worth further testing in addition we developed a web_based to allow users to iteratively search for optimal drug_combinations given a user_defined gene_set availability our tool is freely_available for noncommercial use at http www drug complex_diseases such as cancer cardiovascular_diseases and neurological_disorders usually involve_multiple genes whose protein products play_pivotal controlling aberrant pathways and networks in addition disease pathways and networks are often redundant and robust to single point perturbations because most drugs are designed to selectively target specific proteins single drug_treatments usually cannot break down the whole disease pathways and networks this is why the traditional one disease one gene one drug treatment often fails multi_target treatments especially drug_combinations can simultaneously target multiple components of the disease pathways and networks thus offering hope for treating such complex_diseases there have already been many successful combinatorial therapies to treat complex_diseases for example highly_active is a potent combination of at least three active antiretroviral_drugs targeting reverse_transcriptase protease and integrase to keep the hiv_virus from replicating itself the combination of glyburide and metformin is used to treat type_diabetes in complementary ways moduretic is the combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide that can effectively treat patients with hypertension htn the combination of anastrozole and fulvestrant is more effective than individual or sequential usage of both drugs for the treatment of hormone_receptor metastatic_breast despite the increasing successes in using drug_combinations to treat complex_diseases most of them were developed based on clinical_experience or test and trial strategy which is not only time consuming but also expensive high_throughput methods have also been developed to identify effective pairwise drug_combinations however a systematic analysis of all the possible pairwise combinations is both labor_intensive and costineffective because of the large combinatorial space needed to explore furthermore most drug_combinations may not significantly improve the efficacy over individual_drugs therefore large_scale drug_combination screening is highly ineffective in addition a systematic_screening becomes unfeasible if combinations of more than two drugs are considered the closed_loop control stack sequential and other search algorithms reviewed inhave been developed together with biological_experiments to identify the optimal drug_combinations from a huge drug dose space however given thousands of individual_drugs careful preselection of a subset of drugs within which to search to whom correspondence should be addressed for optimal combinations in experimental_testing is not an easy task several systematic computational_approaches for predicting drug_combinations have recently been developed and could provide a guide to limit the search_space for experimental methods for example proposed identifying the optimal drug_combinations by searching for the minimal number of drugs that can target all the cancer_cell using the highestdegree first and simulated_annealing algorithms however this heuristic_search algorithm does not have optimum guarantee and the convergence_rate for large_scale datasets could be slow integrated a molecular_interaction and gene_expression data of individual_drugs to identify subnetworks affected by individual or combinatorial drugs the drug effect on these subnetworks is measured by taking_into both efficacy and side effect and then used to prioritize drug_combinations they successfully identified effective drug_combinations used to treat type_diabetes but the dependency on the availability of gene_expression data treated with individual and combinatorial drugs as well as the high_computational when handling the vast combinatorial space makes their approach unsuitable for large_scale application proposed two similar computational_approaches to prioritize pairwise drug_combinations using feature patterns enriched in the known drug_combinations and got some promising predictions however their approaches rely heavily on the known drug_combination data that are of small_size thus biasing their predictions toward those combinations that are similar to the known ones therefore the current computational_approaches are limited and there is a great need to develop new algorithms for drug_combination prediction drug_design is usually specific but one drug may target multiple proteins due to promiscuous binding one protein can be targeted by multiple drugs as well the drugs and proteins form an intricate drug_target network when used to treat diseases a drug can affect both disease on target_proteins for which it was designed and some off target_proteins that are not related to the diseases when different drugs are combined there could be a large number of additive off targets whose effects are undesired thus given a set of disease genes the problem of finding the optimum drug_combinations that maximize on target_coverage and minimize off target effects is important and challenging this is similar to the efficacy maximization and side effect minimization problem in combinatorial therapy also such off target effects in drug_combination have not been considered in the systematic computational studies with the exception of the work to address the on target maximization and off target minimization problem we first formulated the optimal combinatorial therapy problem using an optimization framework and solved it using mixed_integer milp then we compared our approach with exhaustive_search using simulation and demonstrated a better performance of our approach over exhaustive_search finally we demonstrated the good performance of our approach through searching optimal drug_combinations for six disease gene_sets from a drugtarget network our approach not only captured the well known drugs and drug_combinations but also suggested novel uses for some other drugs the drug_combinations discovered using our approach can target the protein products of disease genes with minimal perturbations to the other proteins and are worthy of further testing to treat such diseases to make our approach more accessible to the general drug_discovery community we developed a web_based to allow users to iteratively search for optimal drug_combinations from a user_defined gene_set the remaining part of this article is organized as follows we first describe the optimization approach in section application of the approach on both the simulated_and is presented in section and a brief discussion on current_issues and potential future improvements is described in the concluding section of the article we require any selected combination of drugs to cover all the on target disease genes this can be achieved by setting to and adding a constraint of full set cover mathematically the restricted problem can be defined as follows problem minimum off target set cover motsc problem given a disease d t s and a collection of drugs m find a subset c m that minimizes the costd c js cj where jt cj jt mj and c c c c optimal combinatorial therapy discovery is an important and challenging_problem in this article we introduced two complementary approaches for this problem and solved them using milp there are many heuristic_search algorithms that can provide greedy solutions for this problem however we are interested in finding the global optimum solution and these heuristic_search algorithms cannot provide such accuracy therefore we excluded this category of algorithms in solving the optimal combinatorial therapy problem and did not compare our approaches with any heuristic_search algorithms instead we compared our approaches with exhaustive_search and demonstrated that our algorithms can obtain the same optimum solution with much faster running time application of our approach on real disease gene_sets demonstrated its good performance in identifying known drug_combinations as well as predicting novel drug_combinations in addition our approach has the potential to unveil new functions of existing_drugs for drug_repositioning we have developed an online tool for our proposed algorithms the online tool provides many features such as exclusion of adverse drugdrug interaction constraint on the number of drugs iterative search highly_efficient solver and email notification in addition the online tool allows the user to assign the weight balance on the on target and off target sets as well as to choose how to handle drugs with opposite actions on input genes the online tool is also flexible to include new constraints such as the importance weight of input disease genes and the penalty weight of potential off target_genes the availability of the online tool will make our algorithm accessible not only to the computational_biologists but also to the bench scientists the mathematical_analysis presented here provides a general framework for the solution of multi_target therapeutic design although running our algorithm on arbitrarily large set of drugs is not possible due to the nature of np_hard most of the real applications fall into the small and mid size categories in practice our algorithm and online tool demonstrate accurate and fast performance on those applications one weakness of our approach stems from its use of incomplete drugtarget_interaction data however in recent_years a significant amount of effort has been devoted to drug_target annotation and prediction with the improved size and quality of such data we believe that our approach and web_based will play_an in drug_discovery in addition personal variants in protein_coding can be easily_obtained with the advances in next_generation owing to the heterogeneity of complex_diseases even individual patients with the same disease may have a distinct set of causal_genes and thus will need different treatment strategy this problem is challenging and cannot be resolved in an effective way now however our tool offers one way to help predict optimal drug_combination for targeting individual set of disease genes which will have a non trivial contribution to personalized_medicine
