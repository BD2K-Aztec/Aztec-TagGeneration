improving the tfold test for differential shotgun_proteomics we present an updated version of the tfold software for pinpointing differentially_expressed in shotgun_proteomics experiments given an fdr bound the updated approach uses a theoretical fdr estimator to maximize the number of identifications that satisfy both a fold_change cutoff that varies with the t test p value as a power_law and a stringency criterion that aims to detect lowly abundant proteins the new version has yielded_significant improvements in sensitivity over the previous one availability freely_available for academic use atone of the goals of shotgun_proteomics is to perform large_scale comparisons of complex_protein e g biological_fluids or whole cell_lysates it comprises protein_digestion followed by peptide chromatographic_separation online with tandem_mass ms for protein identification and quantitation there are several strategies for protein_quantitation examples are metabolic_labeling chemical_derivatization and label_free we previously described patternlab for proteomics a computational environment for analyzing shotgun proteomics_data the modules available in patternlab serve various purposes ranging from preparing decoy databases to selecting and sharing reliable protein_identifications to performing gene_ontology analyses and many more one of its most popular modules is the tfold test for pinpointing differentially_expressed quantitated by any of the above strategies briefly in the previous version a patternlab file containing protein_quantitation data from different biological conditions would first be filtered according to specified t test p value and fold_change cutoffs then the user would interactively experiment with different fold_change cutoffs each leading to a different list of proteins through the bh fdr estimator for the same user specified q value henceforth referred to as this process would ultimately lead to a fold_change cutoff that maximized the number of proteins in the list even though this simple strategy has been effective in a number of occasions imposing a fixed fold_change cutoff could discard to whom correspondence should be addressed proteins with very low p values but not satisfying the fold_change cutoff this seems unreasonable because in the proteomics scenario the magnitude of a proteins fold_change need not correlate with its biological_importance in fact molecular abundance is only one of the various factors controlling protein activity not necessarily the most important one here we describe how we reformulated the tfold test to better address these limitations and increase sensitivity we also tackle another common problem in proteomics namely that of dealing with lowly abundant proteins e g those having low spectral counts which usually turn out to be over represented in complex_mixtures these proteins are more prone to getting around the barriers imposed by common statistical filters e g the t test because they tend to artificially acquire low p values to exemplify assume the following sets of spectral counts for a given protein in two biological conditions and notably in this extreme example there is a considerable fold_change while the p value is artificially low due to the lack of variation in our experience it is much more likely that this protein is a false_positive than another having significantly_higher spectral counts but with a higher p value as well our updated tfold approach introduces a method to quickly highlight and separate proteins such as the one here exemplified for these proteins additional experimentation is recommended before ascertaining their status as differentially_expressed the effectiveness of our updated algorithm is exemplified on the data_set provided bycomparing a cancer_cells to those a r resistant to perillyl_alcohol poh a naturally_occurring chemotherapeutic_agent that induces_apoptosis the authors provide a list of protein_identifications quantitated by spectral_counting and satisfying a fdr for their identifications according to dtaselect in the original analysis the authors converged to a fixed fold_change cutoff of resulting in differentially_expressed for a p value cutoff of and the new algorithm converged to z pinpointing differentially_expressed for the same plus six proteins satisfying the same criteria but reported in a separate list as having been marked by the l stringency filter thus suggesting the need for further experimentation is a snapshot of pattern labs graphical_user during analysis an example of a protein that was only marked as differentially_expressed by the revised method is glyceraldehyde_phosphate gapdh ipi identifying this protein is important because we hypothesize that it could be related to the initiation of apoptosis when the cells medium contains poh the sets of spectral counts for this protein were for the wild_type and for the resistant cell_culture but further discussions on any of the corresponding biological interpretations are beyond the scope of this manuscript
