gene_expression global analysis of microarray_data reveals intrinsic_properties in gene_expression and tissue selectivity motivation it is expected that individual genes have intrinsically different variability in the global expressional trend among them thus the consideration of gene specific expressional properties will help us to distinguish target selective gene_expression over non selective over expression results the re standardization and integration of heterogeneous microarray_datasets available from public_databases have enabled us to determine the global expression properties of individual genes across a wide_variety of experimental_conditions and samples the global averages and sds of expression for each gene in the integrated microarray_datasets were found to be intrinsic_properties which were consistent among independent collections of datasets using different microarray_platforms using the gene specific intrinsic parameters to rescale the microarray_data we were able to distinguish novel selective gene_expression cartilage_oligomeric comp and collagen x in breast_cancer tissues from non selective over expression a difference that has not been detectable by conventional methods availability_and the web_based for gs lage is available at http dna microarray_experiments have provided a powerful_tool for monitoring transcriptome_wide changes in gene_expression that are associated with physiological or pathological states large_scale microarray_experiments can serve as a resource for a systematic understanding of global expression trends in the transcriptome under various experimental_conditions or in different tissues with the recent rapid increase in microarray expression datasets available in public_databases it has become possible to virtually monitor the global expression trends of a gene in diverse biological_samples under various conditions the availability of a large collection of microarray_data in the ncbi national_center gene_expression to whom correspondence should be addressed omnibus geo http www ncbi nlm nih gov geo provides a resource for the physiome wide analysis of gene_expression on a genome_scale however the microarray_datasets available in public domains have been contributed by many different research groups using a variety of experimental and data normalization_methods the effects of normalization strategies have been extensively_evaluated elsewhere for example two different transformations of the same data may produce two differential_expression of gene deg lists with only agreement thus the heterogeneity among groups of microarray_datasets requires_additional standardization of individual microarray samples before integrative_analysis to this end we have attempted to rescale and integrate heterogeneous microarray_datasets from the ncbi geo by using a two step gene oriented standardization procedure genespecific large_scale analysis of gene_expression gs lage the analysis of the resulting integrated dataset provides insights into gene specific global expression trends found in various microarray samples these trends were then used to improve the statistical confidence of the marginal changes in gene_expression between experiments a major_challenge in microarray_experiments has been the identification of genes whose expression is significantly different between samples many sophisticated statistical_methods have been developed in attempts to achieve more reliable identification of differentially_regulated however under many experimental_conditions the changes in gene_expression are often moderate as compared to the array wide_variability in expression resulting in modest p values that prevent conventional statistical_models from identifying real changes in expression in fact all existing_measures of deg from microarray fluorescence signals are optimized to have a linear correlation with the change in mrna_levels given that individual genes have unique expression levels and fluctuations necessitated by their biological_functions a metric for the direct comparison of the changes in mrna_expression between experiments cannot provide a relevant biological_interpretation based only on the significance of the observed degs between genes one gene may have an intrinsically large variation in expression in different biological_samples or under different conditions while another gene may require only small_variations for its biological_function thus it is reasonable that the observed deg i e mrnapage in the proteinprotein_interaction comp and collagen x have relatively few interacting_partners compared to inhibin and collagen viii suggesting that comp and collagen x are topologically and functionally peripheral in the cellular network while inhibin and collagen viii are hub proteins it has been reported that essential genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues also found that the vast_majority of disease genes were non essential and without tendency of encoding hub proteins they provided an explanation for most disease genes using an evolutionary argument such that only disease related mutations in the functionally and topologically peripheral_regions of the cell have a higher chance of viability consistently the present study shows that two hub proteins inhibin and collagen viii are over expressed in many different normal and cancer tissues indicating that their expression is essential and not specific to a disease on the other hand two peripheral genes comp and collagen x show highly_selective over expression in breast_cancers thus suggesting that their expression is nonessential and specific to breast_cancers this analysis demonstrates that the gene specific interpretation of transcriptome_data is able to distinguish non essential disease related genes from essential genes with over expression in various tissues in conclusion the selective expression of comp and collagen x in breast_cancer observed by qpcr experiments supports the hypothesis that gene specific interpretation of microarray_data allows highly sample specific gene_expression to be distinguished from non selective over expression without large_scale experiments on various samples in a transcriptome_wide study such as a microarray experiment a large number of candidate_genes with significant over expression in target samples are often identified thus it is challenging to determine candidates of more direct or specific importance to a target disease or the metabolic_regulation of specific samples in this study we have shown that gene specific interpretation of microarray_data can be used to prioritize genes with greater selective expression to specific tissues over many other over expressed genes we believe that a transcriptome_wide survey of the global trends in gene_expression is of critical importance to better interpreting large_scale gene_expression data given that individual genes each have their own regulatory system for transcriptional_activity the analysis of global expression trends can provide a direct measure of a genes intrinsic expressional behavior the present study shows that db wide average and sd of gene probe feature expression are an effective measure of the intrinsic expressional behavior of a gene and that they can be used for better interpretation of microarray_data some of intrinsic_properties observed in this study might reflect characteristics of probes themselves thus the present gene specific rescaling method also minimizes the probe specific variation in the interpretation of microarray_data rapid increases in public microarray_data will further improve the quality of thisapproach and provide a unique tool for biological_interpretation of gene_expression data on a transcriptome basis we are currently expanding the integrated microarray_datasets to generalize the genespecific interpretation of transcriptome_data to diverse organisms and experimental_conditions all of the resources used in the present study including the integrated microarray_datasets and analysis methods are available at
