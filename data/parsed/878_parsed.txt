gene_expression causal reasoning on biological_networks interpreting transcriptional changes motivation the interpretation of high_throughput datasets has remained one of the central challenges of computational_biology over the past_decade furthermore as the amount of biological_knowledge increases it becomes more and more difficult to integrate this large body of knowledge in a meaningful manner in this article we propose a particular solution to both of these challenges methods we integrate available biological_knowledge by constructing a network of molecular_interactions of a specific kind causal interactions the resulting causal graph can be queried to suggest molecular hypotheses that explain the variations observed in a high_throughput gene_expression experiment we show that a simple scoring_function can discriminate between a large number of competing molecular hypotheses about the upstream cause of the changes observed in a gene_expression we then develop an analytical_method for computing the statistical_significance of each score this analytical_method also helps assess the effects of random or adversarial noise on the predictive_power of our model results our results show that the causal graph we constructed from known biological_literature is extremely robust to random noise and to missing or spurious information we demonstrate the power of our causal reasoning model on two specific examples one from a cancer dataset and the other from a cardiac_hypertrophy experiment we conclude that causal reasoning models provide a valuable addition to the biologists toolkit for the interpretation of gene_expression data availability_and r source_code for the method is available upon request contact over the past_decade gene_expression have been generated at an increasing pace other types of large_scale to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as data e g metabolomics or genetics are also becoming more commonplace approaches for inferring correlative or causal structure directly from large_datasets generated by perturbing a biological system and consisting of several data types e g expression data and genetics data demonstrate great promise in uncovering novel biological_insights one example of a successful inference of causal_relationships is the work of in which the authors predict and validate three novel susceptibility_genes for obesity based on a rodent model the inference proceeds from expression data and genetics data from a controlled population of several hundred mice in practice most available datasets are much smaller observational in nature and report a single kind of measurement in parallel with an ever increasing amount of data generated the biomedical_literature is also growing_exponentially the results of new experiments should be evaluated in light of this knowledge for at least two reasons i to discover novel biology one needs to know what is already known understand what hypotheses need refinement and what phenomena remain unexplained and ii data interpretation in light of previous_experiments can add significant interpretative power especially given the limitations of small_sample in many current omics experiments the goal of our methodology is to predict upstream_regulators of observed expression changes based on a set of causal_relationships the resulting putative regulators constitute directly testable_hypotheses for follow_up in the laboratory in this article we i define a scoring_scheme to identify putative upstream_regulators for any given input dataset based on a set of causal_relationships encoded as a causal graph ii analytically compute significance scores for our predictions based on random input gene_sets iii analytically quantify the recoverability of embedded signals from regulators for our causal graph under various kinds of noise and iv give concrete examples where our methodology helps elucidate biological_phenomena when presented with real_data in this article we have presented a comprehensive methodology to derive concise molecular hypotheses that can explain the transcriptional changes observed in genome_wide microarrays we have compiled a large causal graph of curated interactions to which we have successfully_applied a simple but powerful reasoning method our method is very similar in spirit to the method of however we have shown here for the first time how to analytically compute the statistical_significance of detected hypothetical drivers of the expression data given the importance of current knowledge for the creation of the causal network we investigated how its characteristics such as redundancy and coverage impact our ability to retrieve clear signals in order to understand this based on our current causal graph of over unique causal_relationships we defined the concept of recoverability and derived an analytical_method to assess it for
