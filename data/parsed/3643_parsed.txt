predicting g_protein downstream_signaling by tissue expression motivation g_protein gpcrs are central to how cells respond to their environment and a major class of pharmacological targets however comprehensive_knowledge of which pathways are activated and deactivated by these essential sensors is largely_unknown to better understand the mechanism of gpcr signaling system we integrated five independent genome_wide expression datasets representing human tissues and cell_lines with protein_protein and functional pathway data results we found that tissue_specificity plays a crucial part in the function of gpcr signaling system only a few gpcrs are expressed in each tissue which are coupled by different combinations of g proteins or b arrestins to trigger specific downstream pathways based on this finding we predicted the downstream pathways of gpcr in human tissues and validated our results with l knockdown data in total we identified connections between gpcrs and pathways in tissues and cell_types availability_and the source_code and results supporting the conclusions of this article are available atg protein coupled receptors gpcrs comprise the largest family of transmembrane signaling moleculesmore than distinct human proteins each member of this family shares in a common seven transmembrane tm a helical fold as highly versatile membrane sensors they regulate many physiological_processes including immunization sensation behavioral and mood regulation homeostasis modulation gpcrs also emerge as crucial players in growth and metastasis of many tumors mutations in gpcrs have been linked to many human genetic_diseases including retinitis_pigmentosa rp hypo and hyperthyroidism nephrogenic_diabetes bleeding_disorder and even carcinomas gpcrs are activated by a heterogeneous set of endogenous ligands these ligands may be light_sensitive compounds odors pheromones hormones and neurotransmitters due to their accessibility on cellular_membranes their central role in cell communication and the wide_variety of potential functions gpcrs are the targets for nearly one third of modern small_molecule therapeutics gpcrs are transducers of extracellular stimuli to signal intracellular changes in their inactive_state gpcrs are bound to a heterotrimeric_g complex including three subunits g a g b and g c the binding of an extracellular ligand will initiate a conformation_change in gpcr which then activates the bound g a subunit the activated g a subunit dissociates from the complex by an exchange from gtp to gdp the dissociated g a and g bc subunits binds to other intracellular_proteins to trigger downstream_signaling or metabolic_pathways separately meanwhile g_protein receptor_kinases grks are recruited to the ligand bound gpcr and phosphorylate the receptor once phosphorylated gpcr binds to b arrestins preventing further coupling of gpcr to g proteins b arrestins have a dual role however and can also interact with intracellular_proteins inducing downstream_effects in the whole process the signal of ligand is passed from gpcr to two types of transducer molecules g protein and b arrestin contributing to g protein dependent_signaling and g protein independent_signaling respectively gpcrs are usually expressed_at with of genes in the genome only accounting for of expressed_sequence fredriksson and schi th whats more expression levels of gpcrs vary dramatically by tissue regard et_al analyzed transcript_levels of gpcrs in adult mouse_tissues and found that gpcrs that are highly_expressed in a given tissue usually exhibit important function to that tissue for example light detecting opsins are highly and specifically expressed in eye and dopamine gamma_aminobutyric gaba receptors are highly_expressed in central_nervous these findings_suggest that gpcr signaling system consists of different expressed proteins depending on the tissue type and target different downstream pathways to fulfill tissue_specific functions driven largely by their utility in drug_development the study of individual gpcr function and their downstream target pathways has become a research_topic of great_importance with this information many new avenues of research are available for example the action of pathways without any direct drug_targets can be modulated through targeting the gpcrs that trigger them in addition the downstream pathways in the target tissue of a drug can be connected to cellular_mechanism or on target side_effects of the drug while the downstream pathways in other tissues can be connected to the off target side_effects however the low expression_level and difficulty in crystallization have made comprehensive_analyses so challenging that most gpcrs still remain the terra incognita or unexplored territory in functional_genomics importantly gpcrs do not interact with intracellular_proteins directly but through the coupling of g protein or recruitment of b arrestin studying the direct partners of gpcrs will not reveal their downstream_effects research has shown that transducer isotypes can have distinct interacting_partners and signaling roles for example g as subunit can activate camp_dependent by stimulating the production of camp while g ai inhibits the production b arrestin mediates dopaminergic synaptic_transmission while b arrestin actives erk_pathway exactly which b arrestins and g proteins associate with each gpcr and if this varies by tissue type remains_unknown further complicating the systematic identification of gpcr targeted pathways we introduced a data_driven method gote to systematically predict gpcr downstream pathways signaling by tissue expression with many genome_wide datasets of different human tissues or cell_types available we were able to identify the expressed proteins of gpcr signaling system in each tissue type these include the gpcr proteins themselves as well as the transducer proteins g proteins and b arrestins we hypothesized that if the proteins of a pathway significantly interact with the transducer isotypes in a particular tissue then the pathway is more likely to be the signaling outcome of the gpcrs that are highly_expressed in that tissue based on this hypothesis we designed a statistical_test to evaluate the association between pathways and gpcrs in each tissue and applied it to five independent datasets four from normal_tissues one from cancer_cell we tested the robustness of gote by comparing the similarity of results across the normal_human datasets we found both concordance and discordance in the predicted pathways the predicted pathways of some gpcrs such as casr tbxa r cxcr and gpr can be connected to their molecular_function or cause of disease by our method due to the lack of true standard specifying the true relationship between gpcr and pathways we used gpcr knockdown datasets to perform a weak validation in which we observed whether the expression of a pathway is significantly_changed after the knockdown of gpcr we concluded with a discussion of the potential uses of these results such as the study of complex human disease or molecular_mechanism of drugs all of our data and code are made publicly and freely_available in this paper we presented a data_driven method gote to systematically identify the downstream pathways of gpcrs in each tissue we used gene_expression to find highly_expressed binding_proteins of g proteins or b arrestins in each tissue and performed pathway_enrichment to find enriched pathways then we connected the enriched pathways to specifically expressed gpcrs in the tissue as their downstream pathways we found that the predicted pathways differ by tissue and gpcr while similar tissues have similar predicted pathways with no true standard available we created a weak standard on our own with an independent dataset from l gene_knockdown experiment to validate our gpcr tissue pathway predictions in the validation we tested the correlation between the knockdown of gpcr and the change of expression in downstream pathways as co expression is only a prerequisite of actual connection this standard is less stringent and will unavoidably bring in some false_positives we controlled for this error by comparing the results to a null_distribution random and another reference method highexp that connects highly_expressed pathways to gpcrs in each tissue gote outperforms both two methods in precision and specificity gote has lower recall than highexp because it chooses the tissue_specific pathways that are also enriched by the binding_proteins of transducers thus gote is more stringent and is expected to have fewer predictions than highexp as a data_driven method our prediction results are dependent on the expression dataset used unfortunately most current expression data are derived from different platforms we tested the robustness of gote among four datasets with normal_human each using a different technology the similarity of predicted pathways between datasets is in alignment with the expression similarity supplementary where the results are highly_consistent between two mass_spectrometry datasets and less consistent between these two mass_spectrometry dataset and the microarray_dataset in addition the five datasets do not employ a standard tissue naming scheme this may contribute to a situation where a same name of tissue can refer to different types of cells in the tissue which adds the difficulty of comparing predicted pathways between different datasets another limitation of gote is our current strategy of mapping gpcrs to their transducers the relationship between gpcrs and transducers has not been well studied therefore we used co expression in the same tissue to connect gpcrs to transducers in gote consequently this may bring in some false_positive pairs of gpcrs and transducers since the correlation in expression does not necessarily mean the existence of actual connection between gpcrs and transducers to mitigate these potential false_positives we provided a parameter in gote that controls gpcr tissue_specificity we showed that by setting a high threshold of this parameter users can get more confident connections between gpcr and downstream pathways at the cost of fewer predictions we found our findings on many gpcrs agree with their molecular_function cause of disease or the action of corresponding drug provided by other resources for example we found class c and d gpcrs are commonly connected to g protein dependent_pathways in nervous_system while class c gpcrs consists of calcium sensing gaba and glutamate_receptors which are synaptic receptors located primarily on neuronal_cells and class d gpcrs are reported to play_an in brain development we also found the tissues connected to gpcr in our results correlate with the atc classification of corresponding drug gpcrs such as casr ptgir are predicted with pathways in agreement with the molecular_mechanism of their corresponding drugs supplementary some gpcrs have predicted pathways validated by other studies for example cxcr one of the co receptors of hiv in immunological cells participate in the activation of ion_channels after the binding of gp we found this gpcr is connected to both hiv related pathways such as hiv transcription_initiation and ion_channel related pathways such as voltage_gated in cd cells supplementary another gpcr gpr is regulated by blimp in nk_cells which is a transcription_factor and modulates the mhc_class antigen processing and peptide loading pathway in our results this gpcr is connected to the class i mhc mediated antigen processing presentation pathway in nk_cells supplementary eventually since gpcrs participate in controlling an extraordinary variety of physiological_functions mutations in gpcr can cause many complex_diseases the pathways we predicted for these gpcrs may help us study the mechanism of these diseases for example mutations in tbxa r a thromboxane receptor tp will cause a bleeding_disorder in human_body in our results this gpcr is connected to blood_clotting pathways such as platelet_activation signaling and aggregation pvalue e ranking supplementary table s in platelets meanwhile we also found other interesting pathways such as influence of four parameters on the prediction results of gote gdp g protein dependent_pathways gip g protein independent pathways in each of four line graphs the x axis indicates the threshold or threshold in b of one parameter the y axis indicates how much gote outperforms highexp in precision when setting the parameter to the threshold of x axis the other three parameters as default setting the four parameters are a t the p value threshold for highly_expressed gpcrs b t the gpcr specificity score threshold c t the p value threshold for highly_expressed binding_proteins of transducers d t the p value threshold for enriched pathways hyaluronan uptake and degradation p value e ranking supplementary hyaluronan metabolism p value e ranking supplementary hyaluronan plays an important role in skin wound_healing events together with fibrin it increases or stabilizes the volume and porosity of the clot and then serves as a physical support through which cells are trapped in the clot
