systems_biology combining optimization and machine_learning for genome_wide prediction of human cell_cycle regulated_genes motivation the identification of cell_cycle regulated_genes through the cyclicity of messenger_rnas in genome_wide studies is a difficult_task due to the presence of internal and external noise in microarray_data moreover the analysis is also complicated by the loss of syn chrony occurring in cell_cycle experiments which often results in additional background_noise results to overcome these problems here we propose the leon learning and optimization_algorithm able to characterize the cycli city degree of a gene_expression time profile using a two step cascade procedure the first step identifies a potentially cyclic behavior by means of a support_vector trained with a reliable set of positive_and examples the second step selects those genes having peak timing consistency along two cell cycles by means of a non linear optimization_technique using radial_basis to prove the effectiveness of our combined approach we use recently_published human_fibroblasts cell_cycle data and performing in vivo experiments we demonstrate that our computational strategy is able not only to confirm well known cell_cycle regulated_genes but also to predict not yet identified ones availability_and all scripts for implementation can be obtained on request cell_cycle is achieved by a highly_regulated temporal program of gene_expression where transcription is coordinated in a series of consecutive interdependent waves such just in time strategy is suggested by the experimental_observation that genes are expressed at peak levels at the time they are needed to study genes regulated in a cell_cycle dependent_manner researchers have deeply used messenger_rna expression_profiling microarrays of synchronously growing cells progressing through the cell_cycle nevertheless the genome_wide identification of cycling genes is a difficult_task for a number of reasons including cell synchronization loss and intrinsic microarray noise the most critical experimental issue is the degree of synchronization as well as its loss during a time course sampling this is the reason why various computational_methods have been proposed to correct such experimental artifact the key problem is that the loss of synchronization results in a flattening of the time profile due to the presence of cells in different stages of the cell_cycle to overcome this problem barhave recently_developed a combined experimental and computational_approach to recover true cell_cycle expression_profiles a number of different techniques have been proposed in the literature for the identification of cycling genes in many organisms all of them relying on a cyclicity scores based on the degree of regulation magnitude and or on a shape parameter fourier_analysis unfortunately there is a remarkably poor overlap between the gene_sets identified as cyclic in different experiments even for the same organism therefore none of them can be considered as the best method and this field is still an open area of research here we provide a new tool to identify cycling transcripts by integrating different features of gene_expression time profiles in fact the leon learning and optimization_algorithm combines in two separate steps information contained in the amplitude of the response learning step and information contained in the shape of the response by considering the consistency of peak timing between minima and maxima along two cell cycles optimization step in particular this last feature is suitable to overcome the loss of synchronization problem as peak timing of upregulation or downregulation is not significantly affected by such artifact in other words the shape of the expression_profile of the population of cells changes as a consequence of different cell progress rate but the up or down expression peak positions in time remain approximately the same this property is illustrated inthrough the example used bywhere raw and deconvolved data display the same peak timing the authors hypothesize that cell progress rates are distributed as a gaussian with a mean of average time and that observed expression values result from a convolution with such gaussian_kernel because the gaussian kernel_function is symmetric around the mean if a certain group of cells has a cell progress rate say d there is also a symmetric group of cells having a progress rate d the total effect of these contributions leaves the to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as maxima points and the minima points in the same time positions to prove the effectiveness of our approach we used recently_published human_fibroblasts cell_cycle data and performed in vivo experiments to validate our computational predictions
