genome_analysis read_count approach for dna copy_number detection motivation the advent_of sequencing_technologies is revolutionizing our ability in discovering and genotyping dna copy_number cnvs read_count based_approaches are able to detect cnv regions with an unprecedented_resolution although this computational strategy has been recently_introduced in literature much work has been already done for the preparation normalization and analysis of this kind of data results here we face the many aspects that cover the detection of cnvs by using read_count approach we first study the characteristics and systematic_biases of read_count distributions focusing on the normalization_methods designed for removing these biases subsequently we compare the algorithms designed to detect the boundaries of cnvs and we investigate the ability of read count_data to predict the exact number of dna copy finally we review the tools publicly_available for analysing read count_data to better understand the state of the art of read_count approaches we compare the performance of the three most widely used sequencing_technologies illumina_genome roche and life technologies solid in all the analyses that we perform contact human_genomes are characterized by genetic_variants that range from the single base_pair to large chromosomal events recent_studies have clearly shown that human_genomes differ more as a consequence of structural_variants than of single base_pair differences structural_variants svs are operationally defined as genomic_events bp that include copy_number cnvs and balanced rearrangements such as inversions and translocations with the sequencing of human_genomes now becoming routine the challenge is to discover the full extent of structural_variations and understand its effect on human_diseases complex_traits and to whom correspondence should be addressed evolution the last few years have seen the emergence of several high_throughput hts platforms that are based on various implementations of cyclic array sequencing the commercial products that are based on this sequencing_technology include the roches the illuminas genome_analyzer ga and the life technologiess lt solid although these platforms are quite diverse in sequencing biochemistry as well as in how the array is generated all of them allow to sequence millions of short_sequences reads simultaneously and are able to sequence a full human_genome per week at a cost fold less than previous methods the advent of hts platforms has opened many opportunities for the study of genomic_variants the first hts based_approach to detect svs was based on paired_end read_mapping pem which identifies insertions_and by comparing the distance between mapped read_pairs to the average insert_size of the genomic_library although this method is able to identify deletions kb with high_sensitivity it does not allow for the discovery of insertions larger than the average insert_size of the library and of the exact borders of svs in complex genomic_regions rich in segmental_duplication an altenative hts based_approach is based on split_read sr methods that allows to detect deletions and small insertions on the basis of a split sequence_read signature the alignment to the genome is broken and a continuous stretch of gaps in the read indicates a deletion or in the reference indicates an insertion although srs approach can be devised to detect a wide_range of sv classes with exact breakpoint resolution it is currently reliable only in the unique regions of the genome in this scenario a very promising approach for the identification of svs using hts technologies consists in measuring the number of reads aligned to the human_reference assuming the sequencing_process is uniform the number of reads mapping to a region is expected to be proportional to the number of times the region appears in the dna_sample following this assumption the copy_number of any genomic_region can be estimated by counting the number of reads read_counts aligned to that particular region were the firsts to use this approach to detect copy_number between tumour and healthy samples of the same individual whileproposed to use rc data to look for genomic_regions that differ in copy_number between normal individuals of the genomes_project at present few algorithms for rc analysis have been packagedpage
