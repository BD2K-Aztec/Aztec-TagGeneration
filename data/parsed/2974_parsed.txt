minimap and miniasm fast mapping and de_novo for noisy long_sequences motivation single_molecule real_time smrt sequencing_technology and oxford nanopore technologies ont produce reads over kb in length which have enabled high_quality genome_assembly at an affordable cost however at present long_reads have an error_rate as high as complex and computationally_intensive pipelines are required to assemble such reads results we present a new mapper minimap and a de_novo assembler miniasm for efficiently mapping and assembling smrt and ont reads without an error_correction stage they can often assemble a sequencing run of bacterial data into a single contig in a few minutes and assemble fold caenorhabditis_elegans data in min orders_of than the existing pipelines though the consensus_sequence error_rate is as high as raw_reads we also introduce a pair_wise read_mapping format and a graphical fragment assembly format and demonstrate the inter operability between ours and current_tools availability_and high_throughput short_read sequencing_technologies such as illumina have empowered a variety of biological researches and clinical_applications that would not be practical with the older sanger_sequencing however the short read_length typically a few hundred basepairs has posed a great challenge to de_novo as many repetitive_sequences and segmental_duplications are longer than the read_length and can hardly be resolved by short_reads even with paired_end data although with increased read_length and improved algorithms we are now able to produce much better short_read assemblies than a few years_ago the contiguity and completeness of the assemblies are still not as good as sanger assemblies the pacbios smrt technology were developed partly as an answer to the problem with short_read de_novo however due to the high per base error_rate around these reads were only used as a complement to short_reads initially untildemonstrated the feasibility of smrt only assembly since then smrt is becoming the preferred technology for finishing small_genomes and producing high_quality eukaryotic_genomes oxford nanopore technologies ont has recently offered another long_read sequencing_technology although the per base error_rate was high at the early access phase the latest data_quality has been greatly_improved confirmed that we can achieve high_quality bacterial assembly with ont data alone published long_read assembly pipelines all include four stages i all vs all raw read_mapping ii raw read_error iii assembly of error corrected reads and iv contig consensus polish stage_iii may involve all vs all read_mapping again but as the error_rate is much reduced at this step it is easier and faster than stage i shows the tools used for each stage notably our tool minimap is a raw read overlapper and miniasm is an assembler we do not correct sequencing_errors but instead directly produce unpolished and uncorrected contig sequences from raw read overlaps the idea of correction free assembly was inspired by talks given by gene each stage can be achieved with multiple tools although we have successfully combined tools into different pipelines we need to change or convert the input output_formats to make them work together another contribution of this article is the proposal of concise mapping and assembly formats which will hopefully encourage modular design of assemblers and the associated tools
