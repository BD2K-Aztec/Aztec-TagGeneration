genetics_and ancestral haplotype_based association_mapping with generalized_linear accounting for stratification motivation in many situations genome_wide are performed in populations presenting stratification mixed models including a kinship matrix accounting for genetic_relatedness among individuals have been shown to correct for population and or family_structure here we extend this methodology to generalized_linear which properly model data under various distributions in addition we perform association with ancestral haplotypes inferred using a hidden_markov results the method was shown to properly account for stratification under various simulated scenari presenting population and or family_structure use of ancestral haplotypes resulted in higher power than snps on simulated_datasets application to real_data demonstrates the usefulness of the developed model full analysis of a dataset with individuals and snps was performed in h min and required gb of ram availability the software glascow can be freely downloaded fromgenome wide association studies gwass identify genetic_variants e g snps cnv or indels affecting traits of interest such as those related to human_health or of agronomical importance with the development of high_throughput and next_generation these studies have been particularly successful hundreds of loci associated with diseases were detected through gwas e g association studies proved equally valuable in other organisms such as arabidopsis_thaliana mice dog crops or livestock species although very effective genetic_association still face a number of potential pitfalls one major_problem in gwas comes from the spurious_associations that may occur as a result of relatedness between individuals e g familial relationships or population_structure another issue is that especially for complex_traits non genetic_factors e g sex age etc may have profound impact on the scrutinized phenotype raising the need for proper modeling of these effects an appealing solution to these problems is to use a mixed model framework indeed this methodology makes it possible to include covariates in the model and to account for the average genomic relatedness among individuals population or family_structure such models have been used for many years for qtl_mapping especially in animal breeding recent_studies that inclusion of such effects in mixed models properly corrects for stratification and that the use of mixed models to control for stratification resulted in fewer false_positives and or higher power than other techniques such as genomic control structured association or principal_components in addition mixed models were able to capture the multiple levels of population_structure and genetic_relatedness all these features make mixed models a very promising tool to perform association_analyses while controlling for relatedness structure linear_mixed lmms assume that traits are normally distributed use of generalized_linear glmms allows extension of the mixed model approach to other types of traits such as binary_traits for example with these models a linear function of different covariates including polygenic and local genomic effects is used to describe the expected value of the observed phenotype through a so_called link function tzeng and zhang developed a variance components score test for association studies which can be used in the glmm framework analyses can be performed using single snp or haplotypes of multiple_snps haplotypes are specific combinations of alleles on the same chromosome they extract more information on the relation between dna variation and phenotypes than single snps and may present higher correlation with underlying mutations depending on the marker_density and the linkage_disequilibrium ld pattern in the population furthermore haplotype tests can model allelic_heterogeneity or find several interacting mutations at different tightly_linked sites however the power of haplotype_based tests is potentially reduced due to the extra to whom correspondence should be addressed
