quality_control of single_cell by sinqc single_cell scrna_seq is emerging as a promising technology for profiling cell to cell variability in cell_populations however the combination of technical noise and intrinsic biological_variability makes detecting technical_artifacts in scrna_seq samples particularly challenging proper detection of technical_artifacts is critical to prevent spurious_results during downstream_analysis in this study we present single_cell quality_control sinqc a method and software_tool to detect technical_artifacts in scrna_seq samples by integrating both gene_expression and data_quality information we apply sinqc to nine different scrna_seq data_sets and show that sinqc is a useful tool for controlling scrna_seq data_quality availability_and sinqc software and documents are available atsingle cell rna_seq scrna_seq provides a relatively unbiased approach to characterize and dissect the heterogeneity of cells in complex_mixtures however one of the major challenges of this technology is distinguishing biological_heterogeneity from technical_artifacts cells with substantial technical noise that makes their gene_expression distinguished from other cells to detect potential technical_artifacts in scrna_seq previous_studies have used various strategies that can be generally grouped into three categories the first category involves using housekeeping_genes to perform qc for example cells not expressing housekeeping_genes e g actb gapdh or abnormally expressing them are filtered out the assumption of methods in this category is that housekeeping_genes are highly and consistently expressed which is not necessarily true for single cells for example a study using single_cell qpcr not only showed that the gene_expression of housekeeping_genes had high variation between individual cells but also that gene_expression expression of housekeeping_genes can even distinguish cell_types thus a reliance on housekeeping_genes to perform qc can result in removing cells with real biological_variation the second category involves using overall gene_expression to define technical_artifacts for example cells are excluded from further analysis if they cluster separately from the rest of the cells or if their median expression values fall below a certain threshold the major_problem of the methods in this category is that they can potentially discard cells with real biological_variation the third category involves using the number of genes detected per some defined expression threshold and or the reads mapping rate to define technical_artifacts however the number of genes detected and mapping rate vary among experiments depending on the quality of a particular library cell_type or rna protocol hence the cutoff settings are typically arbitrary thus although single_cell approaches hold_great in exploring heterogeneity within a cell_population or complex_mixture qc still remains_a in this study we present single_cell quality_control sinqc a method and software_tool for detecting technical_artifacts in scrna_seq samples sinqc assumes that if gene_expression outliers are also associated with poor sequencing library quality poor v c the author published_by
