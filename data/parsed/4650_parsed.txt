the transcriptome_analysis and comparison explorer t ace a platform independent graphical tool to process large rnaseq datasets of non model_organisms motivation next_generation ngs_technologies allow a rapid and cost_effective compilation of large rna sequence_datasets in model and non model_organisms however the storage and analysis of transcriptome information from different ngs_platforms is still a significant bottleneck leading to a delay in data dissemination and subsequent biological understanding especially database interfaces with transcriptome_analysis modules going beyond mere read_counts are missing here we present the transcriptome_analysis and comparison explorer t ace a tool designed for the organization and analysis of large sequence_datasets and especially suited for transcriptome projects of non model_organisms with little or no a priori sequence_information t ace offers a tcl based interface which accesses a postgresql database via a php script within t ace information belonging to single sequences or contigs such as annotation or read_coverage is linked to the respective sequence and immediately accessible sequences and assigned information can be searched via keyword or blast_search additionally t ace provides within and between transcriptome_analysis modules on the level of expression go terms kegg_pathways and protein_domains results are visualized and can be easily exported for external analysis we developed t ace for laboratory environments which have only a limited amount of bioinformatics support and for collaborative projects in which different partners work on the same dataset from different locations or platforms windows linux macos for laboratories with some experience in bioinformatics and programming the low complexity of the database structure and open source_code provides a framework that can be customized according to the different needs of the user and transcriptome project contact recent_advances in sequencing_technology have led to an increasing accumulation of transcriptomic rnaseq_data although most of the data has been generated in model_organisms for which a high number of annotated sequences and complete_genomes are available increasing transcriptomic sequence_data for nonmodel organisms are generated for which only little or no a priori sequence_information exists the analysis of the obtained sequences and or contigs therefore relies on comparative_analysis with annotated_genes or protein_domains of other organisms a multimodal comparison with a high number of sequences from different organisms and databases e g ncbi uniprotkb gene_ontology go kegg should be pursued to gain a wider picture of the putative biological role of a specific sequence this approach however increases the quantity of information per sequence and adds to the already large amount of data not only bioinformatic processing of sequences i e cleaning assembly and annotation is still a bottleneck in rnaseq but so is the subsequent analysis of annotated sequences the analyzing scientist is faced with the problem of organizing the manifold blast hits protein_domains go terms and kegg pathway_information assigned to ten thousands of individual sequences together with the mere sequence_information such as nucleotide and translated protein_sequence protein domain_organization or in case of assembled_contigs read_coverage to date a number of software solutions exist for the assembly and annotation of transcriptomes major efforts have been put into the development of reference guided and de_novo tools several assemblers such as mira newbler roche life_sciences cap velvet and others were developed by researchers together with software and sequencing companies of which some are especially designed for different ngs applications e g illumina or solid it must be noted that de_novo rna sequence_assembly is a particularly difficult bioinformatic problem as e g the existence of transcript_isoforms usually results in many different contigs that cannot be merged in a simple fashion for review see beyond the mere sequence_assembly a suite of software solutions for clustering partigen protein prediction prot est and go
