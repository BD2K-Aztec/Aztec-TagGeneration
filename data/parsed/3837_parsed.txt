sequence_analysis quantifying uniformity of mapped_reads we describe a tool for quantifying the uniformity of mapped_reads in high_throughput sequencing_experiments our statistic directly measures the uniformity of both read position and fragment length and we explain how to compute a p value that can be used to quantify biases arising from experimental_protocols and mapping procedures our method is useful for comparing different protocols in experiments such as rna_seq availability_and we provide a freely_available and open_source python script that can be used to analyze raw read data or reads_mapped to transcripts in bam format atin biological_experiments controlling the quality of data is fundamental to the reliability and reproducibility of the results quality_control is especially important in modern sequencing_experiments where small biases in the preparation of dna libraries can be amplified in the subsequent sequencing steps which typically yield millions of reads sequenced_reads ideally represent fragments sampled uniformly at random from a library and expected coverage statistics can be obtained from the classic landerwaterman model lander and however a key aspect of current experiments is variable fragment length requiring the extension of the lander waterman model to account for random fragment position as well as length such a generalization was described inwhere it was shown that the data from a sequencing_experiment can be modeled by a two_dimensional spatial poisson_process we present a statistical_test for uniformity in the reads of a sequencing_experiment based on this idea and show how it can be used to compare multiple sets of reads in order to assess different protocols our test requires the alignment of paired_end to a reference transcriptome so that fragment positions and lengths can be determined fortunately such alignments are routinely produced after sequencing_experiments so that our test can easily be incorporated into sequencing analysis_pipelines we applied our statistical_test to examine a variety of popular rna_seq protocols using data analyzed in we compare seven paired_end methods on transcripts in the yeast_genome supplementarygives transcriptby transcript summary_statistics for the log probabilities there are multiple_criteria for selecting an rna_seq protocal but using readspy we find that the dutp protocol is statistically most randommeaning least biasedwhich agrees with additionally we make pairwise_comparisons between the methods which can be found in supplementary table s for each pair the binomial_test addresses statistically whether or not one method wins on more often than the other the p values for this test are also listed in supplementary table s our findings mostly agree with the results of however our method illustrates the variability in sequence uniformity among genes for instance gives the point sets for dutp protocol and two yeast genes ydr w in a and yjl c in b when comparing all seven methods dutp achieved p e for yjl w and p for ykl w a low p value indicates that the reads aligning to the transcript are not uniform which is undesirable one can visually see the difference inbetween non random in a and random in b
