gene_expression cop a database for characterizing co expressed gene_modules with biological_information in plants using a large dataset assays obtained from public plant microarray databases we developed the cop database for associating co expressed gene_modules with biological_information such as gene_ontology and if available metabolic_pathway names the confeito algorithm developed previously in our laboratory which is suitable to calculate the interconnectivity between genes in co expressed gene network was applied to extract co expressed gene_modules the database includes the gene_modules for arabidopsis_thaliana thale cress and seven crops glycine_max soybean hordeum_vulgare barley oryza_sativa rice populus_trichocarpa poplar triticum_aestivum wheat vitis_vinifera grape and zea_mays maize since the decoding of the arabidopsis_genome information on genome_sequences and gene_expression in plants has accumulated in public_databases many microarray_datasets assembled from various experiments e g different tissues and chemical_treatments including the atgenexpress datasets of arabidopsis have been utilized to predict co expressed genes for assigning them to metabolic_pathways transcriptional_regulation and or biological_processes there are several databases that are designed to extract coexpressed genes from plant microarray_datasets and then provide biological_information with individual genes in the co expressed gene group facilitating investigation of gene function see the review of cross_species comparison of relevant co expressed gene groups is also useful as seen in the database genecat that provides comparative_analysis of arabidopsis and barley co expressed genes on the basis of sequence_similarity association of co expressed gene_modules intentionally with biological_information such as gene_ontology go and metabolic_pathways would be useful however to our knowledge there is no such database available thus we havepage
