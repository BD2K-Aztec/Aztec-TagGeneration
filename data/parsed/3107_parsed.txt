genetics_and mr predictor a simulation engine for mendelian randomization studies i present mr predictor a simulation engine designed to guide the development and interpretation of statistical_tests of caus ality between phenotypes using genetic instruments mr predictor provides a framework to model either individual traits or complex scenarios where multiple_phenotypes are correlated or dependent on each other crucially mr predictor can incorporate the effects of multiple biallelic loci linked or unlinked contributing genotypic variability to one or more simulated phenotypes the software has a range of options for sample generation and output_files generated by mr predictor port into commonly used analysis tools e g plink r facilitating analyses germane for mendelian randomization studies benchmarks for speed and power calculations for summary_statistic based mendelian randomization analyses are presented and compared with analytical expectation availability_and the simulation engine is implemented in perl and the associated scripts can be downloaded from github com and online documentation tutorial and example datasets are available atthe discovery of genetic_polymorphisms contributing to a wide_range of human phenotypes has made causal_inference between traits or disease endpoints feasible by using these polymorphisms as instrumental_variables the approach dubbed mendelian randomization can be conceptualized as a natural version of a randomized_control as alleles that elevate or lower a biomarker of interest assort randomly at meiosis one popular application finds a researcher having selected multiple unlinked polymorphic_sites reproducibly associated to a biomarker of interest which are then assayed for relationship to a disease endpoint causal_inference can be assessed using either individual genotypes or the equivalent estimated effects summarized from large_scale association studies both approaches to inference are statistically valid if assumptions are satisfied as additional phenotypes and genetic_associations continue to be cataloged monte_carlo approaches that efficiently model complex phenotypic and genotypic relationships will be useful for continued analytical and methodological progress and addressing more complex models unfortunately existing software is optimized for genomics genetic_architecture applications which is careful to incorporate linkage between sites as well as other population genetic_features at computational expense and does not easily handle complex relationships between multiple_traits and genetic_variants simultaneously g thus i report a monte_carlo approach designed to generate samples of unrelated_individuals presenting multiple_phenotypes that also segregate genetic_polymorphisms that contribute to them
