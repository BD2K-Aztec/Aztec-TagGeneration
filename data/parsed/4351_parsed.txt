structural_bioinformatics spatial clustering of protein binding_sites for template based protein_docking motivation in recent_years much structural_information on protein_domains and their pair_wise interactions has been made available in public_databases however it is not yet clear how best to use this information to discover general rules or interaction_patterns about structural proteinprotein_interactions improving our ability to detect and exploit structural interaction_patterns will help to provide a better d picture of the known protein interactome and will help to guide docking based_predictions of the d structures of unsolved protein_complexes results this article_presents kbdock a d database approach for spatially clustering protein binding_sites and for performing template based knowledge based protein_docking kbdock combines residue contact_information from the did database with the pfam protein domain_family classification together with coordinate data from the protein_data this allows the d configurations of all known hetero domaindomain interactions to be superposed and clustered for each pfam family we find that most pfam_domain families have up to four hetero binding_sites and over of all domain families have just one hetero binding_site the utility of this approach for template based docking is demonstrated using complexes from the protein_docking benchmark overall up to out of complexes may be modelled by direct homology to existing domain interfaces and key binding_site information is found for of the remaining complexes these results show that kbdock can often provide useful information for predicting the structures of unknown protein_complexes proteinprotein_interactions ppis are central to many cellular_processes proteins often perform their function by interacting with other proteins to form proteinprotein_complexes in order to understand and predict ppis reliably and to relate such to whom correspondence should be addressed interactions to biological_function knowledge of the d structures of proteinprotein_complexes is vitally_important to date over protein_structures have been deposited in the protein_data pdb however it has been estimated recently that only of these structures correspond to heteromeric complexes therefore to bridge this gap there is much interest in developing computational_techniques to predict how two proteins fit together to form a complex however until recently many of the hetero complexes in the pdb have been enzyme inhibitor_complexes which are relatively easy to model directly hence so_called template based protein_docking has not yet attracted_much from the research_community since it is well known that protein_folds are often more evolutionarily_conserved than their sequences and since it has been shown that proteins with similar sequences often interact in similar_ways it follows that close structural homologues should also be expected to interact in similar_ways several studies have found that the locations of protein interaction sites are often conserved especially within domain families regardless of the structures of their binding_partners additionally it has also been observed that many protein_families employ only one or a small number of binding_sites suggesting that the same surface patch is often re used indeed it has been demonstrated previously that the structure of an unknown protein complex may often be successfully modelled using the known binding_sites of homologous domains this may be described as templatebased docking or docking by homology in recent_years much structural_information on protein_domains and on ppis has been made available in on line databases however beyond listing the residues observed at the interface between a given pair of proteins or protein_domains there is no generally_accepted way to define what actually constitutes a protein binding_site or to quantify whether or not two binding_sites are structurally_similar for example recent methods to compare structural interfaces have used techniques based on e g geometric hashing of cliques of interface c atoms combining geometric hashing with a physicochemical complementarity scoring functionpage kbdock provides a systematic way to store and analyse the d structures of protein domain binding_sites by superposing the structures of all hetero ddis involving a given query domain and by using the simple notion of an interface direction vector to define the central_region a protein binding_site a small number of spatially distinct binding_sites may be identified for each pfam domain_family using this approach we find that the majority of the pfam_domain families have a small number up to four of hetero binding_sites and over have just one hetero binding_site kbdock can be used to find automatically homologous hetero ddis with which to model the unknown d structure of given protein complex in of the docking benchmark examples studied kbdock finds a small number of high_quality ddi templates with which to model the target complex furthermore one of the unique strengths of kbdock is that it can find semihomologous templates even when no full homology template is available hence kbdock provides a useful knowledge based_approach for template based protein_docking and for helping to describe and understand structural ppis on a genomic_scale
