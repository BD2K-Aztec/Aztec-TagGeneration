rvd an ultra sensitive variant detection model for low depth heterogeneous next_generation next_generation is increasingly being used for clinical diagnostic_tests clinical samples are often genomically heterogeneous due to low sample purity or the presence of genetic subpopulations therefore a variant_calling algorithm for calling low_frequency polymorphisms in heterogeneous_samples is needed results we present a novel variant_calling algorithm that uses a hierarchical_bayesian to estimate allele_frequency and call variants in heterogeneous_samples we show that our algorithm improves upon current classifiers and has higher sensitivity_and over a wide_range of median read_depth and minor_allele fraction we apply our model and identify mutated loci in the paxp gene in a matched clinical breast ductal_carcinoma tumor sample two of which are likely loss_of events next_generation ngs_technology has enabled the systematic interrogation of the genome for a fraction of the cost of traditional assays protocol and platform engineering improvements have enabled the generation of bases of sequence_data in h for as a result ngs is increasingly being used as a general platform for research assays for methylation_state dna mutations genomes copy_number promoter occupancy and others ngs diagnostics are being translated to clinical_applications including non_invasive fetal diagnostics infectious disease_diagnostics cancer_diagnostics and human microbiome_analysis the human_microbiome consortium increasingly ngs is being used to interrogate mutations in heterogeneous clinical samples for example ngs based noninvasive fetal dna_testing uses maternal blood_sample to sequence the minority fraction of cell_free infectious_diseases such as hiv and influenza may contain many genetically_heterogeneous sub populations dna_sequencing of individual regions of a solid_tumor has revealed genetic heterogeneous within an individual sample importantly accounting for technical errors can drastically improve performance however the primary statistical_tools for calling variants from ngs_data are optimized for homogeneous samples samtools and gatk use a naive_bayesian decision_rule to call variants gatk involves more sophisticate pre_and processing_steps wherein the genotype prior is fixed and constant across all loci and the likelihood of an allele at a locus is a function of the phred score recently some have developed algorithms to call low_frequency or rare_variants in heterogeneous_samples developed a bayesian_framework which can model the normal dna contamination and intra_tumor by parameterizing the normal genotype cell proportion at each snp varscan combines algorithmic heuristics to call genotypes in the tumor and normal sample pileup data and then applies a fishers_exact on the read count_data to detect a significant_difference in the genotype_calls strelka uses a hierarchical bayesian_approach to model the joint_distribution of the allele_frequency in the tumor and normal samples at each locus with the joint_distribution available one is able to identify locations with dissimilar allele_frequencies mutect uses a bayesian posterior_probability in its decision_rule to evaluate the likelihood of a mutation rvd uses a hierarchical_bayesian to capture the error structure of the data and call variants that algorithm requires a very high read_depth to estimate the sequencing_error and call variants several studies have compared the relative performance of these algorithms demonstrated that varscan somatic performed the best when comparing samtools gatk and splinter for detecting minor_allele fractions mafs of with coverage required for optimal_performance however also highlighted the fact that varscan yielded more false_positives at high read_depth showed that varscan somatic outperformed strelka and had performance on par with mutect in detecting a maf for read_depths between and the remainder of this article is organized as follows in the next section we describe the statistical_model structure of our new algorithm rvd then we derive a sampling algorithm for computing the posterior_distribution over latent_variables in the model and use those samples in a bayesian posterior_distribution hypothesis_test to call variants we compare the performance of rvd to several other variant_calling for a range of read_depths and minor_allele fractions finally we show that rvd is able to call variants on a heterogeneous clinical sample and identify two novel loss ofheterozygosity events we tested rvd using synthetic dna and data from the hcc primary ductal_carcinoma sample the inference algorithm parameters were set to yield gibbs samples with a burn in and thinning rate for a final total of samples we drew samples from estimate the posterior_probability of a variant we performed the posterior difference test to identify mutations in the haploid synthetic data we set the threshold s and the size of the test a for the hcc dataset we identified both somatic and germline_mutations in the posterior somatic test we set the threshold s and the size of the test a in the posterior germline test we set the threshold s considering the low average coverage the size of the test is set at a we performed the v non uniformity test after the posterior density tests we describe here a novel algorithm for model estimation and hypothesis_testing for identifying single_nucleotide in heterogeneous_samples using ngs_data our algorithm has a higher sensitivity_and than many other approaches for a range of read_depths and mafs our inference algorithm uses gibbs_sampling to do inference in the rvd hierarchical empirical_bayes model this sampling procedure provides a guarantee to identify the global optimal parameter_settings asymptotically however it may require many samples to achieve that guarantee causing the algorithm to be slower than other deterministic approaches we opted for this balance of speed and accuracy because computational time is often not limiting and the cost of a false_positive or false_negative greatly outweighs the cost of more computation another factor that can affect the speed of rvd is the number of mh sample within one gibbs_sampling run rvd is able to use multiple cores in parallel which can significantly improve time efficiency in future_studies we plan to reduce the computational_cost by using more sophisticated mcmc sampling methods or deterministic approximation methods such as variational em or stochastic variational em we have focused on the statistical_model and hypothesis_test in this study and our results do not include any pre filtration of erroneous reads or post filtration of mutation calls beyond a simple quality_score threshold incorporation of such data_cleaning steps will likely improve the accuracy of the algorithm our approach does not address identification of indels structural_variants or copy_number those mutations typically require specific data analysis models and tests that are different than those for singlenucleotide variants furthermore analysis of rna_seq or other data generated on the ngs platform may require different models that are more appropriately tuned to the particular noise feature of that data the availability of clinical sequence_data is increasing as the technical capability to sequence clinical samples at low_cost improves consequently we require statistically accurate algorithms that are able to call germline and somatic_point in heterogeneous_samples with low purity such accurate algorithms are a step toward greater access to genomics for clinical_diagnostics
