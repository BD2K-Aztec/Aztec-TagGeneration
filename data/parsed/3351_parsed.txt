ontology patterns for tabular representations of biomedical knowledge on neglected_tropical motivation ontology like domain_knowledge is frequently published in a tabular format embedded in scientific_publications we explore the re use of such tabular content in the process of building ntdo an ontology of neglected_tropical ntds where the representation of the interdependencies between hosts pathogens and vectors plays_a results as a proof_of we analyzed a tabular compilation of knowledge about pathogens vectors and geographic_locations involved in the transmission of ntds after a thorough ontological analysis of the domain of interest we formulated a comprehensive design pattern rooted in the biomedical_domain upper_level ontology biotop this pattern was implemented in a vba script which takes cell contents of an excel spreadsheet and transforms them into owl dl after minor manual post_processing the correctness and completeness of the ontology was tested using pre formulated competence questions as description logics dl queries the expected results could be reproduced by the ontology the proposed approach is recommended for optimizing the acquisition of ontological domain_knowledge from tabular representations availability_and domain examples source_code and ontology are freely_available on the web atthe results of life_sciences research are published in a variety of formats large_scale experimental_data and research results are disseminated in databases such as uniprot http www uniprot org ensembl http www ensembl org index html or arrayexpress http www ebi ac uk arrayexpress whereas parts of the more aggregated and manually reworked information are published in the scientific_literature in the form of tables in contradistinction to databases where entries follow pre defined database schemas scientific authors are free in the composition of tables aside from tables that mainly contain numeric values we frequently encounter symbolic entries i e text strings often from controlled_vocabularies in these tables terms are displayed in a repetitive form for which interpretations are provided by the row and column headings the legend and the reference in the text the proper interpretation by the reader often requires considerable background to whom correspondence should be addressed knowledge and no semantic standard interpretation can be assumed for this kind of data controlled terms in tabular representations of research results may denote individuals such as names of geographic entities persons or institutions but also general terms which denote classes or types of individuals such as molecules organisms or diseases it is this kind of tabular information that we will scrutinize under a viewpoint of formal ontology our hypothesis is that many tables in scientific_papers at least partly convey ontological content which can be diligently exploited in the construction process of formal ontologies as both ontology building and maintenance are labor_intensive tasks semi_automated knowledge acquisition from tabular representations may constitute an interesting rationalization measure we are however equally aware that the symbolic content may frequently cross the boundaries of what is expressible by ontologies thus requiring other knowledge representation formalisms this article is structured as follows after this introduction biomedical_ontologies and their standards are shortly introduced followed by the biomedical background of our case study the field of neglected_tropical ntds in the third section the resources and methods for table guided ontology construction and evaluation are presented results are given in the fourth section the article_concludes with a brief review of related work our case study has shown that it is possible to represent moderately complex biological situations in standard dl using tools and standards recommended by the semantic_web community we proved the ability to reason over such dl models and illustrate the dependency of this approach on principled ontological foundations imposing strict categorial distinctions our formal patterns profited in particular from the re use of a rigid set of object properties found in the upper_level ontology biotop which had their domains and ranges strictly constrained our study shows the usefulness and expressive superiority of the use of true dl queries instead of simple resource_description rdf based sparql queries the latter being much more popular and the former unfortunately still not finalized in a w c recommendation with sparql dl being under development however both query syntaxes are complex and their appropriate use requires considerable training an advantage of dl queries lies in the absence of free variables and the natural way of reasoning over taxonomic hierarchies although the latter is of only marginal interest in our use case it becomes highly_relevant as soon as a similar ontology is linked e g to a representation of biological taxa or a gazetteer with geographic names for the representation of the latter we recommend reifying expressions which include particulars such as haslocus value brazil as a result all reasoning can be performed on a tbox level i e without explicit reference to particulars tooling support for the construction of complex dl queries could be significantly_improved especially in cases where the underlying ontology provides rich domain and range constraints their use as a guidance to the query builder is still a desideratum for protg or other ontology editors and workbenches the support of reasoning use cases which include both subclass retrieval and satisfiability testing was the main rationale for the described effort which makes extensive use of owl dl constructors such as disjunction negation and value restrictions as well as numerous large and complex full class definitions the drastic decrease in reasoning performance was therefore not surprising expressivity together with a strong focus on dl reasoning is certainly one major distinctive criterion when comparing ntdo with obo ontologies or the ontologies developed bywhich represent a similar domain with a i page i i i in this study we investigated two questions first how can canonical domain_knowledge about the transmission of rare tropical_diseases be expressed in a way that warrants reliable answers to relevant competency questions formulated by epidemiologists secondly how legacy information contained in tables mainly within scientific_papers can be transformed into a formal ontology which obeys the principles of philosophically founded and formally accurate ontology design we found satisfactory_results for both questions but also encountered serious performance limitations comprehensive domain_knowledge can be represented in expressive dl and can be queried by dl expressions and a reasoner however the scalability is limited due to the inherent computational_complexity furthermore the construction of such queries is currently not satisfactorily supported by user_friendly tools constraining the users by making them choose an optimized owl profile will either lead to constraints in modeling expressivity owl ql or to performance problems in larger ontologies owl el we successfully developed an export tool based on ontology design patterns which have to be individually crafted for each table here the limitation lies in the content of many tables which do not contain ontological knowledge in a strict sense in these cases other representational formalisms e g for probabilistic knowledge need to be employed which clearly lie outside the realm of ontology and dl
