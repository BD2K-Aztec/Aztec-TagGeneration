a k_mer scheme to predict pirnas and characterize locust pirnas motivation identifying piwi_interacting pirnas of non model_organisms is a difficult and unsolved_problem because pirnas lack conservative secondary_structure motifs and sequence_homology in different species results in this article a k_mer scheme is proposed to identify pirna sequences relying on the training_sets from non pirna and pirna sequences of five model species sequenced rat mouse human fruit_fly and nematode compared with the existing static scheme based on the position specific base usage our novel dynamic algorithm performs much better with a precision of over and a sensitivity of over and the precision is verified by fold_cross in these species to test its validity we use the algorithm to identify pirnas of the migratory locust based on deep sequenced small rna_sequences totally pirnas of the locust are predicted and of them matched with existing locust transposons the transcriptional difference between solitary and gregarious locusts was described we also revisit the position specific base usage of pirnas and find the conservation in the end of pirnas therefore the method we developed can be used to identify pirnas of non model_organisms without complete_genome availability the web_server for implementing the algorithm and the software code are freely_available to the academic community atnon coding rnas ncrnas are functional rna_molecules that are not translated into proteins including highly abundant and functionally_important rnas such as transfer_rna trna and ribosomal_rna rrna as well as other rnas such as snornas micrornas sirnas and pirnas and the long ncrnas among them the ones of typically nt in length are called small_rna piwi interacting rna pirna is the largest class of small to whom correspondence should be addressed rna_molecules expressed in animal cells especially in germ_cells and nt_long in general pirnas form rnaprotein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins and has no clear secondary_structure motifs and its length is slightly longer than mirna compared with mirnas pirna is lack of primary sequence_conservation and the presence of a uridine is common in both vertebrates and invertebrates pirnas in the nematode have a monophosphate and a modification that block either or oxygen and are confirmed to exist in fruit_fly zebrafish mice and rats piwi argonaute also known as pazpiwi domain or ppd protein_family is evolutionarily_conserved owing to its functional significance in stem_cell and germline development pirna derives from the post_transcriptional amplification pingpong model and it may be involved in germ_cell formation germline stem_cell spermiogenesis and oogenesis therefore available pirna data mainly come from model species with complete_genome a general approach to detecting pirna is based on the combination of immunoprecipitation and deep_sequencing in model and sequenced organisms however the lowly_expressed or issue specific pirnas might be missed using this method in addition some of pirnas are not produced by ping_pong model thus computational_methods may provide an alternative approach to detect pirnas which can summarize general properties from known pirnas and then train them to predict novel pirnas first use the position specific usage of upstream bases and downstream bases of u to construct a vector with components by which they characterized and identified mouse pirnas with a precision of they also found that mouse pirnas have some position special_properties such as g or a at position a at position and a slight underrepresentation of g at position however their method has limitations in predicting pirnas from the organism without genome information meanwhile this method cannot efficiently detect those pirnas derived from utr of mrna which are not produced by ping_pong model furthermore pirna sequences are quite divergent among different species lakshmi and agrawal page most general methods such as blast and meme are inappropriate for pirna prediction for example we cannot find any homologous pirnas between fruit_fly and other species with blast and not any conserved_motifs are found in pirnas with meme therefore more efficient computational_methods are urgently demanded the k_mer scheme is widely used to characterize biosequences because patterns using k_mers have been found to be species or taxon special it is important to note that the solexa small_rna data may also include mirna pirna as well as some short fractions of snorna snrna long ncrna and un annotated mrnas which have similar lengths to pirna in fact noncode version has ncrnas shorter than nt suggesting that most ncrna may produce a sequence fraction with similar length to pirna moreover possible background_noise also exists including the background information introduced by solexa the degraded rna_fragments in sample_preparation and the noise caused by the random match of data with genome studies ofdemonstrated that there are about short_sequences in possible candidates of locust small_rnas are unannotated on the other words there are about unannoted small_rnas in which there would be a huge number of pirnas and other short_sequences obviously these remaining sequences could cover real pirnas the fractions of long ncrnas unannotated mrnas and noise produced by solexa therefore pirnas in solexa small_rna data cannot be identified merely based on their lengths in order to predict pirnas an efficient algorithm is required to distinguish the real pirna from the sequences within similar range of length here we used all the nt strings and an improved fisher discriminant algorithm to characterize pirna sequences in five model species rat mouse human fruit_fly and nematode the novel algorithm reached a prediction precision of over and a sensitivity of over in these species we applied this algorithm to the deep sequenced small_rna data of the migratory locust locusta_migratoria which is an important_agricultural pest and model species for physiology neuroscience and behavior this method successfully identified pirnas of the locust with the same precision and sensitivity as the five model species therefore the method proposed in this study can be used to predict pirnas for both model and non model_organisms in this article we implemented a k_mer algorithm to predict pirnas compared with previous_approaches the new method does not require a reference_genome and gives a much better performance on pirna prediction we also improved the fisher algorithm by setting different cutoffs and elevating the precision rate the basic work is to obtain the fisher vector w the mean value m and the sd n std of the negative samples then a sequence represented by a d vector x can be regarded as a pirna if its w x is larger than m n std using this new scheme we obtained putative pirnas from the locust which would be very helpful in studying the phase_transition mechanism of insects especially hemimetamorphosis insects moreover the locust pirnas which have the largest ratio of solitary to gregarious reads and the locust pirnas matched with existing transposons may provide_excellent candidates page for studying phase_transition via locust transcriptome and rnai experiments on the other hand the results provided important cues understanding the molecular_mechanism of fecundity difference between solitary and gregarious locusts most notably different from other methods in literatures the novel prediction approach is based on the general property of string usage in pirnas which is extracted from all available pirnas we believe that this method can be widely used to predict pirnas from both model and non model_organisms
