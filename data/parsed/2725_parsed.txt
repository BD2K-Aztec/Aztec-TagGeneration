data_and lipid pro a computational lipid identification solution for untargeted lipidomics on data_independent tandem_mass platforms a major_challenge for mass_spectrometric based lipidomics aiming at describing all lipid_species in a biological_sample lies in the computational and bioinformatic processing of the large amount of data that arises after data_acquisition lipid pro is a software_tool that supports the identification of lipids by interpreting large_datasets generated by liquid_chromatography lcms ms using the advanced data_independent mode ms e in the ms e mode the instrument fragments all molecular_ions generated from a sample and records time resolved molecular_ion data as well as fragment_ion data for every detectable molecular_ion lipid pro matches the retention time aligned mass to charge ratio data of molecular and fragment_ions with a lipid database and generates a report on all identified lipid_species for generation of the lipid database lipid pro provides a module for construction of lipid_species and their fragments using a flexible building_block approach hence lipid pro is an easy to use analysis tool to interpret complex ms e lipidomics data and also offers a module to generate a user specific lipid database availability_and lipid pro is freely_available at lipids are compounds of biological_origin that are soluble in nonpolar solvents in biological_systems lipids perform ubiquitous functions such as construction of cell_membranes stabilization of membrane_bound proteins balancing of energy_metabolism or cell_signaling all lipid_species in a cell or tissue are referred to as the lipidome changes within lipidomes have been closely_linked to stress_responses or various diseases_including obesity heart_diseases or neurodegenerative_diseases reviewed in liquid chromatography_coupled lcms ms is suitable for lipidome analysis since it can cover a broad range of lipids both data dependent acquisition dda and data_independent dia are widely used for lcms based lipidomics in dda the most abundant molecular_ions at each retention time rt are successively v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com selected for isolation and fragmentation despite the advantages of the dda approach there are some inherent_limitations such as often irreproducible molecular_ion selection undersampling and long instrument cycle times dia overcomes those limitations ms e supported by waters qtof instrument platforms acquires intact molecular and fragment_ions in an unbiased manner by continuously switching the energy for collision_induced between low ms and high ms_ms energy dia analysis requires coherent and intricate data_processing since it produces complex data containing information on all molecular and fragment_ions at each rt commercial and free downloadable software such as mzmine or lipid data analyser provide support to align and compare the spectral_features of lcms data these applications identify lipid_species in lcms raw_data by matching their monoisotopic masses or elemental_compositions with a custom based or online database however these software applications do not consider fragmentation data lipidblast identifies lipid_species by matching the measured ms_ms to an in silico generated library after converting raw_data into the mgf format lipidblast can be used for the analysis of ms e data but it is laborious to match hundreds of different lipid_species of the database with lcms ms data we developed the lipid pro software solution for rapid identification of lipids in preprocessed dia data acquired with lcms ms using rt aligned monoisotopic masses of molecular_ions ms and fragment_ions ms_ms since lipid pro provides a module for construction of lipid_species and their characteristic fragments using a flexible building_block approach rare or even non described lipids beside the common species can be identified in total_lipid extracts of biological_samples to meet the technological objectives of this research we took a step_forward in the development of a new user_friendly modular and client based database management system the lipid pro application can be configured on microsoft windows platforms following a simple six step installation process
