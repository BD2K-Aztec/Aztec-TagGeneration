gene_expression compcoder an r package for benchmarking differential_expression methods for rna_seq compcoder is an r package for benchmarking of differential_expression methods in particular methods developed for analyzing rna_seq the package provides functionality for simulating realistic rna_seq count datasets an interface to several of the most commonly used differential_expression methods and extensive functionality for evaluating and comparing different approaches on real and simulated_data availability_and compcoder is available fromtranscriptome profiling studies using rna_seq with the goal of finding genes that are differentially_expressed de between conditions are abundant in the current scientific_literature and can be expected to become even more so as next_generation becomes cheaper and more accessible rna_seq experiments generate millions of short_reads which are aligned to a reference_sequence to yield a quantitative measure of the expression levels of a collection of genes or other features typically the processed data are represented as a count matrix which constitutes the input for many differential_expression methods in the past_few many novel differential_expression methods applicable to count matrices obtained from rna_seq experiments have been presented for example at this point both users and developers of such methods would thus greatly benefit from objective and standardized benchmarking and characterization of new and existing_approaches a few comparison studies have been published e g however the fast pace at which new and updated methods are being presented and the varying objectives of the users create a need for a tool that makes it easy to evaluate and compare a collection of methods from many different aspects in a standardized way in this applications note we present such a tool compcoder comparison of count_based differential_expression methods with r is a benchmarking r package that in a few steps lets the user evaluate and compare differential_expression methods using an approach similar to the one used by soneson and delorenzi accompanying the package is a large collection of simulated and real_world benchmarking datasets together with differential_expression results obtained by different approaches available from http bcf isb sib ch data compcoder the exact r code used to run each differential_expression is included and can be rerun to reproduce the results taken together the package provides users with a pedagogical interface to understand and compare differential_expression methods and gives developers an accessible tool for standardized benchmarking of newly_developed approaches
