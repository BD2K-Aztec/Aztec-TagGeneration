gene_expression hybrid bayesian rank integration approach improves the predictive_power of genomic dataset aggregation motivation modern molecular technologies allow the collection of large_amounts of high_throughput data on the functional_attributes of genes often multiple technologies and study_designs are used to address the same biological_question such as which genes are over expressed in a specific disease_state consequently there is considerable interest in methods that can integrate across datasets to present a unified set of predictions results an important aspect of data_integration is being able to account for the fact that datasets may differ in how accurately they capture the biological signal of interest while many methods to address this problem exist they always rely either on dataset internal statistics which reflect data_structure and not necessarily biological_relevance or external gold_standards which may not always be available we present a new rank_aggregation method for data_integration that requires neither external standards nor internal statistics but relies on bayesian reasoning to assess dataset relevance we demonstrate that our method outperforms established techniques and significantly_improves the predictive_power of rank_based aggregations we show that our method which does not require an external gold_standard provides reliable estimates of dataset relevance and allows the same set of data to be integrated differently depending on the specific signal of interest availability the method is implemented in r and is freely_available atthe availability of high_throughput experimental_technologies has greatly_increased the rate of data generation however the reliability of individual high_throughput datasets is often uncertain and the development of techniques to integrate the results across different studies to improve the validity and reproducibility of findings has been an important area of research in samples studying disease related expression changes for example sample_size is a common limitation and data_integration by statistical meta_analysis has been used repeatedly to boost statistical_power and find reliable signals formal meta_analyses rely on the statistical_properties of each independent dataset and common strategies involve combining effect_sizes and p values see for a comprehensive_review however the fundamental limitation of this approach is that statistical_properties may not correlate with how well a particular biological_question is addressed a single study may show large_effect and small p values but can be biologically invalid owing to design flaws for example a study purporting to find large expression differences in ethnic_groups was later shown to be confounded by batch_effect an alternative data_integration approach that is robust to discordance between statistical_power and biological validity is bayesian integration with an external gold_standard this approach does not use any internal dataset statistics and has the additional advantage that it can be used to perform integration tasks that cannot even in principle be addressed with statistical meta_analysis such as integrating data from completely unrelated experimental platforms in the bayesian integration approach the accuracy of each dataset is measured in terms of how well it is able to reproduce known information in the gold_standard for example in integrating genomic_datasets for functional network_predictions each dataset is evaluated against a gold_standard of functionally interacting_proteins in this case datasets only contribute a set of final predictions which may be categorical or real valued whose accuracy is judged independently of the underlying data_structure the limitation of the bayesian_approach is that it requires the existence of an acceptable gold_standard against which individual predictions are evaluated for some integration tasks such as disease gene_expression studies such a standard is typically not available moreover even well established standards of knowledge such as the gene_ontology or kegg are only limited to capturing accuracy relative to what is already known thus if a dataset captures correct but completely novel biological_information its value is not recognized by the comparison with a gold_standard lacking any sampling of this signal and its contribution will be discarded a practical alternative to formal statistical meta_analysis or bayesian_analysis is combining datasets directly without any treatment of the underlying statistics or any reference to the external_standard such methods can be applied in a variety of contexts where statistics and external standards may be unavailable or prone to producing misleading quality_assessments in this integration approach each dataset contributes equally to the consensus signature without loss of generality the approach to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com can be viewed as an instance of rank_aggregation where each dataset supplies a prediction list that is not necessarily complete in order of differential_expression correlation or some other metric of relevance unfortunately treating all datasets equally can make these methods unacceptably sensitive to noise and outliers to address these limitations we propose a new data_integration method that combines the rank_aggregation framework with the power of bayesian reasoning our method assumes that there is a ground_truth to be discovered and this is represented with varying fidelity in the datasets to be integrated starting with an equally weighted consensus generated by rank averaging we iteratively fit bayes_factors to each dataset and recompute the integration result thus this approach_combines the advantages of being agnostic to dataset specific statistics and external standards while using the robustness of the bayesian_framework to handle outliers and inconsistencies we demonstrate that this approach has favorable theoretical_properties on an established simulation pipe line and improves over other rank_aggregation methods in real data_integration tasks the method is computationally simple yet significantly increases the predictive_power of rank_based aggregations additionally it provides a reliable estimate of dataset relevance and can be used to produce contextsensitive integrations that focus in on specific areas of interest because it requires only ranked lists it is readily_applicable to many integration problems we present a method that implements rank_aggregation via bayesian reasoning our method differs from previous rank_aggregation approaches in that it directly estimates the reliability of individual_datasets weighing them accordingly we have shown that the birra method outperforms established approaches on simulations and performs well in real data_integration scenarios however the method will likely not be applicable to all data_integration tasks without some further developments for example as it operates entirely by bootstrapping it is even more susceptible to deviations from the independence_assumption underlying the naive_bayes calculations in general the bayes_factors and probabilities calculated by our method are always inflated relative to those that are calculated with an external gold_standard and the gap widens when dataset dependence is present birra performance on the stem_cell expression integration which has considerable dataset dependence demonstrates that the method is effective despite the independence_assumption however dependence will have to be addressed directly for integrations that involve a larger number of datasets it is likely that in those cases the deleterious_effects of data dependence can be negated using regularization techniques commonly_applied to standard based bayesian integration and finding a suitable regularization method will be an important direction for future_research
