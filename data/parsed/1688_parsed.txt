sequence_analysis explicet graphical_user software for metadata driven management analysis and visualization of microbiome data studies of the human_microbiome and microbial community_ecology in general have blossomed of late and are now a burgeoning source of exciting research findings along with the advent_of platforms which have dramatically_increased the scope of microbiome related projects several high performance sequence analysis_pipelines e g qiime mothur vamps are now available to investigators for microbiome_analysis the subject of our manuscript the graphical_user based explicet software_package fills a previously unmet need for a robust yet intuitive means of integrating the outputs of the software pipelines with user specified metadata and then visualizing the combined data availability_and explicet is implemented in c via the qt framework and supported in native code on all major operating_systems windows macintosh linux the source_code documents and tutorials are freely_available under an open_source at www explicet org the scope of microbial_ecology studies has increased_significantly over the past_decade driven in part by the realization that microbial_communities are critical mediators of human and ecosystem_health furthermore a fold decrease in the cost of dna_sequencing www genome gov sequencingcosts has resulted in a commensurate increase in the volume of data to analyze in response many software systems e g s pipelines have been created to deal with the resulting glut of data vamps mbl edu at present software_tools for microbiome_analysis often require some sophistication in computer skills to perform even basic analyses because tools using graphical_user provide more facile interactivity for data exploration we have developed explicet latin for explanation which consumes the output from existing sequence analysis_pipelines and greatly expedites metadata driven management analysis and visualization of sequence classification results be calculated through resampling and rarefaction results are presented as line plots heatmaps and data tables all tabulated data are exportable as delimited text_files for import into other tools e g r or sas whereas figures are exported as editable pdfs explicet fills a critical need for a robust yet intuitive means of integrating the outputs of sequence processing and classification pipelines with user specified metadata and then visualizing the combined data although designed initially for s analysis explicet can be applied to any dataset organized through a hierarchical classification_scheme e g other genes or metagenomes for bioinformaticians explicet offers a powerful means of rapidly evaluating and segmenting large microbial_ecology datasets for non bioinformaticians a familiar easy to use mouse driven software application softens the training focus away from software logistics and toward the microbiology and statistical_methods that underpin microbial_ecology practical use of explicet in several laboratory settings has been found to reduce the requirements for personnel with bioinformatics computational expertise consequently the analysis of complex microbiome datasets is now much more accessible to the growing number of investigators who wish to bring a microbial ecological perspective to their fields of interest especially in medicine and the environmental sciences non parametric statistical_comparison of samples indicating that two taxa differ significantly between sample_types d heatmap of morisitahorn similarity between samples
