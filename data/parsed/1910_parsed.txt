funtoonorm an r package for normalization of dna_methylation data when there are multiple cell or tissue_types motivation dna_methylation are well known to vary substantially across cell_types or tissues hence existing normalization_methods may not be optimal if they do not take this into account we therefore present a new r package for normalization of data from the illumina_infinium human methylation beadchip illumina k built on the concepts in the recently_published funnorm method and introducing cell_type or tissue type flexibility results funtoonorm is relevant for data_sets containing samples from two or more cell or tissue_types a visual display of cross_validated errors informs the choice of the optimal number ofrecently a normalization method was introduced by fortin et_al the percentilespecific adjustments in funnorm are the key feature allowing batch_effects and technical artefacts to have non constant influence across the range of signal strengths however since methylation patterns may differ substantially across cell_types or tissues leading to cell or tissue type specific quantiles optimal normalization adjustments should capture this here we present an r package for normalization of illumina k data funtoonorm an extension of the ideas in funnorm applicable to such heterogeneous data_sets
