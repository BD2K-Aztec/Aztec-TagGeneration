data_and galaxy lims for next_generation we have developed a laboratory_information lims for a next_generation ngs laboratory within the existing galaxy platform the system provides lab technicians standard and customizable sample information forms barcoded submission forms tracking of input sample quality multiplex capable automatic flow cell design and automatically generated sample sheets to aid physical flow cell preparation in addition the platform provides the researcher with a user_friendly interface to create a request submit accompanying samples upload sample quality measurements and access to the sequencing results as the lims is within the galaxy platform the researcher has access to all galaxy analysis tools and workflows the system reports requests and associated information to a message queuing system such that information can be posted and stored in external systems such as a wiki through an api raw sequencing results can be automatically pre processed and uploaded to the appropriate request folder developed for the illumina_hiseq instrument many features are directly applicable to other instruments availability_and the code and documentation are available at http tron mainz de tron facilities computational medi cine galaxy lims next_generation ngs has enabled researchers to sequence large_numbers of samples for example one flow cell on the illumina_hiseq sequencer can sequence samples using the standard illumina multiplexing indexes or more with alternative barcoding methods challenges for sequencing facilities and small labs include tracking sequencing requests individual samples sample status throughout the sequencing_process and the resultant data including the interpretation of the results public and commercial laboratory information management systems limss exist to track ngs samples gnomex for example is an excellent open_source resource for ngs and microarray lims both gnomex and openbis provide complete solutions for more than ngs_data organization such as imaging microarray and proteomics_data gnomex includes its own data_processing and analysis tools for use within the platform in contrast to these platforms our aim was to build a light_weight yet effective ngs lims within an established data_processing and analysis platform the galaxy platform is a widely used easy to setup platform for the analysis of ngs and genomic_data here we extended galaxys basic sample tracking capability into a user_friendly and flexible lims able to handle multiple samples per request furthermore we enabled more reporting capabilities by extending the existing galaxy notification system to update external systems e g wikis with sequencing request and status information our approach is in part similar to the extension by b chapman http bcbio wordpress com nextgeneration_sequencing information management and analysissystem for galaxy but greatly differs in its implementation for creating requests samples and data_processing
