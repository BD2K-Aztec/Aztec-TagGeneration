gene_expression shortran a pipeline for small rna_seq high_throughput currently generates a wealth of small_rna srna data making data_mining a topical issue processing of these large_data is inherently multidimensional as length abundance sequence_composition and genomic location all hold clues to srna function analysis can be challenging because the formulation and testing of complex hypotheses requires combined use of visualization annotation and abundance profiling to allow flexible generation and querying of these disparate types of information we have developed the shortran pipeline for analysis of plant or animal short_rna sequencing_data it comprises nine modules and produces both graphical and mysql format output availability shortran is freely_available and can be downloaded fromone of the challenges in bioinformatics is to create tools with sufficient flexibility to enable formulation and testing of complex biological_hypotheses while remaining technically simple and user_friendly useful programs for processing small ribonucleic_acid srna_seq data exist such as the uea university of east anglia srna toolkit waprna and dario however during our analysis of large_scale srna_seq datasets two issues hampered our progress when using the existing_tools one was restrictions on data upload sizes and parameter adjustment options for web_based tools and the other was a lack of options for easy integration and combined querying of srna expression and annotation data to help address_these we developed the shortran pipeline for srna_seq analysis it is a command_line python based software_package consisting of nine modules that can be used independently the pipeline output includes graphical summaries text_files that can be easily parsed and automatic construction of a mysql_database which allows simultaneous querying of expression and annotation data its features are compared with those of the existing pipelines in supplementary table s shortran is aimed at a broad group of users with only basic bioinformatics training requiring only little experience with command_line and database environments for successful use we analyzed srna_seq libraries representing the major arabidopsis root cell_types and developmental zones using shortran supplementary in the original study the authors focused on mirnas and briefly mentioned cell_type enrichment of mer srnas here we exploit the ease of combining annotation and profiling information using shortran to describe the features of this class of srnas in detail the total million_reads were processed with and without a variation score cutoff stdev average supplementary there was a large variation in library size with larger libraries showing higher correlation between replicates supplementaryand since the endodermis library was small and showed very poor correlation with all other samples we ignored it in the subsequent analyses application of the variation score cutoff elevated the correlation_coefficients supplementary supplementary but did not affect the sequence_composition of nucleotides supplementary in accordance with the original study mirna prediction by module identified a number of conserved and putative novel mirnas that displayed high variation scores supplementaryand supplementaryq the graphical data summaries produced by module showed that the stele and endodermis libraries were strongly enriched for mers compared with the cortex epidermis and columella samples supplementary figs s and s to determine the precise nature of the enrichment we queried the shortran mysql output database supplementary filtering out mer srnas at least three times enriched in stele and endodermis supplementary table s q both construction and querying of the database were computationally light supplementary all the resulting srnas were assigned to the same genomic clusters by module and module mapped them all to glycine transfer ribonucleic_acids trnas with tcc anticodons supplementary table s and using further queries supplementaryq we found that the gly trna derived srnas fully explained the mer enrichment in the stele and endodermis libraries and we showed that the enrichment was not limited to the most abundant gly ttc associated srna supplementary lines this dominant role of gly trnas in srna generation agrees with previous observations interestingly the remaining mer trna derived srnas were most abundant in columella cells supplementary table s lines this enrichment was caused exclusively by srnas derived from arg cct trnas supplementaryq lines and emphasizing the differential cellular expression and potential biological_significance trna associated srnas
