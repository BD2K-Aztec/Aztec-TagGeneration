sequence_analysis an alignment algorithm for bisulfite_sequencing using the applied_biosystems solid system bisulfite_sequencing allows cytosine_methylation an important epigenetic marker to be detected via nucleotide_substitutions since the applied_biosystems solid system uses a unique di base encoding that increases confidence in the detection of nucleotide_substitutions it is a potentially advantageous platform for this application however the di base encoding also makes reads with many nucleotide_substitutions difficult to align to a reference_sequence with existing_tools preventing the platforms potential utility for bisulfite_sequencing from being realized here we present socs b a reference based un gapped_alignment algorithm for the solid system that is tolerant of both bisulfite induced nucleotide_substitutions and a parametric number of sequencing_errors facilitating bisulfite_sequencing on this platform an implementation of the algorithm has been integrated with the previously_reported socs alignment_tool and was used to align cpg_methylation enriched arabidopsis_thaliana bisulfite sequence_data exhibiting a fold increase in sensitivity compared to existing_methods for aligning solid bisulfite data availability executables source_code and sample data are available at
