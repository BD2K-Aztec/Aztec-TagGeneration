comparing genomes with rearrangements and segmental_duplications motivation large_scale evolutionary_events such as genomic rearrange ments and segmental_duplications form an important part of the evolution of genomes and are widely_studied from both biological and computational perspectives a basic computational_problem is to infer these events in the evolutionary_history for given modern genomes a task for which many algorithms have been proposed under various constraints algorithms that can handle both rearrangements and content modifying events such as duplications and losses remain few and limited in their applicability results we study the comparison of two genomes under a model including general rearrangements through double cut and join and segmental_duplications we formulate the comparison as an optimization_problem and describe an exact algorithm to solve it by using an integer_linear we also devise a sufficient condition and an efficient algorithm to identify optimal substruc tures which can simplify the problem while preserving optimality using the optimal substructures with the integer_linear ilp formulation yields a practical and exact algorithm to solve the problem we then apply our algorithm to assign in paralogs and orthologs a necessary step in handling duplications and compare its performance with that of the state of the art method msoar using both simulations and real_data on simulated_datasets our method outperforms msoar by a significant margin and on five well annotated species msoar achieves high_accuracy yet our method performs slightly better on each of the pairwise_comparisons availability_and in addition to the point_mutations single base_pair insertions_and in the course of evolution genomes also undergo many large_scale events which are usually divided_into two categories rearrangements and content modifying events genome_rearrangements include inversions transpositions circularizations and linearizations all of which act on a single chromosome and translocations chromosomal fusions and fissions which act on two chromosomes rearrangements can shuffle the order and switch the transcriptional orientations of the genes on chromosomes but cannot change the number of gene_copies on the other hand the content modifying events which include segmental_duplications tandem_duplications gene insertions and losses can affect the copy_number of the genes these two types of large_scale events are ubiquitous in the tree of life and have been shown playing a very important role in the variations of the individual traits the molecular_mechanisms behind them although have been widely_studied are still very diversefor a review one basic task of comparative_genomics is to infer the events took_place in the evolutionary_history for the extant_species many combinatorial optimization_problems aiming to compute the most parsimonious number of events between two given genomes i e the edit_distance are formulated and many algorithms heuristics or exact ones are proposed for them when only rearrangement events are considered gave the first polynomial time algorithm to compute the inversion distance which was later improved to linear time proposed a universal operation called double cut andjoin dcj which can unite most of the rearrangement events under the dcj model the edit_distance can also be computed in linear time but in a more simple and elegant way because of its simplicity dcj model has formed the basis for the following algorithmic research on rearrangements all of the above efficient algorithms assume that genomes do not contain duplicated_genes in the presence of duplicated_genes most v c the author published_by
