structural_bioinformatics frag'r'us knowledge based sampling of protein backbone_conformations for de_novo structure based protein design motivation the remodeling of short fragment s of the protein_backbone to accommodate new function s fine_tune binding_specificities or change create novel protein interactions is a common task in structure based computational_design alternative backbone conform ations can be generated de_novo or by redeploying existing fragments extracted from protein_structures i e knowledge based we present fragrus a web_server designed to sample alternative protein backbone_conformations in loop_regions the method relies on a database of super secondary structural_motifs called smotifs thus sampling of conformations reflects structurally feasible fragments compiled from existing protein_structures availability_and fragrus has been implemented as web_application and is available at http www bioinsilico org fragrus structural based computational_design aims to alter and change the properties of proteins by using structural_information these include improving protein_stability change and or optimization of catalytic_activities grafting of novel functionalities or altering the binding to small_molecules nucleic_acids or proteins see reviews and references therein pioneering approaches in the field were focused in single amino_acid changes with null or limited backbone flexibility however the remodeling and redesign of short fragments of the protein_backbone i e de_novo design overcomes the intrinsic limitations of fixed backbone design recent works have shown the potential of de_novo design the remodeling of the protein_backbone usually occurs in the loop_regions given its intrinsic flexibility and variable nature usually remodeling the loop_regions seeks to accommodate specific interactions and restraints e g catalytic_residues or to create new local segments the major_limitation of de_novo approaches is the inherent combinatorial complexity that makes almost impossible the systematic sampling of large_insertions in early works we have described the use of smotifs in loop structure_prediction including protein_kinases functional_annotation and prediction of proteinprotein_interactions furthermore we described that the dramatic_increase of structures in the protein databank has resulted in the saturation of sampling of loop structures even in the case of long loops subsequently confirmed and that the geometry of smotifs is fully sampled here we extend the use of smotifs and we present fragrus a knowledge based_approach designed to sample the conformation of loop_regions between fixed flanking regular secondary_structures the sampling is based in the comparison of the geometry between query and candidate smotifs see server usage in supplementary data is length independent the final loop length is not predetermined and is very fast a search among thousand of potential conformations is done in a matter of seconds candidate smotifs matching the geometrical constraints can then be grafted into the protein_scaffold to be used as starting conformations for different de_novo design manipulations in this article we present a server fragrus designed to sample loop conformations using the geometrical constrains of smotifs fragrus has clear applications in de_novo computational_design by seeding the search of alternative backbone_conformations using geometrically suitable backbone regions extracted from known protein_structures fragrus can be also used in proteinprotein proteinnucleic acids and protein small ligand interface design by generating a set of alternative conformation of interface loops finally fragrus can complement loop structure_prediction and x_ray nmr refinement protocols by generating loop conformations that are length independent
