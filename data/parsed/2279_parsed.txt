identification of cancer fusion drivers using network fusion_centrality gene_fusions are being discovered at an increasing rate using massively_parallel prioritization of cancer fusion drivers for validation cannot be performed using traditional single gene based_methods because fusions involve portions of two partner_genes to address this problem we propose a novel network_analysis method called fusion_centrality that is specifically tailored for prioritizing gene_fusions we first propose a domain based fusion model built on the theory of exon domain shuffling the model leads to a hypothesis that a fusion is more likely to be an oncogenic driver if its partner_genes act like hubs in a network because the fusion mutation can deregulate normal functions of many other genes and their pathways the hypothesis is supported by the observation that for most known cancer fusion_genes at least one of the fusion partners appears to be a hub in a network and even for many fusions both partners appear to be hubs based on this model we construct fusion_centrality a multi gene based network metric and use it to score fusion drivers we show that the fusion_centrality outperforms other single gene based_methods specifically the method successfully predicts most of newly_discovered fusions that had validated onco genic importance to our best knowledge this is the first network based_approach for identifying fusion drivers availability matlab_code implementing the fusion_centrality method is available upon request from the corresponding authors contact a fusion_gene that results from chromosome_rearrangements is a hybrid_gene formed from distinct genes either in the same chromosome or in different chromosomes many recurrent gene_fusions such as bcr_abl in chronic_myelogenous ews fil in ewings sarcoma and tmprss_erg in prostate_cancer play_important in cancer_progression gene_fusions can lead to oncogenesis through one of several alternative_mechanisms i a strong promoter of one gene is fused to and hence controls the open_reading of a second proto_oncogene resulting in the deregulation of its oncogenic_function ii the fused gene_encodes a fusion_protein that leads to new oncogenic_function and iii fusion results in the truncation or loss of function of a tumor_suppressor in addition fused transcripts chimeric rnas generated by trans_splicing or readthrough events and unrelated to chromosomal rearrangement may also lead to similar if not identical biological_consequences for cancer_progression chromosome banding_analysis and fluorescence_in have long been used to detect fusion_genes the advent of massively_parallel greatly accelerated the rate of discovery of novel fusion_genes and chimeric rnas a number of bioinformatics_methods have recently been developed for identifying gene_fusions from sequencing_data however recent_studies indicate that the majority of these fusions are likely to constitute passenger events in cancer_progression up to now only a few identified fusions have been shown to have oncogenic effects in part due to the labor_intensive nature of required validation assays thus a computational_method that allows prioritization of potential fusion drivers would greatly_facilitate the discovery of important fusions one well established approach to discover driver point_mutations is to determine_whether its observed mutation_rate is significantly_higher than the background_mutation however this approach is not suitable for the discovery of fusion drivers that involve two genes besides because fusions are rare background rate for fusion mutation would be hard to be established alternatively network_analysis has been successfully used to identify rare cancer_driver with point_mutations without estimating mutation_rate these network methods estimate the tendency of individual mutated genes to result in oncogenesis in molecular_networks prioritization of fusion_genes raises a new challenge for the existing single genebased approaches because fusions result in hybrid genes formed from portions of two genes only few attempts have so_far been made to study network_properties of fusion_genes one study constructed a fusion network based on to whom correspondence should be addressed all partnerships of known fusion gene_pairs in this analysis nodes were fusion partner_genes and edges represented partnerships between fusion partner_genes the constructed gene_fusion network showed a scale_free topology however this analysis did not address the problem of prioritizing fusion drivers another study developed a computational_method to nominate fusion drivers by assessing the association of their partner_genes with the identified biological_concepts i e gene_sets with specific_biological this method similar to the aforementioned single gene based_approaches only accounted for the impact of a single gene a recent study proposed a multiple gene based_approach to identify groups of proteins that are potential cancer drivers however this approach is not specifically developed for identifying fusion drivers to address the problem we here propose fusion_centrality method for prioritizing fusion drivers in network context we first test whether gene_fusions are associated with exon domain shuffling by enrichment_analysis of protein domain co occurrence and protein domaindomain interactions between protein_domains of known cancer fusion partner_genes we then proposed a domain based fusion model assuming that the potential impact level of a fusion in a network would be associated with all the protein_domains or biological_interactions of its two partner_genes the model leads to the hypothesis that a fusion is more likely to be an oncogenic driver if its corresponding partner_genes are involved in extensive biological_interactions i e hub_genes in a network we then test this hypothesis using a network centrality analysis on known cancer fusion partner_genes and then led to the development of fusion_centrality a multiple gene based network metric to prioritize driver fusion_genes from passengers we evaluated the performance of the fusion_centrality model by a comparison with other single gene based_methods finally we applied the fusion_centrality approach to newly_discovered cancer fusions in this work we have proposed the concept of fusion degree centrality which measures the local impact of a fusion_gene through its direct connections in a network the fusion degree centrality however is somewhat biased toward those genes that were studied more in literature therefore false_negatives could be an issue because some of the genes important for cancer_progression may not be predicted by the method because little is known about their function and there is little connectivity between these genes and others in the network for example some bottleneck hub_genes with only a few direct connections to other nodes but that act as key connectors in the network this problem can be addressed by developing of other kinds of fusion_centrality metrics that are able to measure the global network impact of a fusion such as fusion betweenness_centrality or fusion eigenvector centrality using the same concept we proposed here for example after creating a fused node of two nodes the fusion betweenness_centrality of a potential fusion generated by these two nodes in a network is represented by the betweenness_centrality of the fused node which can be calculated using several existing algorithms however in these algorithms the calculations of the shortest_paths between all pairs of nodes in a network are time consuming and have to occur once for each fused node when applying the algorithms to multiple fusions because a fusion between two nodes in a network may shorten paths between other node pairs therefore faster algorithms are needed to efficiently calculate these fusion_centrality measurements for a large number of fusions detected in next_generation the locations of the fusion or breakpoints and the assessment of the directionality to the gene components allowed us to categorize different types of fusions such as in frame fusions and out of frame fusions although the proposed domain based fusion model was developed based on in frame fusions the proposed fusion_centrality method can also be applied to out of frame fusions because an out of frame fusion mutation can be considered the deletion of its two partner_genes more specifically if the reading_frame is not retained across the fusion junction it will likely lead to the production of a premature stop_codon and degradation of the transcript an out of frame fusion can silence one allele of its two partner_genes and be associated with haploinsufficiency or loss_of therefore the potential impact of an out of frame fusion in a network would also be associated with all biological_interactions of its two partner_genes if the other alleles of the partner_genes are lost as well we also applied the centrality analysis to over cancer chimeric_transcripts and fusion_genes collected in chitars database and conclude the same result as that of using the original fusion gene_pairs set supplementary_material section s besides we also used thirty two highly recurrent chimeric rnas that were detected in human prostate_cancer samples and matched benign prostate tissues to validate the performance of our fusion_centrality approach many of these chimerics rna also appeared in matched benign_tissues owing to a field effect within the histologically normal_epithelium they non parametric kolmogorovsmirnov test was used to determine which chimeric rnas are significantly_enriched in cancer tissues we hypothesized that some of enriched chimeric rnas would be fusion drivers and thus have high fusion_centrality in our prediction indeed we found most of chimeric rnas that are significantly_enriched in human prostate_cancer p tended to have higher fusion_centrality than those insignificantly enriched chimeric rnas these results are detailed in the section s of the supplementary_material finally it is important to note that the fusion_centrality method was constructed based on the available data of biological_networks that are far from complete genes that have not been characterized to date but may be important in cancer_progression will not be identified by our fusion_centrality approach because little of their functions are known this limitation applies to all network based_approaches but our method will be improved overtime as more data are generated and are integrated to construct a more complete gene network in the future nevertheless our results suggest that the method of fusion_centrality is an efficient method for identifying novel fusion drivers in summary all results in this work indicate that the fusion_centrality method is a systematic and effective method for prioritizing fusion drivers from hundreds_or of fusion candidates identified in diverse cancer_types to our best knowledge this is the first network based_approaches to nominate fusion drivers
