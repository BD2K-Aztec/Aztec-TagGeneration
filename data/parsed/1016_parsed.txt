cmsearch simultaneous exploration of protein sequence_space and structure space improves not only protein_homology but also protein_structure motivation protein_homology a fundamental problem in computational_biology is an indispensable step toward predicting protein_structures and understanding protein functions despite the advances in recent decades on sequence_alignment threading and alignment_free protein_homology remains a challenging open_problem recently network methods that try to find transitive paths in the protein_structure space demonstrate the importance of incorporating network information of the structure space yet current methods merge the sequence_space and the structure space into a single space and thus introduce inconsistency in combining different sources of information method we present a novel network based protein_homology method cmsearch based on cross_modal learning instead of exploring a single network built from the mixture of sequence and structure space information cmsearch builds two separate networks to represent the sequence_space and the structure space it then learns sequencestructure correlation by simultaneously taking sequence_information structure information sequence_space information and structure space information into consideration results we tested cmsearch on two challenging tasks protein_homology and protein_structure by querying all pdb proteins our results demonstrate that cmsearch is insensitive to the similarity_metrics used to define the sequence and the structure spaces by using hmmhmm alignment as the sequence similarity_metric cmsearch clearly outperforms state of the art homology detection methods and the casp winning template based protein_structure prediction_methods availability_and our program is freely_available for download from http sfb kaust edu sa pages software aspx contact xin gao kaust edu sa supplementary_information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online protein_homology that aims to identify protein homologs that share a common_ancestry during the course of evolution is one of the fundamental open problems in computational_biology for close homologs sequence similarity_search tends to be sufficient however instead of sharing similar sequences remote_homologs might only share similar tertiary d structures or similar functions this is because protein_structures and functions are more conserved than sequences due to the evolutionary_pressure because of the high_cost and experimental barriers to determine protein_structures and functions biologists frequently stuck in the situation that only the sequence is available for the protein of interest thus computationally detecting remote_homologs from a database of proteins with known sequences and or structures becomes a challenging and essential problem ben generally existing_methods for protein_homology can be divided_into three categories alignment_free alignment_methods and network methods the alignment_free refer to the approaches that represent a protein as a feature_vector and then search for homologs in the protein database by comparing feature_vectors early methods such as conduct direct comparisons of feature_vectors later discriminative methods such aswhich is based_on have been developed to improve the sensitivity however a recent study indicates that the alignment_free are usually faster but less sensitive compared to alignment_methods the alignment_methods refer to the approaches that search the query_protein against proteins in the database through alignments these methods can either rely on sequences only or employ structure features as well where the latter is also called threading the most successful methods that rely on sequences only include the ones that enrich protein_sequence by position_specific pssms hidden_markov hmms or markov_random mrfs for threading methods in addition to the enriched sequence_information the structure featuressuch as secondary_structures solvent_accessibility and residue residue_contacts predicted from the query protein_sequence are compared to the structure features extracted from the d structures in the database neither alignment_free nor alignment_methods exploit the network_topologies of the protein space because they predict homologs in a pairwise_comparison manner i e either one to one or one tofamily this motivates network methods to connect remote_homologs through a transitive path in the continuous protein space early network methods utilize sequence_similarities to construct the protein network but they show minor improvement over the sequence alignment_methods recently ents enrichment of network topological_similarity was proposed which constructs a structure similarity network for proteins in the protein_data pdb and then links the query protein_sequence to the known structures through sequence_similarities although ents has demonstrated its outstanding performance it should be considered as a structure similarity based network method except for the query_protein specifically when building the protein network only structure similarities are used for the proteins in the database and the sequence_similarity is only used to approximate the structure similarity for the query_protein thus ents used sequence and structure similarities in a mixed manner but it is known that there is no standard way to combine different similarity_metrics in a unified fashion as demonstrated later in section this might introduce inconsistency issues in this article we propose a cross_modal method cmsearch for protein_homology as shown in cmsearch employs not only structure similarities but also sequence_similarities it then explores the structure and the sequence spaces networks simultaneously by learning sequencestructure correlations crossmodal links between the structure and the sequence spaces to our knowledge cmsearch is the first method that is able to incorporate sequence_information structure information sequence_space information and structure space information simultaneously specifically as shown in cmsearch has several advantages over existing_methods i instead of exploring a single space built from the mixture of sequence and structure similarities as ents cmsearch builds two separate spaces and explores the two spaces simultaneously ii cmsearch is completely different from threading methods because it uses not only sequence and structure information but also sequence and structure space information iii cmsearch is a generic framework such that any sequence similarity_metric and any structure similarity_metric can be adopted we test the performance of cmsearch on two very challenging tasks protein_homology and protein_structure by querying all proteins in the pdb dataset our results demonstrate that cmsearch is insensitive to the similarity_metric it can significantly improve the homology detection performance to the similar levels no matter which sequence similarity_metric is used to define the sequence_space by using hmmhmm alignment as the sequence similarity_metric cmsearch clearly outperforms stateof the art homology detection methods including hhsearch s ding raptorx and ents when cmsearch is applied to structure_prediction of pdb it outperforms casp winning template based structure_prediction for hundreds of cases it can predict highly accurate_models tm_score above while the existing_methods cannot in this article we proposed a cross_modal search method cmsearch for protein_homology cmsearch is capable of significantly improving the accuracy of state of the art homology detection methods including hmmer hhsearch s ding mrfalign raptorx and ents this demonstrates that combining sequence_space information and structure space information can significantly boost the accuracy of protein_homology and improve the accuracy of template based protein_structure the success of our method is mainly credited to the cross_modal propagation that simultaneously explores the protein sequence_space and the protein_structure space the only cost of applying our method is approximately min of computational time on an average computer furthermore our framework is generic and can be straightforward extended to multiple modals it thus can be a highly_valuable framework for many computational_biology tasks for example we are currently extending our method to predict protein functions by simultaneously incorporating protein sequence_space information structure space information and gene_ontology space information it would also be interesting to investigate the possibility to use the superpositions of the best template model cyan to the native model magenta the best template model is found by hhsearch raptorx ents or cmsearch for query_protein ad odaa eg vcxa or hi q a note that the same template model might be found by different methods and the models are superimposed by tm_align and the superimposed models are visualized by pymol illustration of why cmsearch is able to detect better homologs and rank them at the top for the three cases in each triangle represents a sequence each pentagon represents the corresponding structure each solid line represents a strong link each dashed_line represents a relatively weak link the top three homologs predicted by hhsearch in blue have strong query_sequence links the top three homologs predicted by cmsearch in red have weak query_sequence links but strong links among the sequences and structures of them three and this demonstrates that cmsearch is capable of compensating weak links to true homologs that are consistent i e the true homologs tend to be similar to each other cmsearch exploring protein_sequence and structure space by cross_modal learning i network_topologies in the sequence and the structure spaces to detect the number of homologs or if there exists a homolog in the database or not this information could be useful for protein_structure with multiple_templates
