bionetgen advances in rule_based modeling bionetgen is an open_source software_package for rule_based modeling of complex biochemical_systems version of the software introduces numerous new features for both model specification and simulation here we report on these additions discussing how they facilitate the construction simulation and analysis of larger and more complex models than previously possible availability_and stable bionetgen releases linux mac os x and windows with documentation are available atrule based modeling is an approach for addressing combinatorial complexity in models of biochemical_systems instead of manually enumerating all possible species and reactions that can exist within a system a rule_based model defines only the reactive motifs within macromolecular_complexes and the interactions and modifications that involve those motifs bionetgen is an open_source software_package for constructing and simulating rule_based it has been used to model a variety of biological_processes including cell_signaling gene_regulation and metabolism and references therein see also bionetgen org index php model examples models are written in a human_readable textbased modeling language known as bngl bionetgen language numerous user specified actions can be added to a bngl model file including generating a reaction_network and performing deterministic or stochastic_simulations models can also be exported to different formats such as sbml and matlab language the mathworks inc natick ma furthermore bionetgen interfaces with nfsim a network free simulator that avoids enumeration of species and reactions which may be intractable for large models rulebender is a taken together the bionetgen nfsim rulebender suite of tools provides powerful capabilities for rule_based modeling and simulation until recently however there were several significant shortcomings i bngl models were limited to mass action kinetics ii network based stochastic_simulations were limited to computationally_expensive exact methods iii network free simulations were limited to fewer than a few million particles due to high memory load iv there was no facility for importing models from sbml format each of these shortcomings has been addressed in the recent bionetgen x series of releases as described below additional information can be found in extensive online documentation at http bionetgen org index php documentation see supplementary_information for specific links bionetgen is an active open_source project that highly encourages contributions from interested members of the modeling community contact_information as well as numerous links to online documentation is provided in the supplementary_information ongoing_development efforts include interfacing with spatial simulators free_energy based modeling and improved support for community standards e g sbml multi sed ml recent independent efforts that leverage the bionetgen framework include a standard for annotation of rule_based specified in bngl or kappa another widely used rule_based modeling language and bionetfit a parameter_estimation tool for models simulated using either bionetgen or nfsim
