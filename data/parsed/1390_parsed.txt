dime r package for identifying differential chip_seq based on an ensemble of mixture_models differential identification using mixtures ensemble dime is a package for identification of biologically_significant differential binding_sites between two conditions using chip_seq it considers a collection of finite mixture_models combined with a false_discovery fdr criterion to find statistically_significant regions this leads to a more reliable assessment of differential binding_sites based on a statistical_approach in addition to chip_seq dime is also applicable to data from other high_throughput platforms chip_seq chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip assay followed by sequencing_technology is gaining_popularity as the experiment to analyze genome_wide proteindna_interactions at high_resolution chip_seq experiment produces millions of short_sequences that needs to be aligned to a reference_genome the location where a significant number of short_reads overlapped on the genome sometimes referred to as a peak has been shown to coincide with chromatin_immunoprecipitation enrichment indicating the binding_site of the protein of interest a number of methods have been proposed to identify peaks in chip_seq such as findpeaks macs and cisgenome for more details on these and other existing algorithm including their comparisons see these softwares focus on identifying the peaks in one sample or in comparison with a matching input dna whereas in dime we focus on identifying differential binding_sites of a specific protein under two different biological conditions the input to dime is normalized differences of chip_seq counts as in our recent work specifically in that paper we proposed a method to normalize and classify the enrichment regions that are significantly different between two chip_seq samples since then we have thoroughly compared the fitting of ours with another mixture_model in the literature proposed an ensemble approach to synthesize advantages from different where data is an r list as described above optional input_parameters are available to control the fit and classification process in the example above two convergence criteria can be specified by users gng max iter assigns the maximum number of iterations for fitting gng model default and gng tol default e specifies the l norm of differences in the gng parameter_estimates in the current and previous iterations thus the algorithm will stop whenever eitherpage we have developed an r package dime to model and make inference on chip_seq under two different conditions the algorithm effectively selects the model that provides the best fit to the normalized data which lead to statistical inferences with high_sensitivity dime can be easily combined with other r or bioconductor_packages to perform upstream and downstream_analysis of chip_seq furthermore even though dime isdeveloped to fit and classify chip_seq it is highly applicable to other high_throughput data as well especially given its ensemble nature
