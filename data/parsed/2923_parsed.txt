metatt a web based_metabolomics tool for analyzing time series and two factor datasets time series and multifactor studies have become increasingly common in metabolomic_studies common tasks for analyzing data from these relatively complex experiments include identification of major variations associated with each experimental factor comparison of temporal_profiles across different biological conditions as well as detection and validation of the presence of interactions here we introduce metatt a web_based for time series and two factor metabolomic_data analysis metatt offers a number of complementary approaches including d interactive principal_component two way heatmap visualization two way anova anova simultaneous component analysis and multivariate empirical_bayes time series analysis these procedures are presented through an intuitive web_interface at the end of each session a detailed analysis report is generated to facilitate understanding of the results availability freely_available atmetabolomics involves the study of multiple small_molecule compounds in a biological system biofluids i e urine blood are by far the most commonly used sample type in metabolomic_studies these samples can be collected conveniently and relatively non_invasively and are often used in longitudinal_studies such as monitoring disease_progression tracking nutritional_interventions or observing drug_toxicity biofluids have also been increasingly used in cross_sectional studies for biomarker_discovery one important lesson learned from these studies is that metabolic_profiles of many biofluids are very sensitive to multiple factors such as diet age gender etc therefore one often needs to consider other factors together with the biological condition of interest during data analysis specially_designed statistical_approaches have been developed to deal with the multifactor issues as well as for time series studies such as parallel factor_analysis parafac anova simultaneous component analysis asca multivariate empirical_bayes time series analysis meba and multivariate multiway analysis of multisource data however most of
