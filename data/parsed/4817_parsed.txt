using genomic_annotations increases statistical_power egenes motivation expression_quantitative eqtls are genetic_variants that affect_gene in eqtl studies one important task is to find egenes or genes whose expressions are associated with at least one eqtl the standard statistical_method to determine_whether a gene is an egene requires association testing at all nearby variants and the permutation_test to correct for multiple testing the standard method however does not consider genomic annotation of the variants in practice variants near gene transcription_start tsss or certain histone_modifications are likely to regulate_gene in this article we introduce a novel egene detection method that considers this empirical_evidence and thereby increases the statistical_power results we applied our method to the liver genotype tissue expression gtex data using distance from tsss dnase hypersensitivity sites and six histone_modifications as the genomic_annotations for the variants each of these annotations helped us detected more candidate egenes distance from tss appears to be the most important annotation specifically using this annotation our method discovered more candidate egenes than the standard permutation method many studies over the past_decade examined the contribution of genetic_loci to phenotypic_variation in complex_traits genetic_loci that are associated with gene_expression are called expression_quantitative eqtls one important task in eqtl studies is to find egenes or genes whose expressions are associated with at least one genetic_variant the standard method to determine_whether a gene is an egene requires association testing at all variants near the gene cis variants and the permutation_test to correct for multiple testing the permutation_test is the gold_standard for multiple_testing as it properly accounts for the linkage_disequilibrium ld_structure in the genome however this standard method does not consider which variants are more likely to regulate_gene in order to better detect egenes we can increase the statistical_power of this standard method by using annotation data in practice regulatory variants found near the transcription_start tsss and certain histone_modifications are more likely to be associated with gene_expression van_de additionally recent large_scale genomics studies have annotated regions of the genome that are likely to alter gene_expression in individuals for example almost of the chip based heritability of disease risk for human_diseases examined in the wellcome_trust wtccc can be explained by genome_variation in dnase_i sites these variations are likely to regulate chromatin_accessibility and thus transcription these genomic_annotations for the variants can be used to increase the power to detect egenes although several methods were recently_developed to address challenges in multiple_testing in eqtl studies these methods do not improve statistical_power in comparison to the standard method improved the runtime of the standard permutation_test by replacing the permutation procedure with sampling from the multivariate_normal mvn we applied our method func egene to the gtex dataset the gtex pilot_study collected tissue_samples from more than distinct tissues from post_mortem donors and performed rnaseq to quantify gene_expression in those tissues we used the liver_tissue data that has samples all individuals were genotyped at m snps and imputed with genomes phase i as the reference_panel the number of genes expressed in this tissue is in this article we have introduced a new method func egene that relies on the association study methods in darnell et_al and eskin and uses genomic_annotations of the cis variants to create a non uniform prior that can detect more egenes we applied our method to the liver_tissue dataset from the gtex consortium and the results indicate that distance from tss appears to contain enough information that is needed to find more candidate egenes our method has many layers of procedures which can be timeconsuming to reduce runtime we introduced many ideas we employed lr statistic which is more efficient to obtain than a p value in a multi threshold association study we replaced the timeconsuming permutation_test with the use of mvn sampling to avoid reassessing significance thresholds at each new prior in our gridmvn power at prior ratios b search we developed an approximation_method which uses a subset of the tested genes due to these heuristics we were able to conduct a grid_search using tss dnase and six histone_modifications as functional_classes because our method uses grid_search where the runtime increases exponentially with the number of annotations our current method is not yet applicable for simultaneously handling a large number of annotations one future goal is to develop a better optimization method than a grid_search lastly we address the fact that in the alternative hypothesis the true effects of the variants on the gene_expression are unknown in practice it has been demonstrated in previous_studies that different choices of these effect_sizes do not greatly change the outcome another option is to consider some continuous prior density on these true effects and then integrate over their valid domain this idea is another future_research plan
