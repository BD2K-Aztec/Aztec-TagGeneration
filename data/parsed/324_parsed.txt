an enhanced petri_net model to predict synergistic_effects of pairwise drug_combinations from gene microarray_data motivation prediction of synergistic_effects of drug_combinations has traditionally been relied on phenotypic response data however such methods cannot be used to identify molecular signaling_mechanisms of synergistic drug_combinations in this article we propose an enhanced petri_net epn model to recognize the synergistic_effects of drug_combinations from the molecular response profiles i e drug treated microarray_data methods we addressed the downstream signaling_network of the targets for the two individual_drugs used in the pairwise combinations and applied epn to the identified targeted signaling_network in epn drugs and signaling_molecules are assigned to different types of places while drug_doses and molecular expressions are denoted by color tokens the changes of molecular expressions caused by treatments of drugs are simulated by two actions of epn firing and blasting firing is to transit the drug and molecule tokens from one node or place to another and blasting is to reduce the number of molecule tokens by drug tokens in a molecule node the goal of epn is to mediate the state characterized by control_condition without any treatment to that of treatment and to depict the drug effects on molecules by the drug tokens results we applied epn to our generated pairwise drug_combination microarray_data the synergistic predictions using epn are consistent with those predicted using phenotypic response data the molecules responsible for the synergistic_effects with their associated feedback_loops display the mechanisms of synergism availability the software implemented in python programming_language is available from request a combination of drugs or a drug cocktail is a common therapeutic_strategy used in oncology the strategy reduces drug toxicology caused by high doses of single drugs and generates enhanced effects with lower_doses of combined drugs a combination of two drugs may generate same effect simple additive blunted effect subadditive and exaggerated effect super additive or synergistic drug_combination focuses on the relationship between dosages and effects as well as the methodology distinguishing between additive and non additive combinations methods of analysis for distinguishing between simple additivity and other non additive outcomes include lowe dose additivity bliss independence gaddums non interaction highest single_agent and potentiation among them lowe dose additivity is the most common model used in prediction of drug_combination lowe dose additivity distinguishes additive and non additive drug_combinations by the combination_index where in case of an inhibitory drug x refers to a specific percent inhibition level e g c a r and c b r are the concentration of drugs a and b given in a combination of the two drugs and ic x a and ic x b are the concentration of drugs a and b yielding the same effect level when treated alone as the combination if ci the drug_combination has a subadditive effect and if ci the drug_combination has a synergistic_effect however the existing_methods for prediction of synergistic_effects of drug_combinations restrict to the phenotypic response data and therefore cannot be used to describe the underlying_mechanisms of signal transductions or signaling_pathways the studies on signaling_pathways and related interaction molecules would make it possible to recognize downstream effect of a drug or a drug_combination on the targets exogenous signals are initially imposed on the receptors which then carry the signals to second messengers and eventually the signals are led to transcription related_molecules of dna in the nucleus such as transcription_factors rna_polymerases or histone_modification complexes many drugs target on the upstream of signaling_pathways for example membrane_receptors or second messengers they assert a long_term effect called off target effect on gene_transcription related_molecules through the downstream signals along the pathway since the studies on drug_targets alone are not sufficient to indicate the off target effects we need to develop computational_models in order to simulate the effects of drugs on the signaling_pathways many models have been established for network modeling on biological_systems such as ordinary_differential ode fuzzy_logic system fls and petri_net pn ode is to encode a network as a system of differential_equations which generates a detailed and biochemically realistic representation however the ode model suffers the cost of many free_parameters which must be estimated if the number of the nodes of the network reaches tens or hundreds parameter_estimation would become challenging fls modeling has the same parameter issue comparing with these quantitative_models pn model is a better choice to describe biological_systems qualitatively pn has been recently applied in metabolic genetic and signaling_networks where few accurate kinetic_data are accessible we developed an epn model to predict synergistic_effects of pairwise drug_combinations using drug treated gene_expression microarray_data to test the epn model we generated a gene_expression with combinations of two drugs with different dosage pairs the drug effects on molecules identified by epn model were used to predict the synergistic_effects of the combinations in this article we developed a new model epn to predict the synergistic_effects of pairwise drug_combinations using drug treated gene_expression microarray_data the effects of drugs on molecule expressions and the associated pathways are simulated by the defined tokens and transitions in different colors in the model synergism is predicted using enhanced synergistic molecules recognized by epn the activated drug transitions help to interpret the mechanisms of the synergistic_effects of the combinations the application of epn to the microarray profile for gefitinib and docetaxel not only predicts the synergistic dose pairs but also illustrates the mechanism for the synergistic_effects we identified that gefitinib dominates the synergistic_effects while docetaxel assists gefitinib to achieve that the results are also confirmed by the phenotypic response data as shown in we tested another two dosages and mol for genfitinib and another two dosages and mol for docetaxel in the response data we could see that the proliferation inhibition rates are significantly_decreased along with the increase of dosage of gefitinib and the tendency is however not with docetaxel the molecule krt helps us to make it clear how the two drugs generate the synergistic_effect while the drugs treat the cells separately gefitinib is known to inhibit the ras pathway by its target egfr so that the drug prevents the proliferation of cells on the other hand docetaxel binds to another target tubb instead of bcl which stabilizes microtubules and prevents depolymerization from calcium_ions decreased temperature and dilution preferentially at the plus end of the microtubule for the mechanisms of the synergistic combination of two drugs it remains_unclear our analysis indicates that gefitinib still uses the target egfr and its downstream ras pathway while docetaxel alternatively imposes its effects on the target bcl so that it helps gefitinib generate the synergistic_effects on krt krt is also known as cytokeratin ck or keratin k is a keratin protein that in human is encoded by the krt gene it is overexpressed in the patients of breast_cancer so it has been a prognostic_biomarker for the patients of triple_negative and invasive_breast therefore it is the synergistic molecules such as krt to help gefitinib and docetaxel to generate the synergistic_effects the proposed method of epn is suitable for studying the targettherapy drugs the model works best if the targets with their downstream_signaling are already known otherwise one has to ask for assistance from other types of computational_methods to simulate the downstream signaling_network for the targets for example drugtarget identification or pathway simulation based on bayesian_network boolean_network or other gene interaction_network using the microarray or protein array data from the patients tissues or disease cell_lines
