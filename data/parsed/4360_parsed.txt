genetics_and spectraltdf transition densities of diffusion processes with time varying selection parameters mutation_rates and effective_population motivation in the wrightfisher diffusion the transition density_function describes the time evolution of the population wide frequency of an allele this function has several practical_applications in population_genetics and computing it for biologically_realistic scenarios with selection and demography is an important problem results we develop an efficient method for finding a spectral representation of the transition density_function for a general model where the effective_population selection coefficients and mutation parameters vary over time in a piecewise_constant manner availability_and the method called spectraltdf is available at https source forge net_projects spectraltdf the transition density_function tdf of the wrightfisher diffusion describes the time evolution of the frequency of an allele the tdf is useful for understanding the effects of demography mutation and selection on genetic_variation and it is a key_component of a number of methods for inferring selection coefficients predicting allele fixation times and computing population_genetic statistics such as the site_frequency z ivkovictivkovict al most existing_approaches for computing the tdf assume either restrictive models of dominance or selective neutrality or are computationally slow for selection strengths commonly observed in biological data however song and steinr cken and steinr cken et_al recently_developed a numerically stable and computationally_efficient method for finding a spectral representation of the tdf for a general selection model in the case of constant parameters population_size mutation_rates and selection coefficients despite the utility of this new approach assuming that model_parameters remain constant over time is often too restrictive for biological_applications of selection in which the fitness of a homozygote is twice that of a heterozygote i e additive or genic selection furthermore selection parameters are assumed to remain constant over time and the model does not allow for recurrent mutations here we present the first method for computing the tdf under arbitrary models of dominance and recurrent mutation while allowing selection parameters mutation_rates and effective_population to change over time in a piecewise_constant manner
