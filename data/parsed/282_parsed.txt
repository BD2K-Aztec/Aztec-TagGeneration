analysis of differential splicing suggests different modes of short_term splicing regulation motivation alternative_splicing is an important mechanism in which the regions of pre mrnas are differentially joined in order to form different transcript_isoforms alternative_splicing is involved in the regulation of normal physiological_functions but also linked to the development of diseases such as cancer we analyse differential_expression and splicing using rna_sequencing time series in three different settings overall gene_expression levels absolute transcript_expression and relative transcript_expression results using estrogen_receptor a signaling response as a model system our gaussian_process based test identifies genes with differential splicing and or differentially_expressed transcripts we discover genes with consistent changes in alternative_splicing independent of changes in absolute expression and genes where some transcripts change whereas others stay constant in absolute level the results suggest classes of genes with different modes of alternative_splicing regulation during the experiment availability_and r and matlab codes implementing the method are available at https github com probic diffsplicing an interactive browser for viewing all model fits is available atalternative splicing is an important mechanism for increasing proteome complexity in eukaryotes a great majority of human genes have been found to exhibit alternative_splicing with a growing number of annotated spliceforms changes in splicing are important for cell_differentiation abnormal splicing has been associated with many diseases including cancer as well as neurodegenerative_diseases our ability to study and understand alternative_splicing is limited by the technology to measure it the most widely used method is rna_sequencing rna_seq there are emerging sequencing_techniques that enable sequencing of full_length mrnas but they do not match the sequencing_depth and economy of short_read sequencing_technologies which are needed at least to complement the long_read for more reliable quantification of low_abundance genes and transcripts analysis of short_read rnaseq_data raises a difficult problem to identify and infer the expression levels of transcript_isoforms from reads that are too short to uniquely map to a single isoform several methods have been developed to solve this problem e g whereas others have focused on inference of individual alternative_splicing instead of full transcript quantification a recent evaluation found that especially the transcript assembly problem is currently too difficult to solve reliably from short_read and recommended quantification based on known annotated transcripts even for this problem there is significant variation between alternative_methods our study is motivated by the desire to understand the principles of the regulation of splicing on a large_scale dna rna sequence_motifs and epigenetics are important factors in regulation of splicingin this article we have presented a method for detecting temporal changes in gene_expression and splicing as well as transcript expression_patterns that successfully incorporates uncertainty arising from rna_seq quantification in the analysis we evaluated the performance of our method under different experiment designs in a simulation_study our results again confirm the importance of replication in genomic_analyses in our clean synthetic data adding a second replicate gives a dramatic boost but improvements from having more than two replicates of the entire time course are modest things may of course not be as simple for real_data where a third replicate could at least be very useful for detecting corrupted and otherwise significantly diverging measurements that could otherwise decrease the power we compared approaches based on noise variances inferred only from the data and using posterior variance from bitseq as a lower_bound on the noise for the gp the bitseq variances were found to be very useful in unreplicated case as well as for transcript_level analyses we also experimented with a computational_method for modeling variances to fill in missing replicates with information propagated from a single replicated time point the results indicate that this method can increase the accuracy of the analyses however in the case of transcript relative expression there are still unsolved technical_challenges that may have a role in the performance as the variance of the relative transcript_expression depends on the variances of the overall gene_expression levels and the absolute transcript_expression as well as the covariance between them which we did not take into account here it is not straightforward to model the variance for the relative transcript_expression and it would require more powerful_methods which would be suitable for compositional data application of our method to the analysis of splicing patterns during estrogen receptor_signaling response in a human_breast lead to the discovery of classes of genes with different kinds of splicing and expression changes we found several genes for which the relative_expression of different transcripts remain approximately constant whereas the total gene expression_level changes and for which the relative_expression change apparently independently of the total expression_level consistent with a i h topa and a honkela model of independent regulation of total expression_level and relative splicing levels there appears however to also be a potentially more interesting set of genes where the absolute expression of some transcripts remains_constant whereas the expression_level of others changes these examples suggest a link between regulation of gene_expression and splicing but further research with careful controls is needed to assess how common this phenomenon is the finding nevertheless suggests that alternative_splicing analyses need to combine both absolute and relative transcript_expression analyses
