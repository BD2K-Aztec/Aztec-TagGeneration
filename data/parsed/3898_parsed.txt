rcgh a comprehensive array based genomic profile platform for precision_medicine we present rcgh a comprehensive array_based analysis workflow integrating computational improvements and functionalities specifically_designed for precision_medicine rcgh supports the major microarray_platforms ensures a full trace ability and facilitates profiles interpretation and decision_making through sharable interactive_visualizations availability_and the rcgh r package is available on bioconductor under artistic the acgh viewer is available at https fredcommo shinyapps io acgh viewer and the application implementation is freely_available for installation at https github com fredcommo precision_medicine aims at identifying individual cancer patients molecular alterationssuch as copy_number cnas gene_mutations or fusions and protein expressionsand matching these to targeted_therapies while next_generation is now widely used for identifying mutations array_based acgh is a common platform for detecting cnas the advantages of acgh over nextgeneration_sequencing include lower cost rapid turnaround time and lower computational_overhead in the context of precision_medicine cna analysisalongside somatic_mutation analysisis critical for identifying clinically actionable genomic_aberrations however significant technical_challenges remain in the processing of acgh data addressing these challenges requires new state of the art tools for coordinating analysis and interpreting_results the segmentation step aims at identifying breakpoints in the lrrs continuity each delimiting potentially gained or lost dna_segments the rcgh segmentation relies on the circular_binary cbs implemented in the dnacopy r package although this algorithm is widely used it suffers from several parameters to be specified a priori in particular the sdundo segmentation_method mainly relies on two parameters i a significance_level a for the statistical_test to accept points as breakpoints and ii the allowed difference between two consecutive segment means to keep them distinct expressed in dnacopy as a number of standard_deviations undo sd instead of using arbitrary values rcgh introduces a data_driven parameterization given a fixed a the corresponding optimal undo sd value is estimated from the median absolute deviation a widely used noise estimator supplementary methods this optimization greatly_facilitates the use of this algorithm for routine_practice and standardizes the parameterization through a data_driven rule in precision_medicine the decision_making regarding a therapeutic orientation relies on the actionable genes status defined with respect to gain loss thresholds and alteration lengths defining such thresholds is often arbitrary i there is no consensus on which lrr values_correspond to biologically_relevant cnas ii focal alterations possibly referring to significantly recurrent alterations within a cohort are not clearly defined when transposed to the interpretation of unique profiles rcgh provides an interactive visualization_tool that allows the user to visualize and manipulate genomic_profiles from within a web_interface two primary perspectives are provided visualization of cnas along dna_strands or a gene centric table the latter includes genespecific lrr values and corresponding segment lengths when available on microarrays loss_of expressed as the a b allelic difference is also provided a command window provides control over display parameters including re centering merging short segments and gain or loss thresholds see supplementary methods for a full description finally both the genomic profile and the genes table can be re exported in ready to publish quality and xls format respectively including the changes applied on the profile
