structural_bioinformatics whichcyp prediction of cytochromes p inhibition in this work we present whichcyp a tool for prediction of which cytochromes p isoforms among a c c d and a a given molecule is likely to inhibit the models are built from experimental high_throughput data using support_vector and molecular_signatures availability the whichcyp server is freely_available for use on the web at http drug ku dk whichcyp where the whichcyp java program and source_code is also available for download the cytochromes p cyp is a ubiquitous enzyme_family found throughout the nature these enzymes are involved in the metabolism of a large majority of the drugs in use today modeling of their interactions with druglike compounds have been a hot_topic during the past_decade stretching from quantum_mechanical studies of reaction_mechanisms to data_mining approaches and qsar studies the five most important human_cyp isoforms with regard to drug_metabolism are a c c d and a in a large high_throughput study of inhibition to these isoforms was performed enabling the application of machine_learning to the classification of cyp inhibitors such classification_models are important for the prediction of drugdrug_interactions in this work we present whichcyp a publically available software and web_server for prediction of cyp inhibitors built from these data we investigated signatures with different heights ranging from to and combinations_thereof the most successful combinations were combinations of heights results for which are shown in combinations of signature heights for the ranges and gave_similar but with slightly worse area_under auc values for almost all models supplementary_material the final models give accurate_predictions with auc values ranging from to and even sensitivity_and for all models except the one for d due to the unbalanced dataset these results are improvements compared with earlier_studies in which combined classifiers using fingerprints resulted in auc values of to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com and molecular_descriptors in values of for isoforms a c c d and a respectively other approaches that have been used were discussed in a recent review to investigate if we could determine an applicability domain type measure we studied the relation between the number of signatures for the compounds in the test_sets that did not exist in the training_set and the performance of the models it was found that the number of missing signatures of height three supplementary figs s s could be used as an estimation of the likelihood that the model performs well and that the sensitivity was the first measure to drop among sensitivity specificity and prediction_accuracy
