metamp combining amplicon data from multiple_markers for otu analysis motivation we present a novel method and corresponding application metamp to combine amplicon data from multiple genomic markers into operational_taxonomic otus for microbial_community calibrating the markers using data from known microbial_genomes when amplicons for multiple_markers such as the s rrna gene hypervariable_regions are available metamp improves the accuracy of otu based_methods for characterizing bacterial composition and community_structure metamp works best with at least three markers and is applicable to non bacterial analyses and to non s markers our application and testing have been limited to s analysis of microbial_communities results we clustered standard test sequences derived from the human_microbiome mock community test_sets and compared metamp and other tools with respect to their ability to recover otus for these benchmark bacterial_communities metamp compared favorably to qiime uparse and mothur using amplicons from one two and three markers availability_and metamp is available athigh throughput sequencing_technologies allow researchers to characterize microbial_community and structure without first cultivating the microbes there are two current_techniques for analyzing microbial_communities metagenomic and genomic marker sequencing metagenomic_analysis fragments and sequences all dna in a sample and then optionally assembles and maps genes into annotated genomes one often uses metagenomic_analysis to characterize metabolic potential marker sequencing amplifies and sequences conserved but variable genomic_regions usually hypervariable_regions of the essential s rrna gene one then clusters these sequences known as amplicons into operational_taxonomic otus this approach can handle unknown and highly diverged populations provided that the otus correspond with sufficient accuracy to relevant ecological units metagenomic and amplicon analysis therefore answer different research_questions metamp targets only amplicon analysis most marker based studies use amplicons of just one marker and it is difficult to know which marker to select a priori amplicons from different markers in a given sample or even from a single species can cluster differently giving very different pictures of the underlying microbial_community different markers may also lead to very different phylogenies and taxonomies which can differ substantially from those deduced from known genomes unfortunately current bioinformatics techniques assume a single marker this is true of the best currently available software for amplicon otu analysis such as uparse qiime and mothur we introduce the meta amplicon analysis technique metamp which makes it possible to clusters and analyze amplicons from multiple_markers
