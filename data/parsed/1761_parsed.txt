phylogenetics fast computation of minimum hybridization networks motivation hybridization events in evolution may lead to incongruent gene_trees one approach to determining possible interspecific hybridization events is to compute a hybridization network that attempts to reconcile incongruent gene_trees using a minimum number of hybridization events results we describe how to compute a representative set of minimum hybridization networks for two given bifurcating input trees using a parallel algorithm and provide a user_friendly implementation a simulation_study suggests that our program performs significantly better than existing software on biologically_relevant data finally we demonstrate the application of such methods in the context of the evolution of the aegilops triticum genera availability_and the algorithm is implemented in the program dendroscope which is freely_available from www dendroscope org and runs on all three major operating_systems contact speciation by hybridization is a widespread phenomenon not only in plants but also occurs in some other types of organisms when two individuals from distinct species hybridize and merge their sets of chromosomes the hybrid organism is often sterile and does not produce any progeny differences among homologous_chromosomes prevent correct meiotic pairing and viable gamete production however the eventual doubling of the chromosome_number could restore a correct pairing each chromosome pair with its double and the fertile genotype could give rise to a new allopolyploid species in this case homologous_chromosomes do not mix and the number of the genes is doubled in other words the genes from both parental_species coexist in the polyploid genome and evolve independently in the case that the parental_species are genetically_similar enough the pairing between homologous_chromosomes is not completely_prevented and balanced meiosis could take place in this case the hybrid genotype could produce viable hybrid gametes containing portions of both parental chromosomes and progeny if the progeny remains reproductively isolated from the parental genotypes it could give rise to a new species homoploid hybrid speciation this implies that in a hybrid species different genes may have different evolutionary_histories in which case they will give rise to incongruent gene_trees thus using a single rooted phylogenetic_tree to represent the evolutionary_history of a set of taxa may be inaccurate in the presence of interspecific hybridization a more precise description may be possible using a rooted phylogenetic network in which internal tree nodes nodes of indegree represent putative speciation_events whereas reticulate nodes nodes of indegree represent possible hybridization events suppose we are given a collection of species for which we suspect that hybridization events have played_an in their evolution one way to determine a set of possible hybridization events is to compute a hybridization network for a given set of gene_trees that aims at explaining the incongruences between the different trees using a minimum number of putative hybridization events a hybridization network for a set of trees t is simply a rooted phylogenetic network containing the trees in t in computational terms the problem can be formulated as follows given a set t of two or more rooted phylogenetic_trees determine all hybridization networks for t that are minimum in the sense that they have a minimum reticulate number see below this problem is known to be a computationally hard problem even for the case of determining only one hybridization network for two bifurcating trees on the same set of taxa in this article we present an algorithm that takes as input two bifurcating rooted phylogenetic_trees t and t on the same taxon set x and produces as output a representative set of minimum hybridization networks n on x that contain both trees such a representative set is defined to contain exactly one network derived from each of the possible maximum acyclic agreement forests maaf as defined below the number of reticulation nodes in any such minimum network is called the hybridization number denoted by h t t for t and t our algorithm is based on previous work described in which aims at computing the hybridization number and on the work on the rooted spr distance computation reported in we extend the published approach and provide a parallel implementation to compute a representative set of minimum hybridization networks containing one network perpage
