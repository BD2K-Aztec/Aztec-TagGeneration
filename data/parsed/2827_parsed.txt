mcmc clib an advanced mcmc sampling package for ode_models we present a new c implementation of an advanced markov_chain mcmc method for the sampling of ordinary_differential ode model_parameters the software mcmc clib uses the simplified manifold metropolis adjusted langevin algorithm smmala which is locally adaptive it uses the parameter manifolds geometry the fisher information to make efficient moves this adaptation does not diminish with mc length which is highly advantageous compared with adaptive metropolis techniques when the parameters have large correlations and or posteriors substantially differ from multivariate gaussians the software is standalone not a toolbox though dependencies include the gnu scientific library and sundials libraries for ode integration and sensitivity analysis availability_and the source_code and binary files are freely_available for download at http a kramer github io mcmc clib this also includes example files and data a detailed documentation an example model and user_manual are provided with the software modeling intracellular reaction_networks by ordinary_differential odes has become a standard approach in systems_biology odes provide a quantitative and dynamic description of the underlying biochemical_processes however parameter_estimation for these models is a challenging_task as typically only few data_points are available and the respective optimization_problem is ill posed that is the data do not contain sufficient information to identify parameter_values uniquely in a statistical bayesian_framework this results in high correlations of parameters and or multiple_modes in the posterior_distribution standard sampling algorithms frequently fail when facing those problems the metropolis algorithm in its original_form for example is elegant and easy to implement but uses an isotropic distribution to suggest the next set of parameters and struggles with complicated posteriors in the case of strongly correlated parameters some directions are highly prohibitive because of low likelihoods whereas others are permissive because of low sensitivity of the model output in these directions i e flat likelihoods this results in highly auto correlated samples and extremely slow convergence rates adaptive variants of metropolis that try to amend this problem do exist they use diminishing adaptation that can deal with strong correlations of sampling variables in some cases one such implementation is described in the adaptive metropolis algorithm adapts to the posterior by estimating its covariance from previously sampled points while this can drastically increase sampling efficiency for densities that are similar to gaussians it struggles with more complex cases to date sampling_techniques that put more computational effort into the proposal step are often implemented in high_level programming_languages only and so are not efficient computationally this prompted our efforts to provide a highly_efficient specialized tool that spends most of its running time on the solution of initial value problems we introduce mcmc clib an implementation of smmala simplified manifold metropolis adjusted langevin algorithm a sampling algorithm described in girolami and calderhead that has been shown to outperform simpler sampling algorithms
