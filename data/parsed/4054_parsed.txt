systems_biology robust and accurate data enrichment statistics via distribution function of sum of weights motivation term enrichment_analysis facilitates biological_interpretation by assigning to experimentally computationally obtained data annotation associated with terms from controlled_vocabularies this process usually involves obtaining statistical_significance for each vocabulary term and using the most significant terms to describe a given set of biological_entities often associated with weights many existing enrichment_methods require selections of arbitrary number of the most significant entities and or do not account for weights of entities others either mandate extensive simulations to obtain statistics or assume normal_weight distribution in addition most methods have difficulty assigning correct statistical_significance to terms with few entities results implementing the well known luganannirice formula we have developed a novel approach called saddlesum that is free from all the aforementioned constraints and evaluated it against several existing_methods with entity weights properly taken into account saddlesum is internally_consistent and stable with respect to the choice of number of most significant entities selected making few assumptions on the input_data the proposed method is universal and can thus be applied to areas beyond analysis of microarrays employing asymptotic approximation saddlesum provides a term size dependent score distribution function that gives rise to accurate statistical_significance even for terms with few entities as a consequence saddlesum enables researchers to place confidence in its significance assignments to small terms that are often biologically most specific availability our implementation which uses bonferroni_correction to account for multiple_hypotheses testing is available ata major_challenge of contemporary biology is to ascribe interpretation to high_throughput experimental or computational results to whom correspondence should be addressed where each considered entity gene or protein is assigned a value biological_information is often summarized through controlled_vocabularies such as gene_ontology go where each annotated term includes a list of entities let w denote a collection of values each associated with an entity given w and a controlled_vocabulary enrichment_analysis aims to retrieve the terms that by statistical_inference best describe w that is the terms associated with entities with atypical values many enrichment_analysis tools have been developed primarily to process microarray_data in terms of biological_relevance the performance assessment of those tools is generally difficult it requires a large comprehensive gold_standard vocabulary together with a collection of ws processed from experimental_data and with true false_positive terms corresponding to each w correctly specified this invariably introduces some degree of circularity because the terms often come from curating experimental_results before declaring efficacy in biological information_retrieval that is non trivial to assess an enrichment method should pass at least the statistical accuracy and internal_consistency test in their recent survey list distinct bioinformatic enrichment tools introduced between and most tools share a similar workflow given w obtained by suitably processing experimental_data they sequentially test each vocabulary term for enrichment to obtain its p value the likelihood of a false_positive given the null_hypothesis since many terms are tested a multiple hypothesis correction such as bonferroni or false_discovery fdr is applied to p value of each to obtain the final statistical_significance the results are displayed for the user in a suitable form outlining the significant terms and possibly relations between them note that the latter steps are largely independent from the first to avoid confounding_factors we will focus exclusively on the original enrichment p values based on the statistical methods_employed the existing enrichment tools can generally be divided_into two main classes the singular enrichment_analysis sea class contains numerous tools that form the majority of published ones by ordering values in w these tools require users to select a number of top ranking entities as input and mostly use hypergeometric_distribution or equivalently fishers_exact to obtain the term p values after the selection is made sea treats all entities equally ignoring their value differences the gene_set gsa class was pioneered by the gene_set gsea tool tools from this class use all values entire w toapproximating the distribution of sum of weights by saddlepoint method our saddlesum is able to adapt itself equally well to page
