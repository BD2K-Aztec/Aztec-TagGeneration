systems_biology a novel method for assigning functional linkages to proteins using enhanced phylogenetic_trees motivation functional linkages implicate pairwise relationships between proteins that work together to implement biological tasks during evolution functionally linked proteins are likely to be preserved or eliminated across a range of genomes in a correlated fashion based on this hypothesis phylogenetic profiling based_approaches try to detect pairs of protein_families that show similar evolutionary_patterns traditionally the evolutionary pattern of a protein is encoded by either a binary profile of presence and absence of this protein across species or an occurrence profile that indicates the distribution of copies of this protein across species results in our study we characterize each protein by its enhanced phylogenetic_tree a novel graphical_model of the evolution of a protein_family with explicitly marked by speciation and duplication_events by topological comparison between enhanced phylogenetic_trees we are able to detect the functionally associated protein pairs because the enhanced phylogenetic_trees contain more evolutionary_information of proteins our method shows greater performance and discovers functional linkages among proteins more reliably compared with the conventional approaches contact a great number of cellular_behaviors are mediated by proteins which always carry out their functions by interacting with each other proteins that participate in a common structural complex or pathway or biological_process are defined as functionally linked defining functional linkages of proteins is one of the central goals in proteomics that will decipher the molecular_mechanisms the biological_functions and then help to enhance approaches for drug_discovery the complete sequencing of multiple_genomes from diverse_species provides an excellent opportunity to develop comparative_approaches for functional studies in proteomics biological_interactions and functional linkages of proteins can be inferred via various patterns across many genomes these include the co localization of genes on chromosomes the genetical fusion of two distinct proteins from one organism into a to whom correspondence should be addressed single protein in another organism protein domain_composition and phylogenetic profiles phylogeny based_methods for protein functional relationship prediction are broadly_applicable due to a sufficiently_large number of completely_sequenced these methods are premised on the hypothesis that functionally linked proteins evolve in a correlated fashion and therefore they have homologs in the same set of organisms the original approach uses the simplest form of phylogenetic profile of a protein a binary string in which each bit indicates the presence_or of a protein_family in a different species this basic method often referred to phylogenetic binary profiling subsequently searches for matching pairs of profiles which differ from each other by less than three bits in further steps profiles can be compared by statistical_correlation measures such as cooccurrence probability the pearson_correlation fishers_exact or mutual_information introduced phylogenetic occurrence profiling to detect the functionally_related protein_families in eukaryotic_genomes the phylogenetic occurrence profile of a protein_family is a vector in which each element indicates the number of protein members of this family observed in one organism unlike prokaryotic_genomes where a high proportion of protein_families have about one copy per species eukaryotic_genomes show a large number of multiprotein families having more than one member per species phylogenetic occurrence profiling therefore is able to detect more evolutionary signals that could not be detected by phylogenetic binary profiling however binary and occurrence profiles cannot adequately describe the whole evolutionary_history of proteins many methods characterize proteins by their reconstructed phylogenetic_trees these approaches then compare the phylogenetic_trees by utilizing the parsimony principle maximum_likelihood model a tree kernel model or the correlation between the distances matrices used to build the trees evolutionary_divergence convergence and horizontal_transfer events in multiprotein families are more complex than can be described by conventional phylogenetic profiles in this work we introduce a novel graphical_model of the evolution of proteins which enhances the information content of phylogenetic profiles
