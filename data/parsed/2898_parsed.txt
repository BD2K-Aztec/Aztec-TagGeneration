data_and metacomet a web platform for discovery and visualization of the core microbiome motivation a key_component of the analysis of microbiome datasets is the identification of otus shared between multiple experimental_conditions commonly referred to as the core microbiome results we present a web platform named metacomet that enables the discovery and visualiza tion of the core microbiome and provides a comparison of the relative_abundance and diversity_patterns between subsets of samples within a microbiome dataset metacomet provides an efficient and interactive graphical_interface for analyzing each subset defined by the union or disjunc tion of groups within the venn_diagram and includes a graphical taxonomy summary alpha diversity metrics principal coordinate analysis abundance based heatmaps and a chart indicating the geographic_distribution of each sample availability_and metacomet is a user_friendly and efficient web platform freely_accessible ata common_goal in amplicon based microbiome_analysis is the identification of operational_taxonomic otus that are either shared between or distinct among multiple experimental_conditions treatments environments time points etc the term core microbiome has been used to describe these shared microbes and is typically defined as the set of otus common among the microbial_communities from different but related conditions or habitats commonly occurring components within complex microbial assemblages are of interest for a variety of reasons and may well be critical to the general function of those communities although some web_tools like metarep silvangs and vamps provide analysis and visualization functions for microbiome datasets they provide limited tools for the identification of the core microbiome and these tools focus primarily on the presence_or of otus within the data here we present a web platform named metacomet that enables the easy discovery and visualization of the core microbiome using one of three alternative_methods and the comparison of relative_abundance and diversity_patterns for subsets of the data as defined by the core analysis table and is based on the presence and absence of otus among the different microbiomes being compared supplementary if an otu is observed at a level greater than the user specified absolute or relative_abundance threshold within any of the samples_representing a specific group it is counted as being a member of that group this method is helpful for cases when the minimal membership core is expected to be small or when the presence of a microbe alone may indicate a shift in microbiome function for instance in the detection of microbe mediated disease the composition method places otus within the venn_diagram based on relative_abundance rather than presence absence supplementary in this method each otu is automatically assigned membership to the group for which it has the highest relative_abundance and membership in other groups is assigned if the relative_abundance of that otu is similar as defined by a userspecified threshold this method ensures that every otu will be included in the final analysis and will only appear in a single overlap within the venn_diagram this method of analysis may be helpful when there is a large or complete overlap in otus that are observed across different groups but also substantial differences in the relative_abundance of these otus in the groups being compared that could drive important functional differences the persistence method enables the identification of otus that are consistently detected within a microbiome experiment in this method we consider that the otu should be present within a user specified fraction of the samples within the group in order to be counted as belonging to that group supplementary this method can be useful for tracking otus that are stable across experimental replication or across time in longitudinal_studies after applying the methods described above for core microbiome discovery metacomet generates a new otu table for each overlapping region of the venn_diagram and allows for interactive visual_exploration of these otu tables through commonly used statistical_techniques example analyses that help illustrate the utility of metacomet are available for data from a recent study of the rice microbiome as input the metacomet analysis accepts an otu table in biom the biological observation matrix format both versions or supported containing community abundance data the otu table can be filtered by otu or sample abundance using either an absolute or relative threshold which allows the user the option of removing low_abundance taxa and samples additionally metacomet allows for prefiltering by otu taxonomic terms which enables the user to focus on or exclude otus matching specific key_words in downstream_analysis metacomet also allows users to normalize their data to account for differences in read_depths across their samples or to prefilter their data based on phylogenetic_relatedness to collapse closely_related otus into new lineages metacomet has an efficient and interactive graphical_interface that will generate a venn_diagram viewer supplementary using jvenn for comparing between two to six user_defined groups within their microbiome data in addition metacomet provides functionality for analyzing both the overall dataset as well as each subset defined by the union or disjunction of groups within the venn_diagram this functionality utilizes preexisting tools to create a graphical taxonomy summary supplementary abundance based heatmaps skuta
