a hybrid bayesian_approach for genome_wide on related individuals motivation both single marker and simultaneous analysis face challenges in gwas due to the large number of markers genotyped for a small number of subjects this large p small n problem is particularly challenging when the trait under investigation has low heritability method in this article we propose a two stage approach that is a hybrid method of single and simultaneous analysis designed to improve genomic prediction of complex_traits in the first stage we use a bayesian independent screening method to select the most promising snps in the second stage we rely on a hierarchical_model to analyze the joint impact of the selected markers the model is designed to take into account familial dependence in the different subjects while using local global shrinkage priors on the marker effects results we evaluate the performance in simulation_studies and consider an application to animal breeding data the illustrative data analysis reveals an encouraging result in terms of prediction_performance and computational_cost genome_wide gwas have been widely conducted in humans with the goal of identifying genetic_factors predictive of disease gwas chips collect data on single_nucleotide snps across the genome focusing on common_variants in which the minor_allele is at least the dominant focus in gwas has been on independent screening methods which consider the association between disease and each snp separately while adjusting for false_discoveries this strategy tends to produce a small number of snps having modest effect_sizes failing to explain a substantial_proportion of the known heritability in disease given the size of the multiple testing problems in which the number of snps p is dramatically larger than the number of individuals under study n it is not surprising that independent screening has failed to identify much signal in the data as the identified snps typically explain a small proportion of the variability in the phenotype gwas has been unsuccessful at producing accurate predictive_models in humans see e g diabetes genetics initiative of broad institute of dramatic reduction in cost has driven the increased use of gwas beyond humans to animal breeding studies in animal breeding a major focus is on prediction of genetic merit breeding value when the pedigree structure is taken into account based on predictions early in life animals having a high_probability of developing desired traits will be differentially selected when the focus is on prediction of traits instead of identification of the top individual variants it has been suggested that all markers should be included instead of attempting variable_selection because in gwas the number of snps exceeds the number of samples simultaneous analysis requires using penalized or shrinkage approaches the most popular_approach is the lasso tibshirani which includes an l penalty on the coefficients to induce simultaneous variable_selection and shrinkage however a rich variety of alternative penalties have been proposed selection such methods have computational advantages avoid an intractable search over all possible subsets and better accommodate lots of small but non zero coefficients in bayesian analyses of animal breeding it has been common to rely on mixture priors that include a mass at zero for zero coefficients see e g such priors are tabulated in supplementary appendix a although the aforementioned simultaneous approaches have been applied to p n problems there are some clear limitations in scaling computation to very large p as well as issues in obtaining reliable results when n is too small relative to p in sparse signal_processing problems involving large p small n linear_regression it has been discovered that there is often a phase_transition that depends on the relative values of n and p and the true sparsity level when n is too small so that one is on the wrong side of the phase_transition results are very unreliable such transitions have been characterized only in idealized cases making assumptions on the design matrix that are not appropriate in genomic studies due to strong correlations that arise given the linkage_disequilibrium ld_structure we hope to push back the phase_transition by using a carefully structured bayesian_approach to combat the computational intractability of variable_selection in massive dimensions multistage approaches are recommended see e g for family_based proposed two stage screening based on a bayesian non parametric regression_model here we instead propose a two stage approach for a polygenic mixed model to predict phenotypic_variation in the trait of interest from genomic_information for data collected on genetically_related individuals in the first stage we apply a bayesian independent screening method which takes_into familial dependence while examining snps one at a time this bayesian screening method has better performance than competitors in our experience and is expected to select a superset of the important predictors in the second stage we implement a bayesian_hierarchical to control the level of sparsity and amount of shrinkage relative to the size of signals we use the generalized double pareto gdp prior within a polygenic mixed model extending previous implementations of the gdp to problems in which the samples are related we evaluate the predictive_performance and computational_efficiency of the proposed approach_called two stage gdp by conducting a simulation and real_data analysis in p n problems current variable_selection and mixture priors face problems in scaling to very large p when n in small relative to p these problems_include computational bottlenecks and insufficient flexibility to solve these problems multistage approaches have been proposed but not yet in the case in which the subjects under study are related we address this gap via new two stage bayesian approaches that account for familial dependence the method is a hybrid of single marker and simultaneous analyses in the first stage we select a superset of the most promising snps by evaluating the impact of each snp individually while accounting for related samples in the second stage we simultaneously select and estimate the parameters of the model by placing a gdp prior on the snp coefficients again accounting for relatedness our simulation analyses revealed that two stage gdp improves predictive_performance in comparison to one stage analysis when n is too small relative to p the computational_cost of this proposed approach also makes it feasible for large_scale problems like gwas in the real_data analysis we made a comparison among different prior specifications in the second stage of analysis this comparison represented that two stage gdp performs better than two staget priors and two stage bl we then estimated breeding value for protein yield based on two stage gdp although the prediction_accuracy was sufficient for the small_sample that we had a small proportion of phenotypic_variation is explained by snps in problems that the sample_size is not severely limited splitting the data in two subsets and applying each stage on a subset of data see for e g may better recover this missing_heritability which may also arise from interactions
