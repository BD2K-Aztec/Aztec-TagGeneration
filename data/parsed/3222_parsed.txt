systems_biology netds a cytoscape_plugin to analyze the robustness of dynamics and feedforward feedback_loop structures of biological_networks netds is a novel cytoscape_plugin that conveniently simulates dynamics related to robustness and examines structural_properties with respect to feedforward feedback_loops it can evaluate how robustly a network sustains a stable_state against mutations by employing a boolean_network in addition the plugin can examine all feedforward feedback_loops appearing in a network and determine_whether or not a pair of loops is coupled random networks can also be generated to evaluate whether or not an interesting finding in real biological_networks is significantly random availability netds is freely_available purposes at http netds sourceforge net cytoscape is a free open_source platform that is used to visualize complex_networks many cytoscape plugins have been developed for structural analysis of biological_networks for example mcode binom and nemo were developed to search specific sub structures in a network including active parts or densely_connected regions network motiffinder has also been employed to uncover simple network_motifs such as small_scale feedforward loops the motif search function was further extended in netmatch by enabling a user to query more flexible forms of motifs plugins to analyze the dynamics of a biological_network also exist for example perturbationanalyzer can evaluate the propagation effect of perturbations on interaction networks by computing changes in the equilibrium_state simboolnet can examine the dynamics of a signaling transduction pathway using a boolean_network however there are no plugins that may be used to investigate the relationships between the structural_characteristics of networks and network_dynamics considering that the dynamical_behavior of a biological_network is closely_related to its structural_characteristics there is a pressing need to develop such plugins that can analyze relationships between the structural_characteristics and dynamics of a network to whom correspondence should be addressed in particular recent_studies indicate that the ability of a network to sustain a stable_state against mutations is greatly affected by complex motifs such as feedback_loops fbls and feedforward loops ffls harbored by the network for example robust networks tend to have a larger number of positive fbls and a smaller number of negative fbls the number of fbls involving a node is also positively correlated with the functional_importance of the node and the coherent coupling of fbls is a design principle of a robust cell signaling_network kwon and cho a ffls are needed for robust carbohydrate uptake in escherichia_coli inspired by those studies we have developed a plugin netds to analyze the structural_characteristics of biological_networks with respect to fbls or ffls and to compute dynamics related to robustness a random boolean_network rbn model is employed which has been effectively used for investigating the complex dynamics of biological_networks in fact simboolnet has already been implemented in an rbn model to simulate the dynamics of signaling transduction more specifically simboolnet observes the response of downstream molecules simulated for a user specified stimulus for a signal receptor however it cannot provide any dynamics related to attractors to which a network will converge since it simply provides the time series of changes of node values as such the robustness of the network against perturbations cannot be calculated to overcome_this netds was designed to analyze the converging state of a network and its robustness against perturbations in terms of structural analysis netds can analyze both the fbls ffls that appear in a network and detailed properties such as the sign of an fbl the signs of simple paths comprising an ffl and the coherence of coupled fbls or ffls in addition fbl ffls containing specific nodes cannot be easily checked with existing plugins altogether netds provides a combined analysis of structural_properties with respect to fbl ffls and dynamics related to robustness many recent results have shown that robust behavior against perturbations is closely_related to structural_properties with respect to the fbl ffls in biological_networks in this regard we developed a novel cytoscape_plugin that can compute network robustness against initial_state or update rule perturbations and examine fbl ffls harbored in a network netds is the first cytoscape_plugin to investigate the relationships between dynamic and structural_properties in a network in the future netds will be extended to include a variety of perturbation types and update rules that can be applied to dynamics analysis netds has two control panels one is to examine dynamical_properties finding attractors and calculating robustness and the other is to detect structural_properties with respect to fbl and ffl a relationship between dynamical_properties and structural_properties can be discovered
