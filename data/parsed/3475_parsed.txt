sequence_analysis pclust protein network_visualization highlighting experimental_data one approach to infer functions of new proteins from their homologs utilizes visualization of an all against all pairwise similarity network a apsn that exploits the speed of blast and avoids the complexity of multiple_sequence however identifying functions of the protein clusters in a apsn is never trivial due to a lack of linking characterized proteins to their relevant_information in current software_packages given the database errors introduced by automatic_annotation transfer functional deduction should be made from proteins with experimental_studies i e reference proteins here we present a web_server termed pclust which provides a user_friendly interface to visualize the a apsn placing emphasis on such refer ence proteins and providing access to their full information in source databases e g articles in pubmed the identification of reference proteins and the ease of cross database linkage will facilitate understanding the functions of protein clusters in the network thus promoting interpretation of proteins of interest availability the pclust server is freely_available prodata a common practice to formulate hypotheses for a protein of unknown function includes searching for annotations among homologous_proteins although sequence_similarity does not necessarily correlate with functional_similarity all against all pairwise similarity network a apsn works best to illustrate functional_relationships among large_numbers of proteins and meanwhile avoids computational_complexity and problems of aligning non homologous_sequences software_packages such as clans pythoscape and cytoscape provide powerful repositories to manage the a apsn however they require either programming basics or expertise in program setups to generate the network detailed comparison in the supplementary_material numerous efforts aim to visualize the proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network but these packages build the network by ppi data not by sequence_similarity and assign functions by analysing the network_structure such as dissecting functional_modules given the high misannotation rate in current databases the simple protein descriptions that current packages offer are somewhat suspect which hinders the understanding of the protein clusters thus to avoid working with a network of uncertainty one has to tediously verify the functions of nodes in the network before getting into interesting biology here we developed a web_server named pclust for visualization of the a apsn which emphasizes those reference proteins with experimental_studies pclust works with the seq ref server to identify the reference proteins and highlight them in the network the web_interface bypasses the pain of software installation and the requirement of programming expertise the highlighted reference proteins and easy access to their functional studies simplify the process of relating functions to protein clusters thus facilitating hypothesis driven research of proteins of interest pclust has four modes a user can specify the input as i a single_sequence iv customized network data the input interface is shown in supplementary the flow_chart for each mode is available in supplementarys the four above modes are designed to provide a apsns i for any single_sequence ii with an advanced interface similar to clans iii for previously generated seq ref jobs and iv with a customized input that grants users the flexibility to design an email is required to keep track of the job submission once the network is ready an email containing the result link will be sent to the provided address current e value cutoff e shows the interface for an a apsn as well as an example where the input protein brown node annotated as mandelate racemase gij should be a fuconate dehydratase as previously described another practical case is available in the supplementary_material merely reading the brief protein descriptions within the cluster such as rts beta protein mandelate racemase and enolase superfamily member as in the clans interface results in confusion about the function of the cluster pclust alleviates this confusion by highlighting the reference proteins and referring to their annotation sources linked by our server details available in the supplementary_material for example the cluster circled incontaining the questionable mandelate racemase brown includes two solved crystal_structures of known fuconate dehydratases with provided links to their experimental_data thus with the convenience of locating reference proteins in a apsn and accessing their database links more accurate hypotheses about the function of protein queries can be generated potentiating biological discovery
