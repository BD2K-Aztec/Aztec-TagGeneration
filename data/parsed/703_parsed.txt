bedtools a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic_features motivation testing for correlations between different sets of genomic_features is a fundamental task in genomics research however searching for overlaps between features with existing web based_methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current_sequencing fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner results this article introduces a new software_suite for the comparison manipulation and annotation of genomic_features in browser_extensible bed and general_feature format gff format bedtools also supports the comparison of sequence_alignments in bam format to both bed and gff features the tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large_datasets e g next_generation data with both public and custom genome_annotation tracks bedtools can be combined with one another as well as with standard unix commands thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic_datasets availability_and bedtools was written in c source_code and a comprehensive user_manual are freely_available atdetermining whether distinct sets of genomic_features e g aligned sequence_reads gene_annotations ests genetic_polymorphisms mobile_elements etc overlap or are associated with one another is a fundamental task in genomics research such comparisons serve to characterize experimental_results infer causality or coincidence or lack thereof and assess the biological impact of genomic discoveries genomic_features are commonly represented by the browser_extensible bed or general_feature format gff formats and are typically compared using either the ucsc genome_browsers table browser or using the galaxy interface while these tools offer a convenient and reliable method for such analyses they are not amenable to large and or ad_hoc datasets owing to the inherent need to interact with a remote or local web_site installation moreover complicated to whom correspondence should be addressed analyses often require iterative testing and refinement in this sense faster and more flexible tools allow one to conduct a greater number and more diverse set of experiments this necessity is made more acute by the data volume produced by current dna_sequencing in an effort to address these needs we have developed bedtools a fast and flexible suite of utilities for common operations on genomic_features
