detecting differential_binding of transcription_factors with chip_seq increasing number of chip_seq are investigating transcription_factor binding under multiple experimental_conditions for example various treatment conditions several distinct time points and different treatment dosage levels hence identifying differential binding_sites across multiple conditions is of practical importance in biological and medical_research to this end we have developed a powerful and flexible program called dbchip to detect differentially bound sharp binding_sites across multiple conditions with or without matching control samples by assigning uncertainty measure to the putative differential binding_sites dbchip facilitates downstream_analysis dbchip is implemented in r programming_language and can work with a wide_range of sequencing file_formats chip_seq chromatin_immunoprecipitation is widely used in studying proteindna binding on a genomewide scale after cross_linking immunoprecipitation and shearing millions of sequenced dna_fragments reads are mapped to a reference_genome and sites with over abundant reads are declared as putative_binding we focus on an important class of binding_sites that have similar read profiles throughout the genome specifically the lengths of the binding_sites are similar across the genome and their centers are well defined these binding_sites tend to have read profiles that look like sharp peaks this class includes transcription_factor binding and some histone_modifications measured by chip_seq most of the available chip_seq peak finding programs identify transcription_factor in a single_chip sample with or without a matching control sample for a review see wilbanks and facciotti an increasing number of experiments are investigating differential_binding across two or more experimental_conditions including but not limited to multiple_treatments series of time points and multiple cell to whom correspondence should be addressed lines since transcription_factors regulate_gene differential_binding across multiple experimental_conditions is critical for revealing the function of a transcription_factor at each binding_site thus a program that can detect differential_binding of transcription_factors across multiple conditions is much needed in summary dbchip detects differential_binding in a quantitatively principled way by formally testing hypothesis of non differential_binding at each putative binding_site dbchip assigns uncertainty measure p values to each finding and thus proper error_rate control can be achieved furthermore when there are more than two conditions for comparison k dbchip can be used to detect pairwise_differences after the detection of overall differential_binding moreover dbchip does not rely on a specific sequencing_platform and can accommodate data from illumina solid and other platforms
