spread spatial phylogenetic_reconstruction of evolutionary_dynamics spread is a user_friendly cross_platform application to analyze and visualize bayesian phylogeographic reconstructions incorporating spatialtemporal diffusion the software maps phylogenies annotated with both discrete and continuous spatial_information and can export high_dimensional posterior summaries to keyhole markup_language kml for animation of the spatial diffusion through time in virtual globe software in addition spread implements bayes_factor calculation to evaluate the support for hypotheses of historical diffusion among pairs of discrete locations based on bayesian stochastic_search variable_selection estimates spread takes_advantage of multicore architectures to process large joint posterior distributions of phylogenies and their spatial diffusion and produces visualizations as compelling and interpretable statistical summaries for the different spatial projections the advent of powerful and flexible geographic_information gis has fostered an increasing interest in incorporating geographical_information into molecular phylogenetic_methods spatial phylogenetic projections in a cartographic background play_an in these developments but most applications remain_limited to mapping phylogenetic tip taxa to their geographical coordinates mapping phylogeographic histories of geo referenced taxa requires a robust statistical estimate of the geographic_locations at the ancestral nodes of the tree to obtain such estimates under stochastic_process driven models we recently_proposed a suite of bayesian_inference approaches for the joint reconstruction of evolutionary and geographic history models that accommodate spatial diffusion in discrete and continuous space have been implemented in a flexible bayesian statistical_framework beast http beast bio ed ac uk for hypothesis testingpage spread screenshot of spread this example visualizes the phylogeographic history of rabies among raccoons along the eastern us seaboard under a continuous diffusion model such visualizations allow users to quickly inspect key evolutionary changes in their geographic context further generation of kml output enables interactive_exploration in the time dimension as well in freely_available virtual globe software such as google earth on the right the rate and degree of geographical movement over the complete posterior_distribution of trees to obtain such ranges we slice each rooted tree in the posterior sample at a number of points within a time interval usually defined by the length of a summary mcc tree and impute the unobserved ancestral locations for each branch that intersects those time points to fully accommodate the uncertainty of the original inference the imputation involves building brownian bridges that can take into account branch specific scaling_factors of diffusion_rates under relaxed random_walks for each time point we collect the imputed locations across the posterior_distribution and use bivariate kernel density estimates to plot the highest posterior density contours the kernel_density follows and uses bivariate normal kernels with a diagonal bandwidth with bandwidths based on silvermans rule of thumb plug in value
