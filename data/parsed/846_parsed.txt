genome_analysis cambervis visualization software to support comparative_analysis of multiple bacterial_strains motivation a number of inconsistencies in genome_annotations are documented among bacterial_strains visualization of the differences may help biologists to make correct decisions in spurious cases results we have developed a visualization_tool cambervis to support comparative_analysis of multiple bacterial_strains the software manages simultaneous visualization of multiple bacterial_genomes enabling visual_analysis focused on genome_structure annotations availability the cambervis software is freely_available at the project website http bioputer mimuw edu pl camber input datasets for mycobacterium_tuberculosis and staphylocacus aureus are integrated with the software as examples the large amount of genomic_data that is being generated enables exciting new ways for comparative_analysis of genomes in particular revealing drug resistance_mechanisms in pathogenic_bacteria is currently one of the important_applications of comparative_genomics systematic_comparison of drug_resistant and drug susceptible_strains can bring us new clues on how drug_resistance emerges however since the presence of a single gene or mutation can lead to drug_resistance we may require very precise genome_structure annotations to carry out reasonable drug_resistance studies a recent comparative_study considered three pathogenic_bacteria mycobacterium_tuberculosis staphylocacus aureus and escherichia_coli the results showed many inconsistencies in genome_structure annotations moreover lots of the inconsistencies are not due to real sequence differences but are apparently caused by the use of different gene_annotation methodologies by different laboratories the problem of inconsistencies in genome_annotations of translation_initiation start sites tiss was also reported by another recent study the authors compared gene starts annotations of orthologous gene_families among five bacterial_strains of burkholderia the analysis showed that of the ortholog gene_families have inconsistent gene starts annotations in genbank to whom correspondence should be addressed furthermore inconsistencies for only of all the ortholog gene_families could be explained by sequence divergences therefore manual_curation by biologists is necessary in cases where standard genome_annotation tools produce inconsistencies in order to better support this type of analysis we have implemented cambervisa software that allows for visual comparison of the genome_structure annotations of multiple bacterial_strains
