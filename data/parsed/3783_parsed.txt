genetics_and psiko a fast and versatile_tool to infer population_stratification on various levels in gwas genome_wide are an invaluable tool for identifying genotypic loci linked with agriculturally_important traits or certain diseases the signal on which such studies rely upon can however be obscured by population_stratification making it necessary to account for it in some way population_stratification is dependent on when admixture happened and thus can occur at various levels to aid in its inference at the genome level we recently_introduced psiko and comparison with leading methods indicates that it has attractive properties however until now it could not be used for local_ancestry which is preferable in cases of recent admix ture as the genome level tends to be too coarse to properly account for processes acting on small segments of a genome to also bring the powerful ideas underpinning psiko to bear in such studies we extended it to psiko which we introduce here availability_and source_code binaries and user_manual are freely_available at https www uea ac uk computing psiko a major confounding_factor in genome_wide gwas is population_stratification that is reproductive_isolation of a sampled population a powerful way to account for it is to assume that the genotype of each individual generally called an accession and represented in terms of a single_nucleotide snp sequence in a study is an admixture of genotypes of k generally unknown founder populations this admixture can then be expressed in terms of a datasets principal_components pcs or its population_stratification matrix i e its q matrix which indicates for each accession of a study the proportion of its genotype that came from each of the k founders contrary to leading tools such as eigenstrat which only infers a datasets pcs and structure and its extension to faststructure admixture and snmf which only infer a datasets q matrix psiko is able to infer both furthermore comparison of psiko against competing_methods suggests that while the quality of its q matrices is on par with those generated by them psiko has better scaling properties however until now psiko could not be used for local_ancestry lai which is important for applications ranging from human population studies to identification of disease causative loci furthermore it could only be used on a linux platform and the efficiency of its principle_component pca step was not benchmarked psiko addresses these shortcomings
