a dna shape based regulatory score improves position_weight based recognition of transcription_factor motivation the position_weight pwm is a useful representation of a transcription_factor tfbs sequence pattern because the pwm can be estimated from a small number of representative tfbs sequences however because the pwm probability model assumes independence between individual nucleotide positions the pwms for some tfs poorly discriminate binding_sites from non binding_sites that have similar sequence content since the local three_dimensional dna_structure shape is a determinant of tf binding_specificity and since dna shape has a significant sequence dependence we combined dna shape derived features into a tf generalized regulatory score and tested whether the score could improve pwm based discrimination of tfbs from non binding_sites results we compared a traditional pwm model to a model that combines the pwm with a dna shape feature_based regulatory potential score for accuracy in detecting binding_sites for vertebrate transcription_factors the pwm shape model was more accurate than the pwm only model for of tfs tested with no significant loss of accuracy for the remaining tfs availability_and the shape based model is available as an open_source r package at that is archived on the github software repository at https github com ramseylab regshape binding of a transcription_factor tf to its cognate binding_site in dna is a fundamental_mechanism in gene_regulation computational recognition of tf_binding tfbss within the noncoding genome is both a powerful source of mechanistic_insights from gene_expression data and a central problem in bioinformatics experimentally the binding_sites for a tf can be mapped genome_wide using a chip_seq assay but applying chip_seq for each of the mammalian tfs or starting from rare cell_populations is infeasible due to the need for high_affinity antibodies and or due to the significant amount of chromatin required in comparison in silico tfbs recognition is unmatched in terms of the breadth of potential tf regulators that can be simultaneously considered a cornerstone of computational strategies for tfbs recognition is the encoding of a tfs binding_site sequence pattern learned from representative tfbs sequences in a position_weight pwm uncharacterized noncoding dna_sequence is then scanned to identify high_scoring matches to the pwm which are taken as probable tfbss the pwm is efficient for scanning but as a standalone predictor it has high_false because of the cell_type orcondition dependent local epigenetic state limited representative binding_sites for pwm estimation and the fact that tftfbs affinity can depend on combinations of nucleotides within the site frameworks that are used to integrate such correlates include logistic_regression the support_vector bayesian_networks data fusion linear threshold model hidden_markov and random_forest extensions of pwm based_methods have been proposed that incorporate features that correlate with the probability that a basepair bp position coincides with a regulatory_element such correlates include phylogenetic conservation tfbs co localization nucleosome_positioning histone_acetylation motif conservation and tfbs co localization and chromatin signatures methods that directly incorporate a pwm are valuable because for many tfs a pwm is available but representative binding_site sequences in the genome are not such as for pwms obtained from protein binding arrays or from structural_modeling of the proteindna complex a new potential correlate local dna shape is suggested by the demonstration that tf_binding site_specificity depends on the sequence_dependent three_dimensional shape of dna improvements in monte_carlo modeling and in molecular_dynamics based modeling of dna_structure have enabled the development of dnashape a model that predicts local structural shape_parameters for the dna_double in a standardized reference_frame and coordinate system from sliding pentamer dna subsequences here we report the development of a classifier dna shape classifier for predicting whether a short bp dna_sequence from the noncoding genome is a tfbs for any tf or whether it is a non binding_site sequence this generic classifier is based on a novel proceduredescribed hereinfor extracting sequence lengthindependent features from bp level dna shape_parameters within the binding_site we then combined the dna shape classifier score with the tf specific pwm log likelihood_score into an integrated model for tfbs_prediction importantly beyond the dependence of the pwm on representative binding_site sequences the model does not require any tf specific training or parameter_estimation we compared the accuracy of the pwmshape model versus a pwm only model for discriminating tf specific binding_sites within noncoding promoter model sequences and we found that the shape classifier improved the positive_predictive ppv for tfbs recognition for out of the tfs that we tested for the remaining tfs the ppv of the pwmshape model was not significantly_lower than that of the pwm model for each of the tfs representative binding_site sequences were obtained from databases compiled from high_throughput studies section and partitioned into equal sized training and test_sets from the training_set tfbs sequences a pwm was estimated for each tf section for each l pwm w a score threshold h w was obtained from the distribution of pwm match scores s w s of a training_set of l mer subsequences of noncoding non tfbs tss proximal dna nctdtp section for each sequence s a score f s representing the tf generic dna shape based regulatory score was obtained using a random_forest the classifier was trained on features extracted from local dna shape_parameters corresponding to test case dna_sequences section the pwm shape model was then compared to the pwm only model for tfbs recognition section on both pwmlength sequences experiment and on in silico promoter_sequences into which test_set representative tfbs sequences were overwritten at random locations experiment we report the first implementation of a tf generalized classifier based on local dna shape_parameters that improves pwm based tfbs_prediction for both short_sequences and in silico promoters the proposed approach significantly_improved the ppv for most tfs versus the traditional pwm method this improvement was obtained with a simple shape score based filtering criterion that did not require any training overall filtering on dna shape score decreased type_i by more than it increased type_ii error it seems likely that tfbs recognition_performance could be further improved by varying the voting fraction cutoff or by considering more sophisticated methods of combining features general tfbs recognition_performance by the shape based_classifier will likely be further improved as more tf chip_seq are added to the training_dataset both by providing a more complete set of positive tfbs cases and by further eliminating false_negative cases from the nctdtp sequences used in training the classifier the use of tf agnostic regulatory correlates such as the novel shape score reported here complement approaches that require tf specific training using representative tfbs sequences with the two approaches addressing different problem domainstfbs enrichment screening using the broadest collection of pwms available versus tf specific tfbs recognition using a substantial set of representative training
