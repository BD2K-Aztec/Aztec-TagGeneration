rppanalyzer analysis of reverse_phase data rppanalyzer is a statistical tool developed to read reverse_phase data to perform the basic data analysis and to visualize the resulting biological_information the r package provides different functions to compare protein expression levels of different samples and to normalize the data implemented plotting functions permit a quality_control by monitoring data distribution and signal validity finally the data can be visualized in heatmaps boxplots time course plots and correlation plots rppanalyzer is a flexible tool and tolerates a huge variety of different experimental_designs availability the rppaanalyzer is open_source and freely_available as an r package on the cran platform http cran r project org in systems_biology as well as in biomarker_discovery reversephase protein arrays rppas have emerged as a useful tool for the large_scale analysis of protein expression and protein activation the method follows the basic principle of printing large_numbers of crude protein_extracts in parallel on a solid_phase carrier to form a single array multiple slides are printed in parallel and each sub array is probed with a different monospecific antibody to quantify protein expression or protein activation detectable signals are generated via fluorescence dye precipitation or chemoluminescence different methods for calculating and normalizing sample concentrations are available we implemented this package in the free_and r programming environment for statistical computing regarding the fact that r is a widely_accepted standard platform for statistical and bioinformatics method exchange r development core
