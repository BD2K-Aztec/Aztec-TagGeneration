robust reconstruction of gene_expression from reporter_gene data using linear inversion motivation time series observations from reporter_gene experiments are commonly used for inferring and analyzing dynamical_models of regulatory_networks the robust estimation of promoter_activities and protein concentrations from primary data is a difficult problem due to measurement noise and the indirect relation between the measurements and quantities of biological interest results we propose a general approach based on regularized linear inversion to solve a range of estimation problems in the analysis of reporter_gene data notably the inference of growth_rate promoter_activity and protein concentration_profiles we evaluate the validity of the approach using in silico simulation_studies and observe that the methods are more robust and less biased than indirect approaches usually encountered in the experimental literature based on smoothing and subsequent processing of the primary data we apply the methods to the analysis of fluorescent reporter_gene data acquired in kinetic experiments with escherichia_coli the methods are capable of reliably reconstructing time course profiles of growth_rate promoter_activity and protein concentration from weak and noisy signals at low population volumes moreover they capture critical features of those profiles notably rapid changes in gene_expression during growth transitions availability_and the methods described in this article are made available as a python_package lgpl_license and also accessible through a web_interface for more information see https team inria fr ibis wellinverter over the past_decade a variety of new experimental_technologies have become available for measuring gene_expression over time they provide_valuable for the construction and validation of models of gene_regulatory involving tasks like parameter_estimation hypothesis_testing and model_selection a critical step in the exploitation of the experimental_data is the estimation of biologically_relevant quantities in particular promoter_activities the rate of transcription of a gene as a fraction of the maximum rate mrna concentrations and protein concentrations from the primary data provided by the measurement instruments this requires data analysis procedures that are unbiased and robust to measurement noise fluorescent reporter_genes have become widely used for monitoring gene_expression in bacteria at high_temporal in a nonintrusive way the underlying principle is the fusion of a gene of interest and or the promoter_region driving its expression with a gene_encoding a fluorescent protein a bacterial_strain carrying the resulting reporter_gene on the chromosome or on a plasmid emits a fluorescence_signal proportional to the amount of reporter protein in the cell when reporter strains are grown in a microplate the fluorescence and the absorbance optical_density of the culture can be automatically measured every few minutes in a highly parallelized way the resulting data contain information on population level gene_expression that is highly_valuable for such applications as the inference and analysis of regulatory_networks in bacterial cells the extraction of useful information from reporter_gene data is not easy to achieve though since it is often buried in noise especially at low population_densities moreover the fluorescence and absorbance measurements are only indirectly related to promoter_activities and protein concentrations requiring dynamical_models of the expression of reporter_genes for their interpretation several methods have been proposed to process the fluorescence and absorbance signals and estimate time varying promoter_activities and protein concentrations from the data the methods differ in the scope of the estimation problems considered some being restricted to the inference of promoter_activities and others also considering mrna and protein concentrations in addition the approaches used to estimate these quantities from the primary data are quite different some methods are indirect in the sense that they smoothen the data first and reconstruct the profiles of interest via the measurement model only in a second step this results in a propagation of estimation errors that is difficult to control other methods state a regularized data fitting problem directly in terms of the quantities of interest thus proceeding in a single and better controlled optimization step in this article we propose a general comprehensive approach toward the reconstruction of gene_expression from reporter_gene data and solve the estimation problems it comprises in a mathematically sound and practical manner we formulate the estimation problems in the classical framework of regularized linear inversion which gives access to a range of powerful_tools for robust estimation contrary to the related work of we consider not only the inference of promoter_activities but also of growth_rates and protein concentrations moreover no restrictions are imposed that limit the practical applicability of the approach we propose efficient procedures for the implementation of the methods and show by means of an in silico simulation_study under realistic conditions that they perform better than the indirect approaches usually encountered in the experimental literature the algorithms have been implemented in a python_package and are also accessible through a web_application our linear inversion methods have been tested on fluorescent reporter_gene data acquired in experiments with the model bacterium escherichia_coli these experiments aim at quantifying the dynamics of gene_expression during growth transitions induced by carbon upshift or depletion we show that linear inversion succeeds in robustly reconstructing growth_rate promoter_activity and protein concentration over the entire duration of the experiment in particular in the beginning when the population_density and thus the signalto noise ratio are low moreover we show that our methods reliably capture rapid changes in gene_expression during growth transitions when promoter_activities may change to fold within a dozen of minutes reconstructing these transient gene_expression from the data is highly important for increasing our understanding of the functioning of the underlying regulatory_networks but is difficult to achieve to the best of our knowledge the methods and computer tools presented in this paper provide the most comprehensive solution for analyzing reporter_gene data available to date although the application has focused on fluorescent reporter_gene data the methods are directly applicable to the analysis of luminescent reporter_gene data or other time series gene_expression in addition the gene_expression models underlying the methods are valid not only for bacteria but also for higher organisms the inference of meaningful gene_expression from indirect experimental_data is a key_step in the analysis of dynamical_models in systems_biology as reporter_genes tend to become ubiquitous it is important to develop reliable_methods for the automated robust reconstruction of gene_expression i
