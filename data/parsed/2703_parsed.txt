l graal lagrangian graphlet based network aligner motivation discovering and understanding patterns in networks of proteinprotein_interactions ppis is a central problem in systems_biology alignments between these networks aid functional understanding as they uncover important information such as evolutionary_conserved pathways protein_complexes and functional orthologs a few methods have been proposed for global ppi_network alignments but because of np completeness of underlying sub graph isomorphism problem producing topologically and biologically accurate alignments remains a challenge results we introduce a novel global_network tool lagrangian graphlet based aligner l graal which directly optimizes both the protein and the interaction functional conservations using a novel alignment search heuristic based on integer_programming and lagrangian relaxation we compare l graal with the state of the art network aligners on the largest available ppi_networks from biogrid and observe that l graal uncovers the largest common sub graphs between the networks as measured by edge correctness and symmetric sub structures scores which allow transferring more functional information across networks we assess the biological quality of the protein mappings using the semantic_similarity of their gene_ontology and observe that l graal best uncovers functionally conserved proteins furthermore we introduce for the first time a measure of the semantic_similarity of the mapped interactions and show that l graal also uncovers best functionally conserved interactions in addition we illustrate on the ppi_networks of bakers yeast and human the ability of l graal to predict new ppis finally l graals results are the first to show that topological information is more important than sequence_information for uncovering functionally conserved interactions understanding the patterns in molecular_interactions is of foremost importance in systems_biology as it is instrumental to understanding the functioning of the cell because molecular_interactions are often modeled by networks a large number of studies focused on understanding the topology of these networks in the case of proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks where nodes represent proteins and edges connect proteins that interact comparative_studies based on network alignments were particularly successful given two networks aligning them means finding a node to node mapping also called an alignment between the networks that optimizes two objectives i maximizing the number of mapped proteins nodes that are evolutionarily or functionally_related and ii maximizing the number of common interactions edges between the networks network_alignment uncovers valuable information such as evolutionarily_conserved pathways and protein_complexes or functional orthologs finding these allows transfer of information across species such as performing herpes viral experiments in yeast or fly and then applying the insights toward understanding the mechanisms of human_diseases network_alignment is computationally_intractable due to np completeness of the underlying sub graph isomorphism problem hence several network_alignment heuristics i e approximate aligners have been proposed earlier methods called local network aligners search for small but highly_conserved sub networks called motifs as motifs can be duplicated local network aligners often produce one to many or many to many mappings in which a node from a given network can be mapped to several nodes of the other network although these multiple mappings can indicate gene_duplications they are often biologically implausible hence global network aligners which perform an overall comparison of the input networks and produce one to one mappings between the nodes of the two networks have been introduced several heuristics have been proposed for solving the global_alignment problem the first one is isorank which rephrases aligning networks as an eigenvalue problem mimicking googles pagerank algorithm hopemap iteratively constructs the alignment between two networks by searching for a common maximally connected component path and ga algorithms optimize the same objective_function which balances between mapping similar proteins and increasing the number of mapped interactions the graal family is a set of network aligners which are based on the idea that mapping together nodes that are involved in similar local wiring patterns as measured by the statistics of small induced sub graph called graphlets will result in a large number of shared interactions as newer graal aligners use improved alignment heuristic strategies using c graal or mi_graal is recommended also these two methods allow using additional node scores such as sequence_similarity natalie is a combinatorial_optimization method based on lagrangian relaxation which searches for top scoring network alignments over the biologically_plausible node mappings obtained by sequence_alignment ghost is a spectral approach where nodes are mapped according to the similarity of their spectral signatures netal is a fast greedy heuristic that constructs an alignment by iteratively inserting the node mapping with the highest probability to induce common edges where the probabilities are recomputed at each iteration spinal is a two step approach which first computes coarse_grained node similarity_scores and then based on these scores iteratively grows a seed solution piswap optimizes global alignments using a derivative of the local opt heuristic which is originally used for solving the traveling salesman problem magna uses a genetic_algorithm to maximize the edge conservation between the aligned networks hubalign uses a minimum degree heuristic to align important proteins first and then gradually extends the alignment to the whole networks although all the above methods align networks to derive additional biological_knowledge e g orthology group and functional_annotations dualaligner does the opposite and uses biological_knowledge to produce network alignments the number of known molecular_interactions has increased tremendously during the last decade due to the technological_advances in high_throughput interaction detection techniques such as yeast_two and affinity_purification coupled to mass_spectrometry because of the increasing amount of available interaction data coupled with the computational hardness of the network_alignment producing topologically and biologically accurate alignments is still challenging in this article we introduce a novel global_network tool that we call lagrangian graphlet based aligner l graal unlike previous aligners which either do not take into account the mapped interactions e g the previous graal aligners and isorank or use naive interaction mapping scoring_schemes e g natalie l graal optimizes a novel objective_function that takes_into both sequence_based protein conservation and graphlet based interaction conservation by using a novel alignment search heuristic based on integer_programming and lagrangian relaxation we compare l graal with the state of the art network aligners on the largest available ppi_networks from biogrid and observe that l graal uncovers the largest overlaps between the networks as measured with edge correctness ec and symmetric sub structure scores these largest overlaps are key for transferring annotations between networks using semantic_similarity we observe that l graals protein mappings and interaction mappings are in better agreement with gene_ontology go than any other network aligners by aligning the ppi_networks of bakers yeast and human we additionally show that the results of l graal can be used to predict new ppis finally using our novel semantic_similarity measure of the interaction mappings and the ability of l graal to produce alignments by using both topological and sequence_similarity we observe for the first time that topological_similarity plays a more important role than sequence_similarity in uncovering functionally conserved interactions a result that escaped all previous_approaches
