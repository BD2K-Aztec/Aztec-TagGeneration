systems_biology cytoscape_web an interactive web_based network browser cytoscape_web is a web_based network_visualization toolmodeled after cytoscapewhich is open_source interactive customizable and easily integrated into web_sites multiple file exchange formats can be used to load data into cytoscape_web including graphml xgmml and sif availability_and cytoscape_web is implemented in flex actionscript with a javascript api and is freely_available atincreasing amounts of high_throughput data are being collected stored shared and analyzed on the web highlighting the need for effective web_based data visualization network_visualization components are especially valuable to help researchers interpret their data as part of data analysis tools however current webbased network_visualization components lack many useful features of their desktop counterparts medusa is a java_applet originally used in the string database and by many other web_sites for network_visualization but lacks advanced features such as detailed customization of the network view jsquid expands medusas functionality but does not provide an easy way for the client web_site to change and interact with the network view after it has been rendered touchgraph http www touchgraph com navigator html is another java_applet for network_visualization but provides only one mode of network interaction designed for exploration and is not easily customizable yfiles flex http www yworks com en products yfilesflex about html is a rich internet application with a feature rich user_interface an architecture that balances client server work and supports efficient data communication this commercial software is customizable within the bounds of the code already written but is not open_source cytoscape http www cytoscape org is an_open network_visualization and analysis tool that provides a large array of useful features but is not specifically_designed for use on the web except via java webstart or as a library to generate static network images for web display the field of network_visualization is to whom correspondence should be addressed lacking an interactive easily customizable open_source web_based visualization component cytoscape_web is an interactive web_based network visualization_tool modeled after the popular cytoscape software using basic programming_skills cytoscape_web can be customized and incorporated into any web_site cytoscape_web is not intended as a replacement for the cytoscape desktop_application for example it contains none of the plugin architecture functionality of cytoscape instead it is intended as a low overhead tool to add network_visualization to a web_application
