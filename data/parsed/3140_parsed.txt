structural_bioinformatics multicom a multi level combination approach to protein_structure and its assessments in casp motivation protein_structure is one of the most important problems in structural_bioinformatics here we describe multicom a multi level combination approach to improve the various steps in protein_structure in contrast to those methods which look for the best templates alignments and models our approach tries to combine complementary and alternative templates alignments and models to achieve on average better accuracy results the multi level combination approach was implemented via five automated protein_structure servers and one human predictor which participated in the eighth critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp the multicom servers and human predictor were consistently ranked among the top predictors on the casp benchmark the methods can predict moderate to high_resolution models for most template based targets and low_resolution models for some template free targets the results show that the multi level combination of complementary templates alternative alignments and similar models aided by model_quality can systematically improve both template based and template free protein modeling availability the multicom server is freely_available atknowing protein tertiary_structure is useful for determining protein_protein protein_function and evolution and designing drugs at present x_ray and nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy are the two most commonly used experimental methods_employed to determine protein_structure however both methods are far too expensive_and to be used to process the millions of proteins produced by highthroughput genome_sequencing computer_aided protein_structure in contrast is less expensive much faster and able to generate protein_structures on a large_scale as a result computational protein_structure has received much attention in recent_years particularly from those working in computer science chemistry molecular_biology and molecular physics and their efforts have led to steady progress in the area to whom correspondence should be addressed recently the eighth critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp assessed state of the art protein modeling techniques in two categories template_based tbm and template free modeling fm tbm deals with proteins for which suitable templates can be found it can also be referred to as comparative modeling or fold_recognition depending on the availability of sequentially or structurally_related proteins fm deals with proteins for which no suitable templates can be found this category includes both fragment based modeling and purely ab_initio or de_novo modeling in which predictions are made based solely on chemical and physical_principles tbm typically contains five steps the first step is to identify templates that have a similar structure to the protein to be modeled target once templates have been selected the target protein is then aligned with the templates at this point models can be built from the alignments and the structural_information of each template after model generation the models are evaluated and refined here we present a multi level combination approach to improve protein_structure during all facets of tbm our approach first attempts to combine complementary templates alignments and model generation methods to produce a number of alternative_models it then uses a novel model combination process guided by model quality_evaluation to refine the models five fully_automated servers multicom cluster multicom refine multicomcmfr multicom rank and muprot and one human predictor multicom implemented various forms of this approach and participated in casp the casp results show that the multi level combination approach is effective for the full spectrum of protein modeling including high_accuracy tbm hard tbm and fm
