oqtans the rna_seq workbench in the cloud for complete and reproducible quantitative transcriptome_analysis we present oqtans an open_source workbench for quantitative tran scriptome analysis that is integrated in galaxy its distinguishing_features include customizable computational workflows and a modular pipeline architecture that facilitates comparative_assessment of tool and data_quality oqtans integrates an assortment of machine_learning powered tools into galaxy which show superior or equal performance to state of the art tools implemented tools comprise a complete transcriptome_analysis workflow short_read transcript identification quantification and differential_expression oqtans and galaxy facilitate persistent storage data_exchange and documentation of intermediate results and analysis workflows we illustrate how oqtans aids the interpretation of data from different experiments in easy to understand use cases users can easily create their own workflows and extend oqtans by integrating specific tools oqtans is available as i a cloud machine image with a demo instance at cloud oqtans org ii a public galaxy instance at galaxy cbio mskcc org iii a git repository containing all installed software oqtans org git most of which is also available from iv the galaxy toolshed and v a share string to use along with galaxy cloudman technological advance in large_scale sequencing has revolutionized molecular_biology its application to profiling the transcriptome the total complement of cellular rna called rna_seq provides an unmatched dynamic range for expression quantification and single_base for the discovery of new transcripts however analyzing these complex data to their full potential requires computational frameworks here we present oqtans the online platform for quantitative rna_seq online since its integration into the galaxy framework ensures transparent and reproducible computational_analyses oqtans provides a galaxy interface to many recently_developed rna_seq analysis tools and this way considerably extends the standard repertoire of the galaxy toolbox usegalaxy org to reach non expert users and experienced developers we provide the oqtans tool suite in five incarnations i as a cloud machine image see cloud oqtans org for a demo ii as a public galaxy instance at galaxy cbio mskcc org iii as a git repository oqtans org git most of these tools are moreover available from iv the galaxy toolshed and v a preconfigured share string to launch galaxy cloudman using sharing instance functionality oqtans provides a versatile analysis workbench for rna_seq comprising tools suitable for basic and advanced analysis tasks see supplementaryfor a current list of oqtans tools and supplementaryfor supported file_formats their modular_organization within the galaxy framework allows advanced users to easily customize and extend analysis workflows we showcase oqtans capabilities in use cases for which all data parameters intermediate output and final results are made public on a page in our galaxy cloud instance see oqtans org usecases as a first use case we wanted to identify annotated_genes that were differentially_expressed between male_and drosophila_melanogaster fruit_flies using data from this analysis requires three major_steps read_alignment quantification and enrichment_analysis and b the chosen oqtans tools were combined in a workflow supplementary after starting an oqtans cloud instance in amazon web_service ec machine image ami a c and importing the rna_seq read data from the ncbi short_read archive we aligned these to the reference_genome oqtans currently offers three tools for spliced alignments of short_reads tophat star and palmapper subsequently we determined genes that were differentially_expressed in males_and to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work using deseq which tests read_counts for statistically_significant differences to determine enriched gene_ontology go terms among differentially_expressed we supplied the gene_list to topgo which we integrated into oqtans its graphical output highlights expression differences in genes_annotated with the functions reproduction and sex_determination as is expected for this comparison between male_and fruit_fly transcriptomes see supplementary the whole experiment excluding short_read requires min of compute time duration of the alignment depends on the number and size of compute nodes that can be allocated for this task min in our setup with large memory instances on amazon web_service uniquely within oqtans and through the benefits of the galaxy framework we can directly compare integrated software_tools on the same input_data this is of great value for a researchers who are looking for the most appropriate and accurate algorithm to analyze their newly_generated data for instance for de_novo transcript prediction the accuracy of the alignments is particularly important we demonstrate this in a comparison of the accuracy of introns predicted from spliced alignments against the genome_annotation generated by tophat and palmapper and see supplementary section s for details although alignment_accuracy may have a negligible effect on the detection of differentially_expressed annotated_genes it becomes crucial for de_novo inference of transcripts isoforms owing to the high_resolution provided by rna_seq the discovery of novel transcript_isoforms from these data has been a prime analysis goal in gornitz the authors compared the accuracy of transcript inference by combining different read_alignment programs palmapper tophat with different transcript predictors margin based transcript identification method cufflinks all tools used in this example are integrated into oqtans and can be easily combined in workflows to reproduce this and similar comparisons see section s at supplementary_material for more details a performance comparison of two alignment programs integrated in oqtans evaluated on the data from the use case in terms of intron accuracy see supplementarythe same workflow in the galaxy instance is shown in supplementary
