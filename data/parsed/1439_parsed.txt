diswop a novel measure for cell level protein network_analysis in localized proteomics image data motivation new bioimaging techniques have recently been proposed to visualize the colocation or interaction of several proteins within individual cells displaying the heterogeneity of neighbouring cells within the same tissue_specimen such techniques could hold the key to understanding complex_biological such as the protein interactions involved in cancer however there is a need for new algorith mic approaches that analyze the large_amounts of multi tag bioimage data from cancerous and normal tissue_specimens to begin to infer protein networks and unravel the cellular_heterogeneity at a molecular level results the proposed approach analyzes cell_phenotypes in normal and cancerous colon tissue imaged using the robotically controlled toponome imaging system microscope it involves segmenting the diamidino_phenylindole labelled image into cells and determining the cell_phenotypes according to their proteinprotein dependence profile these were analyzed using two new measures difference in sums of weighted co dependence anti co dependence profiles diswop and diswap for overall co expression and anti co expression respectively these novel quantities were extracted using toponome imaging system image_stacks from either cancerous or normal human colorectal specimens this approach_enables one to easily_identify protein pairs that have significantly_higher lower co expression levels in cancerous tissue_samples when compared with normal_colon tissue availability_and to understand cellular_biology on a systems level relationships between molecular_components must be understood not only at a functional level but also localized in the spatial_domain this is due to the fact that proximity of key_proteins provides an indication of the possible existence of functional protein_complexes as a consequence new bioimaging techniques have been recently_proposed to visualize the colocation or interaction of several proteins in cells in intact tissue_specimen these include matrix_assisted maldi imaging raman microscopy toponome imaging system tis multi spectral_imaging methods and mxif tis is an automated high_throughput technique able to co map up to a different proteins or other tag recognizable biomolecules in the same pixel on a single tissue_section it runs cycles of fluorescence tagging imaging and soft bleaching in situ while colocation does not necessarily imply interaction it has been consistently found that clusters containing particular proteins are found in specific sub cellular_compartments hence allowing such a hypothesis to be generated also co dependence between two proteins is a potential indication for an interaction that is not necessarily direct tis has a sub cellular maximum lateral resolution of nm pixel which allows the determination of sub cellular protein network architectures the combination of proteomic information with spatial sub cellular_level topographical data has been termed toponomics biomarkers used in current_clinical are limited to the simultaneous analysis of only a handful of proteins therefore they fail to assess the true complexity of cancer and the resulting biomarkers have a low prognostic value the capabilities of the tis hold_promise for developing a new generation of multiplex biomarkers which could aid the development of personalized_medicine studying the protein interactions in cancer could uncover previously unknown_mechanisms of tumour_formation and could identify new potential_drug in the form of protein interactions it has been shown that tis imaging can be used in cancer research for protein network mapping however there is a need for new algorithmic approaches that analyze the co expression_patterns the standard way to analyze tis images is to apply a threshold to each image of the stack and thus reduce it to binary values however while this step is straightforward and can be performed objectively by reducing the image to binary a lot of potentially important information is to whom correspondence should be addressed lost recently such non threshold methods have been presented these algorithms cluster molecular co expression_patterns on a pixel level and therefore lose the variation at a cell level this can be crucial when analyzing cancerous samples due to the heterogeneity of cancer_cells furthermore these algorithms are based on the raw expression levels which are intensity_dependent and hence may vary between different stacks a similar approach is used in the web_based hyperbolic image data explorer whide which allows analysis of the space and colocation using a h som clustering although this tool is effective at identifying molecular co expression_patterns the cellular structure is lost and hence the method is unable to analyze the different cell_phenotypes that may be present in the samples more recently focus has shifted towards cell level analysis one approach is to use k median clustering to phenotype segmented cells however the conclusions in this study about pathways in colon_cancer were drawn by only visual_inspection of the phenotypes obtained and without considering any control samples in another study cells were phenotyped after dimensionality_reduction of their raw expression_vector using t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding van_der in this article a new approach is proposed where the protein protein dependence profile ppdp is considered instead of the raw protein expression_profiles there has been evidence in the literature that despite the spherical and the exploratory cell states of rhabdomyosarcoma cells having identical average protein_profiles striking_differences were found between the two states at the sub cellular protein cluster level hence rearrangement rather than up or downregulation of proteins is or can be the key to generating new cell functionalities this shows the importance of co dependence of proteins rather than abundance on its own furthermore we perform the analysis at cell level rather than pixel level allowing for the cells to be phenotyped according to their ppdp this enables us to gain a better understanding of the heterogeneity within the cancer cell_population finally two new measures are proposed to enable us to infer small_scale protein networks these new measures highlight protein pairs that have different interaction in cancer and normal_tissues and hence can be used as biomarkers to distinguish between different types of samples using protein co dependence to our knowledge this is the first study of localized protein networks performed using multilabelling imaging_techniques an overview of the approach is presented in applying it to synthetically generated data gave the expected results giving confidence in the new measures
