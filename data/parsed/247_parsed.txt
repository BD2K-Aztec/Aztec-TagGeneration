data_and a method of finding optimal_weight for compound identification in gas_chromatography motivation the compound identification in gas_chromatography gcms is achieved by matching the experimental mass_spectrum to the mass_spectra in a spectral library it is known that the intensities with higher m z value in the gc_ms mass_spectrum are the most diagnostic therefore to increase the relative significance of peak_intensities of higher m z value the intensities and m z values are usually transformed with a set of weight factors a poor_quality of weight factors can significantly decrease the accuracy of compound identification with the significant_enrichment of the mass_spectral database and the broad application of gcms it is important to re visit the methods of discovering the optimal_weight for high confident compound identification results we developed a novel approach to finding the optimal_weight only through a reference library for high_accuracy compound identification the developed approach first calculates the ratio of skewness to kurtosis of the mass_spectral similarity_scores among spectra compounds in a reference library and then considers a weight factor with the maximum ratio as the optimal weight factor we examined our approach by comparing the accuracy of compound identification using the mass_spectral library maintained by the national_institute of standards and technology the results demonstrate that the optimal_weight for fragment_ion peak_intensity and m z value found by the developed approach outperform the current weight factors for compound identification availability the results and r package are available atgas chromatographymass spectrometry gcms is one of the most widely used analytical_techniques for unraveling a large number of compounds present in either chemical or biological_samples one of the most important analyses of gcms data is compound identification which is currently achieved by matching the experimental mass_spectra to the mass_spectra recorded in a to whom correspondence should be addressed spectrum database the mass_spectrum of an unknown compound is assigned to a database compound based on their mass_spectral similarity_score various spectral similarity_scores have been developed for the spectrum matching based compound identification including composite similarity probabilitybased matching system cosine correlation hertz similarity_index normalized euclidean_distance l norm absolute value distance l norm wavelet and fourier_transforms based composite measure the peak_intensities of fragment_ions with large mass to charge m z values in a gcms mass_spectrum tend to be smaller although they are the most informative ions for compound identification the performance of compound identification can be improved by increasing the relative significance of the large fragment_ions via weighing more on their peak_intensities nearly of improvement in identification_accuracy has been observed if an appropriate set of weight factors is used several studies have been performed to discover the optimal_weight for fragment_ion peak_intensity as well as m z value suggested the squared root of an intensity times its m z value as an optimal scaling of the intensities whilerecommended an intensity to the power of times its m z value cubed in case of the cosine correlation recently reported that optimal weight factor is the squared root of intensity and the square of its m z value even though various methods have been developed to improve mass_spectral similarity_measures for high_accuracy compound identification there has been much less development in finding the optimal_weight to improve the performance of compound identification the main objective of this study is to develop a method to discover the optimal_weight for high_accuracy compound identification in gcms it is noteworthy that the literature reported methods require a training data_set whereas the proposed method can discover optimal_weight based on only a reference library the proposed approach focuses on the statistical characteristics of the distribution of mass_spectral similarity_scores among compounds in a reference library the ratio of skewness to kurtosis is used to search for an optimal weight factor considering the optimal weight factor having the maximum of the average ratios of skewness to kurtosis all the statistical_analysis and simulations were performed using the r statistical_software version r development core team with the national_institute of standards and technology nist mass_spectral library for the ease of description we use the terms spectrum and compound interchangeably throughout this article the weight factors for intensities and m z values are optimized at and respectively the optimal weight factor discovered in this work is different from the literature reported weight factors such as w w and w although these discovered weight factors also were optimized for a mass_spectral library in terms of compound identification_accuracy it suggests that the optimal_weight highly depend on a mass_spectral library all literature reported optimal_weight were found based on supervised_learning in the sense that a training data_set query library is required during the discovery phase the proposed approach can however find optimal_weight only using a reference library without any query library meaning that the proposed algorithm can be considered as unsupervised_learning the accuracy of compound identification using the optimal_weight discovered in this work reaches demonstrating that the newly_discovered weight factors outperform the literature reported weight factors for high_accuracy compound identification
