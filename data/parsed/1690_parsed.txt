exploiting hidden information interleaved in the redundancy of the genetic_code without prior_knowledge motivation dozens of studies in recent_years have demonstrated that codon_usage encodes various aspects related to all stages of gene_expression regulation when relevant high_quality large_scale gene_expression data are available it is possible to statistically infer and model these signals enabling analysing and engineering gene_expression however when these data are not available it is impossible to infer and validate such models results in this current study we suggest chimeraan unsupervised computationally_efficient approach for exploiting hidden high_dimensional information related to the way gene_expression is encoded in the open_reading orf based solely on the genome of the analysed organism one version of the approach named chimera average repetitive substring chimeraars estimates the adaptability of an orf to the intracellular gene_expression machinery of a genome host by computing its tendency to include long substrings that appear in its coding_sequences the second version named chimeramap engineers the codons of a protein such that it will include long substrings of codons that appear in the host coding_sequences improving its adaptation to a new hosts gene_expression machinery we demonstrate the applicability of the new approach for analysing and engineering heterologous genes and for analysing endogenous_genes specifically focusing on escherichia_coli we show that it can exploit information that cannot be detected by conventional approaches e g the caicodon adaptation_index which only consider single codon distributions for example we report correlations of up to for the chimeraars measure with heterologous gene_expression when the cai yielded no correlation availability_and for non commercial purposes the code of the chimera approach can be downloaded fromthe inherent redundancy of the genetic_code where codons encode only amino_acids is a widely_studied phenomenon in recent_years it has been shown that various gene_expression regulatory aspects are interleaved in this redundancy specifically during its lifetime the messenger_rna mrna sequence interacts with various intracellular molecules and complexes such as the spliceosome pre initiation complex and ribosomal_rna composing it trnas micro_rnas mirnas other mrnas proteins including transcription_factors and the mrna sequence itself via its folding the affinity of these interactions is affected by the nucleotide_composition in various parts of the transcript zur and tuller a b and can usually be described by markovian models and or position_specific however there are debates regarding the nature and the efficiency of some of these interactions the studies mentioned earlier support the conjecture that it is possible to accurately_predict gene_expression aspects based solely on the coding_sequence and that by manipulating synonymous aspects of the coding_sequence itself it is possible to affect all gene_expression stages there are three major_drawbacks to the current measures for inferring gene_expression based on the coding_sequence orf first most of the conventional methods for estimating the adaptiveness of a transcript to the gene_expression regulatory machinery are based on the independent distribution of single codons in the coding_sequence i e single codon_usage although there are dozens of measures based on single codon distributions dos these methods often fail to exhibit meaningful relations with the usually heterologous_expression levels of genes it is clear that such indexes cannot fully capture all the gene_expression information_encoded in the orf as some of it is not directly related to codon decoding for example the binding_site of mirnas is around nt information not fully described by the independent distribution of single codons thus a simple approach that can capture various aspects of gene_expression regulation is needed we term this type of statistical_information as high_dimensional information as it is related to substrings of nucleotides longer than codons this type of statistic has the potential to encapsulate all known and unknown intracellular interactions second currently most of the models related to the biophysical nature of the various interactions of macro molecules with the orf are based on the analyses of gene_expression e g mrna_levels protein levels ribosomal densities etc b specifically this information can be used for inferring the parameters of the simulative and or predictive gene_expression models however today there are around genomes of different organisms http www ncbi nlm nih gov genome but large_scale gene_expression information e g protein_abundance pa measurements is available for only a few dozen thus we aim to develop an unsupervised measure that is based solely on the genome of the analysed organism without the necessity of additional gene_expression third there is a growing surge of new studies_reporting novel rules related to the ways various aspects of gene_expression are encoded in the transcript one relatively simple rule suggests that the distribution of codon pairs affects gene_expression and the fitness of organisms and viruses however many of these rules are more complicated and complex b see also supplementary_material thus it is apparent that numerous additional rules are yet to be deciphered moreover many of the established rules are organism specific and or condition tissue_specific and may not hold in different organisms conditions than the ones used for their inference thus we aim at developing a measure that can exploit hidden i e unexplored gene_expression information_encoded in the orf which may be related to yet unknown gene_expression rules in the following sections we describe an approach which encapsulates all the three points mentioned above additionally we devise a novel approach for engineering genes for heterologous gene_expression based on the aforementioned concepts in section and supplementary_material we will describe our new computationally_efficient approach for exploiting hidden highdimensional information interleaved in the redundancy of the genetic_code without prior_knowledge since our approach is based on engineering new genes or analysing genes based on patterns that appear in different endogenous_genes we named it chimera which is a mythological creature composed of three different animals in section we will show that indeed such high_dimensional information appears in the coding_regions of the analysed organisms and that we can at least partially infer it with our approach as a model_organism we analyse escherichia_coli which is the only organism with large_scale measurements of heterologous gene_expression the following analysis further demonstrates the relation described above between the chimeramap algorithm and the chimeraars scores we uniformly selected e coli genes according to their pa levels and created the following variations i performing randomizations of these genes while maintaining the encoded_protein the amino_acid bias and the codon_usage per gene supplementary_material ii we optimized them according to the cai rationale replacing every synonymous codon with its most abundant version which we termed mfsc most frequent synonymous codon a variation representing the encapsulation of single codon distribution iii we engineered them according to the chimeramap the results of this analysis can be seen in where clearly and significantly the chimeramap engineered genes obtain the highest chimeraars scores compared with both the randomized and mfsc versions
