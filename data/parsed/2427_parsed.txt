industrial methodology for process verification in research improver toward systems_biology verification motivation analyses and algorithmic predictions based on high_throughput data are essential for the success of systems_biology in academic and industrial settings organizations such as companies and academic consortia conduct large multi year scientific_studies that entail the collection and analysis of thousands of individual experiments often over many physical sites and with internal and outsourced components to extract maximum value the interested parties need to verify the accuracy and reproducibility of data and methods before the initiation of such large multi year studies however systematic and well established verification procedures do not exist for automated collection and analysis workflows in systems_biology which could lead to inaccurate conclusions results we present here a review of the current state of systems_biology verification and a detailed methodology to address its shortcomings this methodology named industrial methodology for process verification in research or improver consists on evaluating a research program by dividing a workflow into smaller building_blocks that are individually verified the verification of each building_block can be done internally by members of the research program or externally by crowd sourcing to an interested community www sbvimprover com implementation this methodology could become the preferred choice to verify systems_biology research workflows that are becoming increasingly_complex and sophisticated in industrial and academic settings contact gustavo us ibm com
