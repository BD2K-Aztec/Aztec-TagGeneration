systems_biology a temporal switch model for estimating transcriptional_activity in gene_expression motivation the analysis and mechanistic modelling of time_series provided by techniques such as microarrays nanostring reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction and advanced sequencing are invaluable for developing an understanding of the variation in key_biological we address this by proposing the estimation of a flexible dynamic_model which decouples temporal synthesis and degradation of mrna and hence allows for transcriptional_activity to switch between different states results the model is flexible enough to capture a variety of observed transcriptional dynamics including oscillatory behaviour in a way that is compatible with the demands imposed by the quality time resolution and quantity of the data we show that the timing and number of switch events in transcriptional_activity can be estimated alongside individual gene mrna_stability with the help of a bayesian reversible_jump algorithm to demonstrate the methodology we focus on modelling the wild_type behaviour of a selection of circadian genes of the model plant arabidopsis_thaliana the results support the idea that using a mechanistic_model to identify transcriptional switch points is likely to strongly contribute to efforts in elucidating and understanding key_biological such as transcription and degradation one of the archetypal challenges of systems_biology is the task of uncovering the network of interactions between genes and proteins using data such as that coming from high_throughput genome_wide technologies or multi parameter imaging time_series from techniques such as nanostring reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction microarrays or advanced sequencing are particularly valuable for addressing such tasks especially if the system can be perturbed in an informative way such data can also be used to get genome_wide understanding of the variation in key_biological such as transcription and degradation in many cases one is concerned with better understood systems such as the circadian_clock or cell_cycle where relatively sophisticated models exist in these cases it is of interest to uncover both new connections and deeper details of the regulatory_interactions however when studying systems where there is a much lower_density of understanding one is relatively satisfied with gaining information on the likelihood of the existence of a regulatory interaction or the importance of a regulatory_mechanism almost all examples studying the response dynamics when systems are subjected to perturbations such as drug dosing or stress or where the progression of disease is studied fall into this latter category analysis of genome_wide time_series typically involves a number of tasks to parse the time series into groups using various criteria identify differential_expression select smaller sets of genes for comparative_analysis identify molecular_signatures and common regulatory_elements sort the data to identify processes active at certain times and apply network_reconstruction algorithms to identify regulatory_interactions one is therefore interested in computational_approaches to check the similarity or difference in time series expression between genes and conditions many techniques for analysing expression_profiles have been usedfor overviews such as hidden_markov spline functions and clustering unfortunately however it is relatively rare that in terms of specific_molecular there is much common regulation found across the clusters produced by such methods this is perhaps less surprising when one notes that the temporal_profile of gene_expression depends on several processes such as transcription degradation and splicing and that similar profiles can be produced from different combinations of these processes in particular the amount of mrna for a particular gene is the balance between its synthesis and degradation at any point in time it would therefore be helpful if one could identify the effect of these different processes from the data this requires the development of algorithms to provide more mechanistic insight by combining time course expression data with parametric_models of gene_expression and there has been some progress in this direction relatively sophisticated methods often using stochastic_simulation have been developed for extracting parameter_estimates from high_resolution time series data however these approaches are geared towards modelling the intrinsic noise associated with the birth and death to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as processes of molecules in single cells and are less suitable for aggregate mrna data arising from microarray and sequencing_experiments recently a flexible parametric model for the response of gene_expression to environmental_perturbations has been introduced in chechik and koller and can be used in this context applying it to gene_expression time courses in saccharomyces_cerevisiae after diverse environmental_perturbations they show that their model which is based on the product of two sigmoid functions and thus can capture exactly two transitions in the response dynamics constitutes an improvement over other general functional_forms i e polynomials however although the magnitude and the timing of the response arise as meaningful parameters their model is not directly connected to mechanism and is still not general enough to explain a wider_range of possible dynamic_pattern observed in gene_expression including oscillations consequently there is a need not only to decouple transcriptional from degradation_processes but also to model general forms of transcription in a way that is compatible with the demands imposed by the quality time resolution and quantity of the data in particular the ability to handle an arbitrary number of transitions where the transcription_rate is changed and to infer the number and types of these transitions from such data would clearly be an extremely desirable feature in this article we propose an ordinary_differential ode model that addresses these issues and at the same time can be effectively fitted to data with sufficient computational_efficiency to enable one to handle many genes it is based on a simple dynamical_model of mrna_synthesis and degradation where transcriptional_activity can switch between an arbitrary number of states the timing and number of transitions or switches can be estimated efficiently alongside mrna_stability with the help of a reversible_jump rjmcmc estimation algorithm multiple change_point or switching models have previously been applied to biological_systems such as inferring transcription_factor interactions modelling negative_feedback in circadian clocks and reconstructing unobserved gene_expression dynamics however these models have so_far only supported binary expression dynamics which are not general enough to capture expression dynamics with multiple steady_state expression levels the structure of the article is as follows we first introduce the modelling approach and estimation algorithm the performance of the algorithm has been studied extensively for artificial data supplementary section simulation_study to demonstrate the methodology and its potential further uses we focus on modelling the wild_type behaviour of a set of chosen oscillatory expressed genes of the model plant arabidopsis_thaliana the approach allows us to investigate whether genes with similar switch event times also have correlated promoter motifs furthermore we introduce a bayesian hierarchical_approach to pool data from several experiments and present results for estimation of mrna_stability the example datasets consist of time series from three experiments called e e and e of varying timescales and sampling regimes under some mock treatment conditions see supplementary here we focus on a subset of oscillatory genes chosen according to their correlation to a sine function for the expression data from e the set includes a number of core circadian clock_genes such as lhy at g cca at g toc at g a list of the genes can be found in supplementary table s to gain a systematic understanding of how the estimation algorithm performs for time series of varying sampling frequencies and noise levels we generate synthetic datasets for chosen kinetic parameter_values and using data from e to obtain realistic sample_sizes and noise levels the full study benchmarking the performance of the model can be found in supplementary section simulation_study for the synthetic data we are able to obtain accurate estimates for timing and number of switches and degradation_rates under all but the largest noise_level taken as the th_percentile from the e data we observe that the parameter_estimation is invariant of the mode of the switch increase or decrease transcription_rate that multiple switch points must have at least one observation between them to be reasonably estimated and that a higher sampling_frequency is generally more informative for estimation than a larger number of replicate samples to demonstrate further use of this approach we now present case studies referring to the example circadian time series the aim of this article is to present a novel approach for identifying timing of transcriptional_activity from time series mrna_expression data the model introduced here consists of a piecewise_linear simple ode model of mrna dynamics which can be fitted efficiently with a rjmcmc sampler to estimate genespecific parameters i e mrna_stability and number and times of switches in transcriptional_activity estimation and performance of the algorithm is investigated for synthetic data of varying sampling frequencies and noise levels in a simulation_study with the example of time series microarray_data from circadian genes further directions are explored exploiting different aspects of the model output namely using the timing of the switches as a basis for clustering which when combined with promoter motif data seems to identify more significant groups of motifs than simple profile clustering with promoter motif data potentially implying a stronger_correlation with regulatory_mechanisms we also explore the potential for the estimation of mrna degradation_rates usually degradation_rate studies involve treatment with a transcriptional inhibitor such as actinomycin_d or translational inhibitor such as cycloheximide it is not clear whether such inhibition is ever achieved fully and whether such treatments have undesired side_effects on degradation and may therefore impact on estimated rates in unpredictable ways the model introduced in this study has several advantages over a transcription inhibition study the primary advantage is that a specific experiment does not have to be designed and performed often at great cost in time and resources to produce a suitable dataset for degradation estimation effectively allowing recycling of existing datasets further increasing their potential scientific value as only free_running mrna_expression dynamics are required potential side_effects introduced by using a chemical inhibitor can be avoided we demonstrate how to pool data from several experiments in a theoretically rigorous way with a bayesian_hierarchical degradation estimates can easily be obtained for suitably resolved time series and can be compared between different experimental_conditions as the number of large high_resolution gene_expression time series datasets publicly_available is likely to increase with the development of cheaper and faster highthroughput technologies new methods are required to analyse these data the model proposed here is mechanistic yet is flexible and rich enough to capture a wide_range of expression dynamics observed in mrna time series data from steady_state behaviour to oscillatory expression at the same time it is simple enough to be estimated with feasible computational time for thousands of genes using a mechanistic_model to identify transcriptional switch points is likely to strongly contribute to efforts in elucidating and understanding regulatory_interactions within transcriptional_networks
