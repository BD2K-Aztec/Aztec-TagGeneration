wgbssuite simulating whole_genome bisulphite sequencing_data and benchmarking differential dna_methylation analysis tools motivation as the number of studies looking at differences between dna_methylation increases there is a growing demand to develop and benchmark statistical_methods to analyse these data to date no objective approach for the comparison of these methods has been developed and as such it remains difficult to assess which analysis tool is most appropriate for a given experiment as a result there is an unmet need for a dna_methylation data simulator that can accurately reproduce a wide_range of experimental_setups and can be routinely used to compare the performance of different statistical_models results we have developed wgbssuite a flexible stochastic_simulation tool that generates single_base dna_methylation data genome_wide several simulator parameters can be derived directly from real_datasets provided by the user in order to mimic real case_scenarios thus it is possible to choose the most appropriate statistical_analysis tool for a given simulated design to show the usefulness of our simulator we also report a benchmark of commonly used methods for differential_methylation analysis availability_and wgbs code and documentation are available under gnu licence atthe methylation of dna is an important epigenetic modifier that is known to play a role in both development and disease a growing number of studies are using whole_genome bisulphite sequencing wgbs to study the differences in methylation between samples and conditions the number of statistical_methods that have been developed to detect these differences from the data has grown considerably in recent_years however it is difficult to judge the differences between these methods as they are not reliably benchmarked against each other here we present both a novel simulator of wgbs data and a benchmark of existing differential_methylation techniques existing_methods for simulating methylation data have been developed but these lack the complexity of real_data or have been developed with reduced representation bisulphite sequencing in mind by using two dependent hidden_markov hmm wgbssuite assists in the study of dna_methylation by supplying simulated dna_methylation datasets that are highly parameterisable based on real_data provided by the user the software has three sections which first allow a user to analyse their own experimental_data in order to find suitable parameters for the simulator and then produce and save a simulated dataset of any size finally the simulated_datasets can be used to benchmark existing_methods for differential_methylation analysis allowing the user to identify a suitable approach for their dataset we acknowledge that this simulatordoes not deal with sample mixtures an experimental_setup that is common when methylation profiles are generated from complex heterogenous tissues i e where the underlying signal is likely to originate from multiple cell_types future extensions will include a mixture distribution to model the probability of success of the nonhomogenous discrete state hmm emission distribution this will allow the generation of single_base dna_methylation data from complex_heterogeneous tissues experiments such as those that arise from whole blood_samples although this extra level of random variation can be easily included in our code developing a simple estimator procedure for the parameters of the mixture distribution is not straightforward and it will be addressed in a future extension of wgbssuite beyond providing an efficient tool to simulate wgbs datasets our wgbssuite will enable fast and efficient methods benchmarking therefore facilitating the choice of the optimal analysis tool for differential_methylation
