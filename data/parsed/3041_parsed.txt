modeling disease_progression using dynamics of pathway connectivity motivation disease_progression is driven by dynamic changes in both the activity and connectivity of molecular_pathways understanding these dynamic events is critical for disease_prognosis and effective treatment compared with activity dynamics connectiv ity dynamics is poorly explored results we describe the m module algorithm to identify gene_modules with common members but varied connectivity across multiple gene_co aka m modules we introduce a novel metric to capture the connectivity dynamics of an entire m module we find that m modules with dynamic connectivity have distinct topo logical and biochemical_properties compared with static m modules and hub_genes we demonstrate that incorporation of module con nectivity dynamics significantly_improves disease stage prediction we identify different sets of m modules that are important for specific disease stage transitions and offer new insights into the molecular_events underlying disease_progression besides modeling disease_progression the algorithm and metric introduced here are broadly_applicable to modeling dynamics of molecular_pathways availability_and m module is implemented in r the source_code is freely_available atcomplex diseases like cancer involve a continuum of molecular_events that starts with early initiation events through progression and catastrophic end_stage events analyzing and understanding disease stage specific molecular_events are critical for understanding disease_etiology and development of therapeutic_interventions network biology has proven to be a powerful_tool for representing and analyzing complex molecular_networks previously several lines of investigations have leveraged dynamic changes in molecular_networks to predict disease outcomes focusing on hub_genes in human protein interactome several groups have shown that they can be categorized into different types based on topological measures such as degree and modularity it was further demonstrated that such topological_features of hub_genes can be used to improve the prognosis of breast_cancer patients chuang et_al used a different strategy by examining the differentially_expressed subnetworks instead of hub_genes between two cohorts of breast_cancer patients they demonstrated that subnetworks with differential_expression levels are effective markers for breast_cancer besides nodal changes in a molecular_network several studies have shown that gene protein connectivity is also highly_dynamic during disease development and stress_response showed that there is a higher degree of physical connectivity between proteins whose genes are mutated in the same disease_state found a large fraction of cases in which a single gene is linked to multiple disorders via distinct interactions which they call edgetic perturbations discovered widespread changes in genegene_interactions among yeast kinases phosphatases and transcription_factors as the cell responds to dna_damage a common_theme in these pioneering studies is the dichotomization of the disease development either for the onset or the severity of the disease those methods analyze each condition individually to determine which hub_genes subnetworks or edge sets are significantly associated with one of the two conditions instead of collectively modeling and analyzing omics_data from patient samples as a single continuum this inability to account for dependence among pathways at different time points limits our ability to observe changes at a pathway level during disease_progression computational_methods for joint analysis of multiple_networks have been developed before they fall into two categories in terms of their purposes i studying conservation of multiple proteinprotein_interaction across species and ii functional gene interaction modules across multiple_networks of the same species under various conditions neither approach has been applied to study subnetwork dynamics during disease_progression to address this critical gap we have developed a general framework to reveal subnetwork dynamics by joint analysis of multiple gene_co during disease_progression we introduce a novel measure to capture changes in the connectivity of a subnetwork using breast_cancer as an example we demonstrate that adding information about network_connectivity dynamics significantly_improves the classification_accuracy of multiple_stages of the disease to whom correspondence should be addressed the m module algorithm for identifying shared co expression modules across multiple_networks to examine the dynamics of pathway connectivity we developed a novel algorithm m module to identify shared subnetworks present in multiple gene_co here we term these subnetworks m modules they have the same set of member genes but potentially different connectivity among the members using m modules we can quantify the dynamic changes in module connectivity the core m module algorithm consists of three major components seed selection m module search by seed expansion and graph entropy minimization and refinement of m modules m module takes as inputs multiple edge weighted co expression networks and a set of prior probabilities representing the mutation probability of a gene based on experimental_data along with network topological_features the prior probabilities are used to rank and select seeds see supplementary methods we transform the m module search problem into a minimum entropy problem by introducing a graph entropybased objective_function for m modules finding m modules whose entropy values are all minimal is an np_hard we therefore developed a greedy_algorithm for m module search based on seed expansion empirical p values of candidate m modules are determined by using randomized networks the software implementing the algorithm is freely_available on request our current knowledge about the dynamics of gene_networks during disease_progression is rather limited conceptually the a b module connectivity dynamics improves disease stage_classification results are based on independent fold cross_validations a classification_accuracy of breast cancer_stages using different feature_sets including randomly_selected genes rg n features genes differentially_expressed dg n features genes tc modules n features genes sc features genes cc features genes jointclustering jc features genes significant modules sm features genes and weighted modules wsm features genes accuracy is defined as the number of patient samples correctly_classified y axis mean accuracy error bar standard_deviation b receiver_operating for svm classifiers trained with different feature_sets auc values are in parenthesis problem of understanding network_dynamics can be divided_into two subproblems i identifying the subnetworks that exhibit structural changes in response to different growth or developmental_events or different spatial_location and ii quantifying the dynamic changes in the subnetwork structure our framework addresses both subproblems to identify subnetworks that change over multiple conditions many previous_approaches first perform all pairwise network comparisons and then identify a unified subnetwork that partially overlaps with pairwise_comparisons in contrast the jc tc and the m module algorithms analyze_multiple gene_networks simultaneously by doing so the latter approach can reduce noises as well as capture subtle but consistent changes in the subnetworks the three latter methods use different objective_functions to identify shared subnetworks jc uses the modularity measure whereas tc uses frequent dense subgraphs the modularity measure is known to have a resolution limit that prohibits the discovery of small modules on the other hand strictly relying on network density prevents the discovery of subnetworks with sparser and linear topologies such as signaling_pathways m module alleviates both problems by using graph entropy based objective_function in addition m module incorporates both network topological feature and prior_knowledge about the mutational_status of genes for the disease under investigation the second subproblem of network_dynamics is how to quantify structural_dynamics in the subnetwork we introduced a novel measure mcds based on the matrix norm of adjacency matrices that represent subnetworks unlike degree comparison which was commonly used in previous_studies mcds takes_into both the existence and strength of connectivity between genes in a subnetwork we compared both the quality and the classification_accuracy of modules derived using individual networks separately and using m modules we found that m modules have higher sensitivity and comparable specificity based on known pathway annotations more importantly we found that m modulebased features achieve significantly_higher accuracy in predicting cancer_stages supplementary this result emphasizes the importance of joint analysis of multiple gene_networks to more accurately capture the dynamics of gene pathways much of previous_studies on connectivity dynamics have been focused on the dynamics of hub_genes m module enables analysis of entire pathway instead of hub_genes only our result suggests that genes in dynamic modules have unique topological and biochemical_properties that may contribute to their function in cancer_progression in particular we found that genes_encoding signaling domains are enriched in dynamic modules but not static modules this finding is consistent with previous results that signaling domains are more frequently associated with oncogenesis and play_critical rewiring signaling_networks and driving phenotypic alteration as disease_progression or during cellular stress_responses we see ample opportunities to improve on the basic concept of m module in future work first although this study uses breast_cancer as a proof_of the m module framework isbroadly applicable to any cohort of patients for which diseasestagespecific transcriptome_data are available second integrating_multiple types of molecular analytes beyond gene_expression and somatic_mutation e g epigenome mirna cnvs might further expand our ability to identify dynamic molecular_events that are associated with disease_progression finally comparing and contrasting dynamic events_involving different molecular types may yield new mechanistic_insights into their interactions in the context of disease_progression
