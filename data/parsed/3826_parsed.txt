qualimap advanced multi sample quality_control for high_throughput detection of random errors and systematic_biases is a crucial step of a robust pipeline for processing high_throughput hts_data bioinformatics software_tools capable of performing this task are available either for general analysis of hts_data or targeted to a specific sequencing_technology however most of the existing qc instruments only allow processing of one sample at a time results qualimap represents a next step in the qc analysis of hts_data along with comprehensive single sample analysis of alignment data it includes new modes that allow simultaneous processing and comparison of multiple samples as with the first version the new features are available via both graphical and command_line additionally it includes a large number of improvements proposed by the user community availability_and the implementation of the software along with documentation is freely_available athigh throughput sequencing hts is a powerful discovery method applied in genomics transcriptomics and other omics disciplines projects such as encode or blueprint generated terabytes of sequencing_data providing new insights into the molecular_mechanisms of the cell the sequencing_technology itself has been improving continuously allowing longer_reads and deeper coverage at lower cost however despite these advantages hts is prone to random errors and systematic_biases including polymerase_chain problems gc_content shift and read contamination to generate reliable conclusions from hts_data these biases have to be detected and addressed accordingly in this regard several bioinformatics_tools have been developed to perform quality_control qc of the hts_data by analyzing raw_reads and their derivatives in the form of sequencing alignments and other quantitative data in the context of large sequencing_projects it is also crucial to have a global overview of all samples in the experiment multisample analysis results comparison enables examination of data clustering and detection of possible outliers there are special toolkits such as statsdb that allow creating detailed multi sample analysis workflows however they require accurate construction of custom pipelines several existing ngs qc software_tools including rna_seq qc and rseqc have only a few options for working with multiple samples this is a major_limitation since sequencing_experiments are often conducted using biological_replicates and can include multiple conditions here we present the second version of qualimap a toolkit for qc of hts alignment data in qualimap we provide new analysis capabilities that allow multi sample comparison of sequencing_datasets additionally we have added a novel mode for discovery of biases and problems specific to rna_seq technology redesigned the read_counts qc mode and implemented numerous improvements
