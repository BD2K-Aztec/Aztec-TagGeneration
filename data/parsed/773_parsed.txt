gene_expression bioplat a software for human cancer biomarker_discovery development of effective tools such as oligo microarrays and next_generation methods for monitoring gene_expression on a large_scale has resulted in the discovery of gene_signatures with prognostic predictive value in various malignant neoplastic_diseases however with the exponential_growth of gene_expression databases biologists are faced with the challenge of extracting useful information from these repositories here we present a software_package bioplat biomarkers platform which allows biologists to identify novel prognostic and predictive cancer biomarkers based on the data_mining of gene_expression and gene_expression databases bioplat has been designed as an easy to use and flexible desktop software application which provides a set of analytical_tools related to data_extraction preprocessing filtering gene_expression calculation in silico validation feature_selection and annotation that leverage the integration and reuse of gene_expression in the context of follow_up data human cancer transcriptomes have been extensively profiled over the past_decade allowing the identification of different cancer molecular_subtypes and the development of prognostic and predictive gene_expression gene_expression have been curated from the literature and collected into publicly_available databases such as msigdb and genesigdb with gene_signatures related to human_diseases on the other hand databases such as geo gene_expression and ae arrayexpress are the primary repositories for the raw_data from functional_genomic a central_focus on translational cancer research is that patient diagnosis and prognosis can be improved by stratification of patients based on functional_genomics data beside relevant follow_up data therefore we developed bioplat biomarkers platform a user_friendly bioinformatics resource which provides a set of analytical_tools for the in silico identification of novel prognostic and predictive cancer biomarkers it encompasses all the stages of data_mining and analysis of the vast number of gene_expression and profiling data including data_extraction preprocessing filtering in silico validation and feature_selection currently there exists a myriad of applications and software focused on the integration and analysis of oncogenomics and clinicopathological_data e g oncomine ittaca papaya intogene cancer_genomics browser mev genepattern however the salient_feature that makes bioplat unique is that it allows the direct and easy integration of gene_expression and gene_expression data to further perform survival analysis moreover bioplat implements features that are not included in other biomarker_discovery tools these features include statistic methods to measure the performance of prediction_models and also algorithms to perform feature_selection although several of these statistical_tests and algorithms are mostly available in r packages our software provides a unified_framework that facilitates the use of these components
