codex exploration of semantic changes between ontology versions life_science ontologies substantially change over time to meet the requirements of their users and to include the newest domain_knowledge thus an important task is to know what has been modified between two versions of an ontology diff this diff should contain all performed changes as compact and understandable as possible we present codex complex ontology diff explorer a tool that allows determining semantic changes between two versions of an ontology which users can interactively analyze in multiple_ways availability_and codex is available under http www izbi de codex and is supported by all major browsers it is implemented_in based on google web toolkit technology additionally users can access a web_service interface to use the diff functionality in their applications and analyses recently ontologies have become very popular in the life_sciences they consist of a harmonized vocabulary of terms concepts describing and structuring a domain of interest their main application is the consistent and uniform description annotation of biological_entities such as genes and proteins enabling analyses such as term enrichment or gene_expression data studies the most used ontology in bioinformatics is the gene_ontology go consisting of subontologies for molecular_functions biological_processes and cellular_components a huge number of life_science ontologies are managed within the open biomedical_ontologies foundry obo which has established the common obo format as representation language the content of ontologies is not static due to new knowledge e g from experimental_results or design errors made in earlier versions they underlie continuous changes to enhance their quality the onex tool already allows studying the evolution of life_science ontologies over the recent_years e g one may notice that the biological_processes of go doubled in their size to concepts between and however onex considers rather simple changes e g concept additions and deletions such that there is still an increasing need to figure out what has exactly been changed between the two versions of an ontology diff the complexity and size of life_science ontologies to whom correspondence should be addressed requires that a diff should be as compact and human understandable as possible semantic changes such as concept merges additions of entire subgraphs or moves of concepts should be reported instead of long lists of rather basic changes as generated by tools such as obodiff of obo edit a semantic diff can be valuable for both ontology users and developers e g if a user likes to perform a term enrichment_analysis based on a new ontology version she may be interested in revised concepts compared with the previously used version or a developer likes to know which changes were performed in the last year to plan future modifications current ontology browsers such as amigo or ontology lookup service are limited to the latest available version and do not offer diff facilities we therefore present codex a web_tool to ad_hoc compute a semantically rich diff between two ontology versions we apply codex to determine and analyze the difference between selected ontology versions first we compute the diff between the july and november version of the sequence ontology this time the ontology grew by and the diff encompasses changes the changes are dominated by attribute value changes especially changes of definitions other frequent semantic changes are moves of concepts and leaf additions however there was a huge amount of revisions including merges as well as obsolete changes the largest of the added subgraphs with new concepts is go protein binding transcription_factor activity the presented codex application allows to compare different ontology versions and determines a compact diff based on semantic changes thus users can flexibly determine semantic diffs and use this knowledge for understanding the ontology evolution or to adapt dependent data the application can be accessed via an interactive web front end or a web_service interface
