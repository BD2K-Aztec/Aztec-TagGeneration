data_and genecost a novel scoring based prioritization framework for identifying disease_causing due to the big_data produced by next_generation studies there is an evident need for methods to extract the valuable information gathered from these experiments in this work we propose genecost a novel scoring based method to evaluate every gene for their disease association without any prior filtering and any prior_knowledge we assign a disease likelihood_score to each gene in correspondence with their variations then we rank all genes based on frequency conservation pedigree and detailed variation information to find out the causative reason of the disease_state we demonstrate the usage of genecost with public and real_life mendelian disease cases including recessive dominant compound_heterozygous and sporadic models as a result we were able to identify causative reason behind the disease_state in top rank ings of our list proving that this novel prioritization framework provides a powerful environment for the analysis in genetic disease studies alternative to filtering based_approaches availability_and genecost software is freely_available at www igbam bilgem tubitak gov tr en softwares genecost en index html contact the progress in next_generation ngs_technologies have led to an increased usage of whole exome and whole_genome in medicine the practice of high_throughput methods in identifying disease_causing is becoming more prevalent with the aim of exploring the unresolved mendelian_diseases hence there is still a need for effective tools to analyze the big_data coming out of sequencing_experiments an important step in extracting information from huge amount of data produced by high_throughput is variant_prioritization variety of tools have been proposed in the literature for identifying the causative reason behind mendelian_diseases such as bierapp privar mendelscan kggseq and extasy most of these methods actually rely on tight filtering_approach to reduce the number of variants however ngs_technology is prone to errors at many steps such as optical reading and alignment therefore filtering based_approaches have the possibility of missing the real causative reason behind the disease_state additionally some of the programs are web_based and require the uploading of the variant file to the program owners server which may compromise the privacy of the individuals furthermore most of the programs can only operate on a single individuals data hence they are not able to use the whole information coming from the pedigree in this study we propose a novel scoring based_approach for evaluating disease_causing unlike any other method genecost focuses on genes instead of single variations hence if several different mutations in a single gene are causing the same disease which is observed at sporadic_cases genecost wouldperfectly identify that gene as well by adopting a scoring based_approach we aim to overcome the problems coming with the quality of the data thus we show in our work that genecost is superior to other prioritization_tools no matter the data is faulty or not moreover genecost has a wider_range of applicability than any other existing_methods since it can make use of the pedigree_information it can accept multiple affected and healthy_individuals information which is crucial for sporadic_cases our method works offline on personal_computers and users are not obliged to upload the vcf file to our servers which carries sensitive information additionally genecost does not require any prior_knowledge of the disease such as phenotype information and can be easily applied using the command_line
