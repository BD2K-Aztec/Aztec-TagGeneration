genome_analysis characterization of structural_variants with single_molecule and hybrid sequencing_approaches motivation structural_variation is common in human and cancer gen omes high_throughput has enabled genome_scale surveys of structural_variation however the short_reads produced by these technologies limit the study of complex variants particularly those involving repetitive_regions recent third generation sequen_cing technologies_provide single_molecule templates and longer sequencing_reads but at the cost of higher per nucleotide error_rates results we present multibreak_sv an algorithm to detect structural_variants svs from single_molecule sequencing_data paired_read sequencing_data or a combination of sequencing_data from different platforms we demonstrate that combining low coverage third generation data from pacific_biosciences pacbio with high coverage paired_read data is advantageous on simulated chromosomes we apply multibreak_sv to pacbio data from four human fosmids and show that it detects known svs with high_sensitivity finally we perform a whole genome_analysis on pacbio data from a complete hydatidiform_mole cell_line and predict high_probability svs over half of which are confirmed by an illumina based assembly availability_and multibreak_sv is available atstructural variationincluding duplications deletions insertions and translocations of genomic segmentsare an important source of variation in human and cancer_genomes human_genomes differ by thousands of inherited structural_variants svs many of which have been associated with genetic_disorders and diseases svs have long been recognized as a form of somatic_mutations that drive the development and progression of cancer the continuing decline in sequencing_costs for next_generation has made it the standard_technique for structural_variation detection largely replacing microarrays and earlier cytogenetic techniques most structural_variation studies conducted on highly repetitive mammalian_genomes use a resequencing approach where reads from an individual genome are independently aligned to a reference_genome discrepancies between the expected and observed alignments or the number of aligned_reads suggest potential svs in the individual genome compared with the reference identifying svs from short_read paired_end sequencing_data is complicated by a number of factors including sequencing and alignment errors as well as repetitive_sequences near sv boundaries to handle these obstacles most methods detect structural_variation by clustering fragments and assigning a higher confidence or score to the cluster if many fragments support the variant early approaches for paired_end data simplified the issue of repeats by either ignoring fragments that align to multiple_locations in the reference or choosing a single best alignment breaking ties arbitrarily methods that incorporate ambiguous alignments for paired_reads improved sv_detection however these methods report a single set of predictions that usually involves minimizing the total number of svs more recently gasvpro demonstrated the effectiveness of a probabilistic_model that considers many possible read mappings and incorporates both a paired_end and a read_depth signal to refine variant predictions additionally some tools have the capacity to analyze split readscorrectly mapping the read subsequences for reads spanning breakpoint junctionsusually in the context of deletions or transcriptomic_data despite these improvements existing_methods are inherently limited by the underlying sequencing_technology i e they often rely on explicit assumptions about fragment length error_rate and the number of svs that fragments imply emerging single_molecule sequencing technologiescoined third generation technologiesfrom companies such as pacific_biosciences pacbio and oxford nanopore are capable of sequencing longer fragments than current_sequencing for example pacbios single_molecule real_time smrt_sequencing generates reads greater than kb on average with some reads exceeding kb the benefits of longer_reads come at a cost per base error_rates of such technologies are higher than next_generation for pacbio while oxford nanopore has not yet launched a commercial machine early indications are that error_rates will be higher than the rates of current short_read technologies the properties of third generation technologies provide_unique and challenges for sv_detection a single_read may span_multiple svs in the sequenced_genome generalizing the concept of split_reads thus standard assumptions of observing a single breakpoint from a single_read must be relaxed as svs are no longer independent from one another additionally protocols such as strobe sequencing which produced multiply linked reads from a single fragment of dna generalize the concept of paired_end both long_reads and multiply linked reads provide increased power to detect complex rearrangements with multiple nearby svs however higher_error create ambiguity in assessing an optimal alignment making it necessary to consider a large set of possible alignments accounting for both higher_error and multiple svs leads to more subtle algorithmic concerns previous work on sv prediction from single_molecule sequencing_data in the context of strobe sequencing_data formulated an optimization_problem that aimed to minimize the number of predicted svs while strobes showed increased specificity in sv predictions compared to paired_end the method suffered from a large false_positive and was never tested on real sequencing_data we propose a new algorithm multibreak_sv which directly addresses the challenges of high_error and multiple svs reported by a single_read rather than trying to find a single solution and assignment for the data multibreak_sv employs a probabilistic_approach that considers all possible solutions multibreak_sv is capable of predicting variants from paired_end sequencing_data third generation data and data from a combination of sequencing_platforms we benchmark multibreak_sv on simulated highlyrepetitive chromosomes using long_read strobe sequencing paired_end and a mixture of strobe and paired_end data we then demonstrate the accuracy of multibreak_sv on pacbio strobe sequencing_data from four fosmids containing known svs finally we perform a genomewide analysis on pacbio long_read data to predict svs from a cell_line derived from a complete hydatidiform_mole as long_read technologies become more practical for large_scale genome_sequencing there is a clear need for methods that take advantage of these reads while allowing for the higher single nucleotide error_rates in current long_read technologies in addition methods that integrate these datasets with existing short_read are also a priority multibreak_sv helps address this need using a probabilistic_model that considers many possible alternative alignments for each read multibreak_sv additionally provides a natural framework for identifying svs across multiple_platforms we have benchmarked multibreak_sv on multiple types of simulated sequencing_data and compared it to other state of the art variant detection_algorithms designed for paired_read and multi read data we have put forth a pipeline for identifying multibreakpoint mappings from long_reads enabling novel adjacency prediction from long_read data here we have shown that multibreak_sv not only outperforms current approaches using data from a single_platform but also enables hybrid approaches that combine data from multiple sequencing_platforms we applied multibreak_sv to whole_genome sequencing_data from chm tert a human cell_line derived from a complete hydatidiform_mole which a target for a high_quality platinum genome_assembly while probabilistic approaches such as multibreak_sv are powerful they are more time consuming than the parsimony based_methods we compare to we have demonstrated that parallel processing of the data makes multibreak_sv feasible the chm tert analysis to evaluate our resulting predictions we compare them to novel adjacencies found in an illuminabased chm tert assembly we acknowledge that this assembly may be incorrect and incomplete thus we do not treat it as a gold_standard identifying a subset of the high_probability novel adjacencies that may be used to augment the existing assembly remains future work finally since chm tert is haploid we suspect that it is considerably easier to identify variants since there should be no heterozygous events it will be important to evaluate multibreak_sv on pacbio long_read data generated from a diploid human_genome when the data becomes available one of the challenges in single_molecule sequencing_technologies is dealing with a higher per nucleotide error_rate by considering many possible alignments for each read and constructing a model which incorporates the error_rate as well as the expected support for an adjacency we are able to take advantage of the length of the read while mitigating false_positives due to high_error this trade_off appears to be inherent to single_molecule technologies upcoming technologies such as oxford nanopore have suggested they can achieve read_lengths greater than kb with per base costs similar to short_read technologies and read_lengths from pacbio continue to increase while maintaining similar error profiles detecting multiple breakpoints from the same dna_fragment is not a strategy limited to single_molecule sequencing_platforms recent_advances such as long fragment read lfr technology allow short_read sequencing_platforms to mimic long_reads the infinipair technique holds the potential of obtaining multiple linked short_reads from a single_sequence fragment by inducing an electrical field over illumina flow cells these advances in short_read platforms further motivate the need for designing algorithms for fragments with more than two sequenced_reads multi reads with sensitive alignment procedures to find ambiguous alignments from long_reads and multi reads are important for discovering high_quality predictions many structural_variation methods propose tiered alignment strategies to find ambiguous alignments however we found that these strategies drastically increased the total number of ambiguous alignments to consider effectively drowning out the signal from true variants supplementary section ultimately more sensitive alignment pipelines will improve sv prediction from multi breakpoint reads the hmm for identifying breakpoints within completelyspanning blasr alignments is one step towards this goal complex svs with multiple co located breakpoints have been observed in both normal and cancer_genomes given the complexity of structural_variation observed in humans the ability to detect multiple breakpoints on a single_read is becoming increasingly critical in of all cancer_genomes and up to in some cancers specific chromosomal_regions are seen to be greatly enriched for nearby rearrangements via a process known as chromothripsis as researchers delve into increasingly_complex regions of the genome with multiple co located rearrangements and or dense repeat structure probabilistic methods that can assign confidence to each call while integrating orthogonal sequencing_platforms will become a necessity our method multibreak_sv provides a generalized framework for such approaches
