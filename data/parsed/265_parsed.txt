an accessible database for mouse and human whole transcriptome qpcr primers motivation real_time qpcr is an important tool in quantitative_studies of dna and rna_molecules especially in transcriptome_studies where different primer combinations allow identification of specific_transcripts such as splice_variants or precursor messenger_rna several softwares that implement various rules for optimal primer_design are available nevertheless as designing qpcr primers needs to be done manually the repeated task is tedious time consuming and prone to errors results we used a set of rules to automatically design all possible exonexon and intronexon junctions in the human and mouse tran scriptomes the resulting database is included as a track in the ucsc_genome making it widely accessible and easy to use quantitative_polymerase qpcr is an efficient tool to quantify changes in abundance of dna rna_molecules its main advantage is that it has a large_dynamic and requires only basic sample_preparation steps reverse transcription of rna double_stranded dye such as sybr based qpcr quantifies the amount of double_stranded in a sample a pair of specific_primers amplifies a short usually bp dna region and the emitted light is measured after every cycle the qpcr platforms allow measurement in parallel on the same plate of many different reactions which saves time and work and reduces technical bias primer_design for qpcr is a relatively simple but repetitive time consuming task the first step is to choose a target_sequence for which one then has to define constraints about the primers product and reaction_conditions then available software e g primer is used to get the set of best suggested primer_pairs when browsing rna_transcripts the target_sequence should be determined and selected carefully because of constraints such as product size amplification of a single product and in particular the need to amplify a specific_isoform of a given gene moreover as qpcr platforms enable performing measurements for a large_number in parallel the user has to repeat many times the task of target_sequence selection and primer_design manually which can be tedious and prone to human errors as an example in the most frequent case of measuring mrna one wishes to amplify an exonexon junction picking the sequences of both exons and imposing the constraint of having the forward primer on the exon and the reverse primer on the exon see also sandhu and acharya discussed in supplementary_information
