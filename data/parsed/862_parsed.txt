cart a chemical annotation retrieval toolkit motivation data on bioactivities of drug like chemicals are rapidly_accumulating in public_repositories creating new opportunities for research in computational systems pharmacology however integrative_analysis of these data_sets is difficult due to prevailing ambiguity between chemical names and identifiers and a lack of cross_references between databases results to address this challenge we have developed cart a chemical annotation retrieval toolkit as a key functionality it matches an input list of chemical names into a comprehensive reference space to assign unambiguous chemical identifiers in this unified space bioactivity annotations can be easily retrieved from databases covering a wide_variety of chemical effects on biological_systems subsequently cart can determine annotations enriched in the input_set of chemicals and display these in tabular format and interactive network visualizations thereby facilitating integrative_analysis of chemical bioactivity data availability_and cart is available as a galaxy web_service cart embl de source_code and an easy to install command_line can also be obtained from the web_site coherent functional themes analogous to gene_ontology tools such as david this makes cart useful e g for the automatic characterization of hits derived from chemical screens for instance also in other contexts annotating chemicals with various biological_effects is becoming an important task which has so_far largely required expert manual_annotation but can be greatly_simplified by cart is established using fishers_exact with fdr correction_for in a typical use case users may want to subject a set of hits resulting from a high_throughput chemical screen to cart analysis after name matching the enrichment_analysis can be done relative to a user specified background in this case the library of all chemicals probed in the screen enriched annotations are subsequently retrieved from databases describing chemical effects at various scales including molecular_targets metabolizing_enzymes functional classifications indication areas and side_effects supplementary_material s the results are visualized as a network linking the input_set of chemicals to enriched annotations supplementary_material s supplementary implemented in cytoscape js this network can be interactively explored the galaxy front end of cart enables users to combine individual modules into new workflows allowing for easy customization and extension of the standard use case described above galaxy moreover facilitates reproducibility due to its history and sharing functionalities cart uses a comprehensive chemical reference space of about million names and synonyms and million inchikeys that are disambiguated to million chemical identifiers based on information from the stitch database version matching user provided chemical names into this reference space is very fast e g processing chemicals takes s supplementary figureand supplementary_material s typical cart workflow including chemical name matching annotation retrieval and enrichment_analysis the lower panels contain a toy example of nonsteroidal anti_inflammatory nsaid compounds and show excerpts of how these are matched and annotated by cart the rightmost panel displays a partial enrichment network ptgs prostaglandin_endoperoxide targets m a atc_code for nsaids adj p fdr corrected p value nephritis and vasculitis are nsaid associated side_effects see_supplementary s and supplementaryfor an application of cart to hits from a drug_screen
