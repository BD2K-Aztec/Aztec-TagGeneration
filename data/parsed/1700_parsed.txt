systems_biology exploring metabolic_pathways in genome_scale networks via generating flux modes motivation the reconstruction of metabolic_networks at the genome_scale has allowed the analysis of metabolic_pathways at an unprecedented level of complexity elementary_flux efms are an appropriate concept for such analysis however their number grows in a combinatorial fashion as the size of the metabolic_network increases which renders the application of efms approach to large metabolic_networks difficult novel methods are expected to deal with such complexity results in this article we present a novel optimization based method for determining a minimal generating set of efms i e a convex basis we show that a subset of elements of this convex basis can be effectively computed even in large metabolic_networks our method was applied to examine the structure of pathways producing lysine in escherichia_coli we obtained a more varied and informative set of pathways in comparison with existing_methods in addition an alternative_pathway to produce lysine was identified using a detour via propionyl_coa which shows the predictive_power of our novel approach availability the source_code in c is available upon request during the last decade different approaches have been proposed to explore the structure of complex metabolic_networks from a pathway oriented perspective as in other methods these approaches are mainly built upon the steady_state condition and irreversibility thermodynamic_constraints which define a polyhedral cone typically referred to as the flux cone in particular pathway based_methods search for solutions in the flux cone that satisfy a simplicity condition technically the non decomposability condition these properties were condensed in the definition of elementary_flux efm in the work of schuster and hilgetag since its introduction the concept of efm has received much attention showing that a wide_range of questions in bioengineering and bioinformatics can be addressed using such an approach in particular the prediction of novel biologically_meaningful pathways constitutes one of the most important_applications of efm analysis an example is the in silico prediction via efm analysis of the pep glyoxylate_cycle which was later confirmed experimentally however due to combinatorial explosion the computation of efms is not easy and until recently their analysis has been restricted to small metabolic_networks in this context have presented an improved method that expands the applicability of the efms approach to moderate_size metabolic_networks however large metabolic_networks remain beyond the capabilities of current_algorithms we have recently shown that the k shortest efms for small k values can be calculated in large_networks even at the genome_scale using integer_linear the use of optimization introduces more flexibility into efm computation and therefore the direct exploration of a particular subset of efms of interest can be accomplished without having first to compute the full set of efms this represents a clear advantage with respect to previous methods a concept related to efms is that of convex basis first introduced in it was defined as a minimal set of efms that generate the solution_space this means that any vector in the flux cone in particular any other efm not included in this minimal set can be written as a non negative linear combination of the elements of the basis for this reason a convex basis is typically referred to as a minimal generating set and elements of this basis as generating flux modes gfms however the convexin this section we present results corresponding to the application of our k shortest gfms to analyze the pathway structure of e coli to produce lysine we used the genome_scale of e coli k mg which involves reactions and metabolites as noted above our method is particularly useful for networks of this size since the computation of a convex basis via traditional_methods is not applicable in these networks a minimal_medium based on glucose ammonium and oxygen was utilized we neglected constraints from proton and cofactor atp nadh nadph etc balances fixing them as external metabolites one may question the validity of this hypothesis for nadp and nadph since nadph is required in stoichiometric_amounts for lysine production and as discussed in its supply has substantial impact in metabolism in this work for the sake of simplicity we focused on pathways for the supply of the carbon backbone of lysine moreover extending the current work to consider the role of cofactors in lysine production can be accomplished without loss of generality as shown in see_supplementary for the exact definition of the medium and cofactors set the reaction transporting lysine from the periplasm compartment to the external compartment is pseudo irreversible i e no reversible gfms exist that produce lysine thus we need only to focus on irreversible gfms producing lysine our k shortest gfms method was then applied with k and constraint for lysine we also computed the k shortest efms as described in in order to compare the results we selected m to guarantee that no pathway_information is missed similarly to in a bits ghz gb ram pc cplex took approximately and min to compute the shortest efms and gfms respectively therefore though computation time is acceptable our method is less efficient than the k shortest efms method note that by setting cofactors as external metabolites we may find solutions that use some cofactors as carbon_source which are irrelevant for the biosynthesis of lysine using glucose as carbon_source as it can be observed in the supplementary_material we found this issue in longer pathways using amp as carbon_source to prevent these solutions from appearing we constrained the adenine pool formed by atp adp and amp to be in balance by adding the following constraint to our previous formulation s ampr are the stoichiometric coefficients of atp adp and amp respectively for reaction r first the shortest efms and shortest gfms involve and reactions respectively in addition while the maximum_length for shortest efms is this is for the shortest gfms which just indicates that the k shortest gfms method produce a set of longer pathways we also used the hamming_distance to evaluate the differences between each pair of solutions of the shortest efms gfms finding that the average hamming_distance is higher for gfms which just indicates that the shortest efms approach determine a less diverse set of solutions furthermore it can be observed fromthat from reactions that participate in the shortest efms are included in the shortest gfms this implies that most information in the shortest efms is included in the shortest gfms and therefore the gfms approach is more informative to validate this we created a subnetwork with the reactions forming the shortest efms and computed the full set of efms for this subnetwork via efmtool as observed incytosol nitrogen_metabolism the balancing of succinate succ and succinyl coa succoa and the production of dha with respect to the shortest gfms we have longer routes than the shortest efms though they are still short maximum reactions the set of pathways is now much more varied see supplementary figs s and s for instance the pentose phosphate pp pathway and the glyoxylate shunt are now recovered moreover we obtain several routes around the switch node per pyr oaa which is known to be responsible for the distribution of the carbon_flux among catabolism anabolism and energy_supply in several bacteria overall most of previous_biochemical knowledge on the production of lysine is recovered in the shortest gfms a relevant mechanism appearing in the shortest gfms is the metabolic cycle shown in which suggests a novel pathway to produce lysine this metabolic cycle consumes one molecule of oaa and produces one molecule of pyr and co each making a detour through propionyl_coa ppcoa this cycle is an alternative mechanism to the oaadc reaction oaa pyr co however it is less efficient than the oaadc reaction since it involves six reactions and consumes one molecule of atp to carry out the conversion we refer to it as the ppcoa cycle to the best of our knowledge this cycle has not been previously described note here that other routes for the conversion of oaa to pyr have been previously described in the literature the importance of the ppcoa cycle in the production of lysine is however questionable the decarboxylation of oaa is generally counterproductive since the overexpression of genes associated with enzymes producing oaa as well as the deletion of genes_encoding that withdraw oaa are well known strategies to increase the yield of lysine a counterexample here is the decarboxylation of oaa via malate reactions mdh and me that converts nadh into nadph which as mentioned above is important for lysine production on the other hand it is known from studies in aspergillus_nidulans that ppcoa inhibits the activity of pyruvate_dehydrogenase and thus its presence decreases the flux through the tricarboxylic_acid tca_cycle this may be of interest for lysine production since the increase in the yield of lysine is linked to a decrease in the flux through tca the overall effect requires experimental_validation we discuss below the functional feasibility of this cycle in e coli in this article we have presented a novel theoretical method to compute a convex basis based on the recent work of deand larhlimi and bockmayr our method was effectively applied to determine a subset of gfms in large metabolic_networks where classical approaches fail though the computation of k shortest gfms is more expensive than the k shortest efms method presented in we here obtained a more diverse and informative set of pathways in the analysis of pathways producing lysine obtained by the k shortest gfms method we identified a new cycle via propionylcoa that produces one molecule of pyruvate and consumes one page
