diggit a bioconductor_package to infer genetic_variants driving cellular_phenotypes identification of driver_mutations in human_diseases is often limited by cohort size and availability of appropriate statistical_models we propose a method for the systematic discovery ofidentification of somatic_mutations and germline variants associated to cancer and other complex_diseases driver_mutations is mostly performed on a statistical basis achieving appropriate statistical_power however requires large_effect or large cohorts to control for errors arising from the large number of tested hypothesis in addition since statistical_approaches do not provide mechanistic insight many disease risk determinants such as apolipoprotein e were discovered long before they were mechanistically elucidated we have recently_developed an approach that boosts the statistical_power of gwas by focusing the analysis to genes mechanistically linked to a specific phenotype or cell state termed master_regulators mr driver gene inference by genetical genomic information_theory diggit searches for genetic_alterations associated with dysregulation of mr protein activity reducing the number of hypothesis to test while providing regulatory clues to help elucidate associated biological_mechanisms we have recently used diggit to identify causal genetic_determinants of the mesenchymal subtype of human glioblastoma gbm here we present the r system implementation of diggit which is available as a software_package from bioconductor elucidating the causal genetic_determinants of most complex_diseases has proven more challenging than expected due to the large number of candidate loci it is difficult to achieve enough statistical_power all but the most highly_penetrant and frequent events furthermore classic gwas approaches are based on pure statistical associations providing no mechanistic_insights diggit aims to address both challenges by relying on context specific models of cell regulation it boosts the statistical_power by focusing on the regulators mechanistically linked to the phenotype and on their upstream post_translational modulators the algorithm relies on large n samples expression and genetic profiles and requires cell context specific models of transcriptional_and its r implementation available as an r system package from bioconductor has low computational between genes affected by genetic_alterations rows and stat inferred protein activity while conditioning on each of the genetically_altered genes columns the rightmost column indicates the weakest association for each gene requirements running in most desktop workstations for an average n samples dataset
