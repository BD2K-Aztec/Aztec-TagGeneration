sequence_analysis visualization and probability based_scoring of structural_variants within repetitive_sequences motivation repetitive_sequences account for approximately half of the human_genome accurately ascertaining sequences in these regions with next generation sequencers is challenging and requires a different set of analytical_techniques than for reads originating from unique_sequences complicating the matter are repetitive_regions subject to programmed rearrangements as is the case with the antigen binding_domains in the immunoglobulin ig and t cell receptor tcr loci results we developed a probability based score and visualization method to aid in distinguishing true structural_variants from alignment artifacts we demonstrate the usefulness of this method in its ability to separate real structural_variants from false_positives generated with existing upstream analysis tools we validated our approach using both target capture and whole_genome experiments capture sequencing_reads were generated from primary lymphoid tumors cancer_cell and an ebv transformed lymphoblast cell_line over the ig and tcr loci whole_genome sequencing_reads were from a lymphoblastoid_cell availability we implement our method as an rstructural variants svs including deletions insertions inversions and translocations are known to contribute to a wide_range of human phenotypes high_throughput technology has facilitated exciting findings associating svs with multi genic diseases like autism and schizophrenia and revealing genomic_rearrangements in cancer thousands of genomic_loci in humans are now known to vary structurally next_generation ngs is central to the field evidenced by the high visibility of consortia that use ngs like the genomes_project despite group efforts and recent_advances discovering and annotating the full landscape of svs in humans is incomplete this is in part owed to the inaccuracy of ngs in defining repetitive_dna repetitive_dna stretches of nucleotides present in more than one copy in the haploid_genome accounts for about half of the human_genome these stretches may be sub classified by length copy_number base_composition and linear organization all of which are difficult to assay with ngs paired_end the most widely used ngs method for detecting svs has some ability to define svs in repetitive_sequences the idea is to find readpairs that map with an unexpected distance or orientation relative to one another therefore implying an sv when one or both ends of a readpair map to the reference_genome in multiple_locations they provide evidence for multiple contradictory structural arrangements this is particularly problematic with ngs because a standard approach among the most widely used aligners is to randomly pick and report only one location for reads that map to multiple_locations this can easily lead to paired_end alignments that appear to be svs when in fact the reads were from a contiguous piece of the reference_genome in this article we demonstrate how this is a substantial problem in practice and present a method that greatly helps ameliorate the problem currently a handful of tools including hydra gasvpro and variationhunter attempt to resolve the inconsistencies generated from ambiguously mapped_reads hydra and variationhunter choose one alignment per read from a set of possibilities to designate as correct gasvpro weighs multiple mappings per read in proportion to their probability despite clever algorithms the accuracy of these tools is limited when the ends map ambiguously this point will be demonstrated to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work in section as a result one must either discard results in repetitive_dna or perform independent_validation one popular form of the latter involves visualizing alignments over candidates several viewers are available but there is a lack of options tailored to discriminating false svs from true svs we developed a probability based score that can be used to prioritize candidate svs our score weighs two contradictory hypotheses readpairs either belong to both the junctions of an sv one read per junction or they belong to just one of the junctions because univariate scores are sometimes too simplistic we also developed a visualization_tool for alignments for candidate svs to avoid reinventing the wheel the starting_point of our method is the outputs of the existing sv discovery tools we illustrate the usefulness of our method on two experiments both of which provided a way to validate findings described in detail in section and in the supplement the first was a typical whole_genome sequencing_experiment and the second was a target capture sequencing on a region known to have a high prevelance of svs for the whole_genome experiment we sequenced a diploid lymphobastoid cell_line from an anonymized female individual for the capture experiment we targeted sequences in the ig and tcr loci in primary lymphoid cancer samples cancer_cell and an ebv transformed cell_line these loci the building_blocks of antigen binding_domains in immunoglobulins and t cell receptors are characterized by consecutive homologous_sequences this repetitive segmentally duplicated architecture makes these loci notoriously_difficult to assay using ngs these loci are an area of much interest because of their fundamental role in immunology and cancer at the heart of our contribution to sv_detection our procedure filtered out false_positives resulting from repetitive sequence in these data for validation of our target capture results we used pcr our target_sequence was enriched for segmental_duplications about six times above the genome_wide level they represented of the target_sequence while they are present in of the human_genome of validated false_positives in the targetcapture sequences contained breakpoints overlapping a segmental_duplication importantly we also identified true svs within segmental_duplications in our target capture data of validated true_positives in the target capture contained breakpoints that overlapped a segmental_duplication segmental_duplications were also a significant source of spurious_results in our whole_genome data of validated false_positives in the whole_genome data contained breakpoints overlapping a segmental_duplication while for true_positives in the whole_genome data only did so to validate these results we used readdepth based cnv_calls from three wholegenome sequencing runs of our lymphoblast sample our results demonstrate that our method effectively distinguishes artifacts from true svs in repetitive loci we used our method with four sv finders hydra gasv gasvpro and variationhunter to analyze sequences from whole_genome and targetcapture data the final validation_set from the whole_genome data included distinct deletions positives_and and distinct svs from the target capture positives_and our sequencing library for the targetcapture experiment included fragments selectively captured from v d j loci on chromosomes and in a panel of neoplastic b and t lymphocytes and an ebv transformed cell_line each of the three sv callers we used for this dataset hydra gasv and variationhunter returned many results gasv and hydra returned a similar quantity and respectively while variationhunter returned the callers also returned many results for the whole_genome sample two callers gasvpro and variationhunter returned results and the other two callers gasv and hydra returned and respectively without accurate prioritization a result list with thousands of calls is not particularly useful based upon validation of junctions in the targetcapture dataset and deletions in the whole_genome sample a small fraction of all candidate svs the callers did not appear to adequately provide this capability caller performance individually see section and in combination using agreement between callers was wanting especially for the targetcapture experiment in our targetcapture dataset agreement between callers was relatively low and did not serve to distinguish validated true_positives from false_positives when considering the top calls from each method were made by only one method were made by exactly two methods and were made by all three the existence of calls made by multiple methods raised the possibility of using consensus to circumvent the weaknesses of any individual caller however when considering the validated svs this prospect did not translate to reality in the call sets of top candidates there were nearly equal_proportions of validated true_positives and false_positives called by multiple methods in these sets false_positives of those validated and true_positives of those validated were reported by at least two callers additionally there was no apparent advantage to distinguishing between calls made by exactly two methods and calls made by all three methods five out of the true_positive calls made by multiple methods were made by all three methods eight out of the false_positive calls made by multiple methods were made by all three methods we show results for agreement between hydra variationhunter and gasvpro for the whole_genome sample because we were able to use gasvpro a probabilistic version of gasv in the whole_genome case when considering the top calls from each method were made by just one method were made by exactly two methods and were made by all three of validated deletions within this set calls made by multiple methods were enriched for true_positives much more than false_positives twenty true_positives of those validated were reported by at least two callers while only seven false_positives of those validated were reported by at least two callers based on these results using agreement between callers to prioritize candidates was a mixed bag it was not useful for the targetcapture and somewhat useful for the whole_genome results in the whole_genome sample calls made by multiple methods were trustworthy compared with calls made by just one method yet about half of validated positives were not multiple method calls these data indicated that a different prioritization was needed
