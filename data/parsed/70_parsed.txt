systems_biology a c library for retrieving specific reactions from the biomodels_database we describe libsbmlreactionfinder a c library for retrieving specific biochemical_reactions from the curated systems_biology models contained in the biomodels_database the library leverages semantic annotations in the database to associate reactions with human_readable descriptions making the reactions retrievable through simple string searches our goal is to provide a useful tool for quantitative modelers who seek to accelerate modeling efforts through the reuse of previously_published representations of specific chemical_reactions availability_and the library is open_source and dual licensed under the mozilla public license version and gnu_general version project source_code downloads and documentation are available at
