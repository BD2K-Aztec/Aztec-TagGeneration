data_and a probabilistic_approach for collective similarity based drug_drug prediction motivation as concurrent use of multiple_medications becomes ubiquitous among patients it is crucial to characterize both adverse and synergistic_interactions between drugs statistical_methods for prediction of putative drugdrug_interactions ddis can guide in vitro testing and cut down significant cost and effort with the abundance of experimental_data characterizing drugs and their associated targets such methods must effectively fuse multiple sources of information and perform inference over the network of drugs results we propose a probabilistic_approach for jointly inferring unknown ddis from a network of multiple drug based similarities and known interactions we use the highly scalable and easily ex tensible probabilistic programming framework probabilistic soft logic we compare against two methods including a state of the art ddi prediction system across three experiments and show best performing improvements of more than in aupr over both baselines we find five novel interactions validated by external sources among the top_ranked predictions of our model availability_and final versions of all datasets and implementations will be made publicly_available increasingly patients use multiple pharamceutical drugs simultaneously to treat their illnesses interactions between drugs can result in reduced efficacy of one or more drugs and in some cases even deletrious side_effects the risk of adverse_effects is higher in demographics like the elderly that commonly take multiple_medications at once on the other hand certain drugs interact to produce synergistic_effects that are more effective in combatting diseases like cancer characterizes a drugdrug interaction ddi as a drug effect that is greater or less than expected in the presence of another drug although it remains crucial to verify potential_ddis in vitro it is prohibitively_expensive to exhaustively test all possible interactions therefore computational_modeling and predictive methods provide a viable way to identify the most salient potential interactions for downstream experimental_validation interactions between drugs are classified as pharmacokinetic_and computational and mathematical modeling_methods rely on current understanding of the mechanisms_underlying each of these types of interactions and are specific to each interaction type a pharmacokinetic interaction with a drug affects the process by which the other drug is absorbed distributed metabolized or excreted in the body on the other hand drugs acting on the same receptor site of action or physiological system constitute a pharmacodynamic interaction although pharmacokinetic_interactions are usually associated with an adverse or exaggerated response pharmacodynamic interactions are implicated in both synergistic and detrimental_effects many pharmacokinetic_interactions are facilitated by the enzyme_family cytochrome_p cyp and extensive but incomplete knowledge of its mechanisms have been used for computational_modeling of pharmacokinetic_interactions similarly prior work has applied mathematical_modeling of known drug response mechanisms to simulate and predict pharmacodynamic interactions in contrast to computational_modeling statistical and predictive methods leverage data and evidence from related experiments as domain_knowledge and biological priors recent advancements in highthroughput experimentation have generated a wealth of biological characterizations of drug_compounds and their target_genes a key challenge for statistical_models of ddis or the closely_related problem of drugtarget_interactions lies in fusing or combining information from multiple data_sources much related work has developed ways of computing similarity_scores between drugs or pairs of drugs to be used as features for machine_learning sophisticated algorithms such as restricted boltzmann machines and matrix_factorization are especially effective in combining two types of similarities by learning latent representations of the entities however they do not inherently support multiple similarities in the same model statistical_methods for ddi prediction are more generalizable as they do not rely on extensive expert_knowledge of each mode of interaction although apply their predictive methods only to pharmacodynamic interactions statisicals models can be easily extended to both types of interactions to the best of our knowledge present state of the art results for ddi prediction of both pharmacokinetic_and interactions with their indi system for combining similarity_measures to use features for a local logistic_regression classifier however these similarity based_methods neglect the structural information_encoded in the biological_network of drugs and their interactions two general types of approaches have been studied for adding network information to similarity based features methods that compute additional network based features and methods that perform inference directly over the structure of the network we refer to these as network similarity methods and network_based methods respectively both kinds of approaches begin by formulating a graph of drugs and their interactions networksimilarity methods proceed by computing relational features based on the local neighborhoods of drugs such as neighborhood overlap and other well studied network attributes the relational features supplement the similarity information given as input to a classifier in contrast network_based methods reason over the graph_structure when predicting interactions multiple network_based approaches have been introduced for the closely_related problem of drugtarget_interaction prediction bleakley andformulate the problem of inferring missing links in a bipartite_graph of drugs and targets and introduce a model that uses local bipartite structure for prediction similarly leverage local bipartite topology for inference andintroduce a random_walk approach for reasoning over the network of drugs and targets however local network based features cannot enforce global constraints based on the full graph of entities given local relational features current network_based methods follow traditional machine_learning in assuming the instances to be independent and identically distributed in recent work improve upon existing bipartite drugtarget_interaction prediction_approaches using the probabilistic programming framework probabilistic soft logic psl to jointly classify all interactions fusing similarity relations and global network information in this work we formalize the problem of network based ddi prediction using multiple similarity relations we collectively predict ddis considering statistical_dependencies between predictions along with knowledge of observed interactions using psl we apply our collective approach to predict ddis on three kinds of interactions i cyp related interactions crds ii ncrds and iii general interactions documented by drugbank for all settings we evaluate our collective approach against two non collective methods including state of the art indi system of gottlieb et_al and a non collective psl model our model achieves statistically significant_improvement up to in area under the roc auc results from gottlieb et_al we further assess area under the precision_recall curve aupr for all methods and show that our collective ddi prediction approach significantly_outperforms the state of the art baseline method by up to finally we present important novel ddis predicted by our approach that are validated in literature in this work we formulate the problem of collective ddi prediction we introduce a joint probabilistic_approach using the psl framework to fuse multiple sources of similarity information together with domain_knowledge of the network_structure for this domain the originality of this work lies in proposing and experimentally validating a highly scalable collective probabilistic_approach for ddi prediction that is easily extensible with different sources of information and similarity_measures we evaluate our approach on two datasets containing three types of interactions including one extracted for this work with known drugbank ids for additional validations we perform fold_cross on all settings and see that our collective psl model significantly_outperforms two other similarity based_methods including the state of the art indi system on two important metrics for link prediction aupr and auc our best performing psl model improves more than upon aupr of both baselines and achieves a best auc of moreover the non collective similarity based method implemented in psl also significantly_outperforms indi in two settings and performs comparably to indi in other settings this result also highlights the effectiveness of psl as an extensible framework for similarity based reasoning that enjoys the benefits of collective inference shown by the first result furthermore the top then predictions of our best performing collective psl methods contain five interactions that are unseen in drugbank but substantiated by drugs com and the biointeractor tool on drugbank this result signifies the usefulness of our collective approach for producing highquality predictions that can be verified experimentally downstream another benefit of our collective psl method is scalability and speed the focus of the indi method is combining similarities by computing interaction edge based similarity_score using a nearestneighbor search approach this feature computation is a computationally_expensive procedure requiring on passes over the drug entities for a dataset containing drugs this computation takes h on average per fold on a single gb machine with cores the comparable non collective psl model introduced in this work takes h for a round of weight learning and inference per fold on the same machine the collective psl model completes computation for a fold in h the psl framework admits highly_efficient polynomial time inference and here we further reduce computational_complexity by blocking unnecessary groundings of the model scalability is crucial for link prediction tasks in increasingly massive biological_networks as new drugs are frequently introduced the task of ddi prediction is closely_related to problems of predicting drug side_effects drug adverse_reactions and synergistic drug pairs our collective approach for similarity based reasoning in networks can be applied and generalized to all these related settings
