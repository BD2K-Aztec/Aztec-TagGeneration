gene_expression easyrnaseq a bioconductor_package for processing rna_seq motivation rna_sequencing is becoming a standard for expression_profiling experiments and many tools have been developed in the past_few to analyze rna_seq numerous bioconductor_packages are available for next_generation data loading in r e g shortread and rsamtools as well as to perform differential gene_expression e g deseq and edger however the processing tasks lying in between these require the precise interplay of many bioconductor_packages e g biostrings iranges or external solutions are to be sought results we developed easyrnaseq an r package that simplifies the processing of rna sequencing_data hiding the complex_interplay of the required packages behind a single functionality availability the package is implemented in r as of version and is available from bioconductor as of version at thesince the extensive utilization of rna_sequencing for expression_profiling rna numerous tools have been developed as part of the r bioconductor_project to load rna_seq in r the first shortread parses manufacturer specific formats it gave way to the rsamtools package as the sam bam format became a de facto standard for reporting next_generation ngs alignment data in parallel analysis packages were adapted edger or newly_developed deseq to accommodate for ngs specificities recently the bioconductor core team released several packages to connect these parts of the process e g genomicranges genomicfeatures however combining them appropriately requires a good understanding of their functionalities and depending on the data different combinations of these packages have to be used implying a long learning_curve for rna_seq neophytes in parallel to these aspects the sequencers yield increase resulted in the generalization of protocols that allow several samples to be run in a single lane a process called multiplexing de multiplexing the obtained data is a processing step that no r package currently addresses here we describe easyrnaseq an r package that eases rna_seq processing by combining the necessary packages in a single wrapper that ensures the pertinence of the provided data and information and helps users circumnavigate rna_seq processing pitfalls in addition it introduces functionalities to handle data produced by recent ngs protocols
