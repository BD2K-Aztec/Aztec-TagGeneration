systems_biology sgns a compartmentalized stochastic chemical kinetics simulator for dynamic cell_populations motivation cell_growth and division affect the kinetics of internal cellular_processes and the phenotype diversity of cell_populations since the effects are complex e g different cellular_components are partitioned differently in cell_division to account for them in silico one needs to simulate these processes in great detail results we present sgns a simulator of chemical_reaction systems according to the stochastic_simulation with multi delayed reactions within hierarchical interlinked compartments which can be created destroyed and divided at runtime in division molecules are randomly segregated into the daughter_cells following a specified distribution corresponding to one of several partitioning schemes applicable on a per molecule type basis we exemplify its use with six models including a stochastic_model of the disposal mechanism of unwanted protein_aggregates in escherichia_coli a model of phenotypic diversity in populations with different levels of synchrony a model of a bacterio phages infection of a cell_population and a model of prokaryotic gene_expression at the nucleotide and codon levels recent_evidence even in cellular organisms whose division is morphologically symmetric there are a number of asymmetries between daughter_cells these arise among other things from the stochasticity in the partitioning of components in division and from biased partitioning schemes for some components for example in escherichia_coli unwanted protein_aggregates follow biased partitioning schemes dependent on the age of the daughter_cells poles these and other recent findings_suggest that the phenotypic diversity of cell_populations among other factors depends on errors and biases in the partitioning of rna proteins and other molecules this is of relevance since most rnas exist in small numbers and small fluctuations in these numbers can alter the behavior of genetic_circuits and trigger visible phenotype changes these sources of phenotypic heterogeneity are difficult to distinguish from e g noise in gene_expression although some effects can be assessed analytically others are too complex and must be assessed numerically a simulator is thus needed that accounts for noise and delays in gene_expression and for compartmentalization of processes and components presently simulators of the dynamics of noisy biochemical_systems rely on the stochastic_simulation ssa e g some support compartmentalization simulating reaction_diffusion in either static or dynamically sized compartments others support rule_based creation of reactions at runtime and thus can simulate a dynamic cell_population very few support delays on the release into the system of one or more products of a reaction these delays are essential to accurately model the kinetics of some processes e g transcription as rna production is mostly regulated by the duration of events in transcription_initiation here we present sgns an extension of sgn sim that incorporates dynamic compartments and multiple partitioning distributions at cell_division applicable on a per molecule type basis the number of reactions compartments and delayed events allowing complex models to be simulated in reasonable time to simulate cell_division we introduced a special reaction event whose timing follows the ssa rules when executed instead of subtracting substrates from the system a random_number is generated based on one of the several partitioning distributions available including some of those listed in huh and paulsson each of these mimics a specific molecule partitioning process during cell_division sgns allows both biased and unbiased partitioning of molecules and sub compartments the results of these events can be instantaneous or be placed on the wait_list compartment division and molecule partitioning are represented in the following form splitp protein cell c cell protein cell when this reaction_occurs a new cell compartment is created cell in the product list proteins in the original cell are partitioned according to a biased binomial partitioning scheme in this each protein is independently partitioned into the new cell with probability p other common partitioning distributions include the independent partitioning of molecules into daughter_cells with random beta distributed sizes and the binding of molecules to spindle binding_sites which are segregated evenly between daughter_cells such as during mitosis available distributions are listed in the manual sgns is a command_line utility designed to fit into a toolchain supporting various input and output_formats input can be specified in two formats sbml and sgnsims native format a subset of sbml core level version is supported allowing simulation of most sbml models output can be in csv tsv or in binary format a text editor may be used to write models in sgnsim format sbml based graphical interfaces such as celldesigner or cytoscape may be used to manage sbml models the results of simulations are interpretable by programs like matlab r or excel an example of running a model in sgnsim format of a growing cell_population is shown in supplementary
