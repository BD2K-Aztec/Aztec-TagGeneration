data_and pihelper an open_source framework for drug_target and antibody target data motivation the interaction between drugs and their targets often proteins and between antibodies and their targets is important for planning and analyzing investigational and therapeutic_interventions in many biological_systems although drug_target and antibody target datasets are available in separate databases they are not publicly_available in an integrated bioinformatics resource as medical thera peutics especially in cancer increasingly uses targeted_drugs and measures their effects on biomolecular profiles there is an unmet need for a user_friendly toolset that allows researchers to comprehensively and conveniently access and query information about drugs antibodies and their targets summary the pihelper framework integrates human drug_target and antibody target associations from publicly_available resources to help meet the needs of researchers in systems pharmacology perturbation biology and proteomics pihelper has utilities to i import drug and antibody target information ii search the associations either pro grammatically or through a web user_interface ui iii visualize the data interactively in a network and iv export relationships for use in publications or other analysis tools availability pihelper is a free software under the gnu lesser general_public lgpl v source_code are at http bit ly pihelper we plan to coordinate contributions from the community by managing future releases contact in cancer_biology systems pharmacology and perturbation biology researchers designing targeted drug experiments often need to choose targeted_drugs and antibodies of interest for their experimental_studies for such studies drug and antibody target databases are valuable resources and are increasingly publicly_available in computable formats unfortunately this information is in separate databases that use mostly incompatible formats making_it to integrate data across different resources this coupled with strict constraints on distribution of the data hinders access to up to date integrated data here we describe an open_source framework pihelper for easy aggregation integration and visualization of drug and antibody target data from multiple sources pihelper provides a platform independent command_line to help users with minimal configuration import and export drug and antibodytarget information in a human and gene centric manner a java application_programming and a rest ful representational state transfer web_service to facilitate programmatic_access to the aggregated_data and a web_based ui to help users query data in a gene centric manner and export the results as an image or undirected binary network we believe pihelper will facilitate hypothesis_generation and design of new experiments by enabling researchers to access and query integrated drug_target and antibody target data from multiple resources in an automatic way
