structural_bioinformatics nmrfam sparky enhanced software for biomolecular nmr_spectroscopy sparky goddard and kneller sparky remains the most popular software_program for nmr_data analysis despite the fact that development of the package by its originators ceased in we have taken over the development of this package and describe nmrfam sparky which implements new functions reflecting advances in the biomolecular nmr field nmrfam sparky has been repackaged with current versions of python and tcl tk which support new tools for nmr peak simulation and graphical assignment determination these tools along with chemical_shift predictions from the pacsy database greatly accelerate protein side chain assignments nmrfam sparky supports automated data format interconversion for interfacing with a variety of web_servers including pecan pine talos n cs rosetta shiftx and ponderosa c s availability_and the software_package along with binary and source codes if desired can be downloaded freely from http pine nmrfam wisc edu download packages html instruction manuals and video tutorials can be found at http www nmrfam wisc edu nmrfam sparky distribution htm sparky https www cgl ucsf edu home sparky remains the most popular computer program for nmr operations such as peakpicking and peak assignment supplementary despite that fact that its originators have not released a new version since sparky sparky supports userdefined enhancements and we have used these to develop new tools in support of our packages for automated protein assignment and structure_determination the added features support i interfacing with servers offering new technologies ii tools for data visualization and verification and iii new protocols for maximizing the efficiency of nmr_data analysis we have refined these sparky enhancements through their use in our annual workshops by participants with varying experience in protein nmr_spectroscopy we describe here the new package which we have named nmrfamsparky
