mutations and effects of antiviral treatments to the more theoretical temporal characterization of the population in evolutionary_studies availability_and freely_available on the web atthe study of rna_virus populations is a challenging_task each population of rna_virus is composed of a collection of different yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispecies this genotypic_diversity is the result of the high mutation_rate of rna_viruses which surpasses that of dna organisms by orders_of this intrinsic high_error is largely attributed to the viral_rna dependent_rna that replicate their genomes recent_studies demonstrate that this high_error is essential for viral adaptation and survival and can have significant implications in vaccine and antiviral efficacy changes in the rate at which these errors occur may affect virus infectivity fitness and pathogenesis moreover it was shown that the diversity within an rna_virus population enhances tissue tropism and dissemination possibly by improving adaptability and mutual support these studies suggest that characterizing rna_virus populations as a whole rather than focusing on dominant viral haplotypes e g sequences shared by a significant amount of members in the population or consensus_sequence is far more informative to study pathogenesis currently rna_viruses are genetically characterized through a variety of techniques the most basic and common method involves classic sanger_sequencing of cdna produced by rt_pcr of total viral_rna i e consensus sequencing although informative the consensus_sequence is the genetic average of all variants within the virus population and the limitations of this method include its low_resolution and ability to detect only highly abundant variants to increase sensitivity and obtain a small representative_sample of viral_variants in a given population by sanger_sequencing individual viruses can be isolated and amplified biological clones or rt pcr_amplicons of the whole population can be subcloned into individual plasmids molecular clones an additional method is single_genome amplification in which viral_rna is extracted from a sample and copied into cdna which in turn is subjected to limiting_dilution and pcr_amplification thus the obtained pcr_products are the result of the amplification of one single_molecule of cdna these pcr_products are then sequenced directly without cloning nevertheless these three methods are time intensive and tedious furthermore the limited coverage that can be sampled generally clones and k nucleotides per population is far from the range of variants typically found in virus samples newer high_throughput hts technologies have expedited research in microbiology in general including virology due to their high_throughput sequence_data production the ultra deep coverage afforded by hts technologies provides obvious improvements to the characterization of rna_viruses however most hts tools in virology are designed for virus discovery de_novo of unknown viral_genomes and the characterization of viral biodiversity found in different organs organisms or environments virome more recently researchers have begun characterizing the intra host and intra strain virus diversity and population_dynamics for a variety of viruses of clinical or agricultural relevance for example some studies addressed the temporal evolution of variants the pre_existing presence of drug resistant_mutants and the dynamics and emergence of escape mutations in the presence of various types of pressure however virologists using hts technologies for the purpose of rare_variant detection face major_obstacles when studying virus population_dynamics both experimentally and in natural settings due to the relatively high_error of these technologies in order to overcome these hurdles several methods have been proposed these methods can be split into two main categories the first increases variant detection fidelity by modulating the library_preparation step schmitt et_al tag and compare both strands of a dna_segment efficiently pinpointing strand discordant variants as errors use unique identifiers for each sequenced template facilitating the identification of pcr and sequencing introduced errors and biases acevedo et_al used circularized genomic rna_fragments to generate tandem_repeats which originate from a single individual within the viral_population variants that appear in every copy of a set of repeats are then considered true variants the second category includes methods that utilize post sequencing parameters in order to identify pcr and sequencing introduced errors ghedin et_al utilize the calculated overall baseline error_rates while flaherty et_al and wilm et_al calculate these rates per sequenced base watson et_al apply a two step quality based filtration prior to variant_calling and macalalad et_al used covariation i e phasing between variants and an expectation_maximization based quality recalibration methods which aim to identify the genomes of individual haplotypes in the population utilize clustering of overlapping reads and haplotype reconstruction in order to correct for sequencing_errors the performance of these methods depends upon the length of sequence_reads with long_reads enabling the reconstruction of entire viral genome_sequences some methods also include an additional test for strand bias in order to further reduce false_positive calls although these second category methods demonstrate very high_specificity positions without variance are correctly_identified as such sensitivity pinpointing true variant positions remains the major_limiting all of the aforementioned tools focus on accurate variant detection and do not facilitate any downstream_analysis and interpretation of the detected variants moreover although the end_users for the aforementioned tools and methods are for the most part virologists studying highly_diverse viral_populations these tools require the use of unix command_line and other computational proficiencies which are not common in the field in order to better integrate and utilize hts technology in viral_population studies we developed a computational_pipeline and web_server termed vivan viral variance_analysis vivan is a complete pipeline to facilitate the identification characterization and comparison of sequence variance in deep sequenced virus populations vivan performs per sample allele rate analysis translates the detected changes into amino_acid changes compares and outputs several informative metrics regarding each analyzed sample applying vivan on deep sequenced data obtained from samples that were previously_characterized by more classical approaches we achieved superior sensitivity and uncovered novel and potentially crucial aspects of virus populations which could not have been identified otherwise and in much shorter time scales vivan efficiently identified low_frequency minority variants across the entire viral_genome and changes in population_diversity that correlate with in vitro and in vivo data of previously described mutator and antimutator strains of rna_viruses additionally it accurately_determined dosage dependent and drug specific alterations in mutation_frequency associated with mutagenic antiviral compounds more generally we monitored temporal changes occurring within rna_virus populations during experimental_evolution and pinpointed unique variable positions in viral_genomes found in specific host environments that are indicative of positive_selection and adaptation overall we show that vivan allows rapid characterization of the genetic_composition and population_dynamics of rapidly_evolving viral mutant spectra it is becoming increasingly clear that studying only the consensus_sequence of an rna_virus insufficiently summarizes the viral_population often increases in fitness and changes in adaptability are observed without changes in the consensus_sequence this hints that minority variants within the viral_population are responsible for this effect virus diversity represents a pool of randomly_generated minority variants available for adaptation and gradually amplified in frequency through selection only with the advent of hts has studying such minorities become feasible but we are missing standard validated tools to mine analyze and compare this information from multiple samples currently available tools require a high degree of computational savoir faire and for more detailed rna_virus population analysis the user must write additional scripts our computational_pipeline has several advantages over other methods we use a robust algorithm based on each variant alleles initial rate and read qualities to differentiate between sequencingintroduced errors and actual population variants facilitating accurate variant assessment even at extremely_low rates another advantage of the pipeline is the set of different outputs we provide for analysis temporal accumulation of variants found in viral_populations the total number of minority variants found in each cvb strain wild_type wt high_fidelity a v and low fidelity s t was calculated for each sequenced passage and replication cycles variation rates the average proportion of variant alleles across covered bases in the genome_sequence sem are shown from three biological_replicates p implementing our method on one of the cvb wild_type samples and recording the changes throughout the passages and the positions demonstrating the highest increase in variant allele rate was detected out of the top most changing positions only four were non structural one synonymous in the viral protease c one nonsynonymous in b and two nonsynonymous in the viral_polymerase d the polymerase variants were then recognized as variants already known to modulate viral_replication fidelity
