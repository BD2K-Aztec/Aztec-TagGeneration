structural_bioinformatics improving the detection of transmembrane barrel chains with n to extreme learning machines motivation transmembrane barrels tmbbs are extremely_important proteins that play_key several cell functions they cross the lipid_bilayer with barrel structures tmbbs are presently found in the outer_membranes of gram_negative and of mitochondria and chloroplasts loop exposure outside the bacterial cell_membranes makes tmbbs important targets for vaccine or drug_therapies in genomes they are not highly represented and are difficult to identify with experimental_approaches several computational_methods have been developed to discriminate tmbbs from other types of proteins however the best performing approaches have a high fraction of false_positive results in this article we introduce a new machine_learning approach for tmbb detection based on n to extreme learning machines that significantly_outperforms previous methods achieving a matthews correlation_coefficient of a probability of correct prediction of and a sensitivity of availability the method and the cross_validation sets are available at the web pagetransmembrane barrel tmbb proteins cross the lipid_bilayer with a series of strands arranged in a cylindrical geometry and forming a structure that resembles a barrel tmbbs can be membrane anchors or membrane_bound endowed with functions relevant to the entire cell_metabolism and including active ion_transport passive nutrient_intake and defense against attack proteins while all living_organisms have transmembrane_proteins organized into all helical bundles tmbbs are presently found in the outer_membranes of gram_negative mitochondria and chloroplasts tmbbs are estimated to be encoded by as many as of the genes in gramnegative bacteria however very few tmbb structures are available at atomic_resolution from gram_negative organismsseveral computational_methods have been developed to predict tmbbs from protein_sequences two prediction_problems can be addressed i the prediction of protein topology both strand localization along the protein_sequence and orientation of the loops with respect to the membrane plane and ii tmbb detection in genomes when the interest focuses on the prediction of the protein topology it has been shown that the best performing methods are based on hidden_markov or grammatical restrained hidden conditional_random the detection of tmmbs in a set of proteins as large as the whole_genome is more difficult due to the cryptic nature of the tmbb structure as compared with that of the all membrane_proteins computational_methods for tmbb detection can identify candidate_genes in order to perform experimental validations to address this task a wide_variety of algorithms has been developed including approaches based on sequence_homology detection machine_learning and physicochemical_properties of tmbbs in this article we tackle the problem of tmbb detection and significantly improve over existing algorithms taking_advantage of previous_works in particular we exploit the effort made byin generating a reliable dataset and defining a thorough comparison with previous methods furthermore we refine the approach of pollastri and co workers by incorporating their n to method in an extreme learning machine elm framework
