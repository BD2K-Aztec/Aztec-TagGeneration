sequence_analysis the prediction of organelle targeting peptides in eukaryotic_proteins with grammatical restrained hidden conditional_random motivation targeting peptides are the most important signal controlling the import of nuclear encoded_proteins into mitochondria and plastids in the lack of experimental information their prediction is an essential step when proteomes are annotated for inferring both the localization and the sequence of mature proteins results we developed tppred a new predictor of organelle targeting peptides based on grammatical restrained hidden conditional_random tppred is trained on a non redundant dataset of proteins where the presence of a target peptide was experimentally_validated comprising sequences when tested on the positive and some other negative_examples tppred outperformed available methods in both accuracy and matthews correlation index and respectively given its very lowfalse positive rate tppred is therefore well suited for large_scale analyses at the prote ome level we predicted that from to of the sequences of human arabidopsis_thaliana and yeast proteomes contain targeting peptides and are therefore likely to be localized in mitochondria and plastids tppred predictions correlate to a good extent with the experimental annotation of the subcellular_localization when available tppred was also trained and tested to predict the cleavage_site of the organelle targeting peptide on this task the average_error of tppred on mitochondrial and plastidic proteins is and residues respectively this value is lower than the error reported by other methods currently available mitochondria and plastids in plants are membrane enclosed organelles contained in eukaryotic_cells that take part into essential_biological including cell bioenergetics and metabolism following the endosymbiotic theory the dnacontaining organelles derive from free_living bacteria that have been incorporated into the cytoplasm of early eukaryotic_cells the organelles retain a small portion of their original genome encoding few tens and few hundreds proteins in mitochondria and plastids respectively however both experimental and computational_methods estimate that some thousands different proteins are located in organelles the last release of mitominer lists human proteins experimentally_characterized as mitochondrial with mass_spectrometry or with green_fluorescent tagging and the at chloro database lists arabidopsis_thaliana proteins annotated as chloroplastic on the basis of mass_spectrometry experiments most organellar proteins are therefore encoded by the nuclear_genome synthesized by the cytoplasmic ribosomes and then targeted to the organelles the most common although not unique type of targeting signal consists of an n_terminal sequence the targeting peptide often referred as pre sequence in mitochondria and transit_peptide in plastids the targeting peptide is cleaved when the native protein is translocated through the outer_membrane of the organelles by means of the translocon protein_complexes in multicellular_organisms it has been estimated that of nuclear genes_encode for proteins endowed with an n_terminal peptide targeting the protein to mitochondria and plastids targeting peptides are highly_heterogeneous in terms of length ranging from to residues and primary sequence phylogenetic and structural studies recognized a modular_architecture in targeting peptides often consisting of two or three separate domains potentially forming amphiphilic helices or strands when interacting with the organelle outer_membrane the modular_organization is probably involved in the sub organellar trafficking of proteins and gives origin to a great variety of primary sequences for targeting peptides in a small but increasing number of proteins the same targeting peptide can mediate the translocation to both the mitochondria and the chloroplasts presently in uniprotkb only of sequences that are endowed with a targeting peptide are supported by experimental annotations because of the biological_importance of targeting mechanisms and the scarcity of experimentally_validated knowledge machine_learning tools have been introduced to predict the presence of targeting peptides and the position of the corresponding cleavage_sites early methods are specific for chloroplasts e g chlorop and pclr and mithochondria e g mitoprot more recent tools integrate the prediction of targeting peptides with the prediction of secretory signal_peptides although they have different compositional and length features among these are targetp which incorporates chlorop ipsort predotar and predsl all methods predict the presence of the targeting peptide but only mitoprot targetp and predsl predict the position of the cleavage_site in general all the predictors analyse an n terminal_portion of the native protein ranging from to residues depending on the method chlorop targetp pclr and predotar are based on neural_networks nns and their input includes residue composition hydrophobicity and abundance of charged_residues ipsort adopts a rule_based algorithm that considers different propensity scales mitoprot defines a discriminant_function on a pool of physicochemical_properties predsl combines nns hidden_markov hmm and scoring_matrices because of the paucity of data all methods have been trained on datasets containing also non experimentally_validated targeting peptides predicted with computational_methods and or inferred by similarity prediction of targeting peptide can be considered as a labelling problem where residues of the n_terminal region of the sequence are assigned either to t targeting peptide or n non targeting peptide labels grammatical restrained hidden conditional_random grhcrf is a recently_introduced machinelearning tool well suited to solve labelling problems grhcrfs offer several advantages i like hmms they can incorporate previous_knowledge on the problem by introducing a grammar on the prediction labels ii like the hidden conditional_random hcrf they are discriminative models and do not require the strong independence assumptions made in hmms and iii similar to nns they can analyse complex and heterogeneous input encodings here we introduce tppred a new predictor for targeting peptides based on grhcrfs tppred is trained on a nonredundant dataset containing only experimentally_validated targeting peptides and efficiently predicts both the presence of targeting peptides and the localization of the cleavage_sites
