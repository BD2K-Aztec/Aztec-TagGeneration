detection of circular permutations within protein_structures using ce cp motivation circular permutation is an important type of protein rearrangement natural circular permutations have implications for protein_function stability and evolution artificial circular permutations have also been used for protein studies however such relationships are difficult to detect for many sequence and structure comparison algorithms and require special_consideration results we developed a new algorithm called combinatorial extension for circular permutations ce cp which allows the structural_comparison of circularly_permuted proteins ce cp was designed to be user_friendly and is integrated into the rcsb protein_data it was tested on two collections of circularly_permuted proteins pairwise_alignments can be visualized both in a desktop_application or on the web using jmol and exported to other programs in a variety of formats availability_and the ce cp algorithm can be accessed through the rcsb website atcircular permutation describes a relationship between two proteins where the n terminal_portion of one protein is related to the cterminal portion of the other while the order of amino_acids changes circularly_permuted proteins are generally found to assume the same structure circular permutation has been documented to naturally occur in a number of protein_families such as lectins and dna_methyltransferases two general mechanisms for the evolution of circularly_permuted proteins are known so detecting such events can shed light on the evolutionary_history of protein_families circular permutation can influence protein_folding dynamics and function synthetic circular permutants have been engineered to alter activity control regulation and improve stability natural circular permutants generally have quite low_sequence with previous_studies finding of proteins share identity thus including structural_information is essential for detecting circular permutations many structural alignment_algorithms are unable to detect rearrangements in sequence while general sequence_order independent methods lack a clear evolutionary_mechanism by which complex rearrangements could occur therefore algorithms that specifically search for circular permutations are needed several existing algorithms have been reported including sheba and cpsarst here we describe a method combinatorial extension with circular permutations ce cp for the identification of circular permutations based on protein_structure
