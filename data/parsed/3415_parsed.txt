genome_analysis panoga a web_server for identification of snp targeted pathways from genome_wide data genome_wide gwas have revolutionized the search for the variants underlying human complex_diseases however in a typical gwas only a minority of the single_nucleotide snps with the strongest_evidence of association is explained one possible reason of complex_diseases is the alterations in the activity of several biological_pathways here we present a web_server called pathway and network oriented gwas analysis to devise functionally_important pathways through the identification of snp targeted genes within these pathways the strength of our methodology stems from its multidimensional perspective where we combine evidence from the following five resources i genetic_association information obtained through gwas ii snp functional information iii proteinprotein_interaction iv linkage_disequilibrium and v biochemical_pathways availability panoga web_server is freely_available at http panoga sabanciuniv edu the source_code is available to academic users as is on request genome_wide gwas aim to discover a subset of single_nucleotide snps that are associated with the onset and progression of complex disease_phenotypes at a genome_wide scale these studies have produced extraordinary successes in the past_few with numerous new genetic_variants identified with levels of significance that were once thought impossible to reach standard gwas approaches focus on single snp analysis and hence it is difficult to incorporate weakly associated snps for multifactorial_diseases this incorporation is especially important because no particular variant on a particular gene may have a strong effect but the combination of the multiple_variants with small effects on the polygenic disease explains the overall susceptibility to disease in this regard pathway based_approaches to gwas in which prior_biological is integrated into association studies and sets of genes are analyzed simultaneously for association with a disease have been proposed recently because the analysis of single variants within isolated genes is not informative enough to explain the underlying_disease mechanisms another recent_trend to further mine gwas data is to integrate proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks following a systems_biology approach these methods evaluate the pairwise or collective effects of genetic_variants where the functional_consequence of each susceptibility allele may interfere with the interaction between pairs of proteins a few studies available to date on the identification of the molecular_interaction associated with the gwas genes indicated that this approach can help to discover formerly unknown mechanisms_underlying human_diseases at the molecular level to better understand the biological_processes underlying complex_diseases we also considered the functional effect of a typed snp in gwas although the dna_polymorphisms that change protein_function can have significant consequences other types of snps such as synonymous snps do not have such serious effects in disease development mechanism functionally_important snps such as those that change amino_acids splicing sites those that lead to gain or loss of stop_codon those that result in frame_shift and those that are found in regulatory_region are priority targets in disease studies and large_scale genotyping projects hence we decided that snp functional knowledge is valuable information to strengthen our pathway and network oriented gwas analysis panoga method to support the steps from snp functionalization into ppi network_analysis to functional enrichment in a single program we developed a web_server for post gwas analysis called panoga with its multifactorial basis panoga has a good potential to decipher the combination of biological_processes underlying_disease panoga has been tested on several complex_diseases including rheumatoid_arthritis bakir intracranial_aneurysm bakir epilepsy and behcets disease and proved to be to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com useful throughout the time the method has evolved with our efforts bakir this web_server presents the latest_version of panoga
