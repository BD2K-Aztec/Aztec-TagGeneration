cg aa backmapping protein coarse_grained structures coarse grain cg models allow long scale simulations with a much lower computational_cost than that of all atom simulations however the absence of atomistic detail impedes the analysis of specific atomic interactions that are determinant in most interesting biomolecular processes in order to study these phenomena it is necessary to reconstruct the atomistic structure from the cg representation this structure can be analyzed by itself or be used as an onset for atomistic_molecular in this work we present a computer program that accurately reconstructs the atomistic structure from a cg model for proteins using a simple geometrical algorithm availability_and the software is free and available online atin the context of molecular_dynamics mds coarse grain cg models define particles by grouping several atoms into one bead this process reduces the number of particles used to describe the system allowing longer scale either temporal spatial or both simulations in exchange of detail furthermore the possibility of reconstructing or backmapping the atomistic structure from the cg representation allows a multiscale approach although a perfect reconstruction is mathematically impossible approximate reconstructions can be obtained for instance in authors construct a complete backmap for the martini model this reconstruction is remarkably accurate for the protein_backbone and quite good on the side_chains the backmapping algorithm presented here was developed for the cg model developed in as in the martini force_field this model represents the backbone with one bead nevertheless this bead is located in the position of the c a atom instead of the center of mass of the residues backbone atoms the side_chains are modeled with one to four beads depending on the complexity of the aminoacid the backbone reconstruction scheme presented in this work can be applied to any model that represents the backbone with a bead at the c a of course side_chains reconstructions strongly depend on number and positions of the beads of each cg model but the same approach can be implemented in other models see supplementaryfor a martini cg model example we also include in our program a backmapping of a cg model for the heme_group which was obtained using a similar approach as the one used to obtain standard cg aminoacids in in summary this tool allows backmapping of cg structures in an accurate manner also due to the simplicity of the algorithm it can be easily expanded to other particular molecules or chemical_groups such as cofactors and ligands e g the heme_group we presented an intuitive portable fast free and easy to use method to map cg structures back to all atom representation we have tested it in several examples by changing protein_structures to cg representation and backmapping them examples were selected in order to test the algorithm for different secondary_structure and d structure complexity both the backbone and total reconstruction isin this example the backmapped structure is superimposed the original accurate except sometimes at the more flexible parts of the structure i e ends loops and long side_chains
