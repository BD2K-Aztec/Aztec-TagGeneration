systems_biology positive unlabeled learning for disease_gene background identifying disease genes from human_genome is an important but challenging_task in biomedical_research machine_learning can be applied to discover new disease genes based on the known ones existing machine_learning typically use the known disease genes as the positive training_set p and the unknown genes as the negative training_set n non disease gene_set does not exist to build classifiers to identify new disease genes from the unknown genes however such kind of classifiers is actually built from a noisy negative set n as there can be unknown disease genes in n itself as a result the classifiers do not perform as well as they could be result instead of treating the unknown genes as negative_examples in n we treat them as an unlabeled set u we design a novel positive unlabeled pu learning algorithm pudi pu learning for disease_gene to build a classifier using p and u we first partition u into four sets namely reliable negative set rn likely positive set lp likely negative set ln and weak negative set wn the weighted support_vector are then used to build a multi level classifier based on the four training_sets and positive training_set p to identify disease genes our experimental_results demonstrate that our proposed pudi algorithm outperformed the existing_methods significantly conclusion the proposed pudi algorithm is able to identify disease genes more accurately by treating the unknown data more appropriately as unlabeled set u instead of negative set n given that many machine learning_problems in biomedical_research do involve positive and unlabeled data instead of negative data it is possible that the machine_learning for these problems can be further improved by adopting pu learning methods as we have done here for disease_gene availability_and the executable program and data are available atuncovering the causative_genes for human_diseases has significant impact to healthcare since many medical_conditions are in some way influenced by human genetic_variations in recent_years an increasing number of genes have been confirmed as causative_genes to diseases this provides an invaluable resource for developing machine_learning to identify novel disease genes from the vast number of unknown genes in the genome using the confirmed disease genes as positive training examples recent_studies have revealed that genes associated with similar disorders have been shown to demonstrate higher probabilities of similar gene_expression high functional_similarities and physical_interactions between their gene_products as such those unknown genes that share similar gene_expression with the confirmed disease genes have high functional_similarities with disease genes and interact with disease gene_products are likely to be disease genes as well systematically integrated human mouse conserved similar expression_profiles with phenotype similarity map to rank potential disease genes in large_genomic kohlermade use of the observation that proteins caused by same similar disorders are likely attached together in proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network and applied the random_walk algorithm on the ppi_network for disease_gene more recently proposed a network propagation based method rwpcn on a novel protein complex network for prioritizing disease genes in the above two ppi_network based_approaches those unknown genes directly interact with one or multiple confirmed disease genes are likely to be predicted as candidate_disease note that the above methods only provide a gene rank list and a threshold is needed to decide whether a specific gene is disease related or not a more biologically_meaningful approach would be to build a binary_classification model that can automatically classify a gene as disease or not this requires identifying systematic_differences between disease genes positive class and non disease genes negative class lopezlopez bigas andinvestigated the distinguishing_features of protein_sequences between disease and non disease genes and found that compared to the products of non disease genes proteins involved in hereditary diseases tend to be long with more homologs with distant_species but fewer paralogs within human_genome further improved on this method by employing a decision_tree algorithm based on a variety of genomic and evolutionary features such as coding sequence_length evolutionary_conservation presence closeness of paralogs in the human_genome etc in addition to sequence_information proteins topological information in protein_interaction has also been shown to be useful for evaluating the likelihood that an unknown to whom correspondence should be addressed

ppi_networks such as proteins degree the percentage of disease genes in proteins neighborhood etc applied support_vector svms classifier using ppi topological_features sequence derived features evolutionary age features etc first built three individual svm classifiers using three types of features i e ppi_network protein_sequence and protein functional information respectively it then built a final classifier by combining the predictions from three individual classifiers for candidate_gene prediction the above works employed machine_learning to build a binary classifier by using the confirmed disease genes as positive training_set p and some unknown genes as negative training_set n however since the negative set n will contain unconfirmed disease genes false_negatives which confuses the machine_learning for building accurate classifiers as such the classifiers built based on the positive set p and noisy negative set n do not perform as well as they could in identifying new disease genes recently mordelet et_al proposed a bagging method prodige for disease gene prediction this method iteratively chooses random subsets rs from u and trains multiple classifiers using bias svm to discriminate p from each subset rs it then aggregates all the classifiers to generate the final classifier however as the random subsets rs from u could still contain unknown disease genes individual classifiers are thus not accurate and this will affect the overall performance of the final classifier in addition prodige method treats all the examples in rs u homogeneously since we can compute the similarities between the examples in u and the positive examples in p we can thus estimate the probabilities of the examples in u belonging to positive negative class as such the examples in u can be partitioned into different subsets and subsequently be treated heterogeneously for classifier building in this article we design a novel positive unlabeled pu learning algorithm pudi pu learning for disease_gene to build a more accurate classifier based on p and u first we use a comprehensive combination of biological_process molecular_function cellular_component protein domain and ppi data to represent the genes into feature_vectors we design a novel feature_selection method to reduce the dimensionality of the feature_vectors then we partition u into four label sets namely reliable negative set likely positive set likely negative set and weak negative set based on their likelihoods being positive negative class finally we build multi level weighted svms using these four sets together with positive set p for identifying disease genes to the best of our knowledge pudi is the first to design a novel multi level pu learning algorithm for building a classifier for disease_gene we have compared pudi with three state of the art techniques namely smalters method xus method and prodige method our experimental_results showed that pudi outperforms the existing_methods significantly for predicting general disease genes and for identifying disease genes in eight specific disease classes such as cardiovascular_diseases endocrine_diseases psychiatric_diseases metabolic_diseases and cancer etc in this section we present our experimental_results on the comparisons of our proposed pudi method with state of the art techniques on general disease genes prediction feature_selection parameter_sensitivity specific disease gene prediction and novel disease gene prediction
