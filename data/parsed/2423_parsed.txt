sequence_analysis in depth annotation of snps arising from resequencing projects using ngs snp ngs snp is a collection of command_line scripts for providing rich annotations for snps identified by the sequencing of whole genomes from any organism with reference_sequences in ensembl included among the annotations several of which are not available from any existing snp annotation tools are the results of detailed comparisons with orthologous sequences these comparisons can for example identify snps that affect conserved_residues or alter residues or genes linked to phenotypes in another species availability ngs snp is available both as a set of scripts and as a virtual_machine the virtual_machine consists of a linux operating system with all the ngs snp dependencies pre installed the source_code and virtual_machine are freely_available for download atthe latest sequencing instruments in conjunction with snp discovery tools can be used to identify huge numbers of putative snps whether the snps are discovered through genome or transcriptome_sequencing the next problem after identification is often annotating and choosing functionally_important snps here we describe a collection of scripts called ngs snp next_generation snp for performing in depth annotation of snps identified by popular snp discovery programs such as maq and samtools ngs snp can be applied to data from any organism with reference_sequences in ensembl and provides numerous annotation fields several of which are not available from other tools
