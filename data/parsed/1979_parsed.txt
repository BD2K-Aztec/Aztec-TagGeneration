generative probabilistic_models for protein_protein the biclique perspective motivation much of the large_scale molecular data from living_cells can be represented in terms of networks such networks occupy a central_position in cellular systems_biology in the protein_protein ppi_network nodes represent proteins and edges represent connections between them based on experimental_evidence as ppi_networks are rich and complex a mathematical_model is sought to capture their properties and shed light on ppi evolution the mathematical literature contains various generative_models of random_graphs it is a major still largely open question which of these models if any can properly reproduce various biologically_interesting networks here we consider this problem where the graph at hand is the ppi_network of saccharomyces_cerevisiae we are trying to distinguishing between a model family which performs a process of copying neighbors represented by the duplicationdivergence dd model and models which do not copy neighbors with the barabsialbert ba preferential attachment model as a leading example results the observed property of the network is the distribution of maximal bicliques in the graph this is a novel criterion to distinguish between models in this area it is particularly appropriate for this purpose since it reflects the graphs growth_pattern under either model this test clearly favors the dd model in particular for the ba model the vast_majority of the bicliques with both sides must be already embedded in the models seed graph whereas the corresponding figure for the dd model is only our results based on the biclique perspective conclusively show that a nave unmodified dd model can capture a key aspect of ppi_networks contact many real_life systems can be modeled as complex_networks or graphs of interacting components although the study of such largescale networks is not new there has recently been much renewed interest in this field this is due to technological_advances of two types i the collection of data which depict large_networks in high_resolution detail and ii the development of computational_tools for the analysis of data among the well studied examples of such networks are the world_wide citation networks neuronal connections metabolic_networks ecological webs and to whom correspondence should be addressed more for reviews see one of the best studied network types is the proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network protein interactions play_a in the execution of biological_functions in any model system accordingly a systematic mapping of ppi on the scale of the whole proteomethe interactomehas recently become available for major model systems from yeast to human although far from complete ppi_network mappings have revealed topological and dynamic_features of the interactome that are common to numerous model systems however the overall size of interactomes differs substantially between human and other multicellular model_organisms including the drosophila_melanogaster and the caenorhabditis_elegans ppis are usually represented by an undirected graph network every node in such a network corresponds to a protein and there is an edge between two nodes if the two corresponding proteins interact physically such networks have been mapped for several organisms using high_throughput htp techniques such as yeast hyrbid y h systems and co immunoprecipitation htp techniques are prone to a high rate of false_positives saccharomyces_cerevisiae bakers yeast is the organism with the most comprehensive high coverage interactome mapping other ppi_networks such as those of escherichia_coli and helicobacter_pylori were investigated as well but they are far from being complete the ppi_networks of human drosophila_melanogaster and caenorhabditis_elegans are more complex due to their multicellular nature specifically interactomes are harder to define as they vary between different cell_types and subsequently harder to map the ppi_network of yeast was refined over the years followed by a critical assessment of data_quality chua while the topology of the partial ppi_network obtained from each of the main technologies is different the combination of ppi data from such complementary experimental_technologies resulted in a near complete map for most organisms the interaction data are still partial and thus topological assessment of these networks is prone to sampling_biases it is not obvious how to infer direct pairwise interactions from htp techniques that focus on protein_complexes i e co immunoprecipitation this is especially challenging when complexes of several proteins are considered to document andpage i i i the proper modeling of ppi_networks is a major_challenge from two perspectives the theoreticalmathematical and the biological one in the search for the best model to explain experimental_data one should be aware of several pitfalls originating in the methodology or in the data itself a key source of difficulty is the quality of available data in particular ppi data originate from several different sources of varying levels of quality and reliability the systematic curation of such data provides at least a partial remedy much of the yeast ppi_network information originates from y h experiments this method suffers from a high false_positive however with advances in experimental_design consistently contaminating proteins are more easily eliminated thus the quantity quality and reliability of ppi_networks have drastically improved in addition large_scale co immunoprecipitation experiments allow the incorporation of labile protein interactions into ppi_networks to test the validity of our conclusions we have repeated the described protocol by omitting the y h data leaving of the data mainly extracted from co immunoprecipitation experiments and from x_ray and stable_isotope by amino_acids silac based tandem_affinity tap technologies this subset shows essentially the same results we use the distribution of maximal bicliques in a graph as a yardstick against which to compare different generative_models of graphs we have investigated the ppi_network of s cerevisiae it transpires that the graphs generated by the dd model are in much better agreement with the actual network than those generated by the ba model clearly both models can be expanded and refined in various ways and we have restricted ourselves to the basic versions of either model in addition other models may also be suggested indeed other closely_related models have also been shown to give rise to many large bicliques still we believe that our findings are rather indicative of the general picture in conclusion we have suggested a new perspective on the question of ppi_network modeling the distribution of maximal bicliques is not only an intuitive method to distinguish between models but also effective and decisive our results based on the biclique perspective conclusively show the ability of the dd model to capture a key essence of ppi_networks
