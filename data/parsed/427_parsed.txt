sequence_analysis a poor man's blastx high_throughput metagenomic protein database_search using pauda in the context of metagenomics we introduce a new approach to protein database_search called pauda which runs times_faster than blastx while achieving about one third of the assignment rate of reads to kegg orthology groups and producing gene and taxon abundance profiles that are highly_correlated to those obtained with blastx pauda requires cpu hours to analyze a dataset of million illumina dna_reads from permafrost soil for which a previous blastx analysis on a subset of million_reads reportedly required cpu hours leading to the same clustering of samples by functional profiles availability pauda is freely_available from http ab inf uni tuebin gen de software pauda also supplementary method details are available from this website
