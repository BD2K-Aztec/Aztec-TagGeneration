systems_biology genssi a software toolbox for structural identifiability analysis of biological_models mathematical_modeling has a key role in systems_biology model_building is often regarded as an iterative loop involving several tasks among which the estimation of unknown_parameters of the model from a certain set of experimental_data is of central importance this problem of parameter_estimation has many possible pitfalls and modelers should be very careful to avoid them many of such difficulties arise from a fundamental yet often overlooked property the so_called structural or a priori identifiability which considers the uniqueness of the estimated parameters obviously the structural identifiability of any tentative model should be checked at the beginning of the model_building loop however checking this property for arbitrary non linear dynamic_models is not an easy task here we present a software toolbox genssi generating series for testing structural identifiability which enables non expert users to carry out such analysis the toolbox runs under the popular matlab environment and is accompanied by detailed documentation and relevant examples availability the genssi toolbox and the related documentation are available atmathematical modeling can be regarded as the central element in computational_systems the process of developing a model involves several tasks among which the estimation of unknown_parameters of the model from a certain set of experimental_data is of key importance this problem of parameter_estimation also known as the inverse_problem has many possible pitfalls and modelers should be very careful to avoid them many of such pitfalls arise from a fundamental yet often overlooked property of this inverse_problem the so_called structural or a priori identifiability srinath and gunawan global identifiability considers the issue of uniquely estimating all the free_parameters of a model from data if a model is non identifiable then the estimated parameters will lead irrespective of the applied method to artifacts in the model calibration and errors in subsequent model_predictions thus there is a fundamental need of reliable_methods and toolshere we present a software toolbox genssi which can be used to test the structural identifiability of arbitrary non linear dynamical_models of biological_systems i e described by sets of non linear ordinary_differential in case of detection of nonidentifiability for a given model this toolbox can also be used to determine which subsets parameters can be identified or at least locally identified therefore guiding in the reformulation of the model when needed genssi is cross_platform using the matlab computing environment available in most operating_systems and is easy to use not requiring high_level programming or advanced mathematical skills from users
