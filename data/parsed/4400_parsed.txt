gene_expression stage prediction of embryonic_stem cell_differentiation from genome_wide expression data motivation the developmental_stage of a cell can be determined by cellular_morphology or various other observable indicators such classical markers could be complemented with modern surrogates like whole_genome transcription profiles that can encode the state of the entire organism and provide increased quantitative resolution recent findings_suggest that such profiles provide sufficient information to reliably_predict the cells developmental_stage results we use whole_genome transcription data and several data projection methods to infer differentiation_stage prediction_models for embryonic_cells given a transcription profile of an uncharacterized cell these models can then predict its developmental_stage in a series of experiments comprising datasets from the gene_expression we demonstrate that the approach is robust and has excellent prediction ability both within a specific cell_line and across different cell_lines availability model inference and computational evaluation procedures in the form of python scripts and accompanying datasets are available atembryonic stem_cells escs and other pluripotent cell_types are increasingly being studied for their potential therapeutic use in regenerative_medicine escs are isolated from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst they replicate indefinitely maintaining pluripotent characteristics and may differentiate in vitro to most of the somatic cell_types present in the adult in the early_stages of mammal differentiation the inner cell mass undergoes gastrulation in this process three specific germ layersmesoderm endoderm and ectodermare formed these layers ultimately give rise to specific tissues and organs while the stages of esc differentiation into a specific cell_type have been broadly identified numerous aspects of this process remain_unknown or difficult_to differentiation is a complex multiple_steps process that presents a non linear progression within a cell_population the stem status is not lost immediately but it gradually decreases this is true particularly at the very beginning when differentiation is induced e g either by an internal or external signal and cells own a heterogeneous status of differentiation being a mixture of diverse developmental_stages escs as well as embryonic carcinoma and induced_pluripotent own common and specific molecular_signatures that define their pluripotent status when differentiation is induced this molecular_signature is gradually lost in favor of one that defines a more differentiated type of cellular identity demonstrated that this cellular transition is due to a large number of transcription_factors whose expression changes across different hematopoietic states other recent_studies of various developmental_processes have shown that they are governed by transcriptional_programs in which genes are regulated in successive waves of transcriptions that mark the stages of differentiation page the predictive_accuracy of inferred models is very high when they are applied to data from the same cell_lines as used in the training_set tables and the reasonable range of c scores is from random predictor to perfect prediction the majority of c scores for the described methods are close to a very high score indicating an excellent_quality of predictions the only notable_exception is dataset gds where all methods achieved lower scores this is not surprising as gds is substantially different from the other datasets both in the type of cells and the processesobserved pca and mce were here the only two methods that obtained reasonably good results we can conclude that predicting the stage of development from transcriptional_profiles is feasible and that the resulting prediction_models can accurately_predict developmental_stages within a chosen cell_line the results of external_validation are also interesting observed that the trajectories obtained from cells of different cell_lines diverged to a large extent we therefore expected that the predictions of models developed on one cell_line would fail when applied to data from another cell_line results on our selection of datasets from geo refute this expectation and demonstrate that the tested predictive_models can be applied across different cell_lines in addition external_validation on datasets from aiba et_al is also qualitatively_similar showing that prediction across different cell_lines is indeed feasible and may be highly_accurate the scores we have obtained are surprisingly high with only four and out of the results for all possible pairs of datasets shown in the supplementary_material confirm the high_accuracy of predictions even for data coming from different studies poor predictions were obtained only for training and test data from different species utility of stage prediction_models across different cell_lines was further confirmed in ipscs and mef experiments projection of related transcription profiles on a pca inferred differentiation scale highlighted the difference in pluripotency between the adult cells and the reprogrammed cell_line among the tested methods the differences in predictive quality were not statistically_significant pca mce pls and svmrank are all time efficient and construct corresponding models for the datasets in our study within seconds pathrecon can be very slow with execution times of several hours or even days for datasets where construction of a pq tree and examination of all candidate orderings is required pls and svmrank are supervised and may focus too much on optimizing their respective goals for example while expression_profiles taken after and h might be very similar supervised algorithms will still try to separate the projections because they know the samples come from different time points while pathrecon is unsupervised it only orders samples and does not provide a model for projection mce can be used for projection but does not provide an explicit model for staging of new samples at the present stage of evaluation we thus prefer the pca because of its simplicity explicit prediction model and the added benefit of its informative differentiation scales the staging is easy to interpret by biologists and the visualization uncovers the dynamics of the changes with phenotypically different stages being placed farther apart on the differentiation scale as its non linear counterpart mce looks very promising and should be considered along pca in further studies of this kind we have noticed some fluctuations of performance of several methods on different datasets the differences could be arbitrary or related to specific types of patterns hidden in the data that a particular method can or cannot detect this issue could be further studied once more datasets of the kind examined in this article will become available developmental_biology is in need of devices that would accurately assess the progression of cells through development and predict the developmental_stages of cells observed under different physiological_conditions we have proposed and investigated the utility of approaches that can make such predictions experiments show that the differentiation_stage prediction_models inferred from transcription profiles are feasible have high_accuracy and that their results can be nicely mapped to simple d differentiation scales
