extensive complementarity between gene_function methods downloaded from motivation the number of sequenced_genomes rises steadily but we still lack the knowledge about the biological_roles of many genes automated function prediction afp is thus a necessity we hypothesize that afp approaches which draw on distinct genome features may be useful for predicting different types of gene_functions motivating a systematic analysis of the benefits gained by obtaining and integrating such predictions results our pipeline amalgamates genes from genomes in a single massive analysis that evaluates five established genomic afp methodologies while gene_ontology yielded reliable predictions the majority of these functions were accessible to only one or two of the methods moreover different methods tend to assign a go term to non overlapping sets of genes thus inferences made by diverse afp methods display a striking complementary both gene wise and function wise because of this a viable integration strategy is to rely on a single most confident prediction per gene function instead of enforcing agreement across multiple afp methods using an information_theoretic approach we estimate that current databases contain bits gene of known e coli gene_functions this can be increased by up to bits gene using individual afp methods or by additional bits gene upon integration thereby providing a highly ranking predictor on the cafa community benchmark availability of more sequenced_genomes boosts the predictive_accuracy of afp approaches and also the benefit from integrating them even though the number of sequenced_genomes rises steadily we still lack the knowledge about the biological_roles of many genes gene function may be determined_experimentally for instance by observing a phenotype of a mutant organism with an altered or deleted gene of interest allowing curators to annotate the gene with gene_ontology go terms or with other controlled_vocabularies experimental essays coupled to manual_curation result in high_quality function assignments but are costly time consuming and cannot keep up with the deluge of new genome_sequences reliable automated function prediction afp methods are therefore of key importance for functional_annotation of newly_sequenced and metagenomes the most common approach to afp is transferring functions from homologs genes with shared_ancestry estimated by sequence_similarity using blast or other tools in addition to homology there exist many afp methods that exploit additional information extracted from the genome_sequence e g conserved gene neighborhoods phylogenetic distribution protein motifs and biophysical_properties codon_usage biases remote homology and composition of protein_domains moreover inference using genomic_information can be further supplemented by experimental_data gene_expression protein_protein or protein_structure and also by text_mining the scientific_literature combining diverse afp models leads to higher accuracy this was made evident in the analyses of gene protein functional association networks constructed using various sources of large_scale data integrating the individual networks resulted in gene_modules that were more functionally consistent and could thus more accurately_predict gene function or phenotypic_effects of gene perturbation one explanation for the benefits of integration is that random error from individual data_sources cancels out enabling the signal of gene function to surface in addition different sources of genomic or experimental_data may be intrinsically better suited for predicting some gene_functions than for others for instance physical protein_protein more directly correspond to the cellular_component domain of the go while genetic_interaction experiments relate to the biological_process go domain such rules may however also extend to the deeper more informative levels of the go a known example is the contrast between ribosomal_proteins and membrane_proteins in yeast where the former are predictable from gene coexpression while in the latter case protein compositional features are more relevant more generally assigning function specific weights to integrated gene_networks inferred from biological_experiments improves afp accuracy thus different highthroughput experimental assays appear to be better suited for predicting different aspects of a genes role in the cell given that afp methods often draw on analysis of genome_sequences to predict gene function it is thus important to systematically characterize the benefits to combining genomic methods we therefore investigate to what extent five well known sequencebased methodologies differ in their ability to assign particular gene_functions across many organisms one known example are stress_response genes where phylogenetic profiling was shown to be accurate for heat osmotic and dna_damage responses but codon_usage biases were superior for starvation and oxidative_stresses we search for broader trends of this sort by examining the overlap and complementarity between purely genome based afp methods an advantage of these approaches is that they apply to any organism with a genome_sequence of sufficient quality and do not require costly_and large_scale experimentation that is restricted to a handful of model_organisms relying exclusively on genomic_data enabled us to perform afp on a massive scale considering bacterial and archaeal genomes with million genes in a single analysis assigning different go functions since the amount of sequenced_genomes will continue to rise rapidly there is a need to characterize the contribution of various genomic afp methodologies towards resolving particular functions of poorly described genes crucially we investigate to what extent the methods will benefit from future availability of more genomes using information_theoretic measures we quantify the current knowledge on gene function in model microorganisms and suggest that common afp methods applied to the already available genome_sequences can provide very high_confidence predictions that increase this knowledge by at least the results of our analysis provide guidelines to researchers on how to best integrate predictions of diverse afp methods in particular one simple but surprisingly accurate strategy is to rely on a single most confident prediction for a given gene and function thus best exploiting the complementarity between individual genomic predictors
