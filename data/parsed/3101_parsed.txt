structural_bioinformatics mp t improving membrane_protein alignment for structure_prediction motivation membrane_proteins are clinically_relevant yet their crystal_structures are rare models of membrane_proteins are typically built from template structures with low sequence_identity to the target_sequence using a sequence structure alignment as a blueprint this alignment is usually made with programs designed for use on soluble_proteins biological_membranes have layers of varying hydrophobicity and membrane_proteins have different amino_acid preferences from their soluble counterparts here we include these factors into an alignment_method to improve alignments and consequently improve membrane_protein models results we developed membrane_protein threader mp t a sequence structure alignment_tool for membrane_proteins based on multiple_sequence alignment_accuracy is tested against seven other alignment_methods over non redundant alignments of membrane_proteins mp t produces more accurate alignments than all other methods tested f m from to alignments generated by mp t also lead to significantly better models than those of the best alternative alignment_tool one fourth of models see an increase in gdt ts of availability all source_code alignments and models are available atthere are only unique membrane_protein crystal_structures http www blanco biomol uci edu mpstruc for comparison in july there were unique crystal_structures in the protein_data this disparity is not due to importance the location of membrane_proteins on the surface of cells and their involvement in signalling_pathways make them targets for approximately one half of current and future drugs the disparity arises because membrane_proteins are inherently hard to crystallizethe hydrophilic conditions required for crystallization are often incompatible with the hydrophobic conditions in which a membrane_protein assumes its native_structure in the absence of crystal_structures a model of a target_sequence may be built using as a template a related protein of known structure homology_modelling conceptually homology_modelling can be divided_into three phases i identifying a template fold_recognition ii aligning the residues of the target on to the template structure iii completion of the model implicit from this alignment e g by modelling missing loops many methods perform fold_recognition and alignment simultaneously in this work we maintain a distinction and focus solely on alignment alignment_methods differ in how they use information about protein_structure and sequence sequence_information is derived from a set of sequences that are homologous to the target and template these sequences are often combined into a profile structure information is commonly incorporated either by the use of statistical_potentials e g or by annotation of the template sequence e g with secondary_structure strings the alignment of membrane_proteins presents_unique most soluble_proteins are globular with a hydrophilic surface whereas membrane_proteins possess neither of these properties alignment_methods incorporating statistical_potentials derived from soluble_proteins are thus expected to perform poorly on membrane_proteins at least two such methods pgenthreader and sparks x recognize this and filter transmembrane sections from their results alignment_methods that annotate a template include hhsearch and promals these align pairs of profiles that are annotated with secondary_structure strings promals may also be used as a homology extension method in this approach a multiple_sequence msa is performed but with each sequence replaced by a profile most msa methods such as mafft msaprobs and t coffee do not use any structure information but instead derive their accuracy from a consistency criterion and or iterative_optimization consistency based_approaches aim to generate a msa that accords best with a library of pairwise_alignments between the sequences being aligned a small number of alignment_methods have been designed specifically for membrane_proteins the alignme program has been developed to study leut fold transporters praline tm and tm coffee are homology extension multiple profile alignment_methods that have been found to perform well on alignments of transmembrane_proteins from the balibase benchmark neither method uses secondary_structure to aid alignment but to whom correspondence should be addressed praline tm uses different scoring in regions annotated as being transmembrane owing to the scarcity of known structures the best template for a membrane protein_sequence is likely to have extremely_low sequence identitypotentially beneath the twilight zone fortunately even at this low_level of sequence_identity accurate alignment may be possible as biological_membranes have a sandwich structure with a hydrophobic middle lipid tail layer and hydrophilic edges lipid head layer these differing hydrophobicities constrain the amino_acids likely to be found in each environment in previous work we demonstrated that environment specific substitution tables improved the pairwise_alignment of membrane_proteins here we incorporate these tables into a consistency based msa program membrane_protein threader mp t the evolutionary_information provided by homologous_sequences greatly_increases alignment_accuracy at low sequence_identities compared with pairwise_alignments our approach involves no sequence weighting or iterative refinement and yet it is as accurate as leading profileprofile aligners such as hhsearch and promals while introducing fewer misaligned pairs of residues mp t leads to models with significantly_higher gdt ts than the best alternative alignment_method testedone fourth of models see an increase in gdt ts of at least we have created a program mp t to perform sequence to structure alignment for the homology_modelling of membrane_proteins tested on a set of diverse structure alignments mp t is found to introduce the fewest misaligned residues high f m while aligning as accurately as the state of the art methods hhsearch and promals mp t performs particularly well on longer membrane_proteins a category that includes drug_targets such as gpcrs and ion_channels and in the twilight zone sequence_identity the accuracy of mp t is derived from its effective use of information about accessible_surface membrane positioning and secondary_structure this information is obtained from the template structure and used to make predictions about the same properties of homologous_sequences gap penalties and substitution scores are adjusted on a per residue basis depending on this informationfor example the creation of gaps in the middle of the membrane is discouraged and substitutions within a helix are scored according to the propensity for an amino_acid type to be in a helix choice of homologues is found to be the single greatest factor_affecting alignment_accuracy for our method selecting homologues to favour sequences that are more closely_related to the target and template leads to substantially less accurate alignments than random_selection it is likely that improvements in accuracy can be gained by further refining the selection process for example by loosening cut_offs if too few sequences are returned in agreement with previous_studies we find that guide_tree construction does not strongly_affect alignment_accuracy however the general trend is that single_linkage clustering is a better method for building guide trees than neighbour_joining bionj or upgma we perform no sequence weighting no iterative refinement and use a simpler consistency criterion than those used in leading multiple sequence aligners such as msaprobs despite this the use of environment aware gap penalties and substitution tables allows us to produce more accurate_models of transmembrane_domains than other methods tested incorporation of environment awareness into a more sophisticated aligner may yield even larger improvements in the quality of membrane_protein models
