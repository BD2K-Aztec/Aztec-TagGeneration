structural_bioinformatics fish finder a high_throughput tool for analyzing fish images motivation fluorescence_in fish is used to study the organization and the positioning of specific dna_sequences within the cell_nucleus analyzing the data from fish images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity automated fish image_analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis while several fish image_analysis software_tools have been developed they often use a threshold based segmentation_algorithm for nucleus segmentation as fluorescence signal_intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment from cell to cell and within a cell threshold based_segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image_analysis leading to additional manual_segmentation and potential subjective bias to overcome these problems we developed a graphical software_tool called fish finder to automatically analyze fish images that vary significantly by posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification_problem compound bayesian_classifier is employed so that contextual_information is utilized resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction this makes it possible to analyze fish images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input_parameters additionally fish finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained fish probes availability fish finder is a standalone matlab application and platform independent software the program is freely_available from fluorescence_in fish is a technique used to visualize the location of specific dna_sequences within the nucleus fish incorporates fluorescently_labeled probes that bind only to the segment of the genome with which they have a high degree of sequence_similarity thus fish provides a way to visually locate a gene within the nucleus using fluorescence_microscopy the process of manual data_acquisition is time consuming and subjective due to inconsistency of an investigators decisions therefore to achieve high_throughput and objectivity the method of data_acquisition to whom correspondence should be addressed should be standardized as well as automated so less manual work is required from the investigator and data are objectively acquired one simple automated approach to extracting a cell from the background is achieved by setting a threshold value above the background level of fluorescent light_intensity all pixels with light_intensity values higher than the threshold are considered as part of the valid nucleus while pixels with light_intensity lower than the threshold are excluded as background_noise another similar approach is to set a fixed signal_to which incorporates a fixed threshold in order to isolate and extract the valid nuclear boundary when cells contain relatively homogenous diamidino_phenylindole dapi fluorescence signal_intensities and have sufficient contrast relative to the background these fixed threshold based_methods often produce biologically_meaningful however fluorescent light_intensity values vary_greatly between experiments and cell_nuclei because artifactual fluorescence and cytological debris are usually present in fish experiments as well as the fact that cells have inherent biological_variations in shape size and other properties due to non uniform intensities found within cells as well as in the background of fish images fixed threshold based segmentation_methods have inherent_limitations as a result common thresholdbased methods used by existing software programs often require manual modification from one sample to the next within the same experiment moreover other advanced segmentation_methods such as dynamic_programming dp or pattern_recognition require user_interaction and or training data for producing optimum output to overcome_these we have developed a highly automated graphical_user software_tool called fish finder which is specifically_designed to analyze fish images effectively and objectively the main contributions of fish finder are i it segments fluorescently stained nuclei automatically using a statistical approach_called compound bayesian_classifier to achieve contextual classification and segmentation using this method fish finder produced highly satisfactory_results of radial positioning analysis in the study of subnuclear organization for seven genes ii fish finder automatically identifies up to two fish signals per fluorescent channel and will compute the shortest distance from fluorescent signals to the nuclear boundary or to other fluorescent signals using the euclidean metric fish finder allows for selection of up to different fluorescent_signal channels to be processed iii processed images can be opened for editing or re editing i e add or remove fish signals removepage to evaluate the performance of our adaptive threshold method of segmentation in comparison with a fixed threshold method we compared fish finder with nemo we tested both fish finder and nemo using fish images containing nuclei from a fish experiment in which nuclei from mouse_embryonic escs were stained with dapi and a single bacterial_artificial bac derived probe was hybridized to its complimentary dna_sequence withinnuclei fish images were acquired using applied precisions delta vision fluorescent light_microscope producing images in the dv format fish finder and nemo were both tested on a desktop computer running windows vista operating system with an intel core quad ghz processor the analysis of each program was conducted using default input_parameters and settings this comparison demonstrates nemos inability to accurately segment nuclear boundaries in all tested images in contrast to fish finders high_efficiency and accuracy of nuclei segmentation to compare the performance of fish finder and nemo we examined the unedited results of segmentation analysis from each program for the following categories nuclei identification i e percentages of nuclei that are precisely identified as valid nuclei to be further analyzed nuclei accurately segmented i e percentages of nuclei with boundaries accurately segmented and not over or underestimated nuclei overestimated i e percentage of nuclei with segmented boundaries larger than actual boundaries determined by eye nuclei underestimated i e percentage of nuclei with segmented boundaries smaller than actual nuclear boundaries determined by eye nuclei ignored i e percentage of nuclei that were not identified as valid nuclei to be analyzed and nuclei adjoined i e percentage of nuclei with adjoining segmented boundaries using the same test image_set we also compared the results of accurate fish signal identification and rate of false_positive fish signal identification nuclei overestimated and nuclei adjoined additionally the time required for analysis by fish finder was significantly less than that of nemo where processing with fish finder took min compared with days with nemo we next compared the edited results of fish finders analysis to the results of manual_analysis of radial positioning results from testing nemo with the image_set did not produce enough valid data_points in order to fairly quantify and compare graphically in order to produce valid data to compare nemo would require optimization of input_parameters for each individual fish image in contrast to fish finder which does not require user_defined input_parameters for automatic_segmentation analysis using applied precisions softworx program manual_analysis was conducted by measuring distance of each signal to the nuclear boundary as well as measuring the average diameter as judged by eye the peripheral distances are then computed as a ratio of the average radius for each nucleus to determine the radial distribution of a target locus being studied shows the cumulative distribution of radial ratios of fish finder results and manual_analysis revealing a close correspondence for our analysis we were unable to fairly compare nemos results of image_analysis due to the high percentage of inaccurately segmented nuclei as well as the high rate of false signal identification present in the processed image results in addition to radial position analysis fish finder will also compute the shortest distance between fish signals of alternate fluorescent staining to compare fish finders analysis of inter probe distances to manual measurements we analyzed twodetermined the distances between loci preserving organizational trends observed by manual data_collection fish finder was developed using fish images_acquired from experiments on escs from the species mus_musculus which has an unusual distribution of heterogeneously compacted dna revealing regions of dense and loose compacted dna when stained with dapi in fact fish finder was used to objectively analyze fish experiments in a study of the effects of the histone_methyltransferase g a on the subnuclear position of seven genes to confirm fish finders potential for application to othercell types or species as well as d and d fish_analysis here we show in all cases nuclei segmented accurately to the edge of dapi_staining for d fixed chinese_hamster cho_cells d fixed c mouse fibroblasts cells d fixed human lymphoblast cells with acute_lymphoblastic all and d fixed mouse_escs we have also attempted to systematically compare fish finder with a tool proposed by since this tool was designed to analyze images collected at lower magnification containing a high_density of aggregated cells whereas fish finder was designed to analyze well separated cells at higher magnification page fish finder is an important analysis tool capable of automatically extracting nuclear boundaries via compound bayesian_classifier localizing fish signals and saving data in the cvs format for future reference significantly enhancing investigators ability to verify data consequently fish finder minimizes errors due to manual fish_analysis by reducing the cognitive bias of an investigators judgmental process more importantly fish finder is a highly_efficient user_friendly software_tool capable of high_throughput fish image_analysis the functionality of fish finder can be enhanced and extended in several ways for example it can be generalized to segment cell_nuclei in three dimensions one way is to segment the images in a z stack one by one the resulting segmentation can then be combined into d models of nuclei by interpolating signed distance functions to the segmented nuclear boundaries with d models the distance from fish probes to the nuclear boundary in the d space can be computed leading to biologically more accurate results while most biologists prefer using familiar tools for the analysis common analysis tools can be readily incorporated into fish finder itself additionally fish finder can be modified and adapted to analyze other fluorescent_signal types such as chromosome_territories or identification of doublets and singlets for replication_timing analysis or identification of more than two fish signals for evaluating aneuploidy we have included a new issues tab on the program download web_page where users can start a forum for problems or suggestions while fish finder produces satisfactory_results on all datasets we have used it is based on a discriminative model even though it is more robust and accurate than some other systems by employing a contextual classifier via compound bayesian_classifier a fundamentally different approach is to adopt a generative modelbased approach e g that is a model that can explain the observed pixel patterns one such a model would be a parametric description of each nucleus and the number of nuclei in an image for example for the image shown in an ideal result would consist of five nuclei with different shapes intrinsic advantages of a generative_model would allow d measurements within a nucleus as well as modeling of interactions among nuclei leading to more accurate results even when multiple nuclei are very close to each other this is being investigated
