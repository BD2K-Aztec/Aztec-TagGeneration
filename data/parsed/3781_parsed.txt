sequence_analysis psicov precise structural contact_prediction using sparse inverse covariance estimation on large multiple_sequence motivation the accurate prediction of residueresidue contacts critical for maintaining the native_fold of a protein remains_an in the field of structural_bioinformatics interest in this long_standing problem has increased recently with algorithmic improvements and the rapid_growth in the sizes of sequence families progress could have major impacts in both structure and function prediction to name but two benefits sequence_based contact predictions are usually made by identifying correlated_mutations within multiple_sequence msas most commonly through the information_theoretic approach of calculating mutual_information between pairs of sites in proteins these predictions are often inaccurate because the true covariation signal in the msa is often masked by biases from many ancillary indirect coupling or phylogenetic effects here we present a novel method psicov which introduces the use of sparse inverse covariance estimation to the problem of protein contact_prediction our method builds on work which had previously demonstrated corrections for phylogenetic and entropic correlation noise and allows accurate discrimination of direct from indirectly coupled mutation correlations in the msa results psicov displays a mean precision substantially better than the best performing normalized_mutual approach and bayesian_networks for out of targets the l i e top l predictions for a protein of length l precision for long_range sequence separation was which represents an improvement sufficient to be of significant benefit in protein_structure or model_quality availability the psicov source_code can be downloaded fromresidueresidue contacts are known to play_critical maintaining the native_fold of proteins and guiding protein_folding such residue_contacts are usually well to whom correspondence should be addressed separated with regards to the primary sequence but display close_proximity within the d structure although different geometric criteria for defining contacts have been given in the literature typically contacts are regarded as those pairs of residues where the c atoms approach within of one another c in the case of glycine it has long been observed that with sufficient correct information about a proteins residueresidue contacts it is possible to elucidate the fold of the protein however accurate prediction of intrachain residueresidue contacts from sequence_data alone remains_an a solution would yield benefits for a range of endeavours including fold_recognition ab_initio d model_quality and de_novo protein design the majority of successful_approaches for contact_prediction attempt to extract contact_information from the content of a multiple_sequence msa usually through the simple identification of correlated_mutations or by calculating the mutual_information mi between columns in the msa the underlying rationale rests on the fact that any given contact critical for maintaining the fold of a protein will constrain the physicochemical_properties of the amino_acids involved should a given contacting residue mutate and potentially perturb the properties of the contact then its contacting partner will be more likely to mutate to a physicochemically complementary amino_acid to ensure the native_fold of the protein remains stabilized turning this observation around pairs of residues seen to coevolve in tandem and thus preserving their relative physiochemical_properties are likely candidates to form contacts such linked mutational_events are often referred to simply as correlated_mutations the physicochemical similarity of residue pairs is typically scored with the mclachlan matrix although recent work has called into question its use to date a wide_variety of information_theory and machine_learning have been applied to the problem of correlated mutation analysis including mi neural_networks support_vector and linear_regression we have demonstrated that the graphical lasso procedure previously applied successfully to other graphical inference problems such as gene network_reconstruction performs excellently in the task of identifying directly coupled covarying columns in large msas which are indicative of residueresidue contacts in protein_families for of the targets contact_prediction was excellent with a precision for the longest range top l predicted contacts i e correctly_predicted long_range per residue at this level of accuracy predicted contacts should be invaluable in determining protein_folds e g in protein model_quality or decoy selection both the mean and peak performance of psicov is substantially_higher than that achieved by either the recently_proposed bayesian_network approach of burger and van nimwegen or the apc corrected mutual_information approach of and it is likely that when further combined with other predicted structural_information such as predicted_secondary and solvent_exposure that psicov will be able to reach even higher levels of accuracy although psicov is able to deal with many of the statistical problems in contact_prediction from large msas there remain several practical issues first sequence weighting becomes more important as the sizes of families increase it turns out that for large_families sequence weighting occupies the bulk of the computation time as it is an o n procedure more efficient sequence weighting_schemes do exist e g but we found these schemes performed_poorly in this application probably because they tend to overweight misaligned or incorrect sequences secondly the practical difficulties of accurately and automatically aligning tens or hundreds of thousands of protein_sequences cannot be underestimated better alignment_methods for large sequence families are certain to offer improvements in contact prediction_accuracy although the standard graphical lasso approach has been used in psicov other sparse learning algorithms could easily be applied to the same problem one interesting possibility that we are currently investigating is to make use of a group_lasso approach to cluster together covariances relating to different residue pairs in the current approach each potential contact is scored by summing matrix values relating to the individual amino_acid in the two alignment columns in a grouped lasso approach rather than treating the matrix values in the submatrix as independent they could be processed as a group of related variables overall we would hope that more tailored sparse learning algorithms better alignment_algorithms along with better sequence weighting and regularization schemes will significantly improve the results obtained from methods such as psicov in the future
