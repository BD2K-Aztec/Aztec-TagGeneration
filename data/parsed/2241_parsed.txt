human cell structure driven model construction for predicting protein subcellular_location from biological images motivation the systematic study of subcellular_location pattern is very important for fully characterizing the human_proteome nowadays with the great advances in automated microscopic_imaging accurate bioimage based classification methods to predict protein subcellular_locations are highly desired all existing_models were constructed on the independent parallel hypothesis where the cellular_component classes are positioned independently in a multi class classification engine the important structural_information of cellular_compartments is missed to deal with this problem for developing more accurate_models we proposed a novel cell structure driven classifier construction approach sc psorter by employing the prior biological structural_information in the learning model specifically the structural relationship among the cellular_components is reflected by a new codeword matrix under the error_correcting output coding framework then we construct multiple sc psorter based_classifiers corresponding to the columns of the error_correcting output coding codeword matrix using a multi kernel support_vector classification approach finally we perform the classifier ensemble by combining those multiple sc psorter based classi fiers via majority_voting results we evaluate our method on a collection of immunohistochemistry images from the human_protein database the experimental_results show that our method achieves an overall accuracy of which is higher than the state of the art method availability_and the dataset and code can be downloaded from https github com shaoweinuaa one important task in the research of proteomics is to explore the natural function of proteins in performing and regulating the activities of an organism at cell level it is widely_recognized that the function of a protein is closely associated with its corresponding cellular_compartments proteins can only find their correct interacting molecules at the right place thus subcellular_location can provide_important for understanding the function of a protein with the breakthrough of genome_sequencing and bioimaging techniques traditional timeconsuming and expensive wet laboratory experimental_approaches cannot catch up with the speed of newly known proteins hence finding an automatic computational way to determine the subcellular_locations of proteins has been becoming a focus in computational_biology from the perspective of machine_learning this task can be transformed where we first need to figure out a proper feature representation way for encoding the protein data which then will be fed into a trained machine_learning model for label decision there are two major research categories depending on how the protein data are represented i e one dimensional amino sequence and two_dimensional image on one hand if a protein is represented in amino_acid pseaac pssm and gene_ontology are among the applied sequence_based features in the second step various machine_learning have been proposed for instance researchers in yoon and lee adopted a boosting framework to accomplish the classification task and in a random label selection method was presented to learn the label correlations from training_dataset to guide the classification for multi_label proteins on the other hand accompanied with the explosive increments in genomic_data we witnessed great advances in automated microscopic_imaging in recent_years because of the intuitive characteristics of images compared with amino_acid bioimage based protein subcellular_distribution pattern analysis has attracted_much for example it is found that image_based analysis can be successfully used to detect protein_biomarkers which will dynamically change their subcellular_locations in the cancerous_tissues if proteins are represented with two_dimensional images e g through fluorescent or immunohistochemistry microscopy the most widely used image_features can be grouped into two categories i e global and local_features for global feature the dna feature is designed to characterize dna distribution in a cell image since there is high co occurrence of protein and dna in a protein image we can infer the relative_position of protein according to the dna distribution besides haralick feature_based on db wavelet is another global feature to describe image texture such as inertia and isotropy which is demonstrated to be robust to cell rotations and translations as to local feature lbp feature is the most frequently_applied descriptor to characterize the spatial_structure of images involving flat areas edges and spots some extensions are also reported constructed a mixed local feature_set by adding two extensive forms of lbp i e ltp and lqp applied the surf feature to handle the classification_problem in cell images considering different features will have their own advantages a common strategy is to fuse multiple types of features for instance different features are concatenated as a long vector to perform the subsequent classification task intuitively since single type of features cannot reflect all the information of a protein image fusing multiple types of features together is expected to be a more promising way for learning algorithms design applied neural_networks to classify four protein types proposed a probability based support_vector svm to predict the subcellular_location of proteins in human reproductive system by considering a high ratio of human proteins co exist at different locations designed a multi_label classifier other efforts includeused a multiresolution approach and logistic_regression algorithm with latent_variables was proposed inalthough much progress has been achieved in designing different statistical classifiers to the best of our knowledge none of the existing image based_classifiers takes the biological cell structure information into consideration which has already been demonstrated to be effective in solving biological sorting problems the basic hypothesis of existing predictors is to parallelly consider every cellular_component class regardless of their organizations in the cell it is expected that better performance will be achieved when we incorporate the cell nature component organization structure into the model construction to enable the learned model to incorporate the subcellular component organization structure we propose a new classifier learning approach by utilizing the error_correcting output coding ecoc framework this new approach can decompose the multi class problem into several binary classification_problems according to the prior human cell structural_information the final decision will then be made by combining the results of these binary classifiers in the new structure driven learning approach we first construct a codeword matrix to reflect the biological structure of cellular_compartments with ecoc then for each binary classifier corresponding to the columns of the ecoc codeword matrix we use kernel combination method to fuse different types of features rather than the direct combination strategy finally we perform the classifier ensemble by combining multiple classifiers via majority_voting the experimental_results show that our method performs much better than several state of the art methods because the proposed approach has incorporated the cell structure prior_knowledge into model generation in this article we develop and test a novel prediction model scpsorter for determining image_based protein subcellular_locations specifically we first devise a novel codeword matrix by considering the biological structural_information under the ecoc framework and then for each binary classifier corresponding to the columns of the ecoc codeword matrix we adopt kernel combination method to fuse different types of features finally we develop a classifier ensemble by combining multiple sc psorter based_classifiers via majority_voting in this study our method has been shown effective in case of each protein corresponding to only one location however as a matter of fact nearly percentage of human proteins co exist more than two locations and thus we will design a new method to solve this multi_label based protein classification_problem also since different biomarker may provide_complementary for the prediction of protein subcellular_location we will add non image data e g amino_acid to our image_based predictor for further performance improvement
