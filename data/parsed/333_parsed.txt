genome_analysis a new correlation clustering method for cancer mutation analysis motivation cancer_genomes exhibit a large number of different alterations that affect many genes in a diverse manner an improved understanding of the generative mechanisms behind the mutation rules and their influence on gene community behavior is of great_importance for the study of cancer results to expand our capability to analyze combinatorial patterns of cancer alterations we developed a rigorous methodology for cancer mutation pattern discovery based on a new constrained form of correlation clustering our new algorithm named c cancer correlation clustering leverages mutual_exclusivity of mutations patient coverage and driver network concentration principles to test c we performed a detailed analysis on tcga breast_cancer and glioblastoma data and showed that our algorithm outperforms the state of the art comet method in terms of discovering mutually_exclusive gene_modules and identifying biologically_relevant driver_genes the proposed agnostic clustering method represents a unique tool for efficient and reliable identification of mutation_patterns and driver pathways in large_scale cancer_genomics studies and it may also be used for other clustering problems on biological graphs availability the source_code for the c method can be found at https github com jackhou c rapid advances in high_throughput have provided unique opportunities for analyzing large_numbers of cancer_genomes however the complexity of genomic_alterations in cancer causes significant analytical and computational challenges that have to be overcome in order to fully characterize the functional_roles of various mutations in particular as cancer_genomes tend to contain a large number of diverse mutations e g point_mutations or copy_number changes most of which are neutral one problem of significant importance is to identify a small set of mutations that perturb key biological_pathways and have significant impact on tumorigenesis hence a central_question in cancer_genomics is how to distinguish driver_mutations which contribute to tumorigenesis from functionally neutral passenger_mutations many computational_methods have been developed to facilitate the discovery of driver_genes most of which rely on mutation counts due to the high_level of inter tumor_heterogeneity two patients with the same cancer may have vastly different drivers and as a result many cancer mutations occur with low_frequency in the patient population therefore approaches relying on simple estimates of recurrence or frequency of mutations usually do not work well in practice to mitigate this problem several recent_approaches have integrated frequency analysis with pathway based and network based models in order to ensure high_accuracy of common driver_mutation discovery such methods have an advantage in so_far that in addition to mutation analysis they take into account gene interactions as an added source of prior_knowledge in parallel methods have been proposed to identify driver pathways i e groups of genes that may interact together in combinatorial patterns to promote tumorigenesis it to show that mutually_exclusive modules based on known networks can aid in determining groups of genes that contribute to tumorigenesis these gene groups or modules are jointly highly recurrent have similar pathway impact in terms of biological_processes and their corresponding mutations tend to be mutually_exclusive meaning that very often only one gene in each gene group is mutated at a given time in any given patient this mutual_exclusivity rule in cancer pathways is supported by the observations that in general one mutated gene suffices to perturb the function of its corresponding pathway multiple mutations would require significantly higher_energy investments on the part of cancer_cells and are hence selected against expanded the ideas behind the concept of memo with imcmc and provided a framework to integrate mutation data copy_number and expression information into cancer network weights which they used to identify modules they also performed multiple types of integrative cancer perturbation data analysis dendrix was developed to identify driver pathways de_novo using mutual_exclusivity and coverage patient coverage principles without relying on known network information that has the potential to improve the discovery process of new modules mdpfinder from expanded on the overall framework of dendrix by incorporating gene_expression information to ensure that genes in discovered mutually_exclusive pathways were also co expressed multi dendrix and comdp improved on the limitations of dendrix and mdpfinder respectively by allowing their algorithms to find multiple co occuring modules more recently comet was proposed to address an inherent bias in dendrix and multi dendrix that resulted in high_frequency mutations being significantly more likely to be included in mutually_exclusive modules however while methods such as dendrix multi dendrix and comet all have the ability to identify mutually_exclusive modules de_novo they still have significant_limitations the aforementioned methods are typically inefficient when applied to large_scale datasets with large values of their relevant_parameters also some of these methods are randomized in nature and no guarantees exist that multiple runs of the methods will produce compatible results furthermore almost all methods are able to identify only a small number of modules of limited size as cluster sizes are critical algorithmic parameters from the perspective of computational tractability most importantly they have to be redesigned or restructured whenever new biological_information is included in the discovery process to overcome these and other shortcomings of existing_methods we introduce a novel method called cancer correlation clustering c to directly tackle the problems of integrating diverse sources of evidence regarding driver pattern behavior and eliminating computational bottlenecks associated with large cluster sizes or cluster numbers the c method uses a new agnostic optimization framework specifically developed and rigorously analyzed for the driver discovery task in which patient data is converted into a simple set of weights used in the objective_function that do not require the algorithm to change upon incorporation of new data_sources in addition to this flexibility c has low_computational and it allows for adding relevant problem constraints while retaining good theoretical performance guarantees furthermore the algorithm outperforms comet in three out of four evaluation criteria where the three criteria depend on which weights are emphasized in the optimization_problem tuning the weights allows one to select which features to improve or emphasize what the relevant constraints features are may be chosen by the user although our analysis included coverage mutual_exclusivity expression data and network pathway_information we also point out that the weights may be chosen so as to cater to the need of many other computational_biology problems that involve optimization on graphs to test c we ran extensive simulations for severn cancer_types including breast_cancer kidney_cancer ovarian_cancer glioblastoma etc unfortunately the patient sample set sizes for all except two cancers breast_cancer and glioblastoma did not allow for accurate and statistically_significant driver identifications for any of the used methods we hence report results for these two cancers only although a pan cancer study is easy to conduct once sufficiently many samples become available the paper is organized as follows a basic introduction of the principles of correlation clustering is provided in section approach section methods contains a description of how to transform patient data into clustering weights used for the computations the algorithmic clustering approach based on the computed weights and the evaluation criteria used to compare c and comet section results contains the main results of our analysis a comparison of the performance of c and comet on breast_cancer and glioblastoma data a discussion of our findings and concluding_remarks are given in discussions a rigorous mathematical performance analysis of c may be found in the supplementary_materials along with more extensive software evaluations and explanations of relevant concepts in what follows we demonstrate that c outperforms comet in almost all of the aforementioned benchmarking criteria or more precisely for three out of the four chosen criteria this is achieved without any special parameter_tuning or optimization as a rule of thumb c can be made to outperform comet in any chosen single pair of triple of criteria by adjusting the weights this observation may be explained by the fact that the weights trade_off the strengths of different modeling assumptions we supplement our statistical_analysis with a discussion of the biological_relevance of our findings and explore the role of the new potential drivers found by c within their driver gene communities in particular we discuss the significance of large mutually_exclusive clusters that cannot be recovered by other methods recall that we restrict our attention to the ten best performing clusters according to mutual_exclusivity as this approach was used in the original evaluation process of the comet algorithm
