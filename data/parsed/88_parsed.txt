databases_and a comprehensive protein centric id mapping service for molecular data_integration motivation identifier id mapping establishes links between various biological_databases and is an essential first step for molecular data_integration and functional_annotation id mapping allows diverse molecular data on genes and proteins to be combined and mapped to functional pathways and ontologies we have developed comprehensive protein centric id mapping services providing mappings for ids derived from databases on genes proteins pathways diseases structures protein_families protein interaction literature ontologies etc the services are widely used and have been regularly updated since availability www uniprot org mapping and proteininformation resource org pirwww search a central difficulty in integrating and comparing molecular data is finding and maintaining correspondences of identifiers ids for genes proteins and higher_level functional groupings like pathways and gene_ontology go terms various research groups and data_repositories use different data_sources ids and names for nucleotide and proteins sequences in their analysis the first step to integrate diverse datasets is to map the data to a common set of biological objects in our experience working with research labs we are often presented with different types of database ids for the same types of biological object whether proteins or genes in addition many of these ids are redundant in that several actually point to the same gene protein several groups have developed tools to address this common problem many take a gene centric approach useful for genomic and microarray work others take a more protein centric approach which is more useful for proteomics work and also can be useful for systems_biology as proteins are often the active biological object that interacts with other objects and pathways to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as we have developed comprehensive protein centric id mapping tools and services built on the iproclass protein data_warehouse which provides mappings between uniprotkb and currently supports ids from data_sources the services allow individual and batch mappings as well as programmatic_access and ftp downloads the mappings are updated monthly
