gene_expression gene_set for self contained tests complex null and specific alternative_hypotheses motivation the analysis of differentially_expressed gene_sets became a routine in the analyses of gene_expression data there is a multitude of tests available ranging from aggregation tests that summarize gene level statistics for a gene_set to true multivariate tests accounting for intergene correlations most of them detect complex departures from the null_hypothesis but when the null_hypothesis is rejected the specific alternative leading to the rejection is not easily_identifiable results in this article we compare the power and type_i of minimum_spanning mst based non parametric multivariate tests with several multivariate and aggregation tests which are frequently used for pathway analyses in our simulation_study we demonstrate that mst based tests have power that is for many settings comparable with the power of conventional approaches but outper form them in specific regions of the parameter_space corresponding to biologically_relevant configurations further we find for simulated and for gene_expression data that mst based tests discriminate well against shift and scale alternatives as a general result we suggest a two step practical analysis strategy that may increase the interpret ability of experimental_data first apply the most powerful multivariate test to find the subset of pathways for which the null_hypothesis is rejected and second apply mst based tests to these pathways to select those that support specific alternative_hypotheses in the era of high_throughput biology technical_difficulties of obtaining large_scale datasets are gradually becoming less pronounced as compared with difficulties in the data analyses and interpretation in the analysis of gene_expression data a conceptual shift toward a better interpretability of results happened almost a decade_ago when instead of testing for the differential_expression of a single gene the first test for testing the differential_expression of a set of genes gene_set gsea was suggested the motivating ideas of gsea are fold first small changes in gene_expression a sign mark of metabolic_diseases cannot be captured by a single gene using conventional tests such as a t statistic together with a correction_for second the data interpretation can be greatly_facilitated conventionally gene_sets represent molecular_pathways and the differential_expression of a pathway has more explanatory_power compared with a single differentially_expressed gene third genes do not work in isolation but interact with each other as a consequence accounting for the multivariate nature of expression changes is more biologically_relevant emmert since the advent of gsea many methodologies for testing the differential_expression of gene_sets molecular_pathways biological_processes have been suggested and collectively named gene_set gsa approaches gsa approaches have been classified into two categories competitive and self contained competitive approaches compare a gene_set against a background dataset and self contained tests compare whether a gene_set is differentially_expressed between two phenotypes that means self contained tests are conceptually similar to classical two sample statistical_inference methods e g individual gene tests based on a t test only with the unit of change being a set of genes rather than a single gene unfortunately both categories have their own pitfalls and benefits for instance competitive approaches are dependent on the size of the entire dataset whereas in the case of self contained approaches a potential weakness is that null_hypotheses tested by self contained tests are not equivalent emmert previously we demonstrated that the space of null_hypotheses for self contained gsa is mostly covered by three null_hypotheses their exact formulation reflects the underlying test_statistic specifically consider the multivariate distribution of gene_expressions in a gene_set for a given phenotype for the multivariate hotelling t statistic null_hypothesis is formulated as the equality of the mean expression_vectors of the two multivariate gene_expression distributions and the null_hypothesis of multivariate n statistic is the equality of the two multivariate gene_expression distributions in contrast gene level test_statistics aggregating scores to whom correspondence should be addressed e mail yrahmatallah uams edu describing changes in the expression of individual genes e g the squared values of individual t tests state the null_hypothesis as the equality of aggregated scores between phenotypes the aforementioned three null_hypotheses are not equivalent and each test projects on different aspects of the data it should be emphasized that gene level test_statistics disregard existing complex correlation structures within a gene_set in real_biological settings moderate as well as extensive correlations between genes in gene_sets are well documented and can result in a decrease in power for gene level tests compared with multivariate tests in this article we further explore the opportunities to increase the biological interpretability of experimental_results under the self contained gsa framework we start with the introduction of multivariate generalizations of the waldwolfowitz ww and kolmogorovsmirnov ks non parametric two sample tests which were developed more than three decades_ago based on the minimum_spanning mst structure these tests however have never been considered and implemented in the context of gene_set prior to our work using simulated_data as well as expression arrays we compare the properties of multivariate ww and ks tests with conventional multivariate tests such as the n statistic and rotation gene_set test roast as well as gene level tests such as sam gs and the median of p values from t tests for individual genes one property of multivariate non parametric two sample tests namely that they can discriminate against several alternative_hypotheses is specifically important in the context of data interpretability for instance a typical analysis question that asks is the expression of a pathway different between two phenotypes can be too unspecific from a biological_perspective for this reason employing statistical hypotheses tests that allow formulating more specific alternatives can sharpen the initial question itself elucidating why the null_hypothesis h was rejected the r code for the multivariate generalizations of the ww and ks non parametric two sample tests is available in the supplementary_material
