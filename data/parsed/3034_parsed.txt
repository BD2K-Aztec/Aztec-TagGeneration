model based media selection to minimize the cost of metabolic cooperation in microbial_ecosystems motivation simple forms of mutualism between microorganisms are widespread in nature nevertheless the role played by the environmental nutrient composition in mediating cross feeding in microbial_ecosystems is still poorly_understood results here we use mixed integer bilevel linear_programming to investigate the cost of sharing metabolic resources in microbial_communities the algorithm infers an optimal_combination of nutrients that can selectively sustain synergistic growth for a pair of species and guarantees minimum cost of cross fed metabolites to test model based_predictions we selected a pair of escherichia_coli single gene_knockouts auxotrophic respectively for arginine and leucine dargb and dleub and we experimentally_verified that model predicted medium_composition significantly favors mutualism moreover mass_spectrometry profiling of exchanged metabolites confirmed the predicted cross fed metabolites supporting our constraint_based approach as a promising tool for engineering microbial consortia in nature beneficial interactions between species dramatically contribute in shaping ecosystem dynamics and survival microbes form stable relationships with a multitude of different organisms and many of these relationships have a direct impact on human_health hence in spite of an increased complexity the attention has been shifted from studying individual microorganisms to investigating the capabilities of microbial consortia as such in parallel several microbial_communities have been engineered for bioremediation metabolic_engineering and biomedical utilization however understanding the ecological principles that shape and drive dynamics and evolution of microbial_ecosystems remains_a cooperative interactions between species can take place at different levels one of the most common cooperative interaction is metabolic although such type of interactions can have radically different nature in some cases only one species benefits from the community without participating in sharing metabolic resources i e altruism versus parasitism while often bacteria can establish mutually_beneficial inter_species interactions in this bidirectional interaction a pair of organisms receives an advantage from each other typically in terms of cross fed metabolites nevertheless mapping these interactions within a microbial_community is hampered by the complexity and dynamic nature of multispecies ecosystems to reduce problem complexity artificial microbial_communities have been successfully used to shed some light on the complex relationships between genetic_interactions and microbial communitys behavior in parallel the development of large_scale stoichiometric models combined with linear_programming approaches has facilitated the quantitative_understanding of microbial_metabolism in this constraint based framework the detailed reconstructions of metabolic_reactions are deprived of their kinetic and efficiency parameters and are investigated as chemical_reaction matrices control strategies that optimize microorganism growth are used to select biologically_meaningful steady_state flux_distributions among an ensemble of in silico cell_phenotypes the ability to simulate distributions of fluxes in various microorganisms and under diverse perturbations renders this simple method valuable for diverse applications tepper and shlomi i e metabolic_engineering drug_discovery etc using stoichiometric models to capture complex cooperative behavior within microbial_communities however is still an open challenge recently a set of escherichia_coli single gene_knockouts auxotrophic for different classes of amino_acids and nucleotides were used to test their ability to establish synergistic growth each pair of mutants was co cultivated in a glucose minimal_medium and growth was monitored over a days period under this particular nutrient composition none of the mutants was capable of surviving individually but significant growth was detected for of the co cultivated pairs because of their reduced complexity these synthetic microbial_communities enabled the use of quantitative predictive_models e g constraintbased models to resolve the underlying molecular_interactions joint biochemical_reaction and flux_balance were used to predict whether a pair of e coli knockouts can grow by sharing essential metabolites this constraint_based approach has been shown to be too permissive allowing synergistic growth for more than of the mutant pairs one of the limits of this approach is that the cost of sharing metabolic resources between microorganisms is typically not taken into account within a community altruism in bacteria should be promoted in order to sustain mutualistic type of interactions this could be obtained by an appropriate environment where sharing metabolic resources is crucial for survival of the different species and the cost of producing essential metabolites is minimized to this end we here propose an algorithm to predict an optimal nutrient composition that prevents growth of two species when grown in isolation but promotes their synergistic growth by minimizing the cost of sharing essential metabolites to experimentally test our in silico predictions we selected a pair of single e coli gene_knockouts dargb and dleub auxotrophic respectively for arginine and leucine these two strains_exhibited poor synergistic growth in a glucose minimal_medium and more generally cross feeding of arginine and leucine was found to induce moderate and very low cooperativity respectively we applied our algorithm and simulated synergistic growth of dargb and dleub in a glucose minimal_medium and in the model based predicted medium where the cost of the interaction was predicted to be significantly_lower we experimentally tested the ability to coculture these two e coli knockout strains in a minimal m medium supplemented with nucleotides precursors as suggested by the model and showed significantly_improved synergistic growth by monitoring the supernatant composition using a sensitive mass_spectrometry approach we could also identify the most relevant exchanged metabolites between the two strains and support model_predictions
