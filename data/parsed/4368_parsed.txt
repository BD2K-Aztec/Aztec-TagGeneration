systems_biology spinal scalable protein_interaction alignment motivation given proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks of a pair of species a pairwise global_alignment corresponds to a one to one mapping between their proteins based on the presupposition that such a mapping provides pairs of functionally orthologous_proteins accurately the results of the alignment may then be used in comparative systems_biology problems such as function prediction verification or construction of evolutionary_relationships results we show that the problem is np_hard even for the case where the pair of networks are simply paths we next provide a polynomial time heuristic_algorithm spinal which consists of two main phases in the first coarse_grained alignment phase we construct all pairwise initial similarity_scores based on pairwise local neighborhood matchings using the produced similarity_scores the fine_grained alignment phase produces the final one to one mapping by iteratively growing a locally improved solution subset both phases make use of the construction of neighborhood bipartite graphs and the contributors as a common primitive we assess the performance of our algorithm on the ppi_networks of yeast fly human and worm we show that based on the accuracy_measures used in relevant work our method outperforms the state of the art algorithms furthermore our algorithm does not suffer from scalability issues as such accurate results are achieved in reasonable running_times as compared with the benchmark algorithms availability supplementary document open_source codes useful scripts all the experimental_data and the results are freely_available atseveral high_throughput techniques including the yeast twohybrid system co immunoprecipitation coupled mass_spectrometry and computational_methods such as those based on genome_wide analysis of gene_fusion metabolic reconstruction and gene coexpression enable extraction of large_scale proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks of various species several problem formulations related to network_topologies module detections and evolutionary_patterns have been proposed for the analysis of these networks from a comparative interactomics perspective network_alignment problems constitute yet another important family of problem formulations for the analysis of ppi_networks in general terms given two or more ppi_networks from different species where for each network nodes represent the proteins and the edges represent the interactions between the proteins the network_alignment is to align the nodes of the networks or subnetworks within them functional orthology is an important application that serves as the main motivation to study the alignment problems as part of a comparative_analysis of ppi_networks a successful alignment could provide a basis for deciding the proteins that have similar functions across species such information may further be used in predicting functions of proteins with unknown_functions or in verifying those with known functions in detecting common orthologous pathways between species or in reconstructing the evolutionary_dynamics of various species before the introduction of network_alignment as a model common methods to detect orthologous_groups of proteins have been solely based on measures of evolutionary_relationships usually in the form of sequence_similarities homologene and inparanoid are examples of such approaches network_alignment on the other hand incorporate the interaction data as well as the evolutionary_relationships represented possibly in the form of sequence_data based on the assumption that the interactions among functionally orthologous_proteins should be conserved across species such an incorporation is usually achieved by aligning proteins so that both the sequence_similarities of aligned_proteins and the number of conserved interactions are large two versions of this general alignment framework have been suggested in local_network the goal is to identify from the input ppi_networks subnetworks that closely match in terms of network_topology and or sequence_similarities approaches proposed for this version of the problem include pathblast networkblast mawish graemlin and the graph match and split algorithm of narayanan and karp typically many overlapping subnetworks from a single ppi_network are provided as part of the local_alignments this gives rise to ambiguity as a protein may be matched with many proteins from a target ppi_network in global_network on the other hand the goal is to align the networks as a whole providing unambiguous one to one mappings between the proteins of different networks to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com starting with isorank several global network algorithms using more or less similar definitions have been suggested isorank is based on an eigenvalue formulation of local neighborhood alignments path and ga ofare based on appropriate relaxations of a cost formulation over the set of doubly stochastic matrices piswap uses a greedy heuristic based on iterative swaps of mappings until local optimum mi_graal and variants use greedy heuristics based on cost formulations including one or more of the graphlet_degree signatures degrees clustering coefficients eccentricities and the sequence_similarities in terms of blast e values other related network_alignment problems_include global many to many alignments and queries in interaction networks and pathways a major_issue in network_alignment is the computational intractability of all the appropriate optimization formulations it becomes even more apparent with some input ppi_networks containing tens_of of nodes and interactions an important feature expected of the global network alignments is then scalability the running time performances of the suggested methods should not degrade drastically with increasing network sizes at the same time accurate alignment scores close to optimum_values of appropriate formulations is a natural expectation however existing_approaches either aggressively optimize for better accuracy at the expense of scalability or vice_versa we propose a novel global_network algorithm spinal which consists of two phases a coarse_grained alignment score estimations phase and a fine_grained conflict_resolution and improvement phase both phases make use of the construction of neighborhood bipartite graphs and a set of contributors as a common primitive using these concepts within iterative local improvement heuristics constitute the backbone of the algorithm in terms of scalability spinal runs much faster and provides more accurate results than the compared state of the art methods in almost all of the experimented instances under consideration
