quantitative_trait association study for mean telomere_length in the south_asian genomes motivation mean telomere_length mtl is associated with cancers and age_related which necessitates identification of genomic and environmental_factors that impact telomere_length dynamics here we present a pilot genome_wide association gwa study for mtl in south asian_population using publicly_available next generation whole genome_sequences wgs both for mtl and genotype calculations results mtl in the studied population was not correlated with age which is in accordance with previous_reports further we identified that individuals with sikh religion had longer telomeres which may be the result of complex interaction between genetic_background and environmental_factors finally we identified mtl associated snps residing in five loci the top ones were located in adarb gene which has previously been implicated with extreme old age conclusion our results show that wgs_data can be used in telomere_length studies in addition we introduce novel loci implicated in mtl that may be worth considering in further telomere studies telomeres are repetitive stretches of dna that cap the ends of chromosomes in humans telomeres are comprised of ttaggg n tandem_repeats and vary between and kb in length among other functions telomeres protect chromosome_ends from being recognized as double_stranded each cell_division results in shortening of telomeric_sequences due to the end replication problem in their study have calculated that in humans the annual loss of telomere_length ranges between and bp telomere_length can be restored in cells by telomerase enzyme which is active in reproductive and stem_cells partially in leukocytes as well as in certain types of tumors significance of telomere_length association with various conditions and diseases is clearly demonstrated through multiple studies shortening of telomeres is associated with aging age_related and certain cancer_types identification of genetic_and impacting telomere_length has been repeatedly addressed from multiple_loci implicated in association with telomere_length those including genes associated with telomerase were among the most validated ones conducted a meta_analysis of individuals and reported seven loci associated with leukocyte mean telomere_length mtl including genes coding for telomerase_rna component terc telomerase_reverse oligonucleotide oligosaccharide binding fold containing protein obfc nuclear assembly_factor ribonucleoprotein naf regulator of telomere_elongation helicase rtel which are involved in telomere biology and two other loci including acyp and znf genes these genes apart from znf were validated or had supportive_evidence in a study within the cogs project association of telomere_length with snps is partially population specific and until now there is no well accepted genomic factor_determining telomere_length and telomere attrition_rate this may be partially attributed to population specific genomic_variations on one side and lack of tools for measuring telomere_length from whole_genome wgs_data on the other recently we have developed a methodology and software computel that allows to calculate mtl from wgs_data by capturing reads from telomeric regions via alignment to a special reference_sequence computel has been proven to be valid with reference to existing experimental methods and to outperform other computational_approaches this gives the opportunity to considerably promote the research aimed at understanding how telomere_length is linked to genomic_context in this study we have performed a genome_wide quantitative_trait association study for mtl in south asian_population using wgs_data both for genotyping and mtl calculation here we have presented a pilot_study of gwa for mtl in south_asians where we exploited wgs_data for snp information and for mtl calculation concordance of certain findings with previously_published validated our approach and demonstrated that the usage of wgs_data can be extended to be utilized in telomere studies this eliminates the necessity of conducting additional experiments for telomere_length measurement greatly facilitating further research moreover there is large amount of already existing wgs_data focused on age_related and cancers where telomeres play_an and our approach can be used to exploit available datasets to enrich the results with telomere_length data our study showed that sikhs are distinguished with longer telomeres compared with other religious groups from south_asia this phenomenon needs further investigation in order to assess the involvement of genetic and or environmental_factors on telomere_length dynamics moreover our results suggest that not only telomere_length but also its association with age can be affected by ethnicity finally we have identified that adarb gene highly impacts telomere_length in south_asians longevity related nature of this gene is characterized in other populations thus combination of this information with our results calls for more investigation to understand the role of this gene in telomere regulation and ageing in general
