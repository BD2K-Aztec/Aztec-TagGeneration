arrest assignsubsets a novel application for robust subclassification of chronic_lymphocytic based on b cell receptor ig stereotypy motivation an ever increasing body of evidence_supports the importance of b cell receptor im munoglobulin bcr ig sequence restriction alias stereotypy in chronic_lymphocytic cll this phenomenon accounts for of studied cases one in eight of which belong to major subsets and extends beyond restricted sequence_patterns to shared biologic and clinical_characteristics and generally outcome thus the robust assignment of new cases to major cll subsets is a critical and yet unmet requirement results we introduce a novel application arrest assignsubsets which enables the robust assignment of bcr ig sequences from cll patients to major stereotyped subsets arrest assignsubsets uniquely combines expert immunogenetic sequence_annotation from imgt v quest with curation to safeguard quality statistical_modeling of sequence_features from more than cll patients and results from multiple_perspectives to allow for both objective and subjective_assessment we validated our approach on the learning set and evaluated its real_world applicability on a new representative dataset comprising sequences from a single_institution availability_and arrest assignsubsets is freely_available on the web at http bat infspire org arrest assignsubsets research into the immune pathogenesis of lymphomas and leukemias over the last three decades has highlighted the important role of antigen_recognition by lymphocyte receptors by uncovering restrictions in their immunogenetic makeup such research in large cohorts of cases of chronic_lymphocytic cll the most common leukemia in an ageing western_population revealed that subsets of patients with stereotyped or quasi identical b cellreceptor immunoglobulin bcr ig or antibody collectively account for of cases and represent disease sub entities with shared biologic and clinical profiles including outcome intriguingly in the latest and largest such study of over patients major subsets each with at least cases accounted for of the cohort and of all stereotyped cases this is remarkable given the negligible chance in the range of of finding two b cell_clones with stereotyped bcr ig thus major stereotyped subsets have attracted great interest to date assignment of new cases to these major subsets has been based on the ad_hoc application of published_criteria mostly by groups with advanced knowledge in immunogenetics and thus with limited applicability and arguably reliability in routine_practice we therefore introduce a novel application arrest assignsubsets which enables the robust assignment of submitted bcr ig sequences from cll patients to the existing major stereotyped subsets negatively these are i rearranged ighv and immunoglobulin heavy joining genes and ii the vh cdr amino_acid through amino_acid frequencies at any given sequence position to keep the model robust and avoid_overfitting the bayesian network_topology is kept as simple as possible with only obvious dependencies captured vh cdr amino_acid frequencies at any position and relative_frequencies of rearranged ighv genes of the same phylogenetic clan to avoid creating unrealistically stringent_criteria we include a relaxation coefficient to the probability calculation of the observed frequency of each feature in all available sequences finally to reduce the noise created by relatively less frequent values we apply the power function on the probability_distribution of each feature assignment phase assignment is based on evaluating submitted sequence_features with the learned bayesian_model each sequence first acquires an absolute score for each major subset of the positive set and for the negative set or pool cohort the absolute score is the minus logarithm of the exact probability of assigning to a set with inf minus infinity meaning that the sequence core_features did not match the subset core_features the difference between the absolute score of each major subset and that of the pool cohort is then calculated as a relative score with positive numbers for submitted sequences closer to subsets than to the pool cohort assignment to the best scoring subset uses a per subset threshold based on the range of scores achieved by existing members of that subset the difference between the relative score and the subset threshold is translated to confidence ranging from borderline to extreme to further assist the user output real_time output consists of progress reports links information and help results and tables these include the detailed arrest seqcure report on the health of the submitted sequences absolute and relative_frequencies of assignment to each of the major cll subsets and an assignment report for each submitted sequence including its health the confidence of the assignment and when possible heat maps of core and secondary features with their significance with respect to the submitted sequence and the bestscoring but not necessarily assigned subset additional information can be found in the supplementary data and on the home page of arrest assignsubsets to validate arrest assignsubsets we performed learning and assignment runs each using randomly_selected of the sequences of our full cohort for learning and the remaining as new sequences for assigning false_positives i e of the pool cohort but assigned to a subset or falsely assigned and false_negatives i e of a subset but assigned to the pool cohort or falsely unassigned were closely inspected we confirm high levels of average specificity sensitivity and overall accuracy favoring specificity is by design due to the potentially important clinical_implications of the assignment results to evaluate the applicability and robustness of arrest assignsubsets to a real_world situation we analyzed new sequences from the university of athens greece now also in imgt cll db a cohort representative of our larger cohort in terms of ighv gene_repertoire and mutational_status our results confirmed the published incidence of major subsets with sequences assigned to major subsets subsets and acquired almost half of the new assignments and cases respectively as expected while subset was under represented in this mediterranean population confirming geographic biases
