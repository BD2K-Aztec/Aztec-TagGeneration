genetics_and statistical considerations for digital approaches to non_invasive fetal genotyping motivation a growing_body has demonstrated the potential for non_invasive diagnosis of a variety of human genetic_diseases using cell_free extracted from maternal plasma_samples in early_gestation such methods are of great significance to the obstetrics community because of their potential use as clinical standard of care proof_of for such approaches has been established for aneuploidy and paternally inherited dominant traits although significant progress has recently been made the non_invasive diagnosis of monogenic diseases that segregate in a recessive mendelian fashion is more problematic recent_developments in microfluidic digital pcr and dna_sequencing have resulted in a number of recent_advances in this field these have largely although not exclusively been used for the development of diagnostic_methods for aneuploidy however given their prevalence it is likely that such methods will be utilized towards the development of non_invasive methods for diagnosing monogenetic disorders results with this in mind we have undertaken a statistical_modeling of three contemporary digital analytical_methods in the context of prenatal_diagnosis using cell_free for monogenic diseases that segregate in a recessive mendelian fashion we provide an experimental framework for the future development of diagnostic_methods in this context that should be considered when designing molecular assays that seek to establish proof_of in this field during the past_few there has been great interest in the search for definitive yet minimally_invasive low_risk procedures for the prenatal_diagnosis of fetal genetic disease although sophisticated evolution of serum based screens has occurred in which concentrations of specific protein markers associated with fetal_malformations are determined in combination with ultrasonography these do not achieve definitive_diagnosis recently there has been rapid development of non_invasive and potentially definitive diagnostic_approaches that utilize circulating to whom correspondence should be addressed cell_free as a substrate this circulating fetal dna is thought to be of trophoblast origin and is present in maternal_plasma at a genome equivalent frequency of between practical_applications of the analysis of fetal dna in maternal_plasma are growing and are perhaps best exemplified by successful non_invasive prediction of fetal rhesus d blood_group status the diagnosis of other paternally inherited mutations causing for example thalassemia and achondroplasia and the detection of trisomy via methylation_specific of polymorphic fetal alleles despite the rapid progress towards the development of diagnostic_methods for fetal disease using cell_free in maternal_plasma there are still a number of obstacles to overcome before this can be used in routine_clinical most significant is the fact the maternally_inherited fetal alleles are identical in primary sequence to their endogenous maternal counterparts one approach to overcome this has been to exploit the fact that the nucleated portion of the maternal hematopoietic system and apoptotic_bodies derived from the placental villus are the primary_sources of the maternal and fetal components of cell_free plasma nucleic_acids respectively therefore functional genomic differences between these tissues can be exploited to identify_biomarkers for the selective enrichment of fetal nucleic_acids and it has been shown that differentially transcribed and or methylated loci on informative chromosomes can be used for the diagnosis of aneuploidy recently it has been demonstrated that microfluidic digital pcr approaches have utility for the diagnosis of aneuploidy using functional biomarkers digital pcr has also been used for the diagnosis of monogenic disease in which allelic ratios are quantified in maternal_plasma dna samples in the context of a recessive mutation that segregates in a mendelian fashion an affected fetus would be distinguished from a heterozygous carrier by deviation from a allelic ratio to a state in which the recessive allele is over represented as a consequence of its increased fetal contribution and concomitant absence of the wild_type fetal counterpart it has also recently been shown that high_throughput wholegenome dna_sequencing can be used for the detection of fetal aneuploidy this is an exciting development with great_potential because it is a direct method that requires no gene or chromosomespecific biomarkers and provides chromosome wide insight into karyotype significantly high_throughput allowspage this article provides a statistical background to three approaches for the non_invasive prenatal genetic_analysis of fetal disease usingit should be noted that our analyses are based on statistical_models of allele counts under the assumption that the experiments are performed perfectly without the introduction of any bias and extra noise in practice this assumption is always more or less violated in particular the difference in the sequences between two dna_fragments may lead to slightly different pcr efficiency and noticeable difference in the number of copies generated from each dna_fragments after many pcr cycles therefore we suggest that a large number of experiments should be performed to establish empirically after pcr the ratio of the number of copies generated from a dna_fragment carrying allele a to the number of copies generated from a dna_fragment carrying allele b call this ratio the a b bias factor we can drive a new allele count_ratio table corrected by this factor and design statistic tests based on the new table finally we would like to point out that while the focus of this article is the diagnosis of recessive mendelian_diseases the methods discussed in this article can be easily applied to other the diagnosis of other type of mendelian_diseases for example suppose a dominant mendelian disease is caused by the presence of allele a when the maternal genotype is aa the fetus must be affected when the maternal genotype is bb the fetus is affected if and only if allele a can be detected from the maternal_plasma note that this is also true for the diseases caused by de_novo dominant mutation when the maternal genotype is ab the fetus carries the benign genotype bb if and only if the ratio of allele a to b is less than or equal to p p the fetus has the disease_causing genotype ab or aa if and only if the ratio is greater than or equal to thus we can determine if the fetus is affected when the maternal genotype is ab by testing_the that the ratio of allele a to allele b is less than or equal to p p against the alternative hypothesis that the ratio is greater than or equal to for diseases caused by compound_heterozygous our methods can be used to determine the fetal genotype at all relevant loci of course when multiple tests are conducted simultaneously we need to use the bonferroni_correction to control the family_wise in conclusion we provide a statistical foundation for the development of digital methods including pcr and dna_sequencing for the non_invasive diagnosis of recessive mendelian human disease the methods we provide should guide the future_design of studies in this realm and be considered when establishing proof_of for such methods funding magee womens research_institute and foundation to d g p
