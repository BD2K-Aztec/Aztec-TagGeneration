systems_biology the role of indirect connections in gene_networks in predicting function motivation gene_networks have been used widely in gene_function algorithms many based on complex extensions of the guilt by association principle we sought to provide a unified explanation for the performance of gene_function algorithms in exploiting network_structure and thereby simplify future analysis results we use co expression networks to show that most exploited network_structure simply reconstructs the original correlation matrices from which the co expression network was obtained we show the same principle works in predicting gene function in protein_interaction and that these methods perform comparably to much more sophisticated gene_function algorithms availability_and data and algorithm implementation are fully described and available at http www chibi ubc ca extended programs are provided in matlab m code gene interactions can be used to infer functional_relationships a principle known as guilt by association gba genes can be judged to be interacting based on direct evidence of protein or genetic_interaction or by a similarity in behavior across a range of conditions such as expression_profiles or phylogenetic profiles the principle of gba forms the basis for most gene_function algorithms which typically use relational information e g interactions to predict new gene membership in gene function categories some of these algorithms operate directly by gba while others infer function from more complex relational properties in the simplest case the function of a gene can be predicted by voting to whom correspondence should be addressed among its connected neighbors with known function perhaps with statistical control such as the chi_square for a given function a genes likelihood of possessing that function could be for example the fraction of its neighbors possessing that function simple nearest_neighbor voting basic gba or bgba has been shown to predict gene function in a variety of biological_networks including protein interaction and gene co expression our focus is on a natural extension of these methods which is to incorporate the broader network structuremeaning indirect connections among genesinto predictions a large variety of techniques have been proposed to extend gba to indirect connections including voting within a fixed radius clustering into function classes specialized support_vector prediction by path_length weighting indirect connections by local topology network propagation topological overlap as well as others most of these methods report improvement over gba between direct connections although where methods are compared they tend to perform comparably and only slightly better than direct gba gene_function and network_analysis methods typically employ networks that are sparse only a subset of possible edges are retained based on some implicit or explicit threshold in coexpression analyses this threshold may be a correlation p value but is often a simple threshold above a certain rank in order to attain a matrix sufficiently sparse to be computationally_tractable even in proteinprotein_interaction ppins the underlying data are typically some metric which must be thresholded though there is also an earlier implicit threshold in terms of which proteins are even tested thresholding to determine confident interactions is particularly convenient for interaction networks which must aggregate the results of multiple studies also this pre filtered analysis leaves the networks performance open to the conventional interpretation of biological_networks in which specific network interactions have specific meaning of course by applying a threshold for statistical confidence information may be lost or disguised within the network we will provide evidence that it is precisely this information which methods exploiting indirect connections reconstruct in their operation there is a larger variety of gene_function methods that use indirect connections implicitly such as support_vector approaches and markov_random but there are broadly only two approaches to explicitly incorporating indirect connections into gene_function page
