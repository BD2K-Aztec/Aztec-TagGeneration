merantk methylated rna analysis toolkit the significance and function of posttranscriptional cytosine_methylation in poly a rna attracts great interest but is still poorly_understood high_throughput of rna treated with bisulfite rna bsseq or subjected to enrichment techniques like aza ip or miclip enables transcriptome_wide studies of this particular modification at single_base however to date there are no specialized software_tools available for the analysis of rna bsseq or aza ip data therefore we developed merantk the first publicly_available tool kit which addresses the special demands of high_throughput rna cytosine_methylation data analysis it provides fast and easy to use splice aware bisulfite_sequencing read_mapping comprehensive methylation calling and identification of differentially methylated_cytosines by statistical_analysis of single and multi replicate experiments application of merantk to rna bsseq or aza ip data produces accurate results in standard compliant formats availability_and merantk source_code and test data are released under the gnu gplv_license and are available atmodifications of dna by methylation and hydroxymethylation of the carbon_atom of cytosine m c hm c are well established epigenetic_mechanisms that affect the activity state of genomic_regions in contrast to the relatively limited array of dna_modifications rna can be target to chemically distinct modifications roughly two thirds of which are methylations most of these rna modifications were studied on rrnas and trnas where m c plays a role in structural and metabolic stabilization surprisingly little is known about the significance and function of m c in poly a rnas recently one of the first studies to globally evaluate rna cytosine_methylation showed that m c occurred throughout the human_transcriptome in coding and non_coding moreover cytosine_methylation in the long_non hotair and xist was found to have the ability to interfere with rnaprotein interaction rna m c modifications can be detected by bisulfite_treatment which converts all unmethylated_cytosines into uracils leaving methylated_cytosines unaffected an alternative_technique is the enrichment of rnas covalently_bound to rna methyltransferases rmt that were trapped on their substrate either by the precence of azacytidine aza ip or by mutating the catalytic center of the respective rmt miclip when these methods are combined with high_throughput it is possible to obtain either global rna bsseq or enzyme specific aza ip miclip m c modified transcriptomes to date numerous software_tools are available for the analysis of dna bsseq data but to the best of our knowledge none of these tools supports the analysis of v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com data from rna bsseq or aza ip which causes a c to g conversion at the rmt bound cytosine aligners and methylation callers specific for dna_methylation data are of limited use when dealing with rna the major shortcomings are due to the fact that transcripts may exist in multiple different splice_forms and that they may be transcribed from either of the two dna_strands at present a few methylation studies using rna bsseq and aza ip have been published however the analysis strategies used in these works are time consuming and cumbersome involving many steps utilizing many differentin part commercialtools and on top they require the development of custom programs to address_these and improve the rna m c data analysis we developed merantk a tool kit that provides programs for fast mapping of high_throughput rna bsseq data and enables accurate identification of methylated and differentially methylated_cytosines from bs_seq and aza ip experiments at single_base previously_proposed analysis approaches for rna cytosine_methylation data consist of many time consuming non automated steps involving the usage of different tools and still demand writing of custom programs merantk solves these issues and enables easy time saving and accurate analysis of rna bsseq and aza ip experiments
