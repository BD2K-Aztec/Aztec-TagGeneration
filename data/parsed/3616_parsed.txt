gene_expression positional correlation_analysis improves reconstruction of full_length transcripts and alternative isoforms from noisy array signals or short_reads motivation a reconstruction of full_length transcripts observed by next generation sequencer or tiling arrays is an essential technique to know all phenomena of transcriptomes several techniques of the reconstruction have been developed however problems of high_level noises and biases still remain and interrupt the reconstruction a method is required that is robust against noise and bias and correctly reconstructs transcripts regardless of equipment used results we propose a completely new statistical_method that reconstructs full_length transcripts and can be applied on both next generation sequencers and tiling arrays the method called artade analyzes positional correlation meaning correlations of expression values for every combination on genomic positions of multiple transcriptional data artade then reconstructs full_length transcripts using a logistic_model based on the positional correlation and the markov_model artade elucidated full_length transcripts from transcriptome datasets and showed notable performance compared with other recent prediction_methods moreover novel transcripts were discovered we experimentally tested novel transcripts among which were confirmed by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction and sequence mapping the method also showed notable performance for reconstructing of mrna observed by a next generation sequencer moreover the positional correlation and factor_analysis embedded in artade successfully detected regions at which alternative isoforms may exist and thus are expected to be applied for discovering transcript biomarkers for a wide_range of disciplines including preemptive medicine every cell of every organism has a signature set of rna_molecules with certain fractions called the transcriptome the transcriptome carries out specialized cell activities to know all about the transcriptome is an essential step for understanding life several technologies are developed therefore to observe the transcriptome hybridization based_methods with genome tiling arrays have been used to approach all phenomena in the transcriptome for species such as humans mice or arabidiopsis thaliana whose genome_sequences have been read with high_quality on the other hand high_throughput sequencers typically called next generation sequencers ngs are emerging as a major equipment to acquire information about transcriptomes by the method called mrna seq because they can be applied not only for well studied organisms but also for other exotic organisms using either method a reconstruction of the shape of fulllength rna_transcripts from observation results is still a critical step in the study because both genome tiling_array probes and ngs_reads are short nt and represent partial observations of original molecules whose lengths are nt and more there are several computational programs that address_this we have also developed artade an abbreviation for arabidopsis tiling_array based detection of exonsthe previous version of artade to reconstruct the shape of mrna_molecules based on genome information and mrna expression_profiles from genome tiling arrays cufflinks is one of the major programs applied for mrnaseq results however tiling_array and mrna seq results often contain high levels of noise which may come from observation machinery and biological fractions this makes the reconstruction of full_length transcripts more difficult if the dynamic range of expression values is low besides it is known that amplification hybridization and sequencing biases cause bad effects on observations almost all recent methods try to reconstruct fulllength transcripts by only using transcriptome on a single condition we think however there is a theoretical limit to the extent these methods can remove noise and bias
