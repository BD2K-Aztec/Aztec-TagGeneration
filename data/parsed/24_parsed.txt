data_and a biclustering algorithm for extracting bit patterns from binary datasets motivation binary datasets represent a compact and simple way to store data about the relationships between a group of objects and their possible properties in the last few years different biclustering_algorithms have been specially developed to be applied to binary datasets several approaches based on matrix_factorization suffix_trees or divide_and techniques have been proposed to extract useful biclusters from binary_data and these approaches provide information about the distribution of patterns and intrinsic correlations results a novel approach to extracting biclusters from binary datasets bibit is introduced here the results obtained from different experiments with synthetic data reveal the excellent_performance and the robustness of bibit to density and size of input_data also bibit is applied to a central_nervous embryonic tumor gene_expression dataset to test the quality of the results a novel gene_expression preprocessing methodology based on expression_level layers and the selective search performed by bibit based on a very fast bit pattern processing technique provide very satisfactory_results in quality and computational_cost the power of biclustering in finding genes involved simultaneously in different cancer processes is also shown finally a comparison with bimax one of the most cited binary biclustering_algorithms shows that bibit is faster while providing essentially the same results availability the source and binary codes the datasets used in the experiments and the results can be found at binary datasets represent a compact and simple way to store data about the relationships between a group of objects and their possible properties this type of data is present in many research_fields including data_mining text_mining bioinformatics engineering or paleontology to whom correspondence should be addressed among others what the values and stand for depends on the context for example when working with gene and protein features if gene r encodes a protein that belongs to a protein of class c then r c is equal to otherwise it is equal to commonly the binary values and mean that under experimental_condition c gene r is either expressed or not respectively in some transcription_regulation datasets a matrix element is if the transcription_factor associated with the motif group putatively binds the upstream region of a certain gene clustering is one of the most popular techniques used to identify the distribution of patterns and intrinsic correlations in large_datasets however the impossibility of discovering local patterns by this technique has led to the popularization of biclustering_algorithms which are able to analyze all dataset dimensions simultaneously and consequently extract local patterns that provide a better understanding of the underlying biological_phenomena different biclustering_algorithms have been developed for their use with binary datasets for example in biclusters are defined as submatrices dense enough with s to be considered statistically_significant based on the same concept the work of vanadapts a score function to effectively deal with sparse binary datasets however these changes lead to a more complicated user input_parameters besides all the elements of every generated bicluster are set to zero in the input matrix introducing noise matrix_factorization can be applied to reduce the dimensionality of data yielding a representation of conditions as linear_combinations of a reduced set of k factors based on this idea a binary matrix_factorization bmf algorithm is presented in the objective is to decompose the input binary matrix x into two binary matrices w and h such that x wh determining the suitable number of factors k is however the main hurdle with these type of approaches suffix_trees have also been used to extract biclusters from binary matrices thus the e bimotif algorithm combines sequence_alignment with an adaptation of the e cccbiclustering algorithm to further group sequences with similar motif structures to find all the maximal contiguous column biclusters the e bimotif algorithm generates a suffix_tree t from a binary matrix where rows and columns represent candidate motifs and sequences respectively then t is used to spell all valid biclusters taking_into an error threshold in the structure of the motifs the aim of this section is to assess the performance of the bibit algorithm and it is divided_into two parts in the first part synthetic datasets are used to evaluate the behavior of the algorithm with respect to sensitivity and to compare the algorithm with bimax in terms of the number of results generated the execution time and the quality of results a novel cumulative binarization method with an increasing density of s is presented in section one of the objectives in our experiments with synthetic datasets is therefore tothe binary matrix b and the user parameters defined as the minimum number of rows mnr and the minimum number of columns mnc allowed in a final bicluster are the inputs of the method the extraction_process of bitpatterns is divided_into two sequential phases in the first phase the encoding manages the input database reduction using a novel encoding process columns are divided_into bit words of a certain length in this particular case every bit word is translated independently into its integer representation thus the column dimension and consequently the number of operations needed in the second phase will be reduced drastically the second phase is related with the biclustering generation_process every pair of rows generates a pattern if the number of elements of is not below the input parameter mnc and that pattern has not been processed previously an initial bicluster is created later rows are added to that bicluster at the end of the process if the number of rows of the final bicluster is equal to or greater than the parameter mnr that bicluster is considered a valid result analyze the performance of bibit with different densities of the input matrix the objective of the second part is to use prior_biological to evaluate the usefulness of bibit algorithm in relation to real_data to achieve this a central_nervous embryonic tumor gene_expression dataset was used
