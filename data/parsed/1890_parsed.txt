data_and fselector a ruby gem for feature_selection the fselector package contains a comprehensive list of feature_selection for supporting bioinformatics and machine_learning research fselector primarily collects and implements the filter type of feature_selection techniques which are computationally_efficient for mining large_datasets in particular fselector allows ensemble feature_selection that takes_advantage of multiple feature_selection to yield more robust results fselector also provides many useful auxiliary tools including normalization discret ization and missing_data imputation availability fselector written in the ruby programming_language is free_and that runs on all ruby supporting platforms including windows linux and mac os x fselector is available from https rubygems org gems fselector and can be installed like a breeze via the command gem install fselector the source_code is available https github com need fselector and is fully documentedfeature selection is of great_importance for building statistical_models when mining large_datasets of high_dimension such as those generated from microarray and mass_spectra analysis it proves to be effective in the data_mining and bioinformatics fields for reducing dimensionality selecting relevant and removing redundant features increasing predictive_accuracy and improving model interpretability depending on how they interact with the learning method various feature_selection techniques roughly fall into three categories filters wrappers and embedded methods filters investigate only the intrinsic characteristics of a given dataset and have the advantage of being fast as well as being independent of learning method basically there are two types of filters filter by feature weighting and filter by feature searching the former measures independently the relevance of each feature to the target problem according to a certain evaluation criterion it provides a weight or ranking list as output and features are usually selected based on a given threshold the latter also takes inter feature correlation into account and generates a subset of the original feature_set that tends to be both relevant and non redundant wrappers wrap around a specific learning method and conduct a search in the space of feature subset for optimal model performance they often report superior results than filters but coupled with increased computational load embedded methods seek a trade_off between performance and computational_cost by use of the internal information of a learning method in many applications specifically in bioinformatics the datasets are often huge with numerous samples and or very high_dimension features it is thus more practical to apply filters for feature_selection because of their computational_efficiency to this end we primarily implemented filters in fselector a wide_variety of feature_selection have been proposed in the past_decades however most of them are scattered in literature and not readily available to researchers feature_selection that come in a collection can be found in several machine_learning software such as pyml http pyml sourceforge net written in python and weka http www cs waikato ac nz ml weka written in java or serve as additional libraries for statistical platform including r http cran r project org_web fselector index html and matlab http featureselection asu edu software php ruby is a high_level dynamic scripting language with a focus on simplicity and productivity which has become increasingly popular in bioinformatics and other scientific research_fields to our best knowledge the only ruby package related to feature_selection is the feature_selection gem that implements only three algorithms https rubygems org gems feature_selection in this work we presented fselector providing a substantially larger collection of filters with feature_selection implemented in ruby fselector is a valuable ruby gem that offers easy and public access to prevalent feature_selection through a consistent interface we hope the rich collection of algorithms together with other utilities including various file_formats support auxiliary data pre_processing techniques and comprehensive help documentation will make fselector a useful tool for supporting various bioinformatics_research such as text_mining microarray_analysis and mass_spectra analysis
