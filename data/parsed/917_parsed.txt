systems_biology cepa an r package for finding significant pathways weighted by multiple network centralities cepa is an r package aiming to find significant pathways through network topology_information the package has several advantages compared with current pathway enrichment tools first pathway node instead of single gene is taken as the basic_unit when analysing networks to meet the fact that genes must be constructed into complexes to hold normal functions second multiple network centralities are applied simultaneously to measure importance of nodes from different aspects to make a full view on the biological system cepa extends standard pathway enrichment_methods which include both over representation analysis procedure and gene_set procedure cepa has been evaluated with high performance on real_world data and it can provide more information directly related to current biological_problems availability cepa is available at the comprehensive_r cran http cran r project org_web cepa biological_pathways are basic integrated circuits to actualize specific biological_process in regular biological system identifying significant pathways in which genes are perturbed is important for researchers to focus on the most relevant sets of genes finding significant pathways from expression data is a fundamental task in bioinformatics_analysis which is always named pathway_enrichment or gene_set currently there are two categories of methodologies on this subject over representation analysis ora and gene_set gsa the former takes a list of differentially_expressed and tries to find which pathways are enriched in the gene_list compared with background genes by a contingency_table one representative tool is david the gsa procedure uses the whole gene_expression matrix from microarray_experiments by first calculating gene level statistics in a pathway and then integrating into a pathway level score ora procedure is convenient for microarray_data with few replications and gsa procedure can generate more reliable conclusions on the analysis however current standard enrichment_methods are limited for revealing significant pathways because genes are treated identical in these procedures it should be noted that pathways are represented as networks thus importance of genes varies from different views of network_structure currently there are only a few works considering pathway topology the first category is to use topological information through a global network which is always constructed from the entire_genome the drawback is that such global network e g constructed from public proteinprotein interaction_database or predicted interactions would contain a lot of noise and is also not specific to biological conditions the second category is to design a pathway score to cover certain aspect of genes e g genes are called important when they locate in the upstream of pathways or when they directly regulate many other genes the limitation is that because of the complexity of biological_pathways such single_measurement cannot fully capture the characteristics of different genes here we proposed the r package cepa that extends standard gene_set enrichment_methods both of ora and gsa procedure with pathway topology_information in our previous work we have proved ora extension shows better performance than the standard one our method has two advantages first we take nodes rather than genes as the basic units when analysing pathways it is to the fact that genes must be assembled into complexes to achieve normal biological_functions also one single gene may locate in different nodes in real biological_systems according to our previous study on an existing pathway database there are genes_located in multiple nodes and nodes contain more than one gene second we use network centralities in the pathway as the weight of nodes and do not set a fixed measurement for the importance of genes but we allow multiple choices tested_simultaneously this feature enables users to look at the system from multiple aspects thus users can make more complete conclusions on current biological_problems the package is designed to be flexible so that it can implement many current gene_set enrichment_methods and various centrality measurements finally cepa generates informative and interactive report for the analysis and also supports parallel_computing to whom correspondence should be addressed
