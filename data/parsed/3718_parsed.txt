structural_bioinformatics probis algorithm for detection of structurally_similar protein binding_sites by local structural_alignment motivation exploitation of locally similar d patterns of physico_chemical on the surface of a protein for detection of binding_sites that may lack sequence and global structural conservation results an algorithm probis is described that detects structurally_similar sites on protein_surfaces by local surface_structure alignment it compares the query_protein to members of a database of protein d structures and detects with sub residue precision structurally_similar sites as patterns of physicochemical_properties on the protein surface using an efficient maximum clique algorithm the program identifies proteins that share local structural_similarities with the query_protein and generates structure based alignments of these proteins with the query structural similarity_scores are calculated for the query proteins surface_residues and are expressed as different colors on the query_protein surface the algorithm has been used successfully for the detection of proteinprotein proteinsmall ligand and protein dna_binding availability the software is available as a web_tool free of charge for academic users at http probis in the protein_data pdb there are presently protein_structures derived from structural genomic studies and of these have no known function binding_sites are closely_related to protein_function the identification of binding_sites in proteins is essential to an understanding of their interactions with ligands including other proteins many computational_tools for the analysis and prediction of binding_sites have been reported binding_sites can retain conservation of sequence and structure structural conservation however is more prevalent even in the absence of obvious sequence_similarity structural_similarity between two protein_structures can imply common_ancestry which in turn can suggest a similar function i e a binding_site however it is also possible for structurally_similar proteins to have different to whom correspondence should be addressed functions and similar folding by itself does not necessarily imply evolutionary_divergence in the case of divergent_evolution similarity is due to the common_origin such as accumulation of differences from homologous ancestral protein_structures in contrast convergent_evolution arises as a result of some sort of ecological or physical drivers toward a similar solution even though the structure has arisen independently a rough estimate is that the frequency of two different folds converging to a similar statistically_significant side chain pattern is it has been shown that convergent_evolution of enzyme binding_sites is not a rare phenomenon if a protein has no known function but a known d structure inferences concerning function can be made by comparison to other proteins recently a number of web_servers for local structural_alignment have become available these provide comparison of pre selected parts of proteins e g binding_sites user_defined structural_motifs against binding_sites or whole protein structural databases the multibind and mappis servers allow the identification of common spatial arrangements of physicochemical_properties such as h bond donor acceptor aliphatic aromatic or hydrophobic in a set of user provided protein binding_sites defined by interactions with small_molecules multibind or in a set of user provided proteinprotein_interfaces mappis others provide comparison of entire protein_structures against a number of user submitted structures unlike global_alignment approaches local structural_alignment approaches are suited to detection of locally conserved patterns of functional_groups which often appear in binding_sites and have significant involvement in ligand_binding in this article we describe an algorithm probis which in contrast to these methods enables local structural_alignment of entire protein surface_structure against a large database of protein_structures in reasonable time it detects structurally_similar regions in a query_protein by mapping structural similarity_scores on its surface the comparison involves geometry and physicochemical_properties and is conducted at the level of amino_acid functional_groups for each pairwise_comparison of the query_protein to a database protein the algorithm produces multiple local_alignments of the surface regions that are found in both no attempt is made to align the proteins globally and similar folding is not a requirement for a relationship between the two proteins since no presumptions about localization of binding_sites prior to comparison are used probis may detect new binding_sites and suggest ligands that these binding_sites may accommodate page probis detects structurally_similar regions and maps them on the surface of the appropriate protein_structures this is accomplished through the detection of high_quality local structural_alignments in a database of non redundant protein_structures the programs performance in detecting different types of binding_sites e g proteinsmall ligand proteinprotein proteindna has been studied on a set of protein_structures details of which are provided in supplementary_material the local structural similarity_scores generated by probis are effective predictors of protein binding_sites the predictions based solely on local structural_similarity are more accurate than those produced by consurf a protein surface mapping tool which depends upon sequence_conservation and which to our knowledge is the only available tool that maps sequence_conservation to protein_structure probis is also compared with q sitefinder a method which detects energetic features in protein_structures favorable for ligand_binding and has been benchmarked as a small ligand as well as protein protein binding_sites detection tool a detailed discussion of the results obtained by probis is provided in the case of biotin carboxylase and in the case of tata_binding tbp the unique ability of probis to detect and align similar binding_sites in protein_structures with different folds and to compare it with other global and local structural alignment_methods is described all experiments described here were performed on a threaded core processor personal computer on this computer pairwise local_alignment of two protein_structures with probis requires typically s and running probis jobs in parallel the nr pdb search with a query_protein of residues involving fast filtering followed by structural_similarity mapping takes min it is well known that protein binding_sites are structurally_similar and many methods exist that can structurally align proteins we introduce a new approach for the detection of binding_sites in a d protein_structure by searching for the locally similar surface_structures in a large database of protein_structures the maximum clique technique the core of the algorithm detects d correspondences between proteins at a sub residue_level local structural similarity_scores are calculated and mapped to the query_protein surface such prediction of binding_sites which depends on structural_similarity of protein_surfaces is useful and accurate and can enjoy success in structures with dissimilar folding patterns structural_similarity can provide additional advantages over sequence_conservation in the detection of functional_regions such as binding_sites and it is concluded that structural_comparison should be the method of choice when a crystallographic or nmr_structure for a protein of interest is available the probis algorithm for detection of structurally_similar binding_sites in proteins is freely_available as a web_tool detailed explanation and instructions to users of probis can be found at http probis cmm ki si
