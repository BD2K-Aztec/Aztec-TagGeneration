structural_bioinformatics skink a web_server for string kernel_based kink prediction in helices motivation the reasons for distortions from optimal helical geometry are widely unknown but their influences on structural changes of proteins are significant hence their prediction is a crucial problem in structural_bioinformatics here we present a new web_server called skink for string kernel_based kink prediction extending our previous study we also annotate the most probable kink position in a given helix sequence availability_and the skink web_server is freely_accessible at http biows inf zdv uni mainz de skink moreover skink is a module of the ball software also freely_available at www ballin our previous study we presented a new method for predicting kinks from amino_acid of helices implemented in the biochemical algorithm library ball using string kernel_based support_vector svm we were able to predict kinks in of all cases correctly exceeding recently reported accuracies of alternative_approaches to make our approach publicly_available by providing a user_friendly interface we developed the web_server skink moreover we annotate the most probable kink position and calculate the corresponding probability value described shortly in the section in consequence the region around the identified residue can be treated as flexible e g in molecular_dynamics md_simulations while the remainder of the helix can be restrained
