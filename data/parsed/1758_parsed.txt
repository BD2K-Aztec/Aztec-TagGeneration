sequence_analysis fast and sensitive mapping of bisulfite treated sequencing_data cytosine dna_methylation is one of the major epigenetic_modifications and influences gene_expression developmental_processes x_chromosome and genomic_imprinting aberrant_methylation is furthermore known to be associated with several diseases_including the gold_standard to determine dna_methylation on genome_wide scales is bisulfite_sequencing dna_fragments are treated with sodium_bisulfite resulting in the conversion of unmethylated_cytosines into uracils whereas methylated_cytosines remain_unchanged the resulting sequencing_reads thus exhibit asymmetric bisulfite related mismatches and suffer from an effective reduction of the alphabet size in the unmethylated regions rendering the mapping of bisulfite sequencing_reads computationally much more demanding as a consequence currently available read_mapping software often fails to achieve high_sensitivity and in many cases requires unrealistic computational_resources to cope with large real_life datasets results in this study we present a seed based_approach based on enhanced_suffix in conjunction with myers bit vector algorithm to efficiently extend seeds to optimal semi global alignments while allowing for bisulfite related substitutions it outperforms most current approaches in terms of sensitivity and performs time competitive in mapping hundreds of millions of sequencing_reads to vertebrate_genomes availability the software segemehl is freely_available atcytosine dna_methylation is one of the major epigenetic_modifications in eukaryotes the epigenetic_modification pathways governing dna_methylation are strongly coupled with each other hypermethylations in promotors of genes are associated with stable repression of its activity as in case of to whom correspondence should be addressed x_chromosome that can be maintained throughout cell_divisions during mammalian_development methylation patterns are largely rearranged in very early_stages methylation marks are erased to allow flexible short_term regulation by histone_modifications while wide_spread de_novo methylations in later stages enable long_term silencing of pluripotency related or imprinted_genes in mammalian_genomes dna_methylation also ensures genomic integrity by inactivating and immobilizing transposable_elements and hence preventing chromosomal_instability translocation or gene_disruption in cancer_cells this overall stable landscape of dna methylations is heavily distorted by widespread and massive hypomethylations e g in repetitive_sequences and by silencing of tumor_suppressor by hypermethylating their promotors capturing dna methylations on genome_wide scales in high_resolution has become technically and economically_feasible only with the advent_of hts technologies dna methylations are commonly captured either by sequencing methylated_dna that was isolated by antibodies or proteins as in methylated_dna immunoprecipitation and methyl_cpg based mbd isolated genome_sequencing or by sequencing dna_reads treated with sodium_bisulfite to selectively convert unmethylated_cytosines to uracils since the first approach merely enriches sequencing_reads with methylation marks by pull_down with antibodies or proteins it is not possible to accurately pinpoint frequency exact location and sequence_context of the modifications the isolation procedure is further biased towards enrichment of highly methylated regions sequencing_techniques based on bisulfite_treatment on the other hand facilitate single_base so that the methylation_state of each single cytosine can be analyzed thus they are capable of detecting intermediate methylation_levels in heterogeneous_samples or imprinted_genes one drawback of this method is the fact that hydroxymethylated cytosines present in some mammalian cell_types cannot be distinguished from methylation marks after conversion with sodium_bisulfite the role of the hydroxymethylation is not yet known but it might be involved in demethylation or alterations of the chromatin_structure due to its high_resolution and the possibility of unbiased genome_coverage bisulfite_sequencing has been established as the gold possible read types fw rc fw and rc in bisulfite_sequencing protocols methylated and unmethylated_cytosines in the genomic_sequence left are coloured in red and blue respectively and positions in the read sequences right derived from genomic cytosines are coloured correspondingly note that the intermediate conversion of unmethylated_cytosines into uracils after bisulfite_treatment is omitted standard method to capture dna_methylation in the earliest approach of this type reduced_representation by genomic_regions with cpg_dinucleotides are enriched by prior digestion with mspi more recent protocols avoid this bias both methylc seq and bs_seq are protocols for the construction of the bisulfitetreated libraries for hts they mainly differ in their amplification procedure while methylc seq involves only a single amplification bs_seq uses two amplification steps to ensure only fully bisulfiteconverted sequences to be amplified and hence sequenced in bs_seq first adapters containing unmethylated_cytosines are ligated to the dna_fragment after treatment with sodium_bisulfite the first amplification is performed using primers complementary to fully bisulfite converted adapters then digested with dnpi and again amplified using common solexa adapters this results in four different types of bisulfite reads fw and rc from the plus strand and fw and rc from the minus_strand in case of methylc seq only two of these read types fw and fw may occur and are expected to be sequenced at similar rate beyond the extensive study ofas part of the ucsd human reference epigenome mapping project the methylomes of silkworm honey_bee and human_peripheral have been analyzed by means of bisulfite_sequencing moreover this technology has been applied to identify methylation variations in epigenetic domains across cancer_types standard dnaseq mapping algorithms may run into problems when dealing with the potentially high number of converted cytosines in bisulfite sequencing_reads the bisulfite_conversion causes a large number of mismatches between read and reference_genome that should not be penalized the asymmetry of the resulting matching rule i e a genomic cytosine should match a thymine in the read but not vice_versa complicates the issue early bisulfite mapping methods used very time consuming strategies bsmap for instance iterates over all possible c t conversions cokusalignment uses an exhausting tree search with base probability vectors more recent methods either allow for asymmetric bisulfite related mismatches typically implemented by means of hash tables as in maq and rmap or use a collapsed alphabet so that the asymmetry is disregarded altogether in the latter type of methods each cytosine is converted to a thymine or guanine to adenine to match the minus_strand in the reads and in the genomic_sequence both bs seeker and bismark use bowtie to map the converted strings using different alignment policies the resulting alignments are then post processed to recover the methylated positions none of the available tools can account for insertions_and indels in the read_alignment this is a major_drawback since indels are known to be the predominant error type in sequencing_data and small_indels contribute significantly to the genetic_variation in human overall currently available bisulfite mappers may not be able to cope with higher_error potentially caused by erroneous pcr clones low quality reference_genomes extensive allelic variations or mapping to the genome of a closely_related organism for example the amphioxus genome exhibits substantial allelic_variation with snps and polymorphic indels in the ciona_intestinalis another important model_organism the average snp rate is but the variations are not uniformly_distributed and locally increase to within windows of nt segemehl is an efficient read_mapping tool based on suffix_arrays that readily accommodates indels using an extended version of the matching statistics in this study we demonstrate that the mapping of bisulfite sequencing_data can be incorporated into the framework using a hybrid_approach that combines seed searches in the suffix_array on a collapsed alphabet with optimal semi global alignments around seed matches using a specialized extension of myers bit vector algorithm
