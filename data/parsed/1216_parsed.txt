genome_analysis cssmd assessing collective_activity for addressing off target effects in genome_scale rna_interference screens motivation off target activity commonly exists in rna_interference rnai screens and often generates false_positives existing analytic_methods for addressing the off target effects are demonstrably inadequate in rnai confirmatory screens results here we present an analytic_method assessing the collective_activity of multiple short_interfering sirnas targeting a gene using this method we can not only reduce the impact of off target activities but also evaluate the specific effect of an sirna thus providing information about potential off target effects using in house rnai screens we demonstrate that our method obtains more reasonable and sensible results than current methods such as the redundant sirna activity rsa method the rnai gene enrichment ranking riger method the frequency approach and the t test rnai high_throughput hts is broadly used in the identification of genes associated with specific biological phenotypes however false_positives generated by non specific effects can lead to false leads and the use of resources to explore non productive research tracks to reduce the impact of off target effects to whom correspondence should be addressed i e the rnai mediated event in which unintended mrnas with sequence_homology to the rnai oligonucleotide are degraded in the screening process researchers typically examine the collective_activity of multiple sirnas i e sirna duplexes also called sirna singles with different sequences against a single target_gene the major reason for doing so is that the off target effects of these sirnas are likely to have different directions and thus may be cancelled out in their collective_activity whereas the on target effects of these sirnas should be in the same direction and may have substantial magnitude at least not be cancelled out when considered collectively accordingly analytic_methods try to capture the collective_activity of multiple sirnas targeting the same gene the straightforward analytic_method is the so_called frequency approach generally a gene is selected as a hit if at least of the sirnas against the gene are selected as hits for example two out of seven sirnas the frequency approach has two major_issues i it may produce contradictory results a gene may be selected as both upregulated and downregulated hits and ii it does not directly_assess all the collective_activity recently proposed the rsa method in which they examine the rank distribution of all sirnas targeting a gene and calculate the statistical_significance or p value of all sirnas targeting a gene being unusually distributed toward the top ranking slots based on an iterative hypergeometric_distribution equation a single p value is associated with a gene so that all sirnas for the same gene are assigned an identical p value a feature of this approach is that a gene with multiple moderately active sirnas is weighted more heavily than a gene with fewer active sirnas a potential_barrier for applying this approach is that it requires two arbitrary thresholds to initially define active sirnas and negative sirnas proposed the riger method that does not need such arbitrary thresholds the riger method assigns an enrichment score for a given gene according to the distribution of measured values of its sirnas within the rank list of all sirnas using a two sample weighted zc statistic based on the likelihoodratio the p value corresponding to the enrichment score for each gene is calculated in both rsa and riger methods the null_distribution is formed from all the sirnas in the entire list in an experiment however to limit experimental cost many genome_scale rnai screens do not use multiple sirnas against a gene in the primary screen in fact most genome_scale rnai screening projects start with a primary screen where thousands of sirna pools three to four sirna duplexes per well are investigated with or without replicates the hits from the primary screen without replicates are usually investigated in one or more confirmatory screens where each pool has replicates the genes selected from either primary or confirmatory screens are further investigated by designing multiple sirnas per gene in a screen the screen in which the phenotypic_effects of multiple sirnas per targeted gene are measured separately is called a deconvolution screen therefore most of the genes included in a deconvolution screen should have non zero effects consequently both rsa and riger methods are suitable for a primary screen where most sirnas should have no or very small effects they are inappropriate for a deconvolution screen where all sirnas are pre selected to have a large effect we present a method using the strictly standardized mean difference ssmd to directly_assess collective_activity of multiple sirnas targeting a gene ssmd can also be applied to one sirna pool or one sirna to distinguish these two types of ssmd we use cssmd to denote the ssmd for collective_activity of multiple sirnas like rsa and riger cssmd captures the collective_activity of multiple sirnas against a gene thus minimizing the impact of off target effects unlike rsa and riger the cssmd method does not form the null_distribution from all investigated sirnas in a screen thus it works effectively for both primary and confirmatory screens with multiple sirnas against a gene we use three in house rnai screening projects to demonstrate the utility of the cssmd method compared with the rsa riger t test and frequency approach to illustrate the utility of the cssmd method we applied them in three in house rnai projects for varicella_zoster vzv diabetes and alzheimers diseases
