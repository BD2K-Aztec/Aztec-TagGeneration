genomic_context analysis reveals dense interaction_network between vertebrate ultraconserved non coding elements motivation genomic_context analysis also known as phylogenetic profiling is widely used to infer functional interactions between proteins but rarely applied to non coding cis regulatory_dna we were wondering whether this approach could provide insights about utlraconserved non coding elements ucnes these elements are organized as large_clusters so_called gene regulatory blocks grbs around key_developmental genes their molecular_functions and the reasons for their high degree of conservation remain_enigmatic results in a special setting of genomic_context analysis we analyzed the fate of grbs after a whole_genome event in five fish genomes we found that in most cases all ucnes were retained together as a single block whereas the corresponding target_genes were often retained in two copies one completely_devoid of ucnes this winner takes all pattern suggests that ucnes of a grb function in a highly cooperative manner we propose that the multitude of interactions between ucnes is the reason for their extreme sequence_conservation genomic_context analysis is a comparative evolutionary approach to infer interactions between protein_coding the string database distinguishes three types of evolutionary evidence for interactions co occurrence in the same species co localization in the same chromosome_region and gene_fusion co occurrence analysis is the most widely_applicable variant and has been termed phylogenetic profiling the co localization or neighborhood criterion is primarily used in prokaryotes where genes participating in the same pathway are often arranged in a single operon gene_fusion is a less frequent event but probably constitutes the strongest type of evolutionary evidence that two proteins encoded by separate genes in some genomes physically interact with each other in principle genomic_context analysis should be applicable to non coding_sequences as well the neighborhood criterion is ideally_suited to infer interactions involving cis_acting regulatory_elements as such elements by definition have to reside on the same chromosome with their interaction_partners nevertheless with a notable_exception discussed further below genomic_context analysis has rarely or never been applied to non coding_sequences to whom correspondence should be addressed in this work we present an application of this method to vertebrate ultraconserved non coding sequence_elements henceforth referred to as ucnes vertebrate ucnes are the most conserved_sequences that exist in nature the term was originally coined bywho defined ultraconserved elements as sequence_regions that are at least bp_long and identical between human mouse and rat somewhat different definitions have been applied by other groups see in a previous work we defined ucnes as non coding elements that are at least bp_long and have evolved at a substitution_rate of per million years the reasons for ultraconservation remain_enigmatic no molecular_mechanism is known that would require such a high degree of conservation it is broadly accepted that a majority of ucnes act as tissue specific_enhancers a few may function as splicing regulators or as noncoding_rnas surprisingly genetically_altered mice_lacking particular ucnes were found to be viable with no detectable phenotype it could be argued that the phenotypes may be too mild to be recognized by human researchers but still severe enough to be removed by purifying_selection in nature over many generations a striking property of ucnes is their tendency to occur as large_clusters on the genome such clusters also referred to as genomic regulatory blocks grbs may comprise up to ucnes span over more than a megabase and include up to a dozen of genes within a grb the ucnes appear to be randomly localized with respect to genes with approximately_equal numbers located in introns and intergenic_regions respectively the order of individual_elements is strictly_conserved between distant vertebrate_species resulting in perfect synteny of the corresponding genes it is assumed that grbs in general have only one target_gene the other genes within the block are called bystander genes in an elegant and pioneering study bythe neighborhood principle of genomic_context analysis was used to discriminate between target and bystander genes of grbs in fish genomes for most vertebrate_species the neighborhood criterion would be useless because the synteny within grbs is perfectly conserved however the situation is radically different in teleost fishes which have undergone a lineage_specific whole_genome wgd after the wgd event most genes survived in only one copy and the same may be true for gene_regulatory as well within a duplicated grb bystander genes may be retained randomly by one or the other copy however the ucnes will always stay with their target_genes the availability of five fish genomes with potentially different gene loss histories after wgd increases the power of the method in fact numerous cases of reciprocal gene alternative_models of ucne action and corresponding retention patterns after whole_genome grey rectangles represent ucnes supposed to be remote_control elements the black circles represent the promoter of the target_gene not supposed to be ultraconserved a standalone model each ucne drives independently of the other ucnes the expression of the target_gene in one particular tissue b cooperative model the simultaneous activity of at least two ucnes is required for target gene_expression different combinations of ucnes drive expression in different tissues c reciprocal retention pattern after wgd expected under the stand alone model ucnes get randomly_distributed over the two daughter genes d winner takes all retention pattern expected under the cooperative model ucnes need to be retained by the same daughter gene in order to ensure expression in all tissues loss were observed between the lineages leading to zebrafish and tetraodon we should mention in this context that the fate of conserved non coding elements after wgd was also analyzed to address questions about subfunctionalization in this work we also exploit the wgd event that has happened in teleosts however we address a different question we are not primarily interested in ucnetarget gene relationships our focus is on cooperative interactions between ucnes within the same block specifically we use genomic_context analysis to discriminate between two models of ucne action which may be called standalone and cooperative the standalone model assumes that each ucne acts independently whereas the cooperative model assumes that two or more ucnes jointly drive expression of the target_gene in a particular tissue the two modes of gene_regulation are illustrated inwith a minimal grb consisting of three ucnes in the standalone mode each ucne drives gene_expression in one of three different tissues in the cooperative mode three different pairwise combinations drive the expression in three different tissues the fate of ucnes after wgd could potentially discriminate between these two scenarios if ucnes act independently of each other they will be randomly_distributed over the daughter genes if ucnes cooperate with one another they have to be jointly retained with one daughter gene we should mention that the discriminatory_power of this approach depends on two conditions i the target_genes are frequently retained in two copies after wgd and ii individual ucnes are frequently retained in only one copy fortunately these conditions are met as will become evident from the results presented further below the reminder of this article is organized as follows section_describes the computational protocols at a technical level in section we present two largely independent studies the first part centers on putative target_genes that are highly_enriched in intronic ucnes in the second part we analyze the fate of the most prominent grbs after wgd this part also includes a non technical description of the computational protocol used to trace back the individual pieces of duplicated grbs after potential synteny breaks conclusions and perspectives are presented in the last section in this work we have addressed the question whether ucnes of a grb act independently of one another or in a cooperative manner using a special setting of genomic_context analysis we presented evidence in support of the cooperative mode of action this cooperativity can be viewed as a second layer of combinatorial gene_regulation traditionally this concept has been applied to transcription_factor within a gene regulatory_region it has been argued that a great variety of different response behaviors could be achieved through different combinations of relatively few
