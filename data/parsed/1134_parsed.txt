genome_analysis condition specific target prediction from motifs and expression motivation it is commonplace to predict targets of transcription_factors tfs by sequence_matching with their binding_motifs however this ignores the particular condition of the cells gene_expression data can provide condition specific information as is e g exploited in motif enrichment_analysis results here we introduce a novel tool named condition specific target prediction cstp to predict condition specific targets for tfs from expression data measured by either microarray or rna_seq based on the philosophy of guilt by association cstp infers the regulators of each studied gene by recovering the regulators of its co expressed genes in contrast to the currently used methods cstp does not insist on binding_sites of tfs in the promoter of the target_genes cstp was applied to three independent biological_processes for evaluation purposes by analyzing the predictions for the same tf in three biological_processes we confirm that predictions with cstp are condition specific predictions were further compared with true tf_binding as determined by chip_seq chip we find that cstp predictions overlap with true binding_sites to a degree comparable with motif based_predictions although the two target sets do not coincide availability_and cstp is available via a web_based interface atgene expression is regulated at different levels and one important level is transcriptional_regulation transcription_factors tfs bind to promoter_regions of genes and induce or repress expression of the target_gene this may further drive downstream cellular_processes understanding of regulatory_processes at the transcriptional level is essential in understanding the regulation of biological_processes it remains_a for computational_biologists to develop effective methods for identifying transcriptional regulatory_interactions given available sequences and expression data to investigate transcriptional_regulation one popular strategy is for a given tf to find genes with the binding_motif in their promoters and those genes are supposed to be regulated by the tf many computational_tools such as match tfbs lenhard and and trap have been developed based on this strategy these tools rely on the description of the tf_binding in the form of a position_weight pwm pwm based_methods have been widely used in recovering transcriptional_targets in many biological_processes the shortcomings of pwm based_methods become apparent when comparing their results with experimental_data like gene_expression or tf location as determined by chromatin_immunoprecipitation with subsequent array hybridization or sequencing chipchip chip_seq all types of discrepancies can be observed pwm matches may not appear to be bound as determined by targets predicted based on the pwm method may not be affected in the studied biological_process on the other hand tfs may bind in places where there is no binding_motif and expression may change even though a genes promoter lacks a binding_site all this is not surprising though given the fact that pwm based prediction is a static sequence_based prediction that remains ignorant of the condition of the cell thus the problem of prediction of transcriptional_targets is an ill posed one as long as it only considers sequence and ignores the condition of the cell one way to include the condition of the cell in a rudimentary manner is by determining common regulatory_factors of coexpressed genes here the condition of the cell enters through the co expression this approach forms the basis of what is called overrepresentation analysis or motif enrichment in overrepresentation analysis tf_binding are searched in the promoter of each of the co expressed genes and then the fraction of genes possessing a certain tf binding_motif is judged based on statistical considerations a tf that is significantly_enriched is assumed to regulate its targets among the co expressed genes an underlying assumption is that co expressed genes are co regulated one caveat of course is that due to the cascades of gene_regulation a co expressed group may be due to many tfs acting serially rather than one tf being responsible for all observed expression changes in this article we extend overrepresentation analysis and put forward a strategy cstp to perform condition specific target prediction within a specific biological_process in cstp we determine the co expressed genes for each studied gene and then apply overrepresentation analysis to predict their potential_regulators based on a philosophy of guilt by association we make a key assumption that a regulator for the co expressed to whom correspondence should be addressed group will in particular regulate its centroid gene which is called core gene thus the result of a cstp prediction is a set of predicted tftarget relationships between tfs that have been identified by overrepresentation analysis and core genes that are used as the centroid of co expressed groups because the regulators are inferred from such a group of co expressed genes there is no strict requirement that the predicted target actually possesses the respective binding_site in its promoter thus one can in principle predict regulatory_interactions even in the absence of a binding_motif in the promoter the prediction also reflects the condition of the cell via the co expression_patterns cstp has been implemented as a web_based that takes user provided expression data and outputs regulatory_interactions between predicted tfs and genes
