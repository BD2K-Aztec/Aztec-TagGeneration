genome_analysis smethillium spatial normalization method for illumina_infinium dna_methylation is a major epigenetic_modification in human cells illumina humanmethylation beadchip makes it possible to quantify the methylation_state of loci spanning genes we developed a non parametric normalization method to correct the spatial background_noise in order to improve the signal_to the prediction_performance of the proposed method was assessed on three fully methylated samples and three fully unmethylated dna samples we demonstrate that the spatial normalization outperforms beadstudio to predict the methylation_state of a given locus dna_methylation is a major epigenetic_modification that regulates transcription by gene_silencing and have a role in the protection of chromosomal integrity methylation occurs in cytosines which precede guanines in dinucleotide called cpgs illumina humanmethylation beadchip is a valuable technology for genome_wide screen of dna_methylation as any microarray_technology beadchip suffers from spatial artifact that requires a correction in order to improve the signal_to to our knowledge the methylumi r package is the only one to deal with illumina methylation beadchip but does not address the spatial correction the proposed method smethillium consists of a spatial correction of the background_noise a probe summarization and a confidence assessment the performance of the method is evaluated on six real_samples with known methylation states to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as figures and shows that the spatial normalization allows a better separation between the methylation_state than the illuminas proprietary software beadstudio this is confirmed by the global criterion in our method allows a better concentration of the beta values around their expected value allowing the possibility to better identify intermediate_state such as hemi methylation for a l threshold of the global performance criterion is after smethillium normalization with beadstudio and without normalization raw we developed a non parametric spatial normalization method that improves the signal_to allowing a more reliable prediction of the methylation_state as compared with beadstudio the method is implemented in r and publicly_available we recommend the user to use in house experiments in order to define the most optimal l threshold for their data
