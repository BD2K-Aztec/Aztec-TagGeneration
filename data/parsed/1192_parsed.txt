genetics_and cpgfilter model based cpg probe filtering with replicates for epigenome_wide the development of the infinium_humanmethylation enables epigenome_wide at a reduced_cost one observation of the k data is that many cpg_sites the beadchip interrogates have very large measurement errors including these noisy cpgs will decrease the statistical_power of detecting relevant associations due to multiple_testing we propose to use intra_class icc which characterizes the relative_contribution of the biological_variability to the total variability to filter cpgs when technical repli cates are available we estimate the icc based on a linear mixed_effects by pooling all the samples instead of using the technical_replicates only an ultra_fast algorithm has been developed to address the computational_complexity and cpg filtering can be completed in minutes on a desktop computer for a k data_set of over samples our method is very flexible and can accommodate any replicate design simulations and a real_data application demonstrate that our whole sample icc method performs better than replicate sample icc or variance based method availability_and cpgfilter is implemented in r and publicly_available under cran via the r package cpgfilter recent_advances in genomic technologies have enabled researchers to conduct large_scale studies of human disease associated epigenetic variation specifically variation in dna_methylation such epigenome_wide ewas have helped elucidate the non genetic_determinants of human disease the illumina_infinium which interrogates the methylation_level of more than k cpg_sites throughout the human_genome has been increasingly popular in large_scale ewas due to its good genome_coverage high_reproducibility and lower cost sandoval one observation of the k data is that many cpgs have relatively larger technical variability compared with their biological_variability which are results of either large absolute technical variability the methylation_level cannot be measured accurately or lower biological_variability many cpgs are constitutively methylated or unmethylated these cpgs are less informative and including these cpgs will reduce the statistical_power to discover relevant cpg_sites by unnecessarily increasing the number of statistical_tests hence cpg filtering could potentially boost statistical_power for underpowered studies traditional variance based cpg filter is based on the total variability which is the sum of the biological_variability signal and technical variability noise however we are more interested in retaining cpgs with relatively large biological_variability instead of total variability as with any hybridization based array technology cpg probes differ in their technical variability possibly due to inexact probe sequence match crosshybridization and local secondary_structures therefore large total variability does not necessarily reflect large biological_variability without technical_replicates the assessment of technical variability is difficult and we can only rely on the total variability to filter cpgs fortunately most ewas have included some technical_replicates to assess various sources of batch_effects we can therefore use these replicates to assess technical variability we propose to use intra_class icc which is defined as the ratio of biological_variability to total variability to filter cpg probes the method using technical_replicates only our method can result in more efficient icc estimate since the unreplicated samples provide significant amount of information about the biological_variability our method can accommodate any type of replicate design including unbalanced design we have implemented an ultra_fast algorithm to fit lmm in linear computational time and the algorithm is highly scalable we compare our whole sample icc method to the replicate sample icc method byas well as the total_variance based method using simulations we simulate cpgs and independent samples among which samples are replicated twice let r n uniform and r uniform we then simulate the methylation m values based on the model and rank these cpgs based on icc or variance after applying the three alternatives we calculate the spearman_correlation between the resulted ranking and the ranking based on the simulated true qs which is assumed to be the best simulations are repeated_times shows our whole sample icc method_produces invariably better ranking than the other two methods median correlation vs and we next study the effects of icc based cpg filtering on the type_i and power of association tests using realistic simulations supplementary note s cpgs with small iccs will have no or little chance of showing significance and removing these cpgs will enrich signals against a background of noise as expected using bonferroni_correction and false_discovery control for multiple comparison correction the proposed method has achieved better power than the replicate sample icc method while controlling the type_i at the desired_level simulation also suggests at least six technical replicate pairs to achieve good results we apply our method to a cleaned k dataset of methylation_sites from buffy_coat leukocytes of males and technical replicate pairs from the normative aging study we conduct an epigenome wide cross_sectional analysis of age median range_years based on a linear_model adjusting for subject_characteristics estimated cell_type proportions and technical covariates strict bonferroni_correction isused to select significant cpg_sites clearly these sites are dramatically enriched in large icc values we see that of the sites associated with age come from those with an icc greater than the median we also see sites with an estimated icc of zero indicating much larger technical variability measurement_error compared with their biological_variability in comparison with the icc method if we had only used the sites with total_variance above the median we would have captured only of the sites associated with age in the full analysis supplementary in general an icc cutoff of around provides a good tradeoff between loss of potential significant cpg_sites due to filtering and gain of power due to reduction of multiple testing burden supplementary
