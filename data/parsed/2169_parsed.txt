sequence_analysis harnessing virtual machines to simplify next_generation analysis motivation the growth of next_generation ngs has not only dramatically accelerated the pace of research in the field of gen omics but it has also opened the door to personalized_medicine and diagnostics the resulting flood of data has led to the rapid development of large_numbers of bioinformatic_tools for data analysis creating a challenging situation for researchers when choosing and configuring a variety of software for their analysis and for other researchers trying to replicate their analysis as ngs_technology continues to expand from the research environment into clinical_laboratories the challenges associated with data analysis have the potential to slow the adoption of this technology results here we discuss the potential of virtual machines vms to be used as a method for sharing entire installations of ngs software bioinformatic pipelines vms are created by programs designed to allow multiple operating_systems to co exist on a single physical machine and they can be made following the object oriented paradigm of encapsulating data and methods together this allows ngs_data to be distributed within a vm along with the pre configured software for its analysis although vms have historically suffered from poor_performance relative to native operating_systems we present bench marking results demonstrating that this reduced performance can now be minimized we further discuss the many potential benefits of vms as a solution for ngs_analysis and describe several published examples lastly we consider the benefits of vms in facilitating the introduction of ngs_technology into the clinical_environment contact
