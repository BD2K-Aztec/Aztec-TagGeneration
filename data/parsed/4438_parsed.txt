systems_biology strengths and limitations of microarray_based phenotype prediction lessons_learned from the improver diagnostic signature challenge motivation after more than a decade since microarrays were used to predict phenotype of biological_samples real_life applications for disease screening and identification of patients who would best benefit from treatment are still emerging the interest of the scientific_community in identifying best approaches to develop such prediction_models was reaffirmed in a competition style international_collaboration called improver diagnostic signature challenge whose results we describe herein results fifty four teams used public data to develop prediction_models in four disease areas including multiple_sclerosis lung_cancer psoriasis and chronic_obstructive and made predictions on blinded new data that we generated teams were scored using three metrics that captured various aspects of the quality of predictions and best performers were awarded this article_presents the challenge results and introduces to the community the approaches of the best overall three performers as well as an r package that implements the approach of the best overall team the analyses of model performance data submitted in the challenge as well as additional simulations that we have performed revealed that i the quality of predictions depends more on the disease endpoint than on the particular approaches used in the challenge ii the most important modeling factor e g data preprocessing feature_selection and classifier type is problem dependent and iii for optimal results datasets and methods have to be carefully matched biomedical factors such as the disease_severity and confidence in diagnostic were found to be associated with the misclassification rates across the different teams availability the lung_cancer dataset is available from gene_expression accession gse the mapredictdsc r package implementing the approach of the best overall team is available at www bioconductor org or http bioinformaticsprb microarrays were introduced in life_science research as a practical means to measure whole_genome expression levels typical experiments involving microarray_technologies were designed to gain biological_insights into various conditions but also to discover new and predict predefined disease_phenotypes for instance breast_tumors were classified based on their molecular_profiles more than a decade_ago and progress has been steady and promising yet practical_applications of microarrays in patient_care are only emerging a recent comparison of three microarray based_classifiers for breast_cancer subtyping blueprint mammaprint and targetprint concluded that multigene assays were more reliable than clinicopathological criteria alone for the clinical_management of breast_cancer patients pharmacogenetic pgx testing is an essential part of personalized_medicine which aims to predict an individuals risk for adverse drug response or treatment outcome recently reviewed how pgx tests are accepted in the us in terms of coverage by the largest health_insurance although there is no us food_and fda_approved test available for oncotypedx a gene assay that can predict year distant breast cancer_recurrence it is covered by most major health insurances allomapgene test that can assess the risk of cardiac_allograft following a heart_transplant similarly lacks fda_approval but it is considered beneficial by a number of health insurances in contrast although the mammaprint test to whom correspondence should be addressed gene profile for prognostic and predictive tumor analysis is approved by fda it has rather limited insurance_coverage apparently fda_approval is neither a prerequisite nor sufficient for the acceptance of a given test rather independent review by insurance_companies and confidence by the clinicians and patients may be the main factors that influence the uptake of a new pgx test we postulate that better and more standard methods to verify diagnostic pgx tests would facilitate acceptance by regulatory_agencies and healthcare_providers and hasten deployment to the public recently the industrial methodology for process verification in research improver was designed as a methodology to validate industrial research processes related to systems_biology as a first initiative of the improver project the diagnostic signature challenge dsc was designed to determine to what extent transcriptomic_data can be used for phenotype prediction and to test which computational_approach works best for this end participants in the challenge were asked to produce a prediction model classifier that can infer the phenotype of biological_samples from gene_expression data for five different endpoints the teams were ranked based on the prediction_performance on test datasets generated by the organizers for details see the methods section the purpose of this article is threefold one to describe the improver dsc results including classification_performance on each endpoint scoring methodology and overall ranking of the teams as well as ranking stability with respect to the composition of the test datasets two to introduce the methods of the top three overall performers and discuss the performance of an ensemble classifier that aggregates the predictions from best models submitted in the challenge and three to identify some of the sources of variability in the classification_performance including biomedical factors and point toward the best alternatives at each step in the classification pipeline performance data from the models submitted to the improver dsc and from post challenge computational studies are used to support our findings we conclude this article with a summary of the main observations and discuss their relevance
