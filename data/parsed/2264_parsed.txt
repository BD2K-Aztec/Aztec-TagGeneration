ibs an illustrator for the presentation and visualization of biological_sequences biological sequence diagrams are fundamental for visualizing various functional_elements in protein or nucleotide_sequences that enable a summarization and presentation of existing information as well as means of intuitive new discoveries here we present a software_package called illustrator of biological_sequences ibs that can be used for representing the organization of either protein or nucleotide_sequences in a convenient efficient and precise manner multiple options are provided in ibs and biological_sequences can be manipulated recolored or rescaled in a user_defined mode also the final representational artwork can be directly exported into a publication quality figure availability_and the standalone package of ibs was implemented_in while the online service was implemented in html and javascript both the standalone package and online service are freely_available ibs a concise delicate and precise picture can afford a great advantage over description alone the graphical_representation of biological_sequences with various functional_elements is fundamental for the efficient introduction and interpretation of scientific_findings obtained in the course of the investigation of molecular biological_functions at present biologists mainly use microsoft powerpoint adobe illustrator or photoshop to diagram biological_sequences however these software_packages were developed for the general propose of image manipulation so it is difficult to use them to prepare a sequence organization diagram of sufficient accuracy for example the scale of functional_elements such as dna motifs and protein_domains is typically approximated even judged by eye also when using these tools neither the locations nor the positions of functional_elements can be precisely designated in the biological_sequences the first attempt at providing a professional illustrator of mydomains for biological_sequences was made by the prosite database using the tool the functional_domains and sites of a protein_sequence can be drawn to a precise scale up to six different shapes and four different color modes are supported in the diagramming of the protein_domains however a pre defined script that specifies the precise positions of the function domains or sites must be provided before generating a protein domain graph dog in our group also developed a software_package called dog for plotting protein graphs in a step_by manner although dog was specifically_designed for protein diagramming a number of researchers still used it for visualizing the functional_elements of nucleotide_sequences however dog is not an optimal tool for the visualization of nucleotide_sequences since it lacks of drawing elements for nucleotide domains in this regard the development of a new software_package for the purpose of diagramming both protein and nucleotide_sequences is awaited in this work we present a new tool called illustrator of biological_sequences ibs for assisting biologists in drawing publicationquality diagrams of both protein and nucleotide_sequences abundant graphical elements are available for representing functional_elements or regulatory_molecules for both protein and nucleotide_sequences the standalone packages of ibs were implemented_in and supported three major operating_systems including windows linux and mac os we anticipate this powerful_tool to be a great help to biologists for the purpose of visualizing biological_sequences here we have developed a novel software called ibs which is dedicated to the illustration of biological sequence organization ibs was equipped with many features that are specifically_designed for drawing both protein and nucleotide_sequences notably ibs was implemented with a configurable database visualization interface which allows users to directly retrieve and specify annotations from uniprot database for the visualization in the near future more different annotations from other databases will be integrated for example the nucleotide_sequence organizations from ncbi genbank and the cancer somatic_mutation information from tcga thus we believe that ibs is a useful tool for the biology research_community allowing the representation of findings in a simpler and more intuitive way
