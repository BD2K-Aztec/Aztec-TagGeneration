databases_and metitree a web_application to organize and process high_resolution multi_stage mass_spectrometry metabolomics_data identification of metabolites using high_resolution multi_stage mass_spectrometry ms n data is a significant challenge demanding access to all sorts of computational infrastructures metitree is a user_friendly web_application dedicated to organize process share visualize and compare ms n data it integrates several features to export and visualize complex ms n data facilitating the exploration and interpretation of metabolomics experiments a dedicated spectral tree viewer allows the simultaneous presentation of three related types of ms n data namely the spectral_data the fragmentation tree and the fragmentation reactions metitree stores the data in an internal database to enable searching for similar fragmentation_trees and matching against other ms n data as such metitree contains much functionality that will make the difficult_task of identifying unknown metabolites much easier availability metitree is accessible atmetabolite identification is a challenging but essential step for the interpretation and understanding of many biological_processes for an increasing number of applications such as biomarker_discovery drug_discovery or nutritional studies the feasibility of using multi_stage mass_spectrometry ms n for identification of metabolites has been shown before the complexity of the data generated demands new computational infrastructures to organize the data and to extract relevant_information recently databases have been set up for storing fragmentation spectra such as ms n data e g massbank and tools have been developed to process ms n data e g the mef tool rojas chertot al or to compare ms n data e g mass frontier thermo fisher scientific in this article we present a web_application called metitree with the novelty that it combines the processing of high_resolution ms n data with a personal local library to organize the fragmentation data furthermore it allows the comparison of ms n data to help the researcher with the identification of metabolites metitree is available at http www metitree nl together with some test ms n data the growing interest in metabolite_identification has increased the need to create computational and visual tools for ms n analysis metitree which gathers several in house developed tools is an easy to use web_application that combines processing sharing visualizing and querying ms n data to help researches to identify metabolites of interest and decrease the time consuming task of identifying metabolites overview of the metitree process flow after the user submits ms n spectra metitree will process these according to a set of parameters afterwards the processed data can be stored in an internal library and labeled as a reference compound using the inchi identifier the results are presented in different formats and viewers which facilitates the exporting of text and figures for their use in reports and publications a finally ms n data can be queried to find similar ms n data in the library b and the query results are presented in a list
