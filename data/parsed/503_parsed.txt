a simple statistical_test to infer the causality of target phenotype correlation from small_molecule phenotypic screens motivation cell based phenotypic screens using small_molecule is an important technology for early drug_discovery if the relationship between the disease related cellular_phenotype and inhibitors biological_targets can be determined however chemical_inhibitors are rightfully believed to be less specific than perturbation by biological_agents such as antibody and small inference rna therefore it is often a challenge in small_molecule phenotypic screening to infer the causality between a particular cellular_phenotype and the inactivation of the responsible protein due to the off target effect of the inhibitors results in this article we present a roche in house effort of screening structurally_diverse compounds for their cytotoxicity in hela_cells measured by high_content technology these compounds were also systematically profiled for the targeted and off target binding_affinity to a panel of pre selected protein_kinases in a cell_free system in an effort to search for the kinases whose activities are crucial for cell_survival we found that the simple association method such as the chi_square yields a large_number because the observed cytotoxic phenotype is likely to be the result of promiscuous action of less specific_inhibitors instead of true consequence of inactivation of single relevant target we demonstrated that a stratified categorical_data analysis technique such as the cochranmantelhaenszel test is an effective approach to extract the meaningful biological connection from the spurious correlation resulted from confounding covariates this study indicates that empowered by appropriate statistical adjustment small_molecule perturbation remains a powerful_tool to pin down the relevant biomarker for drug_safety and efficacy research contact in the past drug_discovery heavily relied upon cell based phenotypic screening in which the drug_candidates that induce the to whom correspondence should be addressed desired cellular_phenotype are discovered first and the molecular_mechanism of action mmoa is identified later the completion of the human_genome and the emergence of omic type technologies such as rna microarrays greatly_increase the expectation of disease target oriented drug_discovery however the productivity of the pharmaceutical_industry keeps declining despite all these technological innovations as a result we have recently seen phenotypic screening regain the momentum in delivering promising drug_candidates the challenge however lies on the elucidation of molecular_mechanism by which the candidate compounds elicit the cellular_phenotype of interest which is always important for understanding disease and medicine and serve as the basis for the further pre clinical development in recent_years pharmaceutical_industries have keen interest in developing therapeutic small_molecules targeting protein_kinases a gene_family implicated in cancer and inflammation however it is proven difficult to determine the crucial targets responsible for pathological phenotype in a protein_kinase focused phenotypic screen due to the off target_behaviors of small_molecules many kinase_inhibitors demonstrate broad cross_reactivity to the family of protein_kinases which share a conserved atp binding_pocket prone to competitive interaction in this study we described the profiling of structurally_diverse compounds for their in vitro kinase inhibiting properties and cytotoxicity a cellular_phenotype regarded as a typical surrogate for early safety and efficacy assessment we devised a three step statistical_framework to facilitate the identification of protein_kinases whose inactivation is responsible for compound induced_cytotoxicity general association methods that correlate blockage of kinases with cytotoxicity such as the chi_square was first performed to generate a potential target list then a logistic regression_model is conducted to confirm the suspected covariate that confounds with the inhibitors targeted effect therefore may interfere with causal_inference finally a stratified categorical analysis such as the cochranmantelhaenszel cmh test is conducted across the entire level of confounding covariates to identify the causal target whose significance is independent of an inhibitors cross_reactivity we are also able to use literature knowledge and experimental_data to validate the resulting targets unveiled by the cmh test this study demonstrates the necessity for a rigorous_statistical correction in order to make accurate inference from data_sources influenced by latent confoundingbesides gene knock_out models and small_interference technology gene function can be studied by chemical genetics using small_molecule intervention in the format of phenotypic screening nevertheless chemical perturbation studies are vulnerable to the bias caused by the cross_reactivity of compound this is particularly true for kinase_inhibitors because the targets of inhibitors share a highly_conserved substrate_binding in this study we show that this issue can be at least partially tackled by following a three step statistical correction association identification confounding_factor confirmation confounding_factor adjustment in order to infer causality of cytotoxicity by the inhibition of house_keeping kinases supplementary stratifying compound library based on the overall inhibitor cross_reactivity is an effective strategy to reduce the type i errors for target_identification arising from grossly promiscuous action of non specific_inhibitors yet it does not entirely solve the causality issue for a relatively specific_inhibitor which binds to both the real target and a small number of non relevant kinases currently this adjustment invalidates the majority of kinases that have been listed to be significant for cell homeostasis by regular association methods such as the chi_square consistent with this result our survey of biological_literature also indicates that many kinases on the list indeed should not be essential to the basic homeostasis of cells for instance c src knock_out mice exhibit largely normal phenotype except in osteoblast most likely owing to the compensatory roles played by lyn and yes the two close homologs of c src on the other hand kdr gene_knockout in mice is embryonic_lethal due to the defect in early hematopoiesis and endothelial development however it is in doubt whether these angiogenesis related functions would be crucial for the survival of hela_cells a human cervical_carcinoma cell_line more revealingly all the highly_specific potent inhibitors against c src and kdr identified in this compound library only show mild toxic phenotype measured by cytotoxicity index conversely the specific potent inhibitors for aurora a and par b kinase both of which remain_significant after the cmh adjustment lead to much higher degrees of toxicity besides the strong experimental_evidences aurora a kinase is well known for its essential role in mitosis and the kinase null_mice die at very early embryonic_stage due to the compromised spindle_assembly danusertib a potent_inhibitor for aurora a is currently in phase_i for the treatment of various advanced solid_tumors the experimental_evidence for the role of par b is less clear because the most potent and selective par b inhibitor ic m we identified in this study also inhibits seven other kinases with low_affinity the combinatorial knock_out of par b and par a its closely homologous_gene is embryonic_lethal raising the possibility of inhibitors cross_reactivity to par a that is not included in our kinase panel this approach has limitations it foremost demands the extensive off target profile be generated for all compounds before it can be statistically adjusted which is not always available however our analysis offers compelling_evidence that a snapshot of cross_reactivity index from a restricted panel of targets can serve as a good surrogate for a more comprehensive screen which might have prohibitive cost meanwhile the public database such as pubchem may also serve as an important resource for information on the interaction profiles of interested chemicals to various biological_entities secondarily our approach_requires large_numbers of compounds with high_diversity to be screened in order to gain sufficient_statistical the pool of potent inhibitors with toxicity also needs to be large enough so that they can be stratified in order for adjustment of covariates another downside of protein_family focused screen is that the interaction of inhibitors with random targets outside the targeted protein_family is overlooked this limitation can only be circumvented by using more compounds in that the general_pattern drawn from a large library is less likely to be influenced by the opportunistic off target effects outside the gene_family that have been screened
