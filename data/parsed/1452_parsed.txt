genetics_and dmgwas dense module searching for genome_wide in protein_protein motivation an important question that has emerged from the recent success of genome_wide gwas is how to detect genetic signals beyond single markers genes in order to explore their combined effects on mediating complex_diseases integrative testing of gwas association data with that from prior_knowledge databases and proteome studies has recently gained attention these methodologies may hold_promise for comprehensively examining the interactions between genes underlying the pathogenesis of complex_diseases methods here we present a dense module searching dms method to identify candidate subnetworks or genes for complex_diseases by integrating the association_signal from gwas datasets into the human proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network the dms method extensively searches for subnetworks enriched with low p value genes in gwas datasets compared with pathway based_approaches this method introduces flexibility in defining a gene_set and can effectively utilize local ppi_information results we implemented the dms method in an r package which can also evaluate and graphically represent the results we demonstrated dms in two gwas datasets for complex_diseases i e breast_cancer and pancreatic_cancer for each disease the dms method successfully identified a set of significant modules and candidate_genes including some well studied genes not detected in the single marker analysis of gwa studies functional_enrichment and comparison with previously_published showed that the genes we identified by dms have higher association_signal availability dmgwas package and documents are available atgenome wide association studies gwas have revealed hundreds of common_variants conferring susceptibility to common diseases according to the national_human nhgri catalog of published genome_wide there have been snps reported in publications as of july http www genome gov gwastudies although the discovered single_nucleotide snps greatly expanded our knowledge of the molecular_mechanisms of common diseases only limited heritability has been explained and it still remains_unclear how these markers genes interact and confer a predisposition to disease depending on the underlying genetic_structure of diseases it is possible that many markers genes having low or moderate risk in and of themselves interact to confer a significant combined effect so_far gwas data analysis has largely focused on single marker discovery however at the stringent genome_wide significance_level of p many markers that are truly but weakly associated with disease often fail to be detected novel statistical or computational_methods to detect the combined effect of a set of genes may provide useful alternative_approaches in gwas recently integrative_analysis of gwas data with other highthroughput datasets has been shown to be effective in the examination of multiple_variants combined effect one example is the application of gene_set based_methods to systematically examine gene_sets typically in the form of biological_pathways or functional_groups using gwas datasets representative examples_include gene_set gsea adapted from the original microarray_expression analysis the snp ratio test o and the hypergeometric_test these methods search for significantly_enriched gene_sets collected from predefined canonical pathways or functional_annotations such as gene_ontology go terms however by sorting genes into classical pathways or functional_categories the results of these methods might be over limited to a priori_knowledge e g predefined gene_sets and thus make it difficult to identify a meaningful combination of genes realizing this problem suggested that investigators group genes by cellular_functions instead of classical pathways assuming that genetic_variation might converge on components acting across pathways however this strategy requires strong disease specific background_knowledge and still uses predefined gene_sets another limitation is the incomplete annotation of pathways or go annotations in the current knowledgebase the proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network based_approach may largely overcome_these because it allows flexibility in setting the components of a gene_set this approach has recentlypage
