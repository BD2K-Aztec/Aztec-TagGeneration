icarus visualizer for de_novo evaluation data visualization plays_an in ngs_data analysis with advances in both sequencing and computational technologies it has become a new bottleneck in gen omics studies indeed evaluation of de_novo genome_assemblies is one of the areas that can benefit from the visualization however even though multiple quality_assessment methods are now available existing visualization_tools are hardly suitable for this purpose here we present icarusa novel genome visualizer for accurate assessment and analysis of genomic draft assemblies which is based on the tool quast icarus can be used in studies where a related reference_genome is available as well as for non model_organisms the tool is available online and as a standalone application availability and implementationdozens of assembly algorithms have been developed in recent_years unfortunately none of them is perfect several evaluation studies showed that genome_size coverage depth sequencing_technology and many other aspects may dramatically affect quality of genome_assembly thus it is challenging to create a universal assembly approach and an everyday tool for assembly evaluation and comparison is needed for choosing the best algorithm for a specific experiment quast is a commonly used tool for quality_assessment of genome_assembly it computes a full range of assembly quality_metrics such as n number of erroneous contigs covered genes etc one of the main drawbacks of the tool is a lack of proper visualization of assemblies and their alignment to the reference_genome genome_browsers have proven to be instrumental in genomic studies it is not a coincidence that there are now a great variety of interactive visualization_tools which include ucsc_genome integrative genome viewer and many others the most successful genome_browsers are adapted to specific analysis goals and it is unlikely that a universal tool for genomics analysis is practical by quast e g misassemblies icarus is an open_source and it is freely_available as a web_tool and as a command_line utility inspired by genomic_data browsing software we developed icarus a browser for quality_assessment and comparison of draft assemblies icarus engine is based on quast a tool for de_novo evaluation and complements its output with interactive_visualizations of contig alignments features and errors as an open_source project our web_based and command_line can be easily utilized by the research_community we believe that icarus will also help developers of assembly algorithms to improve their methods
