nbspred a support_vector based high_throughput pipeline for plant_resistance protein nbslrr prediction the nucleotide_binding leucine_rich nbslrrs belong to one of the largest known families of disease_resistance genes that encode resistance proteins r protein against the pathogens of plants various defence_mechanisms have explained the regulation of plant immunity but still we have limited understanding about plant defence against different pathogens identification of r proteins and proteins having r protein like features across the genome tran scriptome and proteome would be highly useful to develop the global understanding of plant defence_mechanisms but it is laborious and time consuming task therefore we have developed a support_vector based high_throughput pipeline called nbspred to differentiate nbslrr and nbslrr like protein from non nbslrr proteins from genome transcriptome and protein_sequences the pipeline was tested and validated with input_sequences from three dicot and two monocot plants including arabidopsis_thaliana boechera stricta brachypodium_distachyon solanum lycopersicum and zea_mays availability_and the nbspred pipeline is available at http soilecology biol lu se nbs r proteins are well known as plant defence proteins against pathogens that contain different domains like nucleotide_binding nb arc leucine_rich lrr toll interleukin like receptor tir coiled coiled cc and kinase kin five different kinds of r protein domain association categories were found as majority including tir nbs_lrr tnl cc nbs_lrr cnl receptor like kinase receptor like proteins and last category others a number of hypotheses have been proposed for explaining the regulation of plant immunity against pathogens such as the guard hypothesis the receptorligand hypothesis and the structure based functional hypothesis but several questions are still unanswered how many r genes need to be expressed to acquire resistance against microorganisms acting as pathogens in plants how many other proteins are involved directly_or in the resistance process how is the dynamic intracellular localization achieved as the majority of nucleotide_binding leucine_rich nbslrr proteins lack signal_peptides currently sequence and motif similarity domain matching and domain association based_methods are in use each demanding a lot of data_processing and time for genome_wide identification of r proteins disease_resistance analysis and gene orthology drago pipeline of the prg database is also based on blast_search and domain analysis whereas the nlr parser is based on mast motif search prediction of r proteins on the basis of sequence and domain similarity with a small set of reference r genes is challenging due to the high_level of diversity as r genes are under high selection_pressure to adapt their immunity to the rapidly_evolving effector_genes in the pathogens experimental screening of r genes in plants would be difficult to perform at large_scale but presently a large number of plant_genomes and transcriptomes have been sequenced and assembled despite data availability identification of nbslrr sequences in sequenced plants is still limited at large_scale with present available tools nowadays machinelearning techniques are used much more efficiently for answering biological_questions as a solution the nbspred an automated pipeline have been proposed by using support_vector svm technique nbspred is facilitating the high_throughput identification of nbslrr sequences from genome transcripts and protein_sequences as input
