structural_bioinformatics xwalk computing and visualizing distances in cross_linking experiments motivation chemical_cross of proteins or protein_complexes and the mass_spectrometry based localization of the cross_linked amino_acids in peptide_sequences is a powerful method for generating distance_restraints on the substrates topology results here we introduce the algorithm xwalk for predicting and validating these cross_links on existing protein_structures xwalk calculates and displays non linear distances between chemically cross_linked amino_acids on protein_surfaces while mimicking the flexibility and non linearity of cross_linker molecules it returns a solvent accessible surface distance which corresponds to the length of the shortest_path between two amino_acids where the path leads through solvent occupied space without penetrating the protein surface availability xwalk is freely_available as a web_server or stand alone java_application at http www xwalk org in computational_structural distance_restraints from chemical_cross experiments have so_far been employed as an upper_limit on the euclidean_distance between a pair of cross_linked amino_acids however deducing the cross linkability of an amino_acid pair by measuring the length of a euclidean_distance vector disregards the fact that the vector often penetrates segments of the protein have recognized this problem and implemented a short cut algorithm that computes the shortest_path between two cross_linked amino_acids by using vertices from a protein surface triangulation and convex_hull whilehave explicitly modeled the cross_linker molecule onto existing protein_structures we have implemented xwalk which resembles the approach taken byinstead uses grids and a search algorithm to compute the length of the shortest_path which shall be referred to as solvent accessible surface distance sasd our code is the only of its kind being open_source and available in form of a web_server to whom correspondence should be addressed however the shortest_path with an sasd of reveals that the euclidean_distance vector actually penetrates the protein leaving the only option to connect both amino_acids via a long detour over the protein surface chain of spheres colored blue to red for distances of respectively b argonaut protein from the rna_induced risc withpage
