a novel structural position_specific for the prediction of protein secondary_structures motivation the precise prediction of protein secondary_structure is of key importance for the prediction of d structure and biological_function although the development of many excellent methods over the last few decades has allowed the achievement of prediction_accuracies of up to progress seems to have reached a bottleneck and further improvements in accuracy have proven difficult results we propose for the first time a structural position_specific spssm and establish an unprecedented database of million sequences and their spssms this database when combined with a purpose designed blast tool provides a novel prediction_tool spssmpred when the spssmpred was validated on a large dataset entries the q accuracy of the protein secondary_structure was our approach was tested on the two latest eva sets accuracies of and were achieved far higher than can be achieved using other predictors for further evaluation we tested our approach on newly determined sequences entries and obtained an accuracy of for a set of low_homology proteins entries the spssmpred still achieved a q value of availability the spssmpred server is available ateven prior to the determination of the protein_structures of hemoglobin and myoglobin by x_ray analysis activity in the field of protein_structure study had been increasing steadily after this point and for some decades the field attracted intense interest it is known that the structure of a protein determines its function and understanding the functions of proteins such as catalysis transport immunity body defense and so on is of fundamental_importance in the discovery of drugs to treat various diseases knowledge of protein_structures is therefore highly_desirable in the protein_structure hierarchy there are four distinct levels the primary secondary tertiary and quaternary among these the protein secondary_structure occupies an important position as it to whom correspondence should be addressed is the basis for the spatial_structure of a protein the secondary_structure is formed at an early_stage of protein_folding so the study of protein secondary_structures is indispensable as the first and the most important step in d structure studies the protein secondary_structure has also been found to be instrumental in affecting the performance in predicting the tertiary_structure subcellular_localization and so on unfortunately experimental methods for the detection of protein secondary_structure are time consuming and labor_intensive the great disparity between the known protein_sequences stored in the uniprot and detected protein_structures deposited in the protein_data pdb continues to grow larger to fill this void the identification of protein secondary_structures in terms of the three states of helix sheet and random_coil has been carried_out using their amino_acid this technique has become increasingly prominent in spite of the many efforts made by researchers over the last few decades the prediction of protein secondary_structures from their amino_acid is still difficult looking back on some years of protein secondary_structure work it might be possible to discern two categories that encompass the majority of the researchtemplate based_methods and machine_learning template based_methods focused on connections between a query_sequence and template pool sequences with known structures the two most successful templatebased methods were nnssp and predator by comparison machinelearning methods generated a learning model via the use of a series of proteins with known structures for prediction in this category artificial_neural support_vector and hidden_markov were the most widely used algorithms machine_learning have been deemed to be the most effective and robust and have been demonstrated in numerous successful examples that often led to near perfect predictions the development of the now widely_adopted machine_learning underwent three stages during the initial_stage simple methods were used for the prediction of structures and these methods suffered from a lack of data predictions were based on sequence compositions and physical_and probably the most famous early methods from that exploratory stage were those proposed by chou and fasman a b garnier osguthorbe and robson gor andpage
