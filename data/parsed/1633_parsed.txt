estimating the activity of transcription_factors by the effect on their target_genes motivation understanding regulation of transcription is central for elucidating cellular_regulation several statistical and mechanistic_models have come up the last couple of years explaining gene transcription_levels using information of potential transcriptional_regulators as transcription_factors tfs and information from epigenetic_modifications the activity of tfs is often inferred by their transcription_levels promoter_binding and epigenetic_effects however in principle these methods do not take hard to measure influences such as post tran scriptional modifications into account results for tfs we present a novel concept circumventing this problem we estimate the regulatory activity of tfs using their cumulative_effects on their target_genes we established our model using expression data of cell_lines from the national_cancer the trained model was applied to an independent expression dataset of melanoma_cells yielding excellent expression predictions and elucidated regulation of melanogenesis availability_and using mixed_integer we implemented a switch like optimization enabling a constrained but optimal selection of tfs and optimal model_selection estimating their effects the method is generic and can also be applied to further regulators of transcription understanding regulation mechanisms of a cell is fundamental for biomedical_research and transcription_factors tfs are the central regulators of gene_expression through identification of tf_binding the regulatory_role of tfs can be inferred hence chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip techniques pulling down dna_fragments binding to the tf were developed and scaled up using microarrays chip_chip and sequencing_techniques chipseq genome_wide data have been produced from this for a large set of tfs and several cell systems stored in larger data_repositories e g however the specific cellular_context under study usually does not match the experimental background of the deposited data in addition tf_binding need not necessarily lead to a regulatory impact of the tf in particular if the target_gene is not expressed at all hence computational_approaches have been developed using these data to apply it to gene_expression data of the studied cells for instance cheng and co workers used machine_learning and a linear_model to predict regulators explaining gene_expression they used chip_seq chip_chip data from the encode_project and identified distinctive regulation principles of generic and specific tfs tfs binding preferentially to cpgs and cell_type specificity interestingly their method was challenged when predicting transcription_levels of genes under complex cellular control such as cell_cycle genes chip data have been used to compile position_weight which were used to scan the genome for tf specific binding_motifs independent of the cellular_context however this method comes along with high_false modelling techniques were applied to filter out such non functional_predictions used a sparse linear_model explaining gene_expression their model was based on tf_binding predictions in promoters and mirnas in the utr utr untranslated_region aiming to predict regulators leading to glioblastoma tumour_formation techniques were designed to elucidate regulation principles between tfs and their putative target_genes the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular_networks aracne and the context likelihood of relatedness clr both use the transcription_level of a tf to estimate its activity by calculating pearsons_correlation or mutual_information to its target_genes aracne and clr were combined and successfully_applied to identify target_genes for nrf in murine lungs in response to oxidative_stress however there are many steps between mrna_translation of a tf and the actual transcriptional_regulation of target_genes the tf can be post_translationally i e it can be methylated ubiquinated or phosphorylated phosphorylations are often necessary for dimerization and binding to the target_genes promoter it was shown that such modifications can have a substantial impact on tfs regulating their target_genes the underlying concept that expression of the target_genes depends mainly on the mrna gradients of their regulating tfs is often violated in particular in higher_eukaryotes it was shown to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com that regulation of tfs on the protein level plays a substantial role for hypoxia_inducible and p furthermore tfs can interact they can regulate other tfs directly if a tf binds to a promoter of another regulator or indirectly if the expression of modifying enzymes such as kinases is altered hence the expression_level of a tf is often not suitable to describe its activity more suitable readouts are the expression levels of the tfs targets because all these effects are integrated in contrast to previous attempts we based our predictions on the effects to the direct target_genes of the tfs we estimated the activity of a tf using a global approach i e regarding the regulation of all its target_genes it is to note that this also accounts for the fact that in different cells a tf can have a different impact on its targets typically several tfs can bind to a genes promoter and different tfs may compete for binding_sites to model this we used a linear approach similarly to previous_studies the models were optimized by predicting gene_expression based on putative regulators tfs and their predicted impact more than a decade_ago one of the first systems_biology approaches was established using constraintbased modelling to integrate stoichiometric equations under equilibrium conditions for this the mathematical concept of mixed_integer milp was used shachar and co workers used milp for calculating steiner trees combining shortest_paths in signalling_networks of yeast we used the same mathematical concept to assemble signalling and biochemical_pathways for recognition of transcriptional patterns now we used this technique for elaborated regulation models to elucidate regulation mechanisms in contrast to a sparse lasso approach milp allowed us to i get an optimized selection of tfs for a predefined number of parameters and to ii use a switching concept which enabled the optimization_algorithm to decide for each tf to be modelled by its cumulative_effect on the target_genes activity or its gene expression_level tf gene_expression this concept allowed an unbiased and tf specific comparison of the two approaches several elaborated methods have been developed and established the past couple of years to elucidate cellular_regulation of transcription the models range from highly non linear approaches using e g support_vector and random_forests to mathematically rather simple linear_models common to these approaches is the straightforward concept to gain a better mechanistic_understanding if the models can well predict known transcript_levels after concise selection of putative regulatory information this information ranges from tfs binding at promoters and enhancers mirna seeds and now highly investigated a large variety of epigenetic_modifications of histones and dna the task is challenging as transcriptional_regulation is highly complex and all these approaches cover only the tip of the iceberg assuming that regulation principles are redundant they may well be modelled even if basing on data that gives insight to only parts of this machinery however these investigations often do not cover post transcriptional_control as this comes along with more demanding experimental efforts and such control is intrinsically distinct from functional_genomics regulation our activity concept is one approach to circumvent this it integrates the underlying general influence of a single regulator by using the information of differential_expression of all its putative targets assuming to be e g highly_active when strong effects at the targets are observed of course this approach is only a starting_point for more elaborate models as this again is based on putative regulatory_interactions inferred from other cellular contexts a future aspect is to iteratively improve the initial regulation assumptions by e g using bayesian statistics coupled with an expectation_maximization nevertheless we obtained excellent_performance results when validating our predictions by cross_validation and even when applying our trained machines to a completely unseen dataset e g for dct gene pcc r when comparing the model_predictions to the measured gene_expression astonishingly our approach was the method of choice to predict regulation of cell_cycle genes it was mentioned previously that regulation of cell_cycle genes is difficult to model as these genes are involved in a complex post transcriptional_machinery at least to some extent our method may approach this challenge to keep the model simple it was restricted to regions proximal to the transcription_start tss however distal binding at enhancers support transcriptional_regulation a future task can be the inclusion of distal binding information provided by the encode_project in addition to the encode data we used for proximal binding to the tss new coefficients could be added for enhancers with a positively restricted value due to the activating_effect of enhancers and negative_values for silencers phenotypic_traits can be inferred by transcriptional gene_signatures for example kerwin et_al used gene_signatures known to associate with defined circadian time phases to examine natural_variation of the circadian_clock in contrast to these approaches we rather constructed a mechanistic_model of cellular_regulation we used signatures of gene groups target_genes of a tf mostly basing on experimental_evidence of a direct_physical chip with the mediator tf which itself interacts directly with the gene causing the investigated trait its gene_expression we used a linear approach to infer regulation principles linear_models are commonly_applied for this e g dong et_al compared linear with non linear_models random_forests multivariate adaptive regression splines and got similar prediction_accuracies in contrast cheng and co workers compared four different approaches and got better results using the non linear methods as an outlook we plan to investigate the activity approach within linear_and models followed a similar modelling concept i e estimating the effect of a tf by minimizing the error term of prediction and measured gene_expression as experimental_data they used binding_site information concentration data of the tfs and the promotersequence for the investigated target_genes interestingly they also modelled co operativity of tfs assuming that the strength of such interactions depends on the distance between the bound tfs we plan to integrate such an approach in future_studies we used the established framework of milp milp facilitated i the selection of tfs and ii the individual selection how to optimally model them by their cumulative_effects we termed activity or by their transcript_levels with this the biological_diversity of gene_expressions regulation could be modulated more precisely but still several assumptions were made to keep the model simple neglecting e g epigenetic_modifications new coefficients and parameters can be added to include those factors but this may come along with increased complexity of the model and may lead to wrong conclusions due to misleading arrangements of redundant information if the final aim was only to predict gene_expression such an extension is straightforward but the task of this regulation model was mainly to reveal regulators with high impact on the regulation of the gene under study for example for the genes tyr and dct which are the pacemaker enzymes of melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes a regulation model based on a tf network was successfully generated using this regulation model already well known tfs were identified as substantial regulators but for dct also the less prominent regulator sox was found it has been reported that sox interferes activation of dct by sox hence inhibiting expression of dct however for the cell_lines in our study we found positive terms for sox in our model positive values data not shown subsequent specific experimental_validation may elucidate sox s regulatory_role for dct in these cell_lines milp allowed us to introduce several switches into our originally linear_models switches selection of tfs selection of the models of their effects note that embedding such switches lead to a non linear and non convex topology of the search_space for these models this may be compared with a piecewise_linear slope linear part of the model with substantial breakpoints coming from an abrupt error_reduction when switches are used to some extent this compares with drastic observations in cell_biology as e g apoptosis and immortalization at which smoothly linear a point ofno return is approached after which the destiny of the cellchanges apoptosis cell_death in turn immortalization malignancy to our knowledge such events have not been elaborately described for transcriptional_regulation and this would be intriguing research for the future our approach is generic and can be employed also using other sources of regulation information such as epigenetic_modifications and mirna regulation
