reconstruction of genealogical relationships with applications to phase_iii of hapmap motivation accurate inference of genealogical relationships between pairs of individuals is paramount in association studies forensics and evolutionary_analyses of wildlife_populations current methods for relationship inference consider only a small set of close_relationships and have limited to no power to distinguish between relationships with the same number of meioses separating the individuals under consideration e g auntniece versus nieceaunt or first cousins versus great auntniece results we present carrot classification of relationships with rotations a novel framework for relationship inference that leverages linkage information to differentiate between rotated relationships that is between relationships with the same number of common_ancestors and the same number of meioses separating the individuals under consideration we demonstrate that carrot clearly outperforms_existing on simulated_data we also applied carrot on four populations from phase_iii of the hapmap project and detected previously_unreported pairs of third and fourth degree relatives availability source_code for carrot is freely_available atalgorithms for relationship inference can greatly benefit association and linkage_studies by detecting undeclared or misspecified relatives and have applications in forensics and wildlife population management existing_methods based on hidden_markov hmms only consider a small number of relationship types relpair examines eight types of relationships full siblings parentchild avuncular grandparent grandchild half siblings first cousins monozygotic_twins and unrelated prest plus extends this set of alternative relationships to include the relationship types half avuncular half first cousins and half siblings first cousins algorithms for pedigree reconstruction partition the individuals into sets of sibling and parentchild pairs and are not designed for datasets containing distantly_related individuals additionally the methods mentioned above cannot differentiate between rotated to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as relationships that is between relationships with the same number of common_ancestors and the same number of meioses separating the individuals under consideration e g auntniece versus nieceaunt or first cousins versus great auntniece distinguishing between such relationships facilitates pedigree reconstruction from relatively distant relationships we developed carrot classification of relationships with rotations a new framework for relationship inference that leverages linkage information to differentiate between rotated relationships as suggested by we grouped relationships between outbred individuals into three categories based on whether the individuals under consideration have one or two common_ancestors or whether one of them is the ancestor of the other building on the ideas of we defined three sets of hmms one for each category of relationships carrot uses a novel heuristic to decide whether one of the two individuals under consideration is closer to the common_ancestors than the other and benefits from haplotype_phasing in order to distinguish between certain rotated relationships we demonstrated that carrot achieves_higher than maximum_likelihood approaches such as relpair and prestplus using simulated_data we also applied carrot on real_data from phase_iii of the hapmap project in addition to validating relationships reported by we identified previously_unreported third and fourth degree relationships in this dataset
