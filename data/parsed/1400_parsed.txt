systems_biology discovering causal pathways linking genomic_events to transcriptional states using tied diffusion through interacting events tiedie motivation identifying the cellular wiring that connects genomic perturbations to transcriptional changes in cancer is essential to gain a mechanistic_understanding of disease_initiation progression and ultimately to predict drug response we have developed a method called tied diffusion through interacting events tiedie that uses a network diffusion approach to connect genomic perturbations to gene_expression changes characteristic of cancer_subtypes the method computes a subnetwork of proteinprotein_interactions predicted transcription_factor to target connections and curated interactions from literature that connects genomic and transcriptomic perturbations results application of tiedie to the cancer_genome and a breast_cancer cell_line dataset identified key_signaling with examples impinging on myc activity interlinking genes are predicted to correspond to essential components of cancer signaling and may provide a mechanistic explanation of tumor character and suggest subtype specific drug_targets to optimize cancer treatment whole_genome and expression data for an individual patient must be synthesized into a coherent explanation of disease_causing changes gene_networks encapsulate our understanding of how genes and their products interact in the cell to mutually influence activity through proteinprotein proteindna and coupled metabolic_reactions however different tumors usually harbor unique combinations of mutations or other genomic or epigenomic changes a key_question is how best to infer the structures of gene_networks important for normal and diseased phenotypes using high_throughput data and a priori biological_knowledge viewing cancer from a gene network perspective is expected to enhance our understanding of disease_initiation progression and therapy given genes with functions disrupted in a particular type of cancer newly implicated genes can be identified by searching for those with known regulatory connections to the input_set however this task is complicated by the presence of many mutations whose functional significance in cancer is unclear leading to many false_positive discoveries for example using data on copy_number gene_mutations and methylation status it may be difficult to distinguish the genomic changes that exert a physiologically meaningful influence on tumor_biology from numerous passenger events that result from loss of genome_integrity one can identify subnetworks that interconnect mutated genes enriching the set of events for those proteins participating in common pathways the assumption underlying this approach is that such mutations are more likely to be functionally_relevant approaches such as memo and dendrix have been applied successfully in this manner several subnetwork enrichment_methods have been developed to identify regions of a network that contain an unexpectedly high number of relevant_genes see supplementary methods for an overview importantly most methods suffer from the influence of curation bias in the network the hub_genes that have many connections simply because of being studied to a greater extent in the literature are selected at high_frequency even given random input genes one promising class of approaches that helps mitigate this problem is the class based on heat diffusion such as the hotnet algorithm intuitively a diffusion strategy makes the a priori relevance of a hub comparable with a sparsely connected gene because hubs might receive more total heat than a non hub but the hub can also lose the same proportion out of its many connections the tied diffusion of interacting events tiedie method described here extends on the heat diffusion strategies by leveraging different types of genomic inputs to find relevant_genes on a background network with high_specificity in an attempt to reduce the false_positive of previous_approaches shows a simple schematic of tiedie applied to two distinct sets to whom correspondence should be addressed of genes a source set e g mutated genes and a target set e g transcription_factors using two diffusion processes the method discovers newly implicated genes as linking nodes residing on paths connecting sources to targets where the diffusion processes overlap a logically consistent solution can then be extracted from the resulting network of sources targets and linkers supplementary we demonstrate that using two diffusion processes improves our ability to recover pathway_models the overlay of genomic perturbations in a single tumor sample with tiedie solutions reveals patient specific networks that may provide insights into therapy we describe a new tied diffusion method tiedie that is able to integrate transcriptional and genomic perturbation data with biological pathway_models yielding subnetworks that connect the two distinct data_sources we demonstrate the ability of tiedie to generate better precision than single source diffusion methods in recovering both genes and paths across a wide_range of recall with both a simulated toy example and patient data current_limitations of the method are described in the supplementary methods section because many tfs are not conventionally regarded as being druggable approaches such as tiedie that pinpoint influences upstream of these factors but still in neighborhoods proximal to key driving mutations may provide key starting points for identifying new drug_targets a unique set of genes may be essential for a specific tumor to thrive in its transformed environment the so_called synthetic_lethal partners to those genes_mutated in the tumor essential genes would be less likely to appear among a list of cancer drivers based on frequently mutated genes because negative_selection would eliminate alterations to essential genes thus methods like tiedie can aid in finding these important genes to potentially inhibit their activity which can be tested with specific_inhibitors in support of these observations we found that the tiedie solutions enrich for genes that are more sensitive to small_interfering targeting in cell_lines supplementary results supplementary thus tiedie might be used to provide a scaffold for simulation of the effects of gene_knockouts or drug_treatments potentially improving both computational costs and pathway specificity when compared with a simulation performed on the entire starting network the method can be used to characterize individual tumor_samples which may display unique changes in pathway logic that do not conform to the canonical clinical_subtypes in such cases tumor_heterogeneity and tumor evolution may produce a mixture of subtypes the challenge is to identify which pathways are significantly_impacted in complex primary_tumors and metastases and how we can leverage such information to specifically target therapy for a particular patient using data from the tcga breast_cancer cohort we identified a core signaling_pathway that recapitulates several known aspects of the biology distinguishing the major basal and luminal a subtypes that was highly concordant with models derived from breast_cancer in addition the non overlapping regions of these pathways lie in areas where we expect to find differences such as tumor metabolism one exciting possibility would be to compare a patient specific network with a previously recorded set of networks derived from a bank of stable cell_lines grown under different conditions exploring therapeutic_options for that patient would then involve searching the library of cell_lines and growth conditions for those that maximally match the patients network tiedie holds_promise for uncovering pathways relating genomic perturbations to downstream transcriptional changes higher_precision over single diffusion was obtained both in simulations and in human tumor sample datasets where a large set of genes involved in oncogenesis are known even though we chose breast_cancer as a test case the approach can be applied to a
