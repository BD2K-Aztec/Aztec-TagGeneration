data_and supporting tool suite for production proteomics the large amount of data produced by proteomics experiments requires effective bioinformatics_tools for the integration of data management and data analysis here we introduce a suite of tools developed at vanderbilt university to support production proteomics we present the backup utility service tool for automated instrument file backup and the scansifter tool for data conversion we also describe a queuing system to coordinate identification pipelines and the file collector tool for batch copying analytical results these tools are individually useful but collectively reinforce each other they are particularly valuable for proteomics core facilities or research institutions that need to manage multiple mass_spectrometers with minor changes they could support other types of biomolecular resource facilities availability_and source_code and executable versions are available under apache license at http www vicc org jimayersinstitute data contact mass_spectrometry ms based proteomics offers a remarkably powerful technology for identification of proteins in complex biological_samples bioinformatics_tools are essential to this process proteomics services are often provided through shared ms instrumentation with the support of external computing_resources core facilities often struggle to manage the volume of data that these instruments can generate resulting in irregular or non existent backup plans and long_delays separating sample receipt and information release for end_users existing freely_available tools such as tpp cpas and cpfp focus only on data analysis by providing a set of tools for peptide_identification and validation a laboratory_information may offer some capabilities for integration of instrument data backup and data analysis but these services usually catalog samples and bench procedure more effectively than they manage bioinformatics workflows with little support for proteomics_studies we addressed to whom correspondence should be addressed these challenges by developing a suite of tools to support production proteomics these tools are in daily use at the vanderbilt mass_spectrometry research_center and the jim ayers institute for precancer detection and diagnosis they are now freely_available with source_code to commercial government and academic users
