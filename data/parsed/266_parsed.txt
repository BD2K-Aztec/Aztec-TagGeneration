an accurate paired sample test for count_data motivation recent technology platforms in proteomics and genomics produce count_data for quantitative analysis previous_works on statistical_significance analysis for count_data have mainly focused on the independent sample setting which does not cover the case where pairs of measurements are taken from individual patients before and after treatment this experimental_setting requires paired sample testing such as the paired_t often used for continuous_measurements a state of the art method uses a negative_binomial in a generalized_linear framework for paired sample testing a paired sample design assumes that the relative change within each pair is constant across biological_samples this model can be used as an approximation to the true model in cases of heterogeneity of response in complex_biological we aim to specify the variation in response explicitly in combination with the inherent technical variation results we formulate the problem of paired sample test for count_data in a framework of statistical combination of multiple contingency_tables in particular we specify explicitly a random_distribution for the effect with an inverted beta model the technical variation can be modeled by either a standard poisson_distribution or an exponentiated poisson_distribution depending on the reproducibility of the acquisition workflow the new statistical_test is evaluated on both proteomics and genomics datasets showing a comparable_performance to the state of the art method in general and in several cases where the two methods differ the proposed test returns more reasonable p values availability available for download at http www oncoproteomics nl recent technology platforms in proteomics and genomics produce count_data for quantitative analysis in proteomics the number of ms_ms events observed for a protein in the mass_spectrometer has been shown to correlate strongly with the proteins abundance in a complex_mixture in genomics next_generation use read_count as a reliable measure of the abundance of the target transcript statistical_analysis of count_data is therefore becoming increasingly important previous_works using a beta_binomial model or a negative_binomial have focused on an independent sample setting nevertheless consider a study where data are measured from each patient before and after treatment the measurements are no longer independent another frequently used design is to compare the gene protein expression levels between matched_pairs of cancer and to whom correspondence should be addressed normal_tissues these experimental_designs require paired sample testing such as the paired_t used for continuous_measurements due to the lack of a proper statistical_test recent efforts in proteomics van and genomics have resorted to calculating fold changes within each sample and subsequently using a rule_based system to identify differential markers the rules have to take into account such issues as difference in variation at regions of low and high_abundance while this approach might be applicable for a discovery study with a small_sample e g n pairs it possesses no concept of statistical_significance for generalized inference in this article we aim to develop a statistical_method for analysis of paired_samples for count_data for ease of presentation we consider an experiment in which each sample pair consists of a pre_treatment measurement and a post_treatment measurement one is interested in the relative change in abundance due to the treatment for each protein across biological_samples to this end we derive from each protein in each sample pair a contingency_table containing a pre_treatment count and a post_treatment count as well as total sample counts for normalization the treatment effect and statistical_significance can be computed using the fishers_exact or the g test for each contingency_table however combining information from multiple tables to obtain a common effect and a confidence estimate is non trivial and has been a central problem in the field of meta_analysis this article proposes a new technique to estimate a common effect and significance analysis for multiple contingency_tables the method uses ratio of two poisson distributions leading to a binomial_distribution parameterized by a single random effect variable the random effect is subsequently modeled with an inverted beta_distribution resulting in an inverted beta_binomial model for the observed count_data the new statistical_test is therefore called the inverted beta binomial_test the article is organized as follows section_presents mathematical notations the concept of common treatment effect and previous_approaches to the problem section_presents the new statistical_test and its implementation experimental_results are presented in section section concludes this article this article addresses the problem of significance analysis for paired_samples with count_data this type of statistical_testing arises for example in studies where one is interested in a treatment effect or when one plans to correct for differences in genetic_background by using matched cancer normal_tissues by formulating the problem in the framework of combining contingency_tables we can use a large body of literature in statistical meta_analysis for instance the forest plot a frequently used visualization method in meta_analysis offers a dedicated visualization_tool for paired sample tests we have proposed a novel statistical_test using an inverted betabinomial distribution explicitly separating technical variation from biological_variation this is in contrast to a state of the art technique an extension of the edger method which models total_variation with a negative_binomial experimental_results on a proteomics dataset and a genomics dataset demonstrate that ibb is a considerable alternative to the extension of edger as it tends to favor unidirectional regulation technical variation modeled by the ibb test can be adapted to account for over or under dispersion using an exponentiated poisson_distribution in theory one should examine the acquisition platform from independent studies to accurately capture the technical variation this is however not always possible in practice since typically data_acquisition comprises of several steps in a complex workflow in which technology platforms such as a mass_spectrometer or a sequencer play a part only hence one needs to make assumptions about the data generative mechanism for which the standard poisson_distribution provides a reasonable approximation and is a common practice deviating from the standard poisson_distribution should be treated with special_care a generalized linear_mixed glmm is a natural statistical_framework to account for random effect the main difficulty with model_fitting in glmm is that the likelihood_function does not have a closed form and thus one has to resort to complicated numerical_methods for optimization similar to the challenge we face with ibb we have shown that for one dimensional integration approximation by a numerical quadrature is efficient and accurate in addition when i
