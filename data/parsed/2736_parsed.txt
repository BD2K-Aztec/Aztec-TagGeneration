local versus global biological network_alignment motivation network_alignment na aims to find regions of similarities between species molecular_networks there exist two na categories local lna and global gna lna finds small highly_conserved network regions and produces a many to many node mapping gna finds large conserved_regions and produces a one to one node mapping given the different outputs of lna and gna when a new na method is proposed it is compared against existing_methods from the same category however both na categories have the same goal to allow for transferring functional knowledge from well to poorly_studied species between conserved network regions so which one to choose lna or gna to answer this we introduce the first systematic evaluation of the two na categories results we introduce new measures of alignment_quality that allow for fair comparison of the different lna and gna outputs as such measures do not exist we provide user_friendly software for efficient alignment evaluation that implements the new and existing_measures we evaluate prominent lna and gna methods on synthetic and real_world biological_networks we study the effect on alignment_quality of using different interaction types and confidence_levels we find that the superiority of one na category over the other is context dependent further when we contrast lna and gna in the application of learning novel protein functional knowledge the two produce very different predictions indicating their complementarity our results and software provide guidelines for future na method development and evaluation
