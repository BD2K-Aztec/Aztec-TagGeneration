data_and msacquisitionsimulator data dependent acquisition simulator for lc_ms shotgun proteomics_data dependent acquisition dda is the most common method used to control the acquisition process of shotgun_proteomics experiments while novel dda approaches have been proposed their evaluation is made difficult by the need of programmatic control of a mass_spectrometer an alternative is in silico analysis for which suitable software has been unavailable to meet this need we have developed msacquisitionsimulatora collection of c programs for simulating ground_truth lc_ms data and the subsequent application of custom dda algorithms it provides an opportunity for researchers to test refine and evaluate novel dda algorithms prior to implementation on a mass_spectrometer availability_and the software is freely_available from its github repository http www github com dennisgoldfarb msacquisitionsimulator which contains further documentation and usage instructions mass_spectrometry is an analytical_technique used in proteomics to identify and quantify proteins many of its applications share the underlying goal of uncovering the full protein complement in a biological_sample however for complex samples this is rarely achieved partly because the number of ion populations exceeds that which contemporary instruments can individually target for sequence_analysis with a tandem mass_spectrum scan ms_ms acquisition algorithms are necessary to control the data_acquisition process and manage the limited scan speed data dependent acquisition dda constitutes a major class of data_acquisition methods dda methods perform a precursor scan to determine the mass to charge ratio m z and abundance of ions currently entering the mass_spectrometer followed by sequence determining ms_ms scans on ions from a subset of detected peaks the standard dda algorithm topn selects ions for ms_ms scans that contributed to peaks of greatest signal_intensity from the latest precursor scan several other approaches as well as adjustments to topn have been proposed in order to increase peptide and protein_identifications however topn continues to be the dominant choice for acquisition control despite its bias toward abundant proteins and relatively poor reproducibility currently evaluation of novel acquisition strategies requires access to both a mass_spectrometer and its application_programming api unfortunately few instrument vendors provide an api and therefore the pool of researchers with the necessary tools to explore this field is extremely limited an alternative is to evaluate however the size of the simulations is limited due to speed memory and or disk_space requirements most importantly the simulated ms_ms lead to nearly perfect peptide spectrummatches psms when analyzed with existing database_search algorithms the reasons for this include the absence of co fragmentation from neighboring ions within an isolation window the difficulty of predicting fragmentation_patterns and potentially other not yet understood phenomena this limitation makes evaluating any acquisition strategy impractical as the metrics for success are based on the number of confident peptide and protein_identifications here we present an acquisition simulator that produces psms with realistic peptide_sequence and probability assignments for dda strategies by foregoing fragmentation simulation and instead directly generating psms based on the precursor ion fractions of ms_ms scans it builds upon previous work on lc_ms simulations and scales to larger datasets due to probabilistic_models of ion generation and subsequent pruning of rare ions this allows for an increased number of proteins peptides and post_translational that can be simulated dda simulation will assist in the development and assessment of novel methods the next generation of algorithms will likely further integrate data generation with data analysis such as real_time peptide_sequencing and protein inference they may also become more goal oriented seeking to identify subsets of proteins specific modifications or to improve quantification their sophistication may also come at a computational_cost too great for their implementation on contemporary mass_spectrometers for such a scenario msacquisitionsimulator will be a great tool for their evaluation
