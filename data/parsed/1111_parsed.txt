computationally expanding infinium_humanmethylation array data to reveal distinct dna_methylation of rheumatoid_arthritis motivation dna_methylation signatures in rheumatoid_arthritis ra have been identified in fibro blast like synoviocytes fls with illumina humanmethylation array since of cpg_sites are covered by the illumina k array and whole_genome is still too expensive for many samples computationally predicting dna methylation_levels based on k data would be valuable to discover more ra related genes results we developed a computational_model that is trained on tissues with both whole gen ome bisulfite_sequencing and k array data this model integrates_information derived from the similarity of local methylation pattern between tissues the methylation information of flanking cpg_sites and the methylation tendency of flanking dna_sequences the predicted and measured methylation_values were highly_correlated with a pearson_correlation of in leave one tissue out cross_validations importantly the majority of the top differentially_methylated among the tissues was correctly_detected using the predicted methylation_values applying this model to k data of ra osteoarthritis and normal fls we successfully expanded the coverage of cpg_sites fold and accounts for about of all the cpgs in the human_genome by integrative omics study we identified genes and pathways tightly related to ra pathogenesis among which genes were supported by triple evidences including genes already known to perform specific roles in ra and genes as new potential_therapeutic availability_and the source_code rheumatoid_arthritis ra is an autoimmune_disease marked by synovial hyperplasia and invasion into cartilage and bone fibroblast_like fls which form the inner lining of the synovium display an aggressive phenotype in ra that persists in long_term culture the mechanism that contributes to functional alterations in ra fls is only partially understood recent_studies have applied illumina humanmethylation beadchip array to reveal distinct dna_methylation that distinguish ra samples from osteoarthritis oa and normal nl fls integrative_analysis on the differentially_methylated dml the associated genes and relevant pathways has provided insightful clues for identification of therapeutic_targets a significant limitation of the illumina k array is that it only covers less than of cpg loci in the entire_human expanding the coverage of cpg loci in defining the dna_methylation pattern of ra is becoming an urgent need previously computational_methods have been developed to predict methylation_values based on dna_sequences histone_modifications or integration of dna_methylation data from different techniques methods using only dna sequence_features can learn the methylation tendency for a cpg_site based on its surrounding sequence compositions in a specific tissue but the trained model cannot be transferred to predict methylation_levels in different tissues because the input sequence_features remain the same and cell_type methylation obviously vary from one cell_type to another histone_modification features can reflect cell specificity and incorporating histone_modifications allows prediction of cell specific dna_methylation using these models require histone_modification data to be available in the cell_type of interest which is not always the case recently computational_methods were developed to infer dna methylation_levels in the entire_genome using medip_seq and mre seq data since neither histone_modification data nor medip_seq mre seq data are available for ra a new computational_method to expand the coverage of illumina k array is no doubt valuable to further refine the dna_methylation signature of ra in this study we developed a prediction model integrating celltype specific k array data and common dna sequence_features the model was trained on cell_types tissues that have both k array and whole_genome wgbs data as local dna_methylation are similar between similar tissues and the methylation status of a cpg in one tissue is correlated with or affected by its flanking cpg_sites and sequence compositions the model aims to capture such local_similarity of dna_methylation across cell_types tissues we performed cross_validations to confirm the success of this method with an average prediction correlation_coefficient around accuracy over and auc close to particularly of differential_methylation loci were correctly retrieved using the predicted methylation_levels we previously used k array data to identify a characteristic dna_methylation pattern in ra fls which are pathogenic cells that form the lining of the joint these data implicated genes and pathways in the pathogenesis of ra especially related to immunity cell_adhesion and matrix regulation applying this model to the original fls k array data we expanded the cpg coverage to sites which is over fold_greater than the number of cpg_sites covered by k array using the predicted methylation_sites we found genes differentially_methylated between ra and oa nl referred as differentially_methylated genes dmgs combing these dmgs genes_differentially between ra and oa nl degs and ra associated genes from genome_wide gwas_studies we found enriched kegg_pathways most of these pathways are related to immune system and expand upon with those found by k array data only twelve genes were supported by three way evidences of dml dmg and gwas among which half are related to ra such as hladqa lbh and elmo illumina k beadchip array is a useful way to investigate the different dna_methylation in ra and many diseases in fact tens_of of illumina k array data have been generated on precious disease samples despite the invaluable insights generated by these k array data the small coverage of the cpg_sites limited the scope of the investigated dna_methylation in ra and other diseases our computational strategy to predict dna_methylation based on k data alone opens a new avenue of reprocessing the existing data that were previously generated by k array to uncover new disease related genes before these samples are re analyzed using wgbs when applying to a new sample our model only requires input of k array data and avoids the need of histone_modification or medip_seq mre seq data that are not always available which significantly expands its applicability illumina recently released a new infinium methylationepic array which is to replace the current methylation k array referred to as the k array which covers about of cpgs of the human_genome it is straightforward to apply our expanding algorithm to significantly expand the coverage of the k array once enough k array data are available our method significantly expanded the coverage of cpg_sites which is times of the cpgs covered by k array and accounts for about of all the cpgs in the human_genome the current model is trained on tissues that have both wgbs and k array data the performance of the model is expected to be further improved when more tissues cells are included in training the model importantly our model can successfully predict dml and its performance was confirmed by both leave one tissue out cross_validations and identification of ra related genes pathways the triple evidenced genes with predicted dna_methylation data a significant increase from based on k array data include genes with reported functions in ra and genes as potential_therapeutic we expect the similar applications to other diseases would greatly_facilitate discovery of new drug_targets and understanding of disease mechanisms
