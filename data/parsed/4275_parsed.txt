sitar a novel tool for transcription_factor binding_site motivation prediction of transcription_factor tfbss is crucial for promoter modeling and network_inference quality of the predictions is spoiled by numerous false_positives which persist as the main_problem for all presently available tfbs search_methods results we suggest a novel approach which is alternative to widely used position_weight pwms and hidden_markov each motif of the input_set is used as a search template to scan a query_sequence found motifs are assigned scores depending on the non randomness of the motifs occurrence the number of matching searching motifs and the number of mismatches the non randomness is estimated by comparison of observed numbers of matching motifs with those predicted to occur by chance the latter can be calculated given the base compositions of the motif and the query_sequence the method does not require preliminary alignment of the input motifs hence avoiding uncertainties introduced by the alignment procedure in comparison with pwm based tools our method demonstrates higher_precision by the same sensitivity_and it also tends to outperform methods combining pattern and pwm search most important it allows reducing the number of false_positive significantly availability the method is implemented in a tool called sitar site tracking and recognition and is available at http sbi hkidespite the large number of available methods and tools for transcription_factor tfbss prediction the problem of the high number of false_positive fp predictions is not solved so_far the attempts to predict putative_binding using the information about known tfbss have a long history with the main stream of pwm based_methods and deviations to applications of other sequence_based such as hidden_markov hmms e g or less widely known approaches like for example intuitionistic fuzzy sets ifs theory further refinement of predictions can be done by including additional information such as genetic and epigenetic_factors in the query region e g clade specific evolutionary_parameters presence of nearby coding_regions or phylogenetic_relationships e g or and genome_wide expression data e g these ways are promising and have their field of application and they also have a serious drawback this additional information must be available which is far from being always the case to find an optimal balance between high specialization provided by pattern based_methods and high_sensitivity of the pwms several attempts have been made to combine these two approaches these attempts were implemented in such tools as alibaba and p match alibaba method is based on the examination of a tfbs context by application of an extension of the berg and von hippel model it includes a step of aligning of known tfbss with a query_sequence with subsequent construction of a pwm matching each found motif the p match algorithm uses individual tfbss along with the corresponding pwms it searches for dna subsequences matching one of the tfbss from the set and calculates the matching score using the weight_matrix both approaches although they still include the obligatory step of the pwm construction are a significant step_forward in comparison with pure pwm based_methods being methodologically interesting and promising these tools are unfortunately hardly of use in practice alibaba is not maintained since and both tools are dependent on available pwm libraries which are outdated in their public versions at the end of the day pwms remain the state of the art method consequently the great majority of available tools are pwm based see for example and differ mostly in the ways of calculating the cut_offs introduction of e values p values and background modeling e g in matrix scan of rsat allow to reduce the number of fp to some extent other tools tend to use more mathematically sophisticated methods such as variable order bayesian trees and variable order markov_models e g vombat tool without breakthrough results we think however that the problem of motif prediction should not be approached by generalizations we decided to develop a straightforward method based on direct comparison of input searching set motifs with the query_sequence see the section we exploit the idea of non randomness of biologically_meaningful sequence_motifs which can be detected by comparison of observed motifs occurrences with those predicted to happen by chance this simple mathematical_approach provides high_sensitivity of the method allowing significant reduction of the fp predictions sitar is a method for nucleotide_composition based detection of non random matching motifs applied to prediction of tfbss or other types of motifs one of the evident advantages of the method is that it does not require equal length of the searching motifs nor their alignment nor a construction of a pwm nor any other modeling prior to the search any of those steps aligning trimming to equal length etc leads to the loss of information as any generalization and hence introduces some degree of uncertainty in the final_result thus avoiding these steps we preserve as much information as there was in the initial set of tfbs sequences it is notable that the demand for a high_quality of the initial searching set of tfbs sequences is equally strong for any approach ours or pwm based the other quite important consequence of the lack of the abovementioned steps is saving of time and efforts to use sitar one needs to have just a set of known tfbs sequences this can come directly from a publication or a database to use any pwm based tool one needs to have the pwm it either can be found in a matrix database such as transfac or jaspar or has to be made de_novo from that set of known sequences which we directly use in sitar to do that one has to i align the sequences ii find a tool for pwm construction and iii apply it of note jaspar and other prominent pwm based tools like matrix scan or the public version of p match do not allow to construct own matrices this means that even when sitar demonstrates equal performance with a pwm based tool this result is achieved by lower expenses the experiment with reidentification of the tp set with three different methods showed general superiority of the tools that use aligning of individual motifs sitar and p match this conforms to the thesis that pwms are too generalized p match tries to overcome the pwm generalization by including the step of aligning of individual motifs of a pwm with subsets of the query_sequence and applying the pwm characteristics when calculating the scores this attempt significantly_improves the prediction in terms of the number of fps however p match remains dependent on pwms with all consequences discussed in the previous paragraphs in sitar we omit the generalization step completely the positive feature of pwms is that they reflect conservation of particular nucleotides within the motif this kind of information is not directly considered by our method since we allow mismatches in any position of the motif however the theoretically allowed mismatches in the conserved positions are in practice corrected by matching of the correct true motifs and accumulation of the correct matches so the conservation of a certain base is in fact taken into account in an indirect way to reinforce this effect we put special_emphasis on the multiple matching of the motifs when calculating the score on the other hand one should not underestimate the fact that tfbs sets can be very divergent and some single true sites may strongly differ from the rest of the set in fact they can be completely unalignable in a pwm and hence in p match such sites are in a way suppressed so that their content is not reflected neither by the consensus_sequence nor by the weights assigned to each position on the opposite our approach allows each motif to play its role independently of the rest of the set so finally sitar is balancing between multiple and individual matching allowing each of them to be equally successful if the found motif is recognized as non random in terms of accuracy of predictions by of sensitivity sitar is superior to jaspar when reidentifying tfbss in random_sequences supplementary the results of p match and sitar do not significantly differ although also here there is a slight_tendency of sitar to have lower fdr and higher f measure supplementary ideally all sites presented in databases like transfac should be genuine but we cannot exclude the possibility that one or two of them are actually false simply because of the fp rate of the wet_lab for this reason it not always makes sense to insist on the recovering of the whole tp set in fact in some tfbs sets we can observe just one sequence obviously not belonging to the rest of the set spoiling the whole picture taking_into such chances we also considered reidentification of of the tp for this level of sensitivity the difference in the performance of all considered tools is not anymore significant however the tendency of sitar to outperform jaspar and p match remains the same supplementary in promoter_sequences the performance of sitar is comparable with that of jaspar in of promoters in the rest however sitar predicts less additional potentially fp sites since we do not know the real number of tp tfbss in genuine promoters we cannot estimate such characteristics as fdr but we can judge about the sensitivity of the methods in the considered examples we can see that the sensitivity of jaspar and sitar is equally_high of the real tfbss are redetected whereas the sensitivity of p match remains quastionable we will return to this point in a few lines our demands to the interpretation of the predictions in promoters can be formulated as following i the true tfbs has to be recovered ii there should not be too many tp sites we allowed up to additional tfbss considering them as potentially tp an excess over was considered as potential fps both criteria are met by sitar with success it reidentifies all true tfbss of note for this analysis we tried to select those true tfbss that have not sitar
