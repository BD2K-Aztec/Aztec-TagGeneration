mbrole enrichment_analysis of metabolomic_data while many tools exist for performing enrichment_analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic_data in order to interpret them in biological terms almost no equivalent tools exist for metabolomic_data we present metabolite biological role mbrole a web_server for carrying out over representation analysis of biological and chemical annotations in arbitrary sets of metabolites small chemical_compounds coming from metabolomic_data of any organism or sample availability_and the web_server is freely_available atin general omics_data require a secondary analysis in order to be understood in biological terms in the case of transcriptomics for example the primary processing of the raw experimental_data provides large lists of hundreds_or of genes which are over or under expressed in a given condition these lists are not easily_interpretable and they should be further processed in order to get insight into the underlying cause for that change in expression the most widely used methodology for performing such analysis is termed functional enrichment this analysis looks for keywords or descriptors over represented in the set of genes of interest e g those over expressed with respect to a background reference_set e g the whole_genome or the set of genes printed in the array since originally proposed a hundred of variations and different implementations of enrichment_analysis have been proposed while transcriptomic techniques provide information on the mrna concentrations of the gene repertory of an organism and proteomics on the respective protein concentrations metabolomic techniques aim to massively measure the concentrations of the whole metabolite repertory of a given cell hence these methodologies complement each other in providing global pictures of the molecular_components of living_systems newer than transcriptomics and proteomics metabolomic techniques are still facing many technical_problems maybe due to this the number of tools for performing secondary analysis i e biological_interpretation of metabolomic_data is still scarce e g metexplore as far as we know only one public toolin this work we present mbrole a tool to perform functional_enrichment on metabolic data from any organism or sample using sets of annotations of diverse nature only very recently the first tool for performing metabolomic enrichment_analysis appeared msea which is restricted to human metabolites although focused on qualitative annotations mbrole is general and versatile enough to perform functional_enrichment in any metabolomic sample including additional biological and chemical annotations for human metabolites and hence complements existing software for the rising field of metabolomics
