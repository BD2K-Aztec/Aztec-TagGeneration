structural_bioinformatics choyce a web_server for constrained homology_modelling with cryoem maps choyce is a web_server for homology_modelling of protein components and the fitting of those components into cryo_electron cryoem maps of their assemblies it provides an interactive approach to improving the selection of models based on the quality of their fit into the em map in recent_years single_particle cryo_electron cryoem has become a major technique for structure_determination of macromolecular assemblies however the majority of cryoem density maps are still in the range of far from atomic_resolution superior interpretation of these maps is now routinely achieved by fitting into them atomic_structures of individual components such as proteins domains and even secondary_structure many fitting methods have been developed most of which rely on the cross correlation_function ccf between the component structure and the density_map as a measure of goodness_of as experimental atomic_structures of the assembly components are often not available it is becoming increasingly common to fit comparative models or homology_models instead we recently showed that a correlation exists between the quality of a model e g in terms of the root_mean rmsd from the native_structure and its ccf with the density_map based on that a simple way to improve fitting accuracy is to generate a set of models using alternative templates and alignments one of the most accurate_models can be picked from this set based on its fit into the density and possibly in combination with other model assessment scores such as statistical_potentials of mean force unfortunately researchers frequently do not use this option despite the fact that it may lead not only to improved models but also to a better analysis of the em map to whom correspondence should be addressed here we present choyce a web_based designed to perform homology_modelling constrained by cryoem density fitting which enables the selection of improved models of assembly components the choyce server is freely_available via the url http choyce ismb lon ac uk a valid licence key is required for the use of the modeller software the choyce web_server provides a platform for homology_modelling and fitting into cryoem maps the server aids in selecting one of the most accurate_models from an ensemble of models based on the goodness_of to the em map future improvements will include modelling based on multiple template structures as well as iterative alignment fitting and refinement using a combination of ccf and statistical potential scores
