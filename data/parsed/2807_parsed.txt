gene_expression massir a method for predicting the sex of samples in gene_expression microarray_datasets high_throughput gene_expression are currently the most efficient method for transcriptome_wide expression analyses consequently gene_expression data available through public_repositories have largely been obtained from microarray_experiments however the metadata associated with many publicly_available expression microarray_datasets often lacks sample sex information therefore limiting the reuse of these data in new analyses or larger meta_analyses where the effect of sex is to be considered here we present the massir package which provides a method for researchers to predict the sex of samples in microarray_datasets using information from microarray probes representing y chromosome genes this package implements unsupervised clustering_methods to classify samples into male_and groups providing an efficient way to identify or confirm the sex of samples in mammalian microarray_datasets availability_and massir is implemented as a bioconductor_package in r the package and the vignette can be downloaded at bioconductor org and are provided under a gpl for more than a decade high_throughput microarray_experiments have been generating large volumes of genome_wide expression data and the reporting requirements of many journals have seen that much of these data are made publicly_available given the substantial value of these accumulated datasets it is becoming increasingly common to reuse gene_expression data to validate new findings or to pose new biological_questions to our knowledge this is the only available software_package for predicting the sex of samples in gene_expression microarray_datasets this easily implemented method opens_the to both prospective and retrospective gene_expression that wish to consider the effect of sex on gene_expression
