structural_bioinformatics cabs flex predictions of protein_flexibility compared with nmr ensembles motivation identification of flexible regions of protein_structures is important for understanding of their biological_functions recently we have developed a fast approach for predicting protein_structure fluctuations from a single protein model the cabs flex cabs flex was shown to be an efficient alternative to conventional all atom molecular_dynamics md in this work we evaluate cabs flex and md predictions by comparison with protein structural_variations within nmr ensembles results based on a benchmark set of proteins we show that the relative fluctuations of protein residues obtained from cabs flex are well correlated to those of nmr ensembles on average this correlation is stronger than that between md and nmr ensembles in conclusion cabs flex is useful and complementary to md in predicting protein regions that undergo conformational changes as well as the extent of such changes availability_and the cabs flex is freely_available to all users atproteins exist in solution as ensembles of structurally different conformational_states these ensembles can exhibit different degrees of structural_diversity ranging from almost static to highly_mobile protein regions structural flexibility is one of the key_characteristics of proteins and allows them to play important functional_roles in living_organisms thus knowledge of conformational_states in native_state ensembles can provide_important protein functions e g molecular_recognition protein allostery as well as protein evolution most of the known protein_structures have been solved by x_ray and deposited in the protein_data pdb as a single model a single crystal_structure however gives little information about conformational heterogeneity or model accuracy and this is why the crystallographic community has been urged to deposit an ensemble of solutions whenever possible an ensemble view of protein_structures comes predominantly from nmr_spectroscopy which is the method of choice for the determination of protein_structure and dynamics in solution nmr_spectroscopy routinely provides an ensemble of protein models which usually consists of conformers on average the precision and accuracy of nmr ensembles have been a subject of a long_standing dispute in the field the structure diversity of nmr derived ensembles may depend not only on the quality and amount of collected data but also on the computational procedures used for generating and selecting lowenergy models that fit experimental_data nevertheless it has been demonstrated that nmr ensembles may provide_valuable protein_flexibility that is of practical use in structure to function studies among these studies particularly interesting is probably the first comparison of nmr ensembles and a collection of crystal_structures from the point of using them in structure_based performed by damm and carlson they demonstrated that for human_immunodeficiency protease hiv p there is more structural_variation between structures in an nmr ensemble than between crystal_structures bound to a variety of ligands because the nmr ensemble derived model provided the most general yet accurate representation of the active_site of hiv p the authors strongly encourage the use of nmr models in structure_based except for experimental sources the present views on protein_flexibility have been largely obtained thanks to the use of molecular_dynamics md in the past_decades md has become an indispensable tool for determining conformationally heterogeneous states of proteins most often through unbiased simulations starting from experimental static structures or in combination with experimental_data the idea that unbiased md_simulations capture the true dynamic nature of proteins was supported by a study showing that various md force_fields provide a consensus picture of protein fluctuations in solution using the md simulation_data from this study we recently demonstrated that the structural and dynamics characteristics of md trajectories are fairly consistent with simulation_results from a coarse_grained protein modelthe cabs model importantly the computational_cost of obtaining nearnative dynamics by cabs simulations was proved to be much lower times than that of md technically this is the cost of achieving a residue fluctuation profile that best fits that obtained from ns md_simulations see details in following this work we implemented the developed cabs model based protocol for fast simulations of near native dynamics in a web_server called cabs flex in previous_works we compared cabs flex predictions of protein_flexibility with a large set of md simulation_data the comparison tests showed that the cabsflex method is a computationally_efficient alternative to md the present work describes a comparison of protein fluctuations obtained from cabs flex and md_simulations with fluctuations derived from nmr ensembles in this work we used a benchmark protein set of proteins collected and reported by we present a comparison of residue fluctuation profiles for the entire benchmark set the comparison is done using spearmans correlation_coefficient r s and average root_mean rmsd between rmsf values of md nmr cabs flex remarkably the average r s between cabs flex and nmr ensembles is slightly less scattered than that between md and nmr ae and ae respectively standard_deviation values are given in brackets the r s correlation_coefficient is a measure of statistical dependence between compared residue fluctuation profiles and does not reflect differences in profile amplitudes this is reflected in the average rmsd between the compared profiles shown in as presented in the plot the rmsd between nmr profiles and cabs flex or md profiles usually does not exceed a in general the higher the structural_heterogeneity in nmr ensembles the higher is the presented rmsd values the largest rmsd values_correspond to proteins with highly_flexible regions for instance the highest rmsd values nmr to md as well as cabs flex to nmr correspond to the structure of cide n domain of cide b protein pdb id d b which has largely disordered_regions of substantial length residues and the exact r s and rmsd values for each protein are given in supplementary table s together with accompanying data the proteins from the benchmark set represent different degrees of structural_variability within nmr ensembles the degree of variability average displacement per residue ranges from to almost a for the entire benchmark set the average displacement per residue in nmr ensembles is a the values for each protein are given in supplementary table s the analysis of variability of nmr ensembles versus prediction quality showed a tendency that the higher the flexibility cabs flex predictions of protein_flexibility observed in an nmr ensemble the better the correlation_coefficient r s between nmr and cabs flex or md fluctuation profiles for of proteins from the benchmark set the average displacement within their nmr ensembles is a in this subset the average r s between nmr and simulation cabs flex or md is slightly_higher for cabs flex and for md than for proteins with less variable nmr ensembles furthermore we examined another subset of proteins for which cabs flex predictions were the poorest with r s k b waz kkg k k cok sgg pcp pav p q rgf in this subset of proteins the average r s between nmr and cabs flex fluctuation profiles was while that between nmr and md was even lower the subset analysis showed that of proteins had nmr ensembles exhibiting almost no or small flexibility in contrast to cabs flex or md predictions the exception was pcp which has a small amount of secondary_structure only for these nine proteins the average displacement per residue within nmr ensembles was below a counted for the entire or most of the chain such large rigidity does not seem to be justified by the structural_characteristics of these proteins for at least some of them highly_homologous counterparts can be found in the pdb which show more structural_variation than the analyzed nmr ensembles the above observations suggest that an important source of poor correspondence between fluctuations from computational a b comparison of residue

plots for the entire test_set are presented in supplementarypredictions from cabs flex or md and nmr ensembles is the underestimation of fluctuations in nmr ensembles several studies strongly indicate that fluctuations in nmr ensembles are underestimated and do not reflect real structural_heterogeneity the underestimations are largely due to shortcomings of computational procedures used to generate the ensembles based on nmr_data the cabs flex method provides an alternative to other efficient computational_tools generating protein residue fluctuation profiles such as sequence_based predictors of protein disordered_regions meszarosmesza or coarse_grained normal_mode nma most disorder prediction_algorithms such as disopred perform well for stable globular_domains or highly_flexible disordered_regions without a strong structural preference however their performance does not meet expectations for structurally ambiguous regions meszarosmesza therefore in comparison with sequence_based disorder prediction_algorithms cabs flex is better suited to detecting non obvious dynamic_behavior e g significant fluctuations within the well defined secondary_structural that could be of biological_importance another class of commonly used algorithms that compute protein fluctuation profiles use nma based on elastic network models or other coarse_grained models e g webnma server in comparison with elastic network models cabs flex uses more detailed information on the protein system and generates residue fluctuation profiles better correlated on average with those obtained by all atom md see our section in the cabs flex generated models or trajectory can also be subjected to nma as we demonstrated earlier essential movements derived from cabs flex trajectories might not be accurate individually but when considered together they provide a similar description to that obtained by all atom md readers interested in applying the nma may refer to a review on the usefulness and limitations of the method due to the dynamic nature of proteins structure based studies of protein functions require accurate description of protein_flexibility crystallographic b factors are perhaps the most common measure used for the elucidation of residue fluctuations and this is probably because the majority of known structures have been solved by x_ray the b factors reflect protein_flexibility but are also influenced by crystallization conditions the refinement method used for the interpretation of x_ray data and importantly the molecular environment of the crystal_structure the crystal environment has a significant effect on protein_flexibility the spectrum of fluctuations is considerably flattened in crystal as compared with that in solution moreover most x_ray structures have been determined at cryogenic temperatures crystal cryo cooling has been shown to reduce b factors introduce packing defects and it may result in unrealistically unique non functional structures therefore descriptions of protein_flexibility derived from x_ray models and b factors must be approached with caution nmr and all atom md are now the methods of choice for investigation of protein_flexibility in solution because of the difficulty of nmr_studies and timescale problems in all atom md coarse_grained methods have emerged as an inexpensive and powerful alternative the design of coarse_grained methods successfully_applied for large timescale investigations of protein dynamics encompasses entirely different modeling strategies an excellent review on the successes and shortcomings of diverse coarse_grained representations of protein_flexibility is provided in in this work we compare cabs flex predictions of protein fluctuations with that derived from nmr ensembles and md_simulations the comparison shows that cabs flex produces on average a more similar distribution of residue fluctuations to nmr ensembles than md does this is due to more efficient sampling compared with md which leads to additional fluctuations or fluctuation amplitudes that better fit the nmr ensemble data moreover the results from cabs flex and md can complement each other in the sense that the flexibility of some protein regions may be better retrieved by one of these methods while the remaining part by the other one in summary our results suggest that for the accurate assessment of protein_flexibility it is reasonable to analyze results from both cabs flex and atomic md_simulations because the cabs flex method provides a significantly cheaper means of accessing backbone dynamics than atomic md it is a promising tool for larger and or initial reconnaissance screening studies for example of the effect of mutations on protein_stability or

correlation values and standard_deviations in brackets are presented for the entire protein benchmark set and its subsets having average fluctuations in the nmr ensemble lower rmsd a or higher rmsd a
