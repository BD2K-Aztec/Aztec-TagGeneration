structural_bioinformatics xmsf structure preserving noise_reduction and pre segmentation in microscope tomography interpretation of electron tomograms is difficult due to the high noise levels thus denoising techniques are needed to improve the signal_to xmsf microscopy mean shift filtering is a fast user_friendly application that succeeds in filtering noise while preserving the structures of interest it is based on the extension to d of a method widely_applied in other image_processing fields under very different scenarios xmsf has been tested for a variety of tomograms showing a great_potential to become a state of the art filtering program in electron_tomography applied iteratively the algorithm yields pre segmented volumes facilitating posterior segmentation tasks moreover execution times remain_low thanks to parallel_computing techniques to exploit current multicore computers electron_tomography et has gained interest in recent_years for its ability to image relatively big and heterogeneous specimens in a near to native_state low electron doses are used to reduce the radiation_damage which makes the reconstructed volumes exhibit low signal_to snr thus noise_reduction is essential to increase the snr and to facilitate visual_inspection segmentation and in the end interpretation of volumes different denoising techniques have been applied with different degree of success gaussian filtering techniques allow fast noise_reduction but tend to blur volume features not discerning between noise and signal recently iterative median filtering van_der has emerged as a simple and nonlinear technique to filter electron tomograms but it is not optimal under extremely noisy conditions bilateral filtering is an anisotropic filtering technique that has drawn some attention in this field it is based on adaptive gaussian filtering that accounts for both spatial and intensity distances anisotropic nonlinear diffusion and techniques adapt the strength and direction of the filtering to the local structure they are prevalent because the snr is significantly_enhanced while the important structural_information is preserved however their computational_demands are large and they have a number of parameters whose tuning is not to whom correspondence should be addressed trivial for those reasons the availability of new fast methods that are easy to use are very welcome in et this work proposes to use a filtering technique based on the mean shift algorithm mean shift image filtering and segmentation has been previously used with success in different image and video processing areas such as photo edition video tracking_systems etc here we have extended this algorithm for the d case and have prepared a program for public use xmsf microscopy mean shift filtering the resulting filtering program is highly intuitive and user_friendly and moreover yields good results under different snr circumstances also if applied iteratively it has shown a great_potential as a preliminary step for segmentation tasks chip expected to grow rapidly in the near future the user is expected to benefit from this feature greatly memory_consumption is twice the size of the tomogram image being processed xmsf has a great_potential of application in et it has shown to deal well with disadvantageous noisy conditions present in electron tomograms while preserving important structural_features the parallel implementation of the algorithm allows a nearly linear speed up in multicore machines providing fast results at a reduced_cost in terms of execution time and image_quality xmsf outperforms other standard methods in many applications xmsf has the additional advantage of its ability to perform presegmentation of complex tomograms which is essential in this field
