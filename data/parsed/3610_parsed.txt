population_based structural_variation discovery with hydra multi current strategies for snp and indel discovery incorporate sequence_alignments from multiple_individuals to maximize sensitivity_and it is widely_accepted that this approach also improves structural variant sv_detection however multisample sv analysis has been sty mied by the fundamental difficulties of sv calling e g library insert_size variability sv alignment signal integration and detecting long_range genomic_rearrangements involving disjoint loci extant tools suffer from poor scalability which limits the number of genomes that can be co analyzed and complicates analysis workflows we have developed an approach that enables multisample sv analysis in hundreds to thousands of human_genomes using commodity hardware here we describe hydra multi and measure its accuracy speed and scalability using publicly_available data_sets provided bywe present an extension of hydra our structural variant sv discovery software that like many extant tools was designed to detect sv in a single_genome using discordant paired_end alignment signals hydra multi generalizes the hydra algorithm to multiple samples libraries and extends its scalability to incorporate information from many genomes simultaneously variant discovery from multiple samples has been a staple of snp and indel discovery and has been shown to provide_substantial improvement in accuracy over the single_genome strategy therefore it is logical to make use of all available data in sv_detection especially due to the ever increasing number of datasets from large projects such as the cancer_genome tcga andthe genomes_project kgp we previously applied multisample sv discovery in a study of genome_instability in mouse induced_pluripotent cell_lines however the algorithm employed for that study was limited to a handful of samples hydra multi was therefore developed to call svs in a large number of tumor normal pairs in previous_studies the standard cancer genome workflow consisted of calling svs in a tumor and a matched normal and subsequently compared the calls in each sample to find putative somatic_mutations such tumor normal comparisons are fraught with somatic misclassifications i e predicting that a variant is somatic when it is actually in the germline where evidence of sv is found in the tumor but not the normal this problem is exacerbated when shallow coverage is obtained for normal samples leading to a greater number of false somatic sv predictions in the tumor sample in contrast directly integrating_multiple datasets can prevent somatic misclassification in cases where the supporting alignments do not exist in the matched normal but do exist in the genomes of other normal samples other algorithms have employed similar strategies however these frameworks either scale poorly on commodity hardware or simply perform post_hoc genotyping rather than directly combining all data during sv discovery genotyping after discovery can suffer from instances where ample coverage may not be present and therefore sv breakpoints are missed in the discovery phase
