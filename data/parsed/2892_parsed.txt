metabolome scale de_novo pathway reconstruction using regioisomer sensitive graph alignments motivation recent_advances in mass_spectrometry and related metabolomics technologies have enabled the rapid and comprehensive analysis of numerous metabolites however biosynthetic and biodegradation pathways are only known for a small portion of metabolites with most metabolic_pathways remaining uncharacterized results in this study we developed a novel method for supervised de_novo metabolic_pathway with an improved graph alignment based_approach in the reaction filling framework we proposed a novel chemical graph alignment algorithm which we called pacha pairwise chemical aligner to detect the regioisomer sensitive connectivities between the aligned substruc tures of two compounds unlike other existing graph alignment_methods pacha can efficiently detect only one common subgraph between two compounds our results show that the proposed_method previous descriptor based_methods or existing graph alignment_based in the enzymatic_reaction likeness prediction for isomer enriched reactions it is also useful for reaction annotation that assigns potential reaction characteristics such as ec enzyme commission numbers and piero enzymatic_reaction ontology for partial information terms to substrateproduct pairs finally we conducted a comprehensive enzymatic_reaction likeness prediction for all possible uncharacterized compound pairs suggesting potential metabolic_pathways for newly predicted substrateproduct pairs understanding cell_metabolism is essential in a wide_range of fields e g metabolic_engineering synthetic_biology drug_discovery and clinical treatments of metabolic_disorders recent_advances in mass_spectrometry and related metabolomics technologies have enabled the rapid and comprehensive analysis of numerous metabolites however biosynthetic and biodegradation pathways are only known for a small portion of metabolites with the majority of pathways remaining uncharacterized for example it is estimated that at least metabolites are produced within all plants for which most chemical_transformations remain to be identified elucidation of potential metabolic_pathways in plants would provide a significant benefit for environmental agricultural pharmaceutical and public_health matters experimental determination of metabolic_pathways is difficult expensive_and thus automatic pathway reconstruction on a metabolome scale is a challenging issue in current computational_biology the traditional in silico method for metabolic_pathway is the predefined pathway approach where enzyme coding_genes are mapped onto appropriate positions in the predefined pathway diagrams based on gene gene sequence_similarities this method has been used for analyzing metabolic_pathways in fully_sequenced organisms or in specific conditions of cellular_processes another method in the predefinedwe developed a novel method for supervised de_novo metabolic_pathway with an improved graph alignment algorithm called pacha our proposed pacha enabled us to detect regioisomer sensitive connectivities between aligned substructures of two compounds the novelty of our proposed method lies in the detection of a unique graph alignment scalability for analyzing a vast amount of compounds on a metabolome scale and applicability to many tasks in metabolic_pathway we showed the usefulness of the pacha descriptors for enzymatic_reaction likeness prediction and reaction annotation with a sparsity induced classifier this study addressed the importance of the distinction of regioisomers for metabolic_pathway although a popular_approach for representing compounds is to use chemical descriptors that deal with many small chemical substructures they cannot correctly consider the substructure connectivity thus the comparison of two chemical descriptors is insufficient to generate atomatom mapping which makes it impossible for all descriptor based_methods to describe sensitive chemical changes in a single enzymatic_reaction as illustrated in simcomp the most related previous graph_based method was designed for searching similar compounds in databases by allowing some small common substructures the common procedure in simcomp and pacha is to generate an association graph where the vertices association nodes represent the atomatom pairs of two compounds and obtain common subgraph s considering adjacency the difference between simcomp and pacha lies in the definition of adjacency in the association graph pacha defines the association nodes as being adjacent to each other only when the corresponding atoms are adjacent in both compounds therefore only one common subgraph occurs and the second common subgraph is not allowed simcomp defines the association nodes to be adjacent either when the corresponding atoms are adjacent in both compounds or when they are not adjacent in both compounds the adjacency in the simcomp association graph often generates multiple common subgraphs which are integrated afterwards however in some cases the integrated subgraph contains many gaps having such gaps is not an issue when finding similar compounds e g for pharmaceutical purposes however it is of crucial importance for metabolic_pathway because most reactions generate or eliminate only a few chemical bonds therefore the number of gaps affects the prediction_accuracy of enzymatic_reaction likeness our proposed pacha algorithm solved this problem successfully as demonstrated by significant_improvement of the de_novo pathway reconstruction especially in the analysis of isomerenriched data future extensions would involve the detection of frequent substructure changes and stereoinversions which requires more sophisticated tuning of pacha
