piecewise_linear approximation of protein_structures using the principle of minimum message length simple and concise representations of protein_folding patterns provide powerful abstractions for visualizations comparisons classifications searching and aligning structural data structures are often abstracted by replacing standard secondary structural featuresthat is helices and strands of sheetby vectors or linear segments relying solely on standard secondary_structure may result in a significant loss of structural_information further traditional_methods of simplification crucially depend on the consistency and accuracy of external methods to assign secondary_structures to protein coordinate data although many methods exist automatically to identify secondary_structure the impreciseness of definitions along with errors and inconsistencies in experimental structure data drastically limit their applicability to generate reliable simplified representations especially for structural_comparison this article introduces a mathematically rigorous algorithm to delineate protein_structure using the elegant statistical and inductive inference framework of minimum message length mml our method generates consistent and statistically_robust piecewise_linear explanations of protein coordinate data resulting in a powerful and concise representation of the structure the delineation is completely_independent of the approaches of using hydrogen_bonding patterns or inspecting local substructural geometry that the current methods use indeed as is common with applications of the mml criterion this method is free of parameters and thresholds in striking contrast to the existing programs which are often beset by them the analysis of results over a large number of proteins suggests that the method_produces consistent delineation of structures that encompasses among others the segments corresponding to standard secondary_structure with the rapid_growth in the corpus of known structures concise representations are increasingly preferred to inspect and analyze protein_folding patterns at the core of this simplification is the idea that proteins contain repetitive substructural elements and that the essence of a fold lies in the assembly and to whom correspondence should be addressed interaction of these elements the appearance of some of these elements arises from the periodicity in the patterns of hydrogen_bonds between backbone nitrogen and carbonyl_groups along the protein polypeptide_chain among the standard secondary_structure definitions are helix helix helix and helix and strand of sheet ideally the spatial trace of carbon c atoms of standard secondary_structure show a linear trend allowing them to be abstracted using vectors or line segments without much loss of structural_information about the fold the common practice is to fit an axis to a helix and a least square line to c or main_chain atoms of strands of sheet replacement of secondary_structural with line segments is therefore one of the common methods to abstract protein_structures and construct concise representation of their folding patterns the number of standard secondary_structural observed in a protein is typically an order_of than the number of residues in a chain therefore methods that utilize concise representations clearly benefit from a massive space and computational saving especially when comparing and analyzing structures on a large_scale methods that abstract protein_structure at the level of secondary_structure generally rely on external programs that can automatically assign secondary_structures to coordinate data however accurate identification and assignment of secondary_structure is an inexact process although definitions based on hydrogen_bonding provides some rigor in assigning secondary_structure the standard definition of what constitutes a hydrogen_bond is based on the notion of bond energy whose measurement can be imprecise and acutely sensitive even to small differences in the position of nitrogen and carbonyl atoms especially the carbonyl oxygen positions two popular programs that use hydrogen_bonding as a basis for assignment of secondary_structure are dssp_and on the other hand secondary_structure can be defined using geometric features such as distances and dihedral_angles of c atoms along the backbone in addition to other local structural_features in fact there is a direct correlation between patterns of hydrogen_bonding and the geometry that arise out of them however secondary_structural can deviate substantially from ideal geometry therefore posing severe challenges to detect such elements using geometric features alone among the methods that rely primarily on geometry to assign secondary_structure arepage i i i in the previous sections we have demonstrated an efficient and statistically_robust algorithm to simplify a protein_structure with piecewise_linear segments we implemented the described algorithm in c our implementation is available from http www csse monash edu au karun pmml we evaluated our method using a non redundant dataset containing protein_structures obtained from the protein_data the non redundancy here implies that no two structures in this dataset share a sequence_identity this dataset was culled using the program pisces the list of proteins structures in the dataset and the results of their delineation produced by our method can be obtained from the aforementioned link gives the distribution of the measure of simplification of structures over the entire dataset for a structure the measure of simplification is the ratio of number of line segments identified by the program over the number of residues in the structure on an average geometric profiles of ideal secondary_structures used to classify coarsely the delineation identified by the program and are average backbone dihedral_angles n is the periodicity of the local structure is the rise p is the pitchthe respective secondary_structure assignments using dssp_and we note that both these programs assign secondary_structure definitions at a residue_level while the coarse assignment for our method described above is at a segment level therefore to enable a comparison between the methods we assign all residues within a segment to the segment level secondary_structure state gives the concordance of helix and strand assignments between dssp stride and our method pmml although even a coarse segment level assignment by our method produced a satisfactory concordance with dssp_and there is still a disagreement of between pmml and the other two methods inspecting these differences we note that the majority of them came from the terminal parts of the segments delineated by our program therefore we refine the coarse level assignment produced by pmml using the hydrogen_bonding patterns of residues within each segment to reassign the secondary_structure state at a residue_level we use a simple proximity of backbone nitrogen and carbonyl_groups and angle of n o c atoms based computation of hydrogen_bonds comparing our refined assignments at a residue_level with dssp_and we notice a substantial improvement in the concordance of helix and stand assignments with dssp_and see rows and in we emphasize that although pmml can be used to generate protein secondary_structure assignments its real aim is to generate concise representations of structures irrespective of the nature of the segments of which they are composed for instance pmml could be applied to rna_structures without needing any appeal to the types of substructure anticipated manually evaluating the delineation of a large number of structures we notice that although pmmls delineation identifies the regions of helix and strand consistently there remain small discrepancies in assigning precise beginning and end residuesthe sses in the rows follow the order of their appearance along the chain of the protein from its n to c terminus the column wwpdb gives the residue ranges of various sses as indicated in the wwpdb file nll the column pmml gives the corresponding residue ranges of the segmentation produced by pmml of secondary_structure as ascertained by an expert to highlight these differences consider the following example of the delineation produced by pmml shows the structure of oxidized clostridium beijerinckii flavodoxin this protein binds a cofactor flavin_mononucleotide fmn flavodoxin is a small protein containing a stranded parallel sheet with two helices packed against each face of the sheet a e and c d there is also a short helix b located near the n terminus of the protein different segments produced by pmml are shown in different colors the elements of secondary_structure shown as thick ribbons are the secondary_structure assignments taken from the structures wwpdb file nll gives the residue ranges that is start and end residues for each secondary structural_element sse of the flavodoxin structure listed in its wwpdb file the residue ranges of the corresponding segmentation produced by pmml is also presented in the table broadly the program correctly assigns segments to the sses however minor differences can be i we have presented a novel and efficient method to delineate protein_structures using the mml framework mml is tolerant to measurement_error and other inaccuracies the model used in this work is independent of preconceived notions of what substructures are being sought to simplify the observed coordinate data our method maximizes the economy of representation while minimizing the loss of information taking_into even the loop_regions of proteins analysis of the delineations of a large number of protein_structures suggests that the method is consistent in among others delineating standard secondary_structures the concise representations produced by this method have a potential use for rapid and accurate structure comparison and lookup an implementation of our program is available from http www csse monash edu au karun pmml
