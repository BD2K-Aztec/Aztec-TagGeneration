systems_biology glycosylation network_analysis toolbox a matlab based environment for systems glycobiology systems glycobiology studies the interaction of various pathways that regulate glycan biosynthesis and function software_tools for the construction and analysis of such pathways are not yet available we present gnat a platform independent user extensible matlab based toolbox that provides an integrated computational environment to construct manipulate and simulate glycans and their networks it enables integration of xml_based glycan_structure data into sbml systems_biology files that describe glycosylation reaction_networks curation and manipulation of networks is facilitated using class definitions and glycomics database query tools high_quality visualization of networks and their steady_state and dynamic simulation are also supported availability the software_package including source_code help documentation and demonstrations are available at http sourceforge net_projects gnatmatlab files glycosylation is an important post_translational that alters a majority of mammalian secreted and cell_surface proteins glycosylated proteins play structural and functional_roles in diverse_biological including inflammation cancer and development the recent development of advanced analytical_tools has heralded the emergence of glycomics a field where entire glycomes of cell systems are characterized these data are starting to be stored in glycosylation specific databases like the glycomedb and the consortium for functional glycomics cfg website bioinformatics and statistical_approaches developed to query glycomics databases offer an avenue to study glycosylation systems based mathematical_modelling represents an alternate methodology particularly if the emphasis is on the quantitative_analyses of biochemical_pathways that contribute to a given experimentally_measured glycan distribution software applications to construct and analyse glycosylation reaction_networks do not exist this manuscript describes a new matlab based toolbox called glycosylation network_analysis toolbox gnat pronounced naet this package provides a streamlined approach for the construction visualization and simulation of glycosylation reaction_networks it introduces a method to store glycan_structure information in sbml format files it provides basic data_structure manipulation tools to tailor glycans and associated networks it enables an environment where data obtained by querying of glycomics databases can be applied to refine reaction_network model structure it provides an interactive gui graphical_user that allows linkage between individual glycans represented in glycosylation networks and corresponding data in glycomics repositories finally the toolbox facilitates steady_state and dynamic simulation of glycosylation reaction_networks
