structural_bioinformatics the design of optimal therapeutic small_interfering molecules targeting diverse strains of influenza a virus motivation there is an urgent need for new medications to combat influenza_pandemics methods using the genome_analysis of the influenza a virus performed previously we designed and performed a combinatorial exhaustive systematic methodology for optimal_design of universal therapeutic small_interfering molecules sirnas targeting all diverse influenza a viral_strains the rationale was to integrate the factors for highly_efficient design in a pipeline of analysis performed on possible influenza targeting sirnas this analysis selects specific sirnas that has the ability to target highly_conserved accessible and biologically_significant regions this would require minimal dosage and side_effects results and discussion first possible sirnas were designed successive filtration followed where a novel method for sirna scoring filtration layers was implemented this method excluded sirnas below the experimental inhibition mapped scores using the intersection of different scoring algorithms further filtration of sirnas is done by eliminating those with off targets in the human_genome and those with undesirable properties and selecting sirna targeting highly probable single_stranded regions finally the optimal properties of the sirna were ensured through selection of those targeting conserved biologically functional short motifs validation of a predicted active sh and a predicted inactive sh that was filtered out in stage silencer of the ns gene showed_significant of the ns gene for sh with negligible decrease for sh which failed target accessibility this demonstrated the fertility of this methodology as it is a big_challenge to design universally_applicable sirnas for influenza that are potent specific and non toxic we sought page expression upon co transfection of ns and ns shrna expressing vectors in hek_cells a hek_cells confluent in well plates were transfected with g of flag ns from the h n pandemic virus h n v expression_vector alone or together with g ns specific pu shrna expressing vectors sh and sh or together with luciferase specific pu shrna expressing vector shluc normalization for equal amount of plasmid_dna transfected was obtained by transfecting and g of pflag empty vector in the experimental controls were no ns protein and no shrna were expressed lane or were ns protein was expressed but not shrna lane respectively immunoblotting_analysis of wces collected h post transfection from hek_cells by using anti flag and anti actin abs are shown b the relative increase decrease in the ns h n v expression upon co expression of shrnas was measured by densitometry analysis of the immunoblotting experiment and expressed as arbitrary_units after normalization with the levels of actin first to exhaustively design all possible candidates and then filter them out based on the many factors that affect sirna efficiency continuing previous work that utilized sirnas against the m and np segments the silencing of the ns protein was also demonstrated_experimentally as a test of our methodology in addition to checking the efficiency of the criteria by sirnas that was filtered out in stage using the rnaxs tool as it had low single_stranded probability moreover we provided the methodology and results for each filtration stage in supplementary_file s the total sirnas that were designed stage from both datasets the sirnas remaining after the and inhibition cutoff scores filtration stages and the sirnas after the target accessibility filtration stage are all displayed sequentially in the different sheets for all the six segments have formulated a broad inhibitor of influenza a virus h n strain np and pa our methodology has similar extrapolated three sirnas that target the same segments in the stage sirnas np segment and in stage sirnas similarly have tested h n targeting sirnas here sirnas targeting all diverse strains of influenza were sought through analyzing different hosts finding common conserved_regions and using the design power of the best recommended second generation algorithms this was complemented by target accessibility analysis of the sirnas using different approaches additionally we selected sirnas that target functional and completely conserved_motifs to ensure a comprehensive exhaustive methodology for efficient potent sirna selection out of the total designed sirnas using sivirus and second generation tools more than half remained after filtering the inhibition scores and omitting sirnas with less than two mismatches to human mrnas the risc off target effect was eliminated by excluding all sirnas with two or less mismatches to human mrnas after mapping the sirnas of average experimental inhibition percent to various algorithms scores hundreds of sirna that covered the five influenza genome remained the highest number of sirnas targets pb the largest segment cropping the list to the scores corresponding to the inhibition reduced the numbers of sirnas by more than a half with more than a hundred sirna for each segment using optimization steps like choosing sirnas with terminal ends having high singlestranded probability the remaining sirnas in each segment were in tens finally using sirnas that target functional conserved_motifs the number of sirnas in each segment was reduced substantially to few sirnas that we predict to be potent efficient silencers
