systems_biology predicting kinase substrates using conservation of local motif density motivation protein_kinases represent critical links in cell_signaling a central problem in computational_biology is to systematically identify their substrates results this study introduces a new method to predict kinase substrates by extracting evolutionary_information from multiple_sequence in a manner that is tolerant to degenerate motif positioning given a known consensus the new method condens compares the observed density of matches to a null_model of evolution and does not require labeled training data we confirmed that condens has improved_performance compared with several existing_methods in the field further we show that it is generalizable and can predict interesting substrates for several important eukaryotic kinases where training data is not available availability_and condens can be found atprotein phosphorylation is a well studied class of post_translational that has powerful influence over the dynamics of biological_systems it is characterized by the addition of a phosphate_group po to an amino_acid by a kinase enzyme proteins that are subjected to these events often undergo a biochemical change that can in turn affect biological_pathways associated with them kinases often choose phosphorylation targets selectively and different kinases may favor residues with different local arrangements of amino_acids which are referred to as consensus_sequences or motifs however consensus_sequences alone are often insufficient for kinase_substrate prediction because they tend to be short and degenerate and matches are expected to occur frequently by chance in random_sequences computational kinase_substrate predictors take advantage of a myriad of local biological_information in generating their predictions this includes amino_acid arrangement biochemical structural property and quantity density to whom correspondence should be addressed of consensus matches there are also some that incorporate interactome information to further enhance their predictions the focus of our work is to develop a kinase_substrate prediction method based on motif conservation over evolution this idea is based on the work in a previous study which illustrated that consensus sites for protein_kinase or pka are more likely to be phosphorylated if preserved over longer evolutionary_distances a challenge in using this approach is that patterns of molecular_evolution in protein_sequences are highly_heterogeneous in many cases a match to a consensus_sequence which we will also refer to as match motif match or consensus match can be considered as functionally conserved if it is well aligned in a multiple_sequence or msa however in situations where the entire local sequence neighborhood is also conserved it will be difficult to tell whether the matches are specifically conserved due to a kinase substrate_interaction or non specifically conserved as part of a larger domain with a different function at the same time functional phosphorylation motif matches do not necessarily align in a msa previous_studies that phosphorylation_sites are often not positionally conserved despite being located in the same local region in orthologous_proteins for such examples one can observe that the quantity of matches in the local sequence neighborhood is consistent among orthologous sequences nevertheless all of these cases contrast with the patterns observed for randomly occurring matches to the consensus_site that typically show no consistent conservation patterns and disappear quickly current conservation based prediction methodologies are largely focused on the residue conservation of motif matches since these strategies are dependent on the positional conservation of the matches of interest they may be insensitive towards situations where matches are not positionally conserved furthermore the lack of consideration for the local_regions conservation can lead to false detection of matches located in highly_conserved neighborhoods to address_these we designed a new kinase_substrate prediction method condens that i considers the conservation of the number of motif matches in a local region of the protein rather than the alignment of individual phosphorylation_sites and ii uses an evolutionary model to account for the local sequencein all we offer a new method to predict kinase substrates based on evolutionary_conservation of phosphorylation_site recognition motifs the requirement for accurate phosphorylation_site alignment was circumvented by using the local retention of motif density as the measure of conservation since the new method is based on a statistical_model of molecular_evolution a labeled training_set is not required furthermore we demonstrated the methods utility in mining substrates for kinases with some information on substrate_specificity but few characterized in vivo substrates condens should be applicable to a wide_variety of model_organisms due to available databases such as ensembl and inparanoid that provide homologous sets of proteins
