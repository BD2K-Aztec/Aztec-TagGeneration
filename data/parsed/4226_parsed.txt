gene_expression shinygeo a web_based application for analyzing gene_expression datasets the gene_expression geo is a public repository of gene_expression data although geo has its own tool geo r for data analysis evaluation of single genes is not straightforward and survival analysis in specific geo datasets is not possible without bioinformatics expertise we describe a web_application shinygeo that allows a user to download gene_expression data_sets directly from geo in order to perform differential_expression and survival analysis for a gene of interest in addition shinygeo supports customized graphics sample_selection data export and r code generation so that all analyses are reproducible the availability of shinygeo makes geo datasets more accessible to non bioinformaticians promising to lead to better understanding of biological_processes and genetic_diseases such as cancer availability_and web_application and source_code are available from http gdan cik github io shinygeo the gene_expression geo is a public repository of genomic_data that currently hosts gene_expression containing million samples geo is a valuable resource for identifying biomarkers of biological_processes and disease its datasets have been used to identify_biomarkers of hras and myc pathway activity biomarkers of monocyte differentiation in response to viral_infection and prognostic_biomarkers in breast bladder and lung_cancer biomarker evaluation in geo datasets typically involves data_retrieval and gene probe selection followed by an appropriate statistical_analysis a differential_expression determines whether the expression of a gene differs_significantly across two or more groups of samples a survival analysis determines whether gene_expression is significantly associated with an event such as death from disease through comparison of kaplainmeier curves based on censored time to event data to facilitate data analysis geo provides an interactive web_tool geo r http www ncbi nlm nih gov geo geo r which allows users to_identify in geo datasets however geo r does not support survival analysis and is designed for gene_discovery rather than for evaluation of individual genes in addition although specialized tools have been developed to facilitate gene_expression analysis by non bioinformaticians there are no available tools that allow a user to evaluate whether a specific gene is differentially_expressed or associated with survival in a specific geo dataset in this paper we describe shinygeo a web_based for performing differential_expression and survival analysis on gene_expression in geo in addition shinygeo produces publicationready and customizable graphics allows for sample_selection data correction data export for custom analyses and r code generation for reproducibility
