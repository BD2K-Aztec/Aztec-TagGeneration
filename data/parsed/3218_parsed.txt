gene_expression netclass an r package for network based integrative biomarker signature discovery in the past_years there has been a growing interest in methods that incorporate network information into classification algorithms for bio marker signature discovery in personalized_medicine the general hope is that this way the typical low reproducibility of signatures together with the difficulty to link them to biological_knowledge can be addressed complementary to these efforts there is an increasing interest in integrating different data entities e g gene and mirna expressions into comprehensive models to our knowledge r package netclass is the first software that addresses both network and data_integration besides several published approaches for network integration it specifically contains our recently_published stsvm method which allows for additional integration of gene and mirna_expression data into one predictive classifier availability netclass is available on http sourceforge net p netclassr and cran http cran rone of the major_goals of personalized_medicine is to identify molecular_biomarkers that reliably_predict a patients response to therapy to avoid ineffective treatment and to reduce drug side_effects and associated costs for that purpose prognostic and diagnostic biomarker signatures have been derived from omics_data in numerous publications for various disease_entities to construct biomarker signatures typically machine_learning are used such as svms and randomforests the challenge is the extreme high_dimensionality of omics_data coupled with a relatively small_sample which imposes a major need for careful feature_selection however during the past_years it has become more and more clear that classical feature_selection such as t test based filtering frequently lead to signatures that are neither reproducible on a different dataset nor biologically interpretable hence there has been a growing interest to incorporate prior information on protein_protein pathways or gene_ontology into feature_selection see cun and frohlichfrohlich a for an extensive review it has been shown that such approaches can at least increase the feature_selection stability and facilitate the biological_interpretation of signatures cun and frohlichfrohlich b in this article we present our r package netclass which implements five network based gene_selection methods although there is a rich literature on general data_integration netclass is to our knowledge the first software that allows for integrating mirna and mrna_expression data together with protein_protein and mirna target_gene information into one predictive_model netclass thus complements the functionality of our earlier software_package pathclass it is worth emphasizing that netclass focuses on classification algorithms only a software_package that is more tailored to cox_regression is coxboost the basic idea behind stsvm is to smooth a feature wise marginal statistic like the commonly used t statistic over the structure of a joint proteinprotein and mirna target_gene interaction graph for this purpose a random_walk kernel is used a permutation_test is used to select features in a highly consistent_manner and then these features are used for subsequent svm training in our article we demonstrated the utility of this approach on four datasets from different tumor_entities and specifically showed that integration of mirna and mrna_expression could enhance the prediction power for prostate cancer_prognosis netclass is an r package that allows for network and data_integration for biomarker signature discovery it includes several published approaches for incorporating network information into gene_selection moreover netclass contains our recently_published stsvm algorithm which allows for additional integration of mirna and mrna_expression data all implemented methods can perform repeated cross_validation to estimate the prediction_performance moreover integration of igraph facilitates the follow_up analysis of selected_features via graph algorithms and plotting functions in summary we believe that netclass provides a useful tool for biomarker signature discovery in personalized_medicine workflow of stsvm marginal statistics for features in each omics dataset are computed and smoothed over the structure of a joined mirna ppi_network after re ranking a permutation_test selects the most relevant_features and trains an svm model the obtained signature can be visualized as a network
