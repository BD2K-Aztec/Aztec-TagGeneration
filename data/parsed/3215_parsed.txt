data_and netal a new graph_based method for global_alignment of protein_protein motivation the interactions among proteins and the resulting networks of such interactions have a central role in cell_biology aligning these networks gives us important information such as conserved complexes and evolutionary_relationships although there have been several publications on the global_alignment of protein networks however none of proposed methods are able to produce a highly_conserved and meaningful alignment moreover time complexity of current_algorithms makes them impossible to use for multiple_alignment of several large_networks together results we present a novel algorithm for the global_alignment of pro teinprotein interaction networks it uses a greedy method based on the alignment scoring_matrix which is derived from both biological and topological information of input networks to find the best global_network netal outperforms other global alignment_methods in terms of several measurements such as edge correctness largest common connected subgraphs and the number of common gene_ontology between aligned_proteins as the running time of netal is much less than other available methods netal can be easily expanded to multiple_alignment algorithm furthermore netal overpowers all other existing algorithms in term of performance so that the short running time of netal allowed us to implement it as the first server for global_alignment of proteinprotein_interaction availability binaries supported on linux are freely_available for download atthe interactions among proteins are of high importance within the majority of biological_functions a protein may interact with another protein for the sake of modification it also may interact to form part of a protein complex or it may carry another protein there are numerous experimental_techniques including yeast_two and protein co immunoprecipitation that demonstrate large_scale proteinprotein_interactions ppis for organisms including saccharomyces_cerevisiae homo_sapiens and drosophila_melanogaster as the data from these experiments have a lot of false_positive interactions putting several studies containing other data types such as gene_expression into account they have been used to reduce the number of such interactions von such an analysis is the alignment between networks that identify functional or structural conserved components in species the purpose of network_alignment is to align nodes of the input networks to maximize the overall match between them this alignment not only gives the global similarities between the networks of species but also yields knowledge about the topology of the proteins in the networks that is valuable in evolutionary_biology given a group of such ppi_networks the scores of the pairwise_alignment between them can be used to construct their phylogenetic_tree most of the previous_approaches focused on local_network lna lnas find local similar subnetworks that are probably conserved components either functional or structural pathblast networkblast mawish and graemlin are examples of local_network pathblast uses both blast similarities of the proteins and the probabilities of interactions to find the biological_pathways these probabilities indicate how much an interaction is true and is not false_positive networkblast generates a network_alignment graph_based on the sequence_similarities and performs a search over the network to identify_conserved pathways and clusters mawish models the biological deletion and duplication and uses the weighted edge of the network to find the maximum_weight induced subgraph graemlin uses a scoring_scheme based on two models in one of which the module is subject to evolutionary_constraints however in other proteins the modules are under no constraints as mapping of lna is categorized as one to many mapping it may be ambiguous in other words in this kind of alignment one node can be aligned with different nodes in different local to whom correspondence should be addressed conserved subnetworks although this may indicate gene_duplication in some cases it may cause implausibly numerous matches for a protein previous lna algorithms have not generally been able to detect large connected subgraphs that are conserved during the evolution in contrast the purpose of global_alignment is to find a unique correspondence between all nodes of the input networks such an overall alignment can result in detection of functional orthologs and cross_species variations the pioneering work in this area was carried_out by isorank that mapped the nodes of two input networks based on the similarity of their neighborhood topology it uses a preprocessed matrix that indicates the efficiency of aligning each node of the network to all others afterward isorankn was proposed for aligning multiple_networks this algorithm uses original isorank to find the alignment scores between any pair of networks it uses a developed pagerank nibble algorithm to infer the alignment clusters based on these scores graemlin is a parameter learning algorithm that finds the alignment between multiple_networks by relying on their phylogenetic_relationships ga and path are based on one and two relaxations over the set of doubly stochastic matrices they use the same objective_function that balances the matching similar pairs with increasing the number of conserved edges piswap uses a local optimization to find the optimal alignment this algorithm initially finds an alignment using only sequence_data and then adjusts it by incorporating topological information natalie is a lagrangian relaxation approach that uses homology_information with a branch and bound method to compute the global_alignment hopemap is a parameter free algorithm that iteratively refines the conserved_regions by applying a connected componentbased process graal and hgraal rely solely on topological network similarities based on the graphlet_degree vector although graal is a greedy seed and extend approach hgraal uses hungarian algorithm to find the optimal alignment mi_graal uses both node similarity and topological network similarity_measures to break the ties and find a more stable alignment inone can see the categorization of different tools including netal which shows how the strategies are different broadly network_alignment local or global can be categorized into two groups pairwise_alignment and multiple_alignment pairwise alignment_algorithms align two ppi_networks mawish natalie hopemap piswap isorank graal h graal and mi_graal are examples of pairwise alignment_algorithms however multiple alignment_algorithms try to create an alignment between more than two ppi_networks isorankn networkblast and graemlin are in this group previous_algorithms for the problem of ppi network_alignment use two main approaches for scoring the alignments some of the algorithms such as graal use solely the topology of networks whereas most of the alignment_methods like mawish networkblast isorankn and graemlin incorporate previous biological_information about nodes such as the similarities of protein_sequences and phylogenetic_relationships in ppi_networks in this article we propose a novel algorithm netal network aligner as a solution to the pairwise global ppi network_alignment this problem can be formulated as follows given two networks find an injective mapping so each node in the smaller network is mapped to one node in the larger network all the details of our algorithm are discussed on pairwise_alignment but it can be easily promoted to multiple_alignment this algorithm uses a scoring_function based on both biological and topological information the topological information between each pair of nodes is updated gradually during execution the main advantages of our proposed method are finding the best global ppi alignment and the ability to find big connected common subgraph that is so useful for extracting the biological_information we compare the results of our program with mi_graal graal and isorank to demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our method the reason for choosing these tools for comparison is because of the accuracy of their results in comparison with other existing_tools that have been used so_far in this section our algorithm is compared with other global network_alignment the comparisons are done based on five criteria at first these criteria for the comparison are introduced edge correctness ec is the percentage of edges interactions of the first network that are aligned to edges in the second network higher values of the ec indicates that the two input networks are topologically more similar ec is computed by the following equation obviously if the second network has a subnetwork that is isomorphic to the first network then ec can be ideally one node correctness nc is the percentage of nodes proteins of the first network that are aligned to the correct nodes of the second network let f be the correct node mapping and g be the alignment mapping then nc is defined asobviously to calculate nc a correct node mapping like f should be known interaction correctness ic is the percentage of interactions of the first network that are aligned with a correct interaction in the second alignment ic is defined aswhere a fu v e jfu gu fv gvg like nc for calculating ic a correct node mapping like f should be known largest common connected subgraph lccs is largest connected subgraph of the first network that is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second network this common subgraph is not necessarily induced the larger and denser connected subgraphs are biologically more valuable nf is the number of aligned protein pairs that their functional_similarity is such protein pairs are considered to be functionally_related higher values for nf indicate that the alignment is functionally meaningful functional_similarity between proteins is defined based on their gene_ontology go terms the functional_similarity of two proteins is calculated by the method defined by this method only considers biological_process and molecular_function terms go terms that exist in different databases describe some biological_characteristics of the proteins such as molecular_function biological_process and cellular_component if both proteins corresponding to the aligned pair of nodes share_common go terms then it means that the aligned_proteins are functionally_similar more common go terms express that two proteins of the aligned pair are more similar to each other a large number of such pairs in the resulted alignment supports that the alignment is biologically credible in the next section the netal algorithm is compared with the other global alignment_algorithms such as isorank graal and mi_graal on the basis of the mentioned criteria the reason for choosing these tools is their availability and the accuracy of their results in comparison with other existing_tools although isorankn and graemlin are also popular and renowned algorithms for global_network they are not included in our assessments output of isorankn algorithm is not compatible with ours for which we excluded from our comparisons it outputs disjoint sets of aligned_proteins that each set may contain a node of one network that is aligned to several nodes of the other network in other words it gives a one tomany mapping between the nodes moreover the input information of graemlin is somehow different with other alignment_methods for example it takes the phylogenetic_relationships among the species corresponding to input networks some other algorithms such as ga and path are not able to align huge networks to each other including yeast and human furthermore some other methods like natalie and hopemap need homology_information to align networks
