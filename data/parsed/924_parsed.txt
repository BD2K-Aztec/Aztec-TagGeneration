chado controller advanced annotation management with a community annotation system we developed a controller that is compliant with the chado database schema gbrowse and genome_annotation editing tools such as artemis and apollo it enables the management of public and private data monitors manual_annotation with controlled_vocabularies structural and functional_annotation controls and stores versions of annotation for all modified features the chado controller uses postgresql and perl availability the chado controller package is available for download at http www gnpannot org content chado controller and runs on any unix like operating system and documentation is available atwith the growth of large community annotation projects due to the rapid progress of the next_generation efficient and optimized genomic_data management is critical community annotation systems cass are suitable for curators to annotate from all over the world via the web some genomic_information systems have been provided to the community but only a few of them allow manual interactive dynamic and user_friendly curation generic model_organism database gmod http gmod org is a collaborative project to develop a set of interoperable open_source for visualizing annotating and managing biological data in this project are developed popular software such as chado a modular database schema that underlies many gmod tools such as the generic genome_browser gbrowse to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address um ligm cnrs upr igh imgt f montpellier france in conjunction with genome_annotation editing tools such as apollo and artemis these interfaces are foundations for a generic and robust cas however additional components are required to consolidate these components for instance software to deal with confidential and unpublished_data which is an important requirement for a system to be more widely_adopted by biologists that prefer to deal with flat files on a local file system also required is a monitoring system to keep track of the annotation_process and highlight annotation inconsistencies currently when a modification is made pre_existing manual annotations are overwritten and only basic data quality_controls are made to address_these we decided to extend the chado schema our approach was driven by the gmod philosophy and we propose a generic modular seamless easy to install and highly configurable controller called the chado controller cc
