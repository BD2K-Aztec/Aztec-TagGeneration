random distance_dependent attachment as a model for neural_network generation in the caenorhabditis_elegans motivation the topology of the network induced by the neurons connectivitys in the caenorhabditis_elegans differs from most common random networks the neurons positions of the c elegans have been previously explained as being optimal to induce the required network wiring we here propose a complementary explanation that the network wiring is the direct result of a local stochastic synapse_formation process results we show that a model based on the physical distance between neurons can explain the c elegans neural network_structure specifically we demonstrate that a simple model based on a geometrical synapse_formation probability and the inhibition of short coherent cycles can explain the properties of the c elegans neural_network we suggest this model as an initial framework to discuss neural_network generation and as a first step toward the development of models for more advanced creatures in order to measure the circle frequency in the network a novel graph_theory circle length measurement algorithm is proposed contact neural_networks can have up to billion synapses the information defining the position of each synapse is not hard coded into the genome since the number of genes coding for the properties of the neural_network does not exceed a few hundred even for the complex network of the homo_sapiens axon_guidance for example is determined by a few tens of genes specifically in the caenorhabditis_elegans mainly nertins ephrins and semphorins the position of each synapse must therefore be determined by other means the synapse positions can be a combination of genetically coded hardwired connections stochastic processes or learning_mechanisms the relation between the neurons positions and the network wiring has been extensively_studied in the context of optimal wiring to whom correspondence should be addressed perez escudero and the neuron positioning was proposed to be optimized to minimize the total axon and dendrite lengths the neuron positions were indeed found to reduce the wiring length compared to a random positioning however it is not clear whether the neuron positioning is optimized to minimize the wiring or if the short wiring is simply the result of the preferential attachment of nearby neurons the only currently existing fully mapped neural_network is the one of the ce as part of the ce project a full map of the ce cells was produced and all neurons and synapses were mapped the observed ce has neurons and synapses which are divided_into motor sensor and intermediate neurons a wide_distribution of synaptic_connections characterizes the ce network neurons with a high number of synaptic_connections are mostly localized on the main nerve ring the nerve rings bundles of axons encircling the outside of the pharynx are the principal circumferential tracts in the ce nervous_system axons from sensory_neurons in the anterior ganglia form six labial nerves that enter the nerve ring at its anterior margin most axons from neurons in the lateral ganglia enter the nerve ring at its posterior margin either laterally or ventrally via the ventral ganglion other neurons such as sensors and motor_neurons are naturally localized near the edges of the nematode however there are also a large number of sensors near the pharynx because the pharynx centralizes much of the sensory activity of the nematode in the current work we propose to study the ce nn generation mechanism using network_theory tools we represent the ce nn neurons as nodes and synapses as edges hundreds of network generation mechanisms were proposed in the last few years some very generic and some specific to a given network e g among many others the simplest network generation mechanism model was suggested by in this model a network is constructed by randomly connecting nodes for a given erdos renyi network with n nodes ern n p the probability of connecting each pair is p this network has a poisson degree_distribution and short average geodesic distances between nodes page the network_properties of the ce nn differ from most known networks the ce nn stands half way between an ern and a scale_free network the ce nn degree_distribution is neither a power_law black line in nor a poisson_distribution the ce nn has a large number of nodes with a very low degree on one side and a fat tail on the other side the ce nn clustering_coefficient is high versus in parallel ern its shortest_paths distribution is also longer than the one typical to ern and it has a peculiar small_scale motif distribution supplementary the ce nn degree_distribution also differs from the one expected in a strogatz and watts model the ce nn evolves through cell_division and synapse_formation over a limited spatial region neurons with distant soma have a lower probability of being connected as can be seen from the observed distribution of synapses and pre synaptic soma physical distances note that some of the neurons are long and span most of the nematode body affecting the distance distribution the probability of connecting two neurons decreases with the distance between the soma centers if only neurons with short span are considered the decrease is approximately geometrical with a power between and except for a small group of distal connections that will be further discussed we here propose an attachment model that follows the observed node position and synapse distance distributions all neurons were placed in their observed experimental position and the probability of creating an edge between two neurons was defined as p i j c d i j in order to test the validity of our model we tested whether the model reproduces the generic features of the observed ce nn the only free parameter in the simulation is we run multiple simulations with different values of and for each such value we did simulations most of the properties of the ls are similar to the ce nn for and the average geodesic distance against the full shortest_path distribution and the average connectivity properties the simulated spatial network and an ern the upper left drawing represents the nodes shortest_paths distribution where the similarity between the real ce nn and the local simulation ls network can be seen in contrast with the ern the lower left panel represents the degree_distribution on a loglog scale the upper right drawing is the connectivity distribution and the lower right drawing is the betweenness_centrality distribution in all drawings one can clearly see the similarity between the ce nn and the ls network and the difference to the ern the physical distance distribution of neurons with short spans as a fraction of the total nematode body_length in neurons which are long and span most of the nematode body more than half the size of the nematode the neuron itself contributes significantly to the physical distance and the physical distance distribution of all connected neuron pairs is flat full gray line against are similar between the ls and the ce nn and very different from the ern or sfn the connectivity of node i is defined as the number of nodes in its connected component the only feature that is different between the ls and the ce nn is the clustering_coefficient which is sd away from the ls results the sd of each page the ce nn is currently the only fully mapped network beyond its obvious physical_parameters size number of neurons number of synapses and the physical position of the neurons it has several well defined properties such as its peculiar degree_distribution clustering_coefficient centrality and shortest distance and circle distribution this fully mapped network allows us to test if the network_structure is predetermined and rigid or is based on a simple stochastic_process we have tested the simplest stochastic_process where the probability of creating a synapse decreases geometrically with the physical distance this model contains a single_parameter and can explain the vast_majority of the network_properties the main difference between the proposed model and the experimentally_measured ce nn is the low number of coherent circles in the observed network this may be due to a secondary process that limits useless very short information cycles and increasing the number and length of long circles such an inhibitory process is reasonable taking_into that most axon_guidance and neural adhesion genes are inhibitory thus the network generation is a mixture of spatial and functional_limitations the proposed model suggests that the network_properties can be explained by the need to maintain global connectivity and a local structure such a balance leads to the creation of local nerve rings with a high internal clustering on the one hand and the creation of long_range axons on the other hand at the mathematical level these two requirements limit the values of to a very narrow range and explain most of the network_properties a complementary view of neural_networks is that the neurons positions have evolved over long_periods to minimize the wiring length neuron positions may have evolved to optimize some functionality for example through the aggregation of neurons in rings however the observed minimal wiring length cannot serve as a proof for such a mechanism the proper positioning of neurons based on their wiring properties can be an artifact of the network generation mechanism we have applied an optimal wiring algorithm to the network produced by the simulation and obtained a average_error of in the node positions random positions would give a similar error was obtained when the ce nn was used the analysis was performed assuming a single synapse between each pair of connected neurons while the nematodes nn is much simpler than that of primates and advanced vertebrates its generation rule may hint to the way much more complex_networks are generated one may extrapolate from these results two basic building elements i a local stochastic creation mechanism combined with functional_limitations on short coherent circles ii local structure and long_range connectivity need to be maintained such a model can be the prototype for the way the structure of large complex_networks can be theoretically coded by a very small number of genes
