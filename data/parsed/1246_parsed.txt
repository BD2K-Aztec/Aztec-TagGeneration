databases_and dadp the database of anuran defense peptides anuran tissues and especially skin are a rich source of bioactive_peptides and their precursors we here present a manually_curated database of antimicrobial and other defense peptides with a total of entries most of them in the precursor form with demarcated signal_peptide sp acidic proregion s and bioactive moiety s corresponding to non identical bioactive sequences search functions on the corresponding web_server facilitate the extraction of six distinct sp classes the more conserved of these can be used for searching cdna and uniprotkb databases for potential bioactive_peptides for creating prosite search patterns and for phylogenetic_analysis availability dadp is accessible at http split pmfst hr dadp with the growing problem of pathogens developing resistance to conventional antibiotics there is a great interest in antimicrobial_peptides amps as substitute therapeutics there are several existing databases on many types of amps apd camp phytamp defensins knowledgebase amsdb bactibase amper and yadamp however these databases tend to focus on the antimicrobial sequences and the immature precursors from which the active amps are cleaved are not always present dadp is a versatile database for anuran defense peptides that retains all this important information some anuran species contain amps in their tissues and especially their skin as well as other bioactive_peptides but many are endangered while whole genomes have been decoded for only out of almost species bioactive_peptides from amphibian species with function often related to host_defense are a fast_growing group in the uniprotkb database and this attempt to collect and order them all can mostly serve to emphasize the incompleteness of our knowledge for instance out of species from the dadp only can be found among threatened and near threatened anuran species from the iucn red list the dadp focuses on precursors and their conserved sps and has allowed the individuation of six distinct sp classes see_supplementary and supplementary tables s and s consensus_sequences for the different sp classes are a good foundation for searching protein or dna databases that might carry precursors with novel amp sequences where a direct homology_search based on the active region only is unsuccessful the most numerous class of sps present in of precursors has twin lysines at positions and and is denoted as class in dadp it is found in neobatrachia families ranidae hylidae hyperoliidae and rhacophoridae sp classes are associated not only with amps but also with mature bioactive_peptides having other functions precursor structure is informative about origin function and evolution of mature peptides collected in the dadp but there are numerous peptides present only as the mature bioactive sequence where the precursor structure is not reported the activity data shown as mic and hc values are available for over sequences these should however be considered critically as both are quite sensitive to assay conditions which vary from lab to lab e g medium salt_concentrations and the size of initial inoculum which should be at least cfu_ml for mic and at most erythrocytes for hc determinations limits often either not observed or not defined in published_papers the conservation of sps in different suborders and families of anurans whose relatedness follows continental tectonics and corresponding changes in biogeography is quite impressive supplementaryand the dadp web_server this is one of those rare examples when maintenance of the export sps which are dispensed with after secretion is evolutionarily more conserved than the mature exported polypeptide structure it may be beneficial for the host to have accelerated co evolution of the mature defense peptide_sequences to keep up with the constantly shifting microbial biota allowing to maintain the hostpathogen balance the number of identical sps associated with different mature peptides found in different species can be quite large e g identical class sp sequences encompassing species and associated with different mature peptides it is also possible to find identical mature peptides associated with sps that are different in several positions an example is the antimicrobial granulosusin d and palustrin isa respectively belonging to different species amolops granulosus from china and rana ishikawae from japan another is the bradykinin sequence rppgfspfr which is associated with different sp sequences in different species these bioactive skin peptides from frogs and toads may be effective repellents against macroscopic predators such as fish and snakes these two cases are possible examples of convergent_evolution of the active region to provide for similar functions the dadp can greatly_facilitate using the hmmer tool to search uniprotkb for amphibian amps in this case the sequence_length limitations of the tool require the combined use of the signal_sequence and acidic propiece as the query the dadp can be regularly updated using both keywords and similarity_search
