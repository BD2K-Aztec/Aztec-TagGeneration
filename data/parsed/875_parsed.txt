sequence_analysis catrapid signature identification of ribonucleoproteins and rna_binding regions motivation recent_technological revealed that an unexpected large number of proteins interact with transcripts even if the rna binding_domains are not annotated we introduce catrapid signature to identify ribonucleoproteins based on physico chemical_features instead of sequence_similarity the algorithm trained on human proteins and tested on model_organisms calculates the overall rna_binding propensity followed by the prediction of rna_binding regions catrapid signature outperforms other algorithms in the identification of rna_binding and detection of non classical rna_binding regions results are visualized on a webpage and can be downloaded or forwarded to catrapid omics for predictions of rna_targets availability_and catrapid signature can be accessed atrna binding_proteins rbps use rna binding_domains rds to recognize target rnas and to regulate co post_transcriptional processes examples of classical rds include rna_recognition rrm double_stranded binding_domain dsrrm k homology kh rgg box and the pumilio fbf pum domain in addition to classical rds recent experimental_studies on hela hek and mesc cells indicate that a number of rna interacting_proteins contain non classical rds ncrds for which annotation is not yet available discovery of new rds is a challenging_task domaindetection tools such as hmmer and blast rely on sequence_similarity to identify annotated rds and fail to recognize newly_discovered rbps similarly other methods such as rnapred predict rnabinding ability using features of annotated rds that might be different in ncrds alternatives to identify rna_binding regions include bindn pprint and rnabindr but the algorithms have been trained to identify single amino_acids and not contiguous regions catrapid signature overcomes these limitations by i predicting the propensity of a protein to interact with rna and ii identifying rna_binding regions through physico_chemical instead of sequence_patterns the algorithm is an extension of the catrapid approach to predict protein_rna and the cleversuite algorithm to classify protein groups using physico chemical_features
