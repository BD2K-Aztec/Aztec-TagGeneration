structural_bioinformatics towards the development of standardized_methods for comparison ranking and evaluation of structure alignments motivation pairwise_alignment of protein_structures is a fundamental task in structural_bioinformatics there are numerous computer programs in the public_domain that produce alignments for a given pair of protein_structures but the results obtained by the various programs generally differ substantially hence in the application of such programs the question arises which of the alignment programs are the most trustworthy in the sense of overall performance and which programs provide the best result for a given pair of proteins the major_problem in comparing evaluating and judging alignment results is that there is no clear notion of the optimality of an alignment as a consequence the numeric criteria and scores reported by the individual structure alignment programs are largely incomparable results here we report on the development and application of a new approach for the evaluation of structure alignment results the method uses the translation vector and rotation matrix to generate the super position of two structures but discards the alignment reported by the individual programs the optimal alignment is then generated in standardized form based on a suitably implemented dynamic_programming where the length of the alignment is the single most informative parameter we demonstrate that some of the most popular programs in protein_structure research differ_considerably in their overall performance in particular each of the programs investigated here produced in at least in one case the best and the worst alignment compared with all others hence at the current state of development of structure comparison techniques it is advisable to use several programs in parallel and to choose the optimal alignment in the way reported here availability_and the computer software that implement the method described here is freely_available melolab org stovca an alignment of two protein_sequences is completely defined by a set of pairs of amino_acids one from each protein that are considered to be equivalent or related on the other hand an alignment of two protein_structures can be considered as a sequence_alignment together with the geometric transformation that simultaneously superimposes the c atoms of the equivalent amino_acid in fact for any sequence_alignment the associated optimal transformation is found by minimizing the root_mean rms error of the c distances between the equivalent pairs of residues this unique optimal transformation can be computed efficiently the remaining question is how to get the most suitable or optimal alignment at the current state of affairs the question is unanswered the reason is that in the construction of structure alignments two conflicting goals need to be satisfied one goal is to maximize the number of equivalent residues i e the length of the alignment the second is to minimize the associated rms error obviously one can lower the rms error at the expense of shortening the alignment or one can maximize the alignment_length on the expense of increasing the rms error but it remains_unclear what combination of alignment_length and rms value provides the most suitable result in any particular case lacking a clear definition of what constitutes an optimal alignment structural_bioinformatics has created an ever growing arsenal of computer programs all dedicated to solve one and the same problem the pairwise superposition of two protein_structures where each program provides its own numerical criteria and scores to describe the properties of the alignments obtained from a users point_of the situation is most confusing research on protein_structure requires structure alignment tools but it is unclear which programs produce the most valuable results in a given situation and how the results obtained have to be interpreted obviously some effort of standardization is required in what follows we describe an approach that can be used to compare structure alignments obtained from any program that reports the geometric transformation required to superimpose the two structures in fact the transformation consisting of a translation vector and a rotation matrix is the essential result of any structure alignment technique using the transformation the structures can be superimposed and from the superimposed structures alignments can be constructed transformation and superposition on the one hand and alignment construction on the other can be executed independently it is therefore possible to use the transformations reported by the individual programs to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com to compute standardized structure alignments and the associated alignment_length as we demonstrate below this standardized alignment_length which is optimal when obtained with a dynamic_programming on some defined parameters is a most convenient measure for the comparison and ranking of structure alignment results as we have demonstrated here the construction of structural_alignments of proteins can be split in two independent parts i the geometric transformation required for the superposition of two structures and ii the read out of the associated sequence_alignment from the superimposed coordinates the transformation captures the performance of a particular protein_structure program whereas the read out of the alignment can be standardized in this way the geometric transformation is mapped to a single characteristic number the alignment_length which can then be used to judge the performance of individual methods or to choose the longest alignment from a set of alternatives using this approach we have shown that the various programs investigated here perform quite differently on the benchmark_dataset on the one hand the programs split in two groups where one group clearly outperforms the other but at the same time there is no single program consistently producing the optimal alignment therefore depending on the application it may be advantageous to use several programs in parallel to choose the most appropriate alignment from the ensemble of alternatives reported by the individual programs in each case it is important to highlight that the software developed here called stovca is used only to calculate sequence_based alignments of maximum_length from an input pair_wise protein_structure superposition generated with another software the alignment produced by stovca is optimal according to the user provided parameters given a fixed set of parameters the resulting sequence_alignments are standardized and thus they can be compared directly in benchmarking the various programs we used single domains of comparable size corresponding to the most basic scenario encountered in protein_structure research in many applications the situation is more complex proteins often consist of several domains contain repeats the alignment may require permutations in the sequences and the complete description of the extent of structural_similarity of two proteins may require several alternative alignments we have not addressed_these here as only a few programs report a full set of alignments can handle permutations or multi_domain e g therefore besides the criteria of optimality we have discussed here the power of a structure alignment program and the quality of the results obtained critically depend on these additional_criteria additionally we have not incorporated in this benchmark any software that carries out flexible protein_structure superposition but only rigid structure superposition given that maximum alignment_length was the criteria adopted to assess the performance of the structure superposition methods it would be unfair to use this measure to assess the performance of flexible aligners which normally produces many short alignments with a low rms error along the same line of discussion it is also fair to mention that not all the structure superposition software tested here have been optimized to maximize the alignment_length this may explain why on average some software_tools perform better than others the focus of the work presented here is not to compare and rank different structure superposition software but rather to emphasize that in difficult cases the results obtained from the various programs may differ_considerably a reasonable strategy to compare various alignments and to select the best one according to a given measure like alignment_length is to generate all the alignments in standardized form this is exactly what the method reported here does similar strategies may eventually be developed in the future for alternative measures thus allowing the comparison of software performance from distinct point of views we expect that the use of the method presented here improves the accuracy of structural_alignments of distantly_related and single_domain which in turn may have a widespread and positive impact in the study of i sequence structure relationships in proteins and rna_molecules ii evolutionary_relationships in protein_families that exhibit a high divergence at the sequence level iii identification of functionally_important and iv classification of protein and rna_structures structure superposition was generated by the specific software_tools mentioned above and the subsequent calculation of the optimal structure alignment with stovca software was carried_out segments of protein_chains that do not contain equivalent positions are shown in blue query_protein chain and green target protein chain colours structurally aligned regions of blue and green protein_chains are shown in red and orange colours respectively acknowledgement we are very grateful to dr lisa holm for sending us the dali software as well as for her support to install it in our computer systems in the superposition generated with topmatch and the corresponding optimal structure alignment obtained with stovca colouring scheme used here is the same as that described in
