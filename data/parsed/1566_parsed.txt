elaspic web_server proteome_wide structure based prediction of mutation effects on protein_stability and binding_affinity elaspic is a novel ensemble machine_learning approach that predicts the effects of mutations on protein_folding and proteinprotein_interactions here we present the elaspic web_server which makes the elaspic pipeline available through a fast and intuitive_interface the web_server can be used to evaluate the effect of mutations on any protein in the uniprot database and allows all predicted results including modeled wild_type and mutated structures to be managed and viewed online and downloaded if needed it is backed by a database which contains improved structural_domain definitions and a list of curated domaindomain interactions for all known proteins as well as homology_models of domains and domaindomain interactions for the human_proteome homology_models for proteins of other organisms are calculated on the fly and mutations are evaluated within minutes once the homology_model is available availability_and the elaspic webserver is available online at http elaspic kimsequence variation in the human_genome is a crucial aspect in biomedical_research many variants can directly cause mendelian_diseases and can confer_susceptibility or protection to more multifactorial_diseases such as cancer to unravel the mechanism behind those phenotypic_effects we first need to understand the biochemical impact of mutations a number of computational_tools have been developed to predict the effect of mutations on protein_stability or binding however those tools require a resolved crystal_structure of the protein precluding their application on a proteome_wide scale there are webservers which use structural_information to predict the effect of mutations and which map mutations to proteins in a d protein_interaction however none of those resources predict the effect of mutations on protein_protein affinity here we present a webserver that can be used to predict the effect of mutations on protein_stability and protein interaction affinity for any protein for which a homology_model can be constructed the webserver is based on the elaspic pipeline but drastically simplifies the experience for the end_user impact results for all human mutations implicated in hereditary diseases and cancers new mutations are evaluated within minutes if homology_models are available and under an hour if those models are to be generated the webserver offers a streamlined and intuitive_interface for analyzing the results and makes all predictions and structures available for download
