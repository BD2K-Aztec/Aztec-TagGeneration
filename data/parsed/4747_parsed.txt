genome_analysis triplex inspector an analysis tool for triplex mediated targeting of genomic_loci at the heart of many modern biotechnological and therapeutic_applications lies the need to target specific genomic_loci with pinpoint accuracy although landmark experiments demonstrate technological maturity in manufacturing and delivering genetic_material the genomic sequence_analysis to find suitable targets lags behind we provide a computational aid for the sophisticated design of sequence specific_ligands and selection of appropriate targets taking gene location and genomic architecture into account availability source_code are downloadable from www bioinformatics org au triplexator inspector targeting genomic_loci with high_accuracy is essential for modern_molecular such as for insertion of genetically_engineered material into genomes recent_publications demonstrate the maturity of techniques using triplex forming peptide nucleic_acids pnas for accurate sequence specific gene_targeting apply pnas in conjunction with donor_dna to introduce heritable gene modification andimprove the delivery by linking the antennapedia transport peptide antp to the pna to enable its transfer into the cell_nucleus after systemic administration of the compound in contrast to these biotechnological achievements the determination of genomic targets that can be accurately targeted has been hampered by the lack of dedicated computational_tools able to jointly optimize the choice of the target_site and the design of the delivery molecule e g pna such that the number of possible collateral binding_sites off targets is minimized althoughwere able to demonstrate site_specificity by determining that the pnaantp conjugate did not alter the nearby control gene cii which contains a potential triplex target_site whose sequence differs from that of the intended target they acknowledged the possibility of pna binding occurring at other genomic_locations that have sequences similar to the target the extent to which applications of pna based delivery may be hampered by a non optimal target choice is demonstrated by the fact that the sequence chosen byhas almost identical copies across the mouse_genome making off target binding a near certainty the introduction of genetic_material at any of these loci but especially at the sites that are located within exons would have unpredictable and probably undesirable consequences this illustrates the need for a computational aid that takes triplex specific design_features into account triplex formation of conventional oligonucleotides relies on hydrogen_bonding of the third strand in the major_groove of the genomic_dna target and potential in vivo roles of triplexes are reviewed in in contrast pna based targeting as used by depends on strand invasion resulting in a pna dnapna triple_helix with a looped out dna_strand the peptide_backbone provides enhanced resistance to nucleases and pnas show an increased affinity for dna compared with oligonucleotides the target_site consists in either case of a sequence of consecutive purines that provide the hydrogen donor and acceptor groups that stabilize the triple_helix suitable genomic targets thus exhibit a dominant polypurinepolypyrimidine characteristic polyrpoly y
