sequence_analysis lordec accurate and efficient long_read error_correction motivation pacbio single_molecule real_time sequencing is a third generation sequencing technique producing long_reads with comparatively lower throughput and higher_error errors include numerous indels and complicate downstream_analysis like mapping or de_novo a hybrid strategy that takes_advantage of the high_accuracy of second generation short_reads has been proposed for correcting long_reads mapping of short_reads on long_reads provides sufficient coverage to eliminate up to of errors however at the expense of prohibitive running_times and considerable amounts of disk and memory space results we present lordec a hybrid error correction_method that builds a succinct de_bruijn representing the short_reads and seeks a corrective sequence for each erroneous region in the long_reads by traversing chosen paths in the graph in comparison lordec is at least six times_faster and requires at least less memory or disk_space than available tools while achieving comparable accuracy availability and implementaion lordec is written in c tested on linux platforms and freely_available atgc lirmm fr lordec sequencing the determination of dna or rna_sequences now belongs to the basic experiments in life_sciences compared with the sanger method the so_called next_generation of the second third or even fourth generations have drastically lowered its cost and increased its efficiency making genome_wide and transcriptome_wide sequencing feasible numerous types of omics experiments beyond de_novo genome_sequencing and assembly have been invented and rely on high_throughput all currently available technologies produce reads that represent only a piece of the target_molecule sequence processing these reads requires aligning them against other sequences for instance while mapping them against a reference_genome or when computing overlaps among reads during assembly optimal and sometimes suboptimal alignments are retained for further analysis the strength of an alignment and hence its usefulness is mostly controlled by two factors its percentage of identity and its length clearly errors introduced during the sequencing_process sequencing_errors blur the signal in an alignment by introducing mismatches or by breaking it into shorter ones weaker alignments may not pass subsequent filters and are lost for downward analyses the finer the analysis the higher the necessity to capture the information available in all alignments for instance when trying to bridge a gap in a less covered region of genome during assembly or to reconstruct the sequence of a less expressed rna to counteract sequencing_errors error_correction algorithms have been found effective for de_novo and so they are often incorporated in assembly pipelines see e g euler sr allpaths_lg and soapdenovo
