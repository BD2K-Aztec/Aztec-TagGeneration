structural_bioinformatics an automatic method for casp free modeling structure_prediction assessment motivation manual_inspection has been applied to and is well accepted for assessing critical assessment of protein_structure casp free modeling fm category predictions over the years such manual assessment requires expertise and significant time investment yet has the problems of being subjective and unable to differentiate models of similar quality it is beneficial to incorporate the ideas behind manual_inspection to an automatic score system which could provide objective and reproducible assessment of structure models results inspired by our experience in casp fm category assessment we developed an automatic superimposition independent method_named quality_control score qcs for structure_prediction assessment qcs captures both global and local structural_features with emphasis on global topology we applied this method to all fm targets from casp and overall the results showed the best agreement with manual_inspection scores among automatic prediction assessment methods previously applied in casps such as global distance test total_score gdt ts and contact score cs as one of the important components to guide our assessment of casp fm category predictions this method correlates well with other scoring_methods and yet is able to reveal good quality models that are missed by gdt ts critical assessment of protein_structure casp is an experiment running for years that has been absolutely_essential for evaluating progress or lack of thereof in prediction spotting and encouraging most successful methods and stimulating discussions in the field of structure_prediction for each biannual casp prediction period organizers collect sequences with d structures in the works to whom correspondence should be addressed and release them to predictors predictors deliver structure models and assessors critically_evaluate the quality of predictions after the experimental_structures have been determined by separating the process of prediction and assessment casp provides an objective basis for comprehensive evaluation of models based on the availability of structural templates and the prediction difficulty targets in casp are currently divided_into two categories template_based tbm and free modeling fm without an easily detectable template targets in the fm category are the most challenging and predicted models are usually of low quality fm category models are traditionally evaluated by manual_inspection because well established structure comparison measures such as root_mean rmsd or even global distance test total_score gdt ts may miss promising models for instance gdt like scores may emphasize on small but precisely modeled substructure such as a long helix rather than decent general fold and topology however model evaluation by human_experts is subjective and time consuming and it is impossible to carefully examine all the models within the time frame of a casp experiment a practical compromise is to limit manual_inspection to the top models selected by a scoring system e g gdt ts however this initial selection biases final results to avoid the bias recent casp assessors utilized additional scores e g cc contacts or distances to select candidates for visual_inspection combination of different methods lowers the probability of missing reasonable models and improves the evaluation of structure_prediction as the assessors of the casp fm category we introduced a novel automatic structure_prediction assessment method_named quality_control score qcs we suggest that the score is particularly useful to compare poor predictions qcs reflects our manual evaluation experience and aims to capture global features of models defined by mutual arrangement of secondary_structure sses interresidue contact component is included in qcs to quantify the accuracy of modeling atomic details overall qcs is in agreement with manual_inspection and correlates well with gdt ts however qcs can reveal models with better global topology that are missed by gdt ts qcs is not only suitable to select candidates for manual_inspection in the casp assessment but also can be used as an independent and objective method to assess the quality of structure_prediction with emphasis on the global topology moreover qcspage we developed an automatic method for structure_prediction assessment which is inspired by the manual assessment traditionally carried_out by casp assessors not dominated by local_features of the prediction qcs emphasizes the global topology qcs is a good complement for superimposition based scores as gdt ts and can be used for casp in the future and generally for automatic structure_prediction assessment moreover qcs can be upgraded into a tool for general structure alignment and comparison with emphasis on global features of the structure qcs or the ideas presented could be useful for remote_homology and structure classification of proteins
