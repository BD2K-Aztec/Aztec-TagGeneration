genome_analysis control freec a tool for assessing copy_number and allelic content using next_generation data more and more cancer studies use next_generation ngs_data to detect various types of genomic_variation however even when researchers have such data at hand single_nucleotide have been considered necessary to assess copy_number and especially loss_of loh here we present the tool control freec that enables automatic calculation of copy_number and allelic content profiles from ngs_data and consequently predicts regions of genomic alteration such as gains losses and loh taking as input aligned_reads control freec constructs copy_number and b allele_frequency profiles the profiles are then normalized segmented and analyzed in order to assign genotype status copy_number and allelic content to each genomic_region when a matched normal sample is provided control freec discriminates somatic from germline events control freec is able to analyze overdiploid tumor_samples and samples contaminated by normal cells low mappability regions can be excluded from the analysis using provided mappability tracks availability c source_code is available at http bioinfo curie fr projects freec cancer_genomes often display copy_number cnas and or losses of heterozygosity loh genetic_abnormalities in specific regions may be related to the aggressiveness of a cancer and be associated with clinical_outcomes to detect cna and loh regions single_nucleotide snp_arrays have been recently much in use furthermore next_generation ngs has been moving to replace snp_arrays in prediction of cnas a recent study presented exomecnv to whom correspondence should be addressed a tool to predict cnas and loh using exome_sequencing however detection of loh regions and more generally prediction of genotype status copy_number and allelic content of an altered region using whole_genome sequencing_data has remained unsolved the main challenges to doing so are non uniform read_coverage of genomic positions for example due to different mappability and gc_content and alignment bias reference allele coverage is usually higher than the coverage of the alternative allele thus the resulting signal is noisier and more difficult to process than in the case of snp_arrays here we present control freec control free copy_number and allelic content caller a tool that annotates genotypes and discovers cnas and loh control freec inherits many features from freec assessment of copy_number and evaluation of contamination by normal cells as well as the general_methodology of the gap algorithm for snp_arrays control freec takes as an input aligned_reads then constructs and normalizes the copy_number profile constructs the b allele_frequency baf profile segments both profiles ascribes the genotype status to each segment using both copy_number and allelic_frequency information then annotates genomic_alterations if a control matched normal sample is available control freec discerns somatic variants from germline ones we applied control freec to detect cnas and loh regions in a tumor normal dataset for a neuroblastoma patient x coverage unpublished_data control freec detected somatic cna and loh regions covering of the tumor genome and was able to identify the genotype status despite contamination of the tumor sample by normal cells estimated percent of tumor_cells was our results agreed with the snp_array analysis output we obtained consistency between the results of control freec and gap which we applied to snp_array generated for the same tumor sample supplementary_materials control freec is a tool for automatic_detection of cnas and loh regions using ngs_data it accurately calls genotype status even when no control experiment is available and or the genome is polyploid it corrects for gc_content and mappability biases in the case of tumor_samples control freec is able to evaluate the level of contamination by normal cells the software is written in c and freely_available
