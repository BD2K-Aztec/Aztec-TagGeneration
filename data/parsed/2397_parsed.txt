sequence_analysis improving protein secondary_structure using a simple k_mer model motivation some first order methods for protein sequence_analysis inherently treat each position as independent we develop a general framework for introducing longer range interactions we then demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to secondary_structure under the independence_assumption sequences produced by existing_methods can produce features that are not protein like an extreme example being a helix of length our goal was to make the predictions from state of the art methods more realistic without loss of performance by other measures results our framework for longer range interactions is described as a k_mer order model we succeeded in applying our model to the specific problem of secondary_structure to be used as an additional layer on top of existing_methods we achieved our goal of making the predictions more realistic and protein like and remarkably this also improved the overall performance we improve the segment overlap sov score by but more importantly we radically improve the probability of the real sequence given a prediction from an average of per residue to crucially this improvement is obtained using no additional information the prediction of secondary_structure remains very important in the field of protein biology even if the methods have matured and development of the algorithms is a far less active area than a decade_ago one of the reasons for this decline in activity is that most of the competing_methods have converged on a similar level of performance beyond which they have been unable to improve and possibly because the level of performance that they achieve is by bioinformatics standards exceptionally good this is reflected in the fact that the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp competition for protein_structure ceased to assess this as an official category some years_ago as has the eva continuous benchmarking project accurate prediction of secondary_structure from an amino_acid remains very useful to to whom correspondence should be addressed biologists in its own right but it is worth pointing out that it is also an essential component of tertiary_structure which in contrast is far from solved and continues to be a highly_active area of research in addition sequence comparison methods have more recently incorporated local structure tracks such as secondary_structure or burial the extra_information utilized by the new methods has led to considerable improvements in fold_recognition and alignment_accuracy there are many different methods for secondary_structure e g all using neural_networks analysis of the results of the last casp competition to include secondary_structure gives a good indication of the state of the art and the range of methods available for this work we chose to use predict nd which is named as one of the three leading original methods despite secondary_structure prediction_methods being able to correctly assign either helix strand or loop to roughly of the individual positions in a protein_sequence the overall prediction is not protein like for example these methods are capable of predicting a helix of a single amino_acid in length although consequently most have implemented an ad_hoc filter to remove them what we aim to achieve in this article is to create a model which makes the overall predictions of existing_methods more realistic and protein like without loss of performance as measured on a per residue basis it is possible that in doing this we may improve prediction_accuracy even if it is not our original goal the idea of implicitly using more than one amino_acid has been around for some time but many protein_sequence comparison methods when making a prediction implicitly treat positions in a protein_sequence with some level of independence even in cases where a sliding_window is used predictions are dependent on the neighbouring amino_acids but not usually directly on neighbouring predictions while an independence_assumption is an acceptable approximation when comparing individual amino_acid it fails dramatically for many local structure alphabets to give a specific example when a position in a sequence is an helix the adjacent positions are highly likely chance to also be helical in fact we have observed three broad types of correlations that violate the independence_assumption short range if h stands for a helix and a for an anti_parallel strand there are three times more occurrences of hh times more occurrences of aa but at least times fewerpage
