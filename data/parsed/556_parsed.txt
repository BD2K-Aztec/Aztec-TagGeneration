a structure based protocol for learning the family specific mechanisms of membrane binding_domains motivation peripheral membrane targeting domain mtd families such as c c and ph domains play_a in signal_transduction and membrane_trafficking by dynamically translocating their parent proteins to specific plasma_membranes when changes in lipid_composition occur it is however difficult to determine the subset of domains within families displaying this property as sequence_motifs signifying the membrane binding_properties are not well defined for this reason procedures based on sequence_similarity alone are often insufficient in computational_identification of mtds within families yielding less than accuracy even with a sequence_identity of results we present a machine_learning protocol for determining membrane targeting properties achieving accuracy in separating binding and non binding_domains within families our model is based on features from both sequence and structure thereby incorporation statistics obtained from the entire domain_family and domain specific physical quantities such as surface electrostatics in addition by using the enriched rules in alternating decision_tree classifiers we are able to determine the meaning of the assigned function labels in terms of biological_mechanisms conclusions the high_accuracy of the learned models and good agreement between the rules discovered using the adtree classifier and mechanisms reported in the literature reflect the value of machine_learning protocols in both prediction and biological knowledge_discovery our protocol can thus potentially be used as a general function_annotation and knowledge mining tool for other protein_domains signal_transduction networks formed by specific proteinprotein and proteinlipid interactions are a primary means by which the cell transmits information from its external environment to intracellular recipients one vehicle driving the intracellular signal_transduction speed beyond that of simple diffusion is the selective and reversible_binding of so_called peripheral proteins to membrane_surfaces within the cell by redistributing cytosolic_proteins to membranes in response to the onset of signaling_events a de facto compartmentalization of the cellular space takes to whom correspondence should be addressed place allowing for greater proximity among communicating parties thereby facilitating interaction the importance of this mode of signal_transduction is underlined by the fact that more than of human protein_kinases contain at least one lipid_binding module the ability to identify and understand peripheral proteins and the physical_factors causing their co localization at membranes is thus pivotal in uncovering the dynamics governing signaling regimens peripheral proteins are most commonly scaffold proteins containing one or more domains that associate with lipid head_groups thereby anchoring the entire protein_structure near the lipid surface an increasing number of ubiquitous and structurally_distinct domains have been found to display lipid binding_properties collectively referred to as membrane targeting domains mtds mtds have been identified in the following families c c ph fyve fab yotb vac eea px phox enth epsin n_terminal homology and recently pdz_domains despite their highly_similar intra family folds not all domains in these families possess membrane targeting properties in fact a diverse_array of overlapping intra family functions exists spanning from protein_protein to structural_support and potentially enzymatic_activity numerous experimental_techniques have been used to identify novel mtds revealing details on binding mechanisms and orientation genome_scale identification and characterization of mtds does however remain labor_intensive and expensive to this end in silico protocols offer a highthroughput complement to wet laboratory_methods allowing for rapid characterization of thousands of domains membrane binding_properties are inherently difficult to predict as they are often not determined by well defined sequence_motifs or a specific structural composition pdz_domains were for instance found to have highly diverging membrane binding behavior despite high_sequence and ph domains span a large range of binding_affinities though being structurally very similar in previous_works from our laboratory machine_learning protocols for distinguishing mtds from a general body of cytosolic protein_domains know to have no membrane binding activity were performance of a sequence_based nearest_neighbor classification procedure accuracy_measures for classification of membrane binding_properties for five domain families using consensus of the three nearest_neighbors for each domain the accuracy for each family is depicted at varying levels of maximum sequence_similarity allowed between instances in dataset for each domain_family constructed using support_vector svm and later on extended using other classifiers by representing each domain as a numerical vector of feature values derived from structural data a classification model achieving accuracy in separating binding and nonbinding domains was constructed there are however two issues of this model to be addressed first while performing well when separating mtds from cytosolic protein_domains of unrelated fold the model does not provide similar performance in separating binding and non binding_domains within any specific family as we will demonstrate intrafamily classification is in fact a very hard problem as even highly_similar domains display different membrane binding_properties second the constructed svm model does to a great extent function as a black_box classifier giving little insight as to how the different calculated features play together in producing the final classification of a domains binding_properties in this work we construct a series classification_models for separating membrane binding_domains from domains with other activity within families our focus is on c c and ph domain families as domains from these three families have been found to be key_players in a number of signaling_pathways we are however not merely interested in constructing models for classification as such models are of limited utility in explaining the predicted behavior in a manner that leads to experimentally testable hypothesis rather we want to provide both a confident assessment of a given binding behavior and a body of biological evidence_supporting the classification label the goal is to go from data_mining to knowledge mining revealing the specific mechanisms responsible for observable higher_level behavior to this end we take advantage of a new ensemble based_classifier namely the alternating decision_tree adtree algorithm the adtree relates to other classification tree algorithms such as cart and c by quantifying the relationship between features as a combination of rules each representing a binary decision on a feature the adtree is based on the boosting technique but is at the same time a tree_structure representable as a conjunction of rules all contributing a real valued additive evidence toward classification the final classification decision is thus determined by a committee voting scheme based on the real values evidence presented by each rule traversed in the tree by a given domain this scheme makes representation of the classifier as a spare and easily_interpretable tree_structure possible a feat recently demonstrated in studies for identifying dna_binding and characterizing their binding mechanisms the article is organized as follows first we give the intuition behind the features used to represent the individual_domains in a form suitable for constructing machine_learning protocols we then construct classification_models based on svm and adtree to separate intra family binding and non binding_domains finally we analyze the individual rules used in determining membrane targeting behavior in the three domain families in terms of experimentally known binding mechanisms the contribution of this work is fold first we show that machine_learning based on the sequence and structure features introduced below perform significantly better than procedures based on sequence_homology in separating mtds from non mtds within families second we demonstrate how adtree models not only perform comparable to a svm based models but also present us with specific evidence for the classification label allowing us to interpret the model within the context of current experimental_observations to further illustrate the difficulty of the current_classification task of intrafamily separation a simple unsupervised classification_scheme aimed at predicting the membrane binding behavior of a domain based on the binding behavior of closely_related homologs is fashioned a sequence is predicted to be binding or non binding from the majority vote decision of its three closest related sequence neighbor as defined from a blast_search depicts the prediction_accuracy for the procedure as a function of varying levels of the maximum sequence_similarity allowed between domains in the dataset it is evident that even at maximum sequence_similarity levels as high as accuracies of no more than can be achieved for any family indicating the need for more sophisticated procedures to confidently identify mtds within families compares the performance of svm adtree and the sequence_based nearest_neighbor protocol for three domain families in all families the two structure based machine_learning protocols perform significantly better domain separation than the sequence_based nearest_neighbor procedure at the sequence_identity level for c domains both svm and adtree improve on the accuracy of the sequence_based method by more than points with both achieving accuracy rates in the range the svm protocol does however have a better auc roc than the adtree due to a better balance between sensitivity_and making it the strongest classifier for this family inspecting the models constructed for c and ph domains we again observe a far better performance of the machine_learning over the sequence_homology based_classifier with accuracy improvements of points for both families comparing the svm and adtree models for the c domain families a similar performance over the entire specificity range is observed as the auc roc of the two models is almost identical although the adtree achieves a higher accuracy when comparing the points of best class separation for the two classifiers for the ph domain_family we again observe the two classifiers performing comparable with a small advantage to the svm algorithm of points as measured by auc roc in sum the results show that for the problem at hand the adtree models perform comparable or only slightly worse than svm indicating almost no loss in performance when using a model that has the feat of human interpretability though not presented here we have experimented with machine_learning protocols relying solely on sequence derived features although these protocols did show better performance than the nearest_neighbor homology_based procedure used as bench mark above they never achieved accuracies higher than which is significantly less than what was achieved by using both sequenceand structure based features
