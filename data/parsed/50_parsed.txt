accurate estimation of isoelectric_point of protein and peptide based on amino_acid downloaded from motivation in any macromolecular polyprotic systemfor example protein dna or rnathe iso electric pointcommonly referred to as the pican be defined as the point of singularity in a titra tion curve corresponding to the solution ph value at which the net overall surface chargeand thus the electrophoretic mobilityof the ampholyte sums to zero different modern analytical biochemistry and proteomics methods depend on the isoelectric_point as a principal feature for protein and peptide characterization protein_separation by isoelectric_point is a critical part of d gel_electrophoresis a key precursor of proteomics where discrete spots can be digested in gel and proteins subsequently identified by analytical mass_spectrometry peptide fractionation according to their pi is also widely used in current proteomics sample_preparation procedures previous to the lc_ms analysis therefore accurate theoretical prediction of pi would expedite such analysis while such pi calculation is widely used it remains largely untested motivating our efforts to benchmark pi prediction_methods results using data from the database pip db and one publically available dataset as our reference gold_standard we have undertaken the benchmarking of pi calculation_methods we find that methods vary in their accuracy and are highly_sensitive to the choice of basis_set the machine_learning especially the svm based algorithm showed a superior_performance when studying peptide mixtures in general learning based pi prediction_methods such as cofactor svm and branca require a large training_dataset and their resulting performance will strongly depend of the quality of that data in contrast with iterative methods machine_learning have the advantage of being able to add new features to improve the accuracy of prediction in a titration curve the isoelectric_point pi is the value at which the overall net surface_charge of a macromolecular polyprotic species equals zero protein pi values are amongst the most widely determined and widely_reported quantities in all of biochemistry and proteomics the pi is obtained as essentially incidental information during isoelectric_focusing ief experiments free_flow electrophoresis ffe capillary_electrophoresis and in gel_electrophoresis experiments using ipg strips electrophoresis based separation of proteins and peptides in both free_flow and gel systems has been adapted to a wide_variety of proteomics platforms in order to reduce the complexity of the studied proteome in addition to the resolution and dynamic range of the fractionation technique combining the electrophoretic_separation of proteins with mass_spectrometry analysis provides an orthogonal analytical_method for improving protein identification in different workflows assuming a protein to be denatured theoretical_calculation of the pi is typically rapid requiring only the sequence as input most techniques exploit tabulated pk a values for the different ionizable amino_acid such values are assumed to be constant regardless of structural context many authors have reported different values for the pk a s of protein side_chains and most of them are derived from measurements of side_chains in isolated amino_acids or from model compounds as well as values derived from ionizable side_chains in situ as many such alternative theoretical methods have been proposed the calculation of protein pi values is in urgent need of benchmarking since its accuracy remains largely untested extant comparison has been exiguous using very small_datasets peptides rather than proteins or has reported poor accuracy we have previously described the database pip db a collection of proteins with associated experimentally_determined pi values as collated from the literature in this paper we use pip db as a gold_standard reference for comparison and describe the benchmarking of protein pi prediction we also include a peptide dataset to evaluate the performance of pi prediction_methods when estimating peptide pis due to the importance of properly assessing the accuracy of such prediction as previously we combine different methods with different parameter_values specifically we evaluated five isoelectric_point prediction_algorithms iterative bjellquivst cofactor svm and branca using where appropriate a set of alternate values for ionizable amino_acid pk a s our benchmarking comparison constitutes a strong blind_test since no method is in any way optimized for this particular data_set and all the proteins and corresponding isoelectric_points were collected from different sources and correspond to distinct analytical settings the present study demonstrates that the algorithms from bjellqvist et_al and perez riverol et_al represent the most accurate algorithms overall for computing protein isoelectric_points the results also demonstrate that when other pk a sets are employed no significant differences were seen for the bjellqvist et_al approach and most of the small differences observed can be related to specific analytical_conditions specific to the experiment the poor_performance of all evaluated algorithms for the single value protein dataset is alarming there are several possible explanations for this behaviour the dataset was evaluated using a variety of methods over many decades thus the intrinsic variation will arise both from true biological_variation the presence of unknown processed or truncated proteins or proteins with charged post_translational etc and other errors introduced by a gallimaufry of different experimental_protocols each with distinct and incommensurable calibration the low correlation between experimental and predicted values throws serious doubt on the veracity of many theoretical_studies of isoelectric_point distributions in whole proteomes such as the studies by and any arguments made on that basis an alternative exegesis posits that pip db must contain a large number of annotation errors as introduced during database construction which seriously contaminates the result this is clearly possible if highly unlikely in ief gels or sds_page experiments it is common to find the same polypeptide instance through multiple experimental fractions due to diffusion phenomena or from uneven cutting during band excision across of the gel in addition the peptides or proteins could have precipitated out of solution during migration from the well to the appropriate ph in the gel possible aggregation and degradation could contribute to enhance inappropriate focalization making_it to correctly interpret the results obtained it has also been shown that not only the amino_acid but also its subsequent modification can influence the accurate estimation of the isoelectric_point e g common modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation which might lead to the shielding of surface_charges as previously described in section pip db illustrates this complex scenario as shown in the table it contains multiple proteins that may be detectable in both acid and basic region showing a wide focalization zone most pi prediction_methods do not take into account such artifacts and will thus fail to make accurate estimates these results also highlight the need for a complete and customizable tool that can provide all available algorithms and pk a sets for isoelectric_point analysis the machine_learning especially the svm based algorithm showed a superior_performance when studying peptide mixtures in general learning based pi prediction_methods such as cofactor svm and branca require a large training_dataset and their resulting performance will strongly depend of the quality of that data even though cofactor and branca algorithms are based on learning approaches it is not possible to retrain these algorithms with different datasets in this sense the svm approach shows more flexibility in pi computation and this feature can improve prediction_accuracy in contrast with iterative methods machine_learning have the advantage of being able to add new features to improve_prediction considering the amount of pk a sets reported to date use of the iterative_approach provides a good opportunity to find some variant that fits well with particular experimental_conditions in the near future new algorithms and bioinformatics_tools should be able to provide a way of choosing different pk a sets and thus obtain more accurate prediction for a given analytical setting the svm and cofactor methods should only be used where a high number of sequences are studied and can thus be used to train the algorithms we observed notable fluctuations in pi predictions for iterative methods on a small dataset showing this method to be sensitive to small changes in the amino_acid pk a values used moreover the algorithm fails when certain pk a values are missing we envisage that more algorithms based on machine_learning including new additional features should be explored allowing the development of fast accurate and reliable pi calculation algorithms for use in future protein and peptide proteomic_analysis defined by the difference between the maximal and minimal pi experimental value found for the protein in pip db
