phylogenetic networks do not need to be complex using fewer reticulations to represent conflicting clusters phylogenetic_trees are widely used to display estimates of how groups of species are evolved each phylogenetic_tree can be seen as a collection of clusters subgroups of the species that evolved from a common_ancestor when phylogenetic_trees are obtained for several datasets e g for different genes then their clusters are often contradicting consequently the set of all clusters of such a dataset cannot be combined into a single phylogenetic_tree phylogenetic networks are a generalization of phylogenetic_trees that can be used to display more complex evolutionary_histories including reticulate events such as hybridizations recombinations and horizontal gene transfers here we present the new cass algorithm that can combine any set of clusters into a phylogenetic network we show that the networks constructed by cass are usually simpler than networks constructed by other available methods moreover we show that cass is guaranteed to produce a network with at most two reticulations per biconnected component whenever such a network exists we have implemented cass and integrated it into the freely_available dendroscope software phylogenetics studies the reconstruction of evolutionary_histories from genetic data of currently living_organisms a rooted phylogenetic_tree is a representation of such an evolutionary_history in which species evolve by mutation and speciation the leaves of the tree represent the species under consideration and the root of the tree represents their most_recent each internal node represents a speciation species splits into several new species thus mathematically speaking such a node has indegree and outdegree at least in recent_years a lot of work has been done on developing methods for computing rooted_phylogenetic d h which form a generalization of phylogenetic_trees next to nodes representing speciation rooted_phylogenetic can also contain reticulations nodes with indegree at least such nodes can be used to represent the recombinations hybridizations or horizontal gene transfers depending on the biological_context in addition phylogenetic networks can also be interpreted in a more abstract sense as a visualization of contradictory phylogenetic_information in a single diagram to whom correspondence should be addressed suppose we wish to investigate the evolution of a set x of taxa e g species or strains each edge of a rooted phylogenetic_tree represents a cluster a proper subset of the taxon set x in more detail an edge u v represents the cluster containing those taxa that are descendants of v each phylogenetic_tree t is uniquely defined by the set of clusters represented by t phylogenetic networks also represent clusters each of their edges represents one hardwired and at least one softwired cluster an edge u v of a phylogenetic network represents a cluster c x in the hardwired sense if c equals the set of taxa that are descendants of v furthermore u v represents c in the softwired sense if c equals the set of all taxa that can be reached from v when for each reticulation r exactly one incoming edge of r is switched on and the other incoming edges of r are switched off an equivalent definition states that a phylogenetic network n represents a cluster c in the softwired sense if there exists a tree t that is displayed by n formally defined below and represents c in this article we will always use represent in the softwired sense it is usually the clusters in a tree that are of more interest and less the actual trees themselves as clusters represent putative monophyletic groups of related species for a complete introduction to clusters see d h submitted for publication in phylogenetic_analysis it is common to compute phylogenetic_trees for more than one dataset for example a phylogenetic_tree can be constructed for each gene separately or several phylogenetic_trees can be constructed using different methods to accurately_reconstruct the evolutionary_history of all considered taxa one would preferably like to use the set c of all clusters represented by at least one of the constructed phylogenetic_trees in general however some of the clusters of the different trees will be incompatible which means that there will be no single phylogenetic_tree representing c therefore several recent_publications have studied the construction of a phylogenetic network representing c describe how a phylogenetic network can be constructed that represents c in the hardwired sense a cluster network a network is a galled network if it contains no path between two reticulations that is contained in a single biconnected component a maximal subgraph that cannot be disconnected by removing a single_node see huson and klpper anddescribe an algorithm for constructing a galled network representing c in the softwired sense related literature_describes the construction of phylogenetic networks from phylogenetic_trees or triplets phylogenetic_trees on three taxa a tree or triplet t is displayed by a network n if there is a subgraph t of n that is a subdivision of t i e t can be obtained from t by replacing edges by directed paths computing the minimum number of reticulation required in ashowed that it is fixed parameter tractable fpt if parameterized by the minimum number of reticulations the downside of these algorithms is that they are very rigid in the sense that one generally needs very complex_networks in order to display the given trees the level of a binary network is the maximum number of reticulations in a biconnected component and thus provides a measure of network complexity given an arbitrary number of trees on the same set of taxa describe a polynomialtime algorithm that constructs a level phylogenetic network that displays all trees and has a minimum number of reticulations if such a network exists which is unlikely in practice given a triplet for each combination of three taxa jansson and coworkers and give a polynomial time algorithm that constructs a level network displaying all triplets if such a network exists the algorithm by van iersel and kelk can be used to find such a network that also minimizes the number of reticulations these results have later been extended to level van and more recently to level k for all k n although this work on triplets is theoretically interesting it has the practical drawback that biologists do not work with triplets but rather with trees or clusters and that it is rather difficult to intuitively convey what it means for a triplet to be in a network an additional drawback is that these triplet algorithms need at least one triplet in the input for each combination of three taxa while some triplets might be difficult to derive correctly if for example one induces triplets from a set of trees then this is likely not to give you a triplet for each combination of three taxa if one or more input trees are not fully resolved or if some input trees do not have exactly the same set of taxa in this article we present the algorithm cass which takes any set c of clusters as input and constructs a phylogenetic network that represents c in the softwired sense furthermore the algorithm aims at minimizing the level of the constructed network and in this sense cass is the first algorithm to combine the flexibility of clusters with the power of level minimization cass constructs a phylogenetic_tree representing c whenever such a tree exists in section we generalize the notion of level to non binary networks named after the cass field station in new_zealand for c a b f g i a b c f g i a b f i b c f i c d e h d e h b c f h i b c d f h i b c i a g b i c i d h and b the network constructed by cass for the same input moreover we prove that cass constructs a level or level network representing c whenever there exists a level or level network representing c respectively experimental_results show that also when no level network representing c exists cass usually constructs a network with a significantly_lower level and lower number of reticulations compared with other algorithms in fact we conjecture that similar arguments as in our proof for level can be used to show that cass always constructs a level k network with minimum k we prove a decomposition theorem for level k networks that supports this conjecture finally we prove that cass runs in polynomial time if the level of the output network is bounded by a constant we have implemented cass and added it to our popular treedrawing program dendroscope where it can be used as an alternative for the cluster network and galled network algorithms experiments show that although cass needs more time than these other algorithms it constructs a simpler network representing the same set of clusters for example shows a set of clusters and the galled network with four reticulations constructed by the algorithm inthis dataset also a level network with two reticulations exists and cass can be used to find this network see dendroscope now combines the powers of cass and the two previously existing algorithms for constructing galled and cluster networks we have introduced the cass algorithm which can be used to combine any set of clusters into a phylogenetic network representing those clusters we have shown that the algorithm performs well on practical data it provides a useful addition to existing software because it usually constructs a simpler network representing the same set of input clusters furthermore we have shown that cass provides a polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether a level phylogenetic network exists that represents a given set of clusters this algorithm is more useful in practice than algorithms for similar problems that take triplets as input because clusters are more biologically_relevant than triplets and because the latter algorithms need at least one triplet for each combination of three taxa as input while cass can be used for any set of input clusters furthermore cass is also not restricted to two input trees as the algorithms inthe six gene_trees of the poaceae grass dataset within s clusters were used that were present in at least three of the six gene_trees for the same input gallednetwork produced a level network with reticulations and the cluster network algorithm produced a level network with reticulations all clusters in the multi labeled tree s and subsequently uses cass to find a phylogenetic network representing these clusters several theoretical problems remain_open first of all does cass always construct a minimum_level network even if this minimum is three or more second what is the complexity of constructing a minimum_level network if the minimum_level k is not fixed but part of the input is this problem fpt when parameterized by k finally it would be interesting to design an algorithm that finds a network representing a set of input clusters that has a minimum reticulation number so_far not even a non trivial exponential time algorithm is known for this problem
