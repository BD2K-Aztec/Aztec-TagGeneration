celltracker not only for dummies motivation time lapse experiments play_a in studying the dynamic_behavior of cells single cell_tracking is one of the fundamental tools for such analyses the vast_majority of the recently_introduced cell tracking_methods are limited to fluorescently_labeled cells an equally_important limitation is that most software cannot be effectively used by biologists without reasonable expertise in image_processing here we present celltracker a user_friendly open_source for tracking cells imaged with various imaging_modalities including fluorescent phase contrast and differential_interference dic techniques availability_and celltracker is written in matlab the mathworks inc usa it works with windows macintosh and unix based systems source_code and graphical_user gui are freely_available at http celltracker website the migration analysis of in vitro cultured cell_populations plays_a in a wide_range of dynamic cell_behavior studies in the last decade dozens of methods have been proposed for such analyses there is no universally best but a great variety of methods exist for different fluorescent microscopic scenarios however very few tracking tools can analyze images taken by phase contrast dic or other label_free microscopy i e techniques using transmitted light or its modulations which are common ways to observe living_cells furthermore the majority of these tools require relevant image_processing skills which strongly limits their practical usefulness within the biologist community for instance bioimagexd timelapseanalyzer and tactics require segmented cells for tracking and cell segmentation on label_free microscopic images is very challenging accordingly so_called point and click manual tracking tools are often used and they are considered as the gold_standard for cell_tracking nevertheless manual tracking is operator dependent laborious and error_prone an automated user_friendly and versatile open_source with track editing possibilities would boost live_cell analysis research in this work we present celltracker a cellcenter detection and tracking tool for different imaging_modalities an early version of celltracker was already used in here we describe its implementation and usage supplementary_material s with the intention of providing a tool also for users with limited image_processing background a qualitative comparison of celltracker with relevant tracking tools is shown in supplementary_material s furthermore we quantitatively_compared six different settings of celltracker details in supplementary_material s by using three different datasets fluorescence dic and phase contrast_images supplementary_material s we only tracked cells that are present in the first frame and excluded those touching image borders ground_truth is provided in supplementary_material summarizes the obtained results supplementary_material s we used three metrics for this comparison supplementary_material s relative root_mean normalized to the cell size rrmse jaccard similarity coefficient jsc and overall processing time automatic tracking was considerably precise average rrmse but it required the most time for post_processing of the detected tracks automatic tracking might be the best choice for applications where the detection of cells is relatively easy semiautomatic tracking was the fastest modality and represents a good trade_off between cell detection and tracking accuracy as expected the most accurate solution was manual tracking the best solution was obtained by manual tracking combined with template_matching rrmse jsc in conclusion celltracker is a versatile_tool able to track cells and other objects supplementary_material s in different scenarios combining accuracy and usability it is an easy to use and efficient solution especially for users with limited expertise in image_processing
