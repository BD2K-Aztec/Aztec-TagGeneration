mapreduce implementation of a hybrid spectral library database_search method for large_scale peptide_identification a mapreduce based implementation called mr mspolygraph for parallelizing peptide_identification from mass_spectrometry data is presented the underlying serial method mspolygraph uses a novel hybrid_approach to match an experimental_spectrum against a combination of a protein_sequence database and a spectral library our mapreduce implementation can run on any hadoop cluster environment experimental_results demonstrate that relative to the serial version mr mspolygraph reduces the time to solution from weeks to hours for processing tens_of of experimental_spectra speedup and other related performance studies are also reported on a core hadoop cluster using spectral datasets from environmental microbial_communities as inputs availability the source_code along with user documentation are available on http compbio eecs identifying the sequence_composition of peptides is of fundamental_importance to systems_biology research high_throughput proteomic_technologies using mass_spectroscopy are capable of generating millions of peptide mass_spectra in a matter of days one of the most effective_ways to annotate these spectra is to compare the experimental_spectra against a database of known protein_sequences the main idea here is to generate candidate peptide_sequences from the genome of the organism under study and then to use models of peptide fragmentation to generate model spectra that can be compared against each experimental_spectrum however as samples become richer in diversity e g from environmental microbial_communities the number of candidate comparisons could increase by orders_of supplementary an increase in the number of candidates also increases the probability of finding high_scoring random matches it is therefore essential to implement a peptide_identification method that is both accurate and scalable to large sizes of spectral collections and sequence_databases the prediction_accuracy of peptide_identification can be improved to whom correspondence should be addressed if experimental_spectra are also compared against spectral_libraries although this would only exacerbate the computational_demands recently developed a novel hybrid statistical_method within the mspolygraph framework which combines the use of highly_accurate spectral_libraries when available along with on the fly generation of model spectra when spectral_libraries are not available this method demonstrated increases of in the number of confidently identified peptides at controlled false_discovery this effort to enrich quality of prediction however comes at an increased computational_cost while a parallel mpi version of the code exists most users do not have access to large_scale parallel clusters whereas open_source science cloud installations and commercial vendors such as amazon provide access to mapreduce clusters on an on demand basis in this article we present a mapreduce implementation of mspolygraph called mr mspolygraph mapreduce is an emerging parallel paradigm for data intensive applications and is becoming a de facto standard in cloud installations one of the popular open_source implementations for mapreduce is the hadoop framework mr mspolygraph uses mapreduce to efficiently distribute the matching of a large spectral collection on a hadoop cluster previously ported peptide_identifications tools that use the database_search approach onto the amazon ec cloud environment our work incorporates the statistics of the hybrid search method in mspolygraph to any cluster running the open_source hadoop environment
