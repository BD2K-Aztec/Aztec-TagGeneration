databases_and ramigo an r bioconductor_package providing an amigo visualize interface the r bioconductor_package ramigo is an r interface to amigo that enables visualization of gene_ontology go trees given a list of go terms ramigo uses the amigo visualize api to import graphviz dot format files into r and export these either as images svg png or into cytoscape for extended network_analyses ramigo provides easy customization of annotation highlighting of specific go terms colouring of terms by p value or export of a simplified summary go tree we illustrate ramigo functionalities in a genome_wide gene_set of prognostic genes in breast_cancer availability_and ramigo is provided in r biocon ductor is open_source under the artistic license and is available with a user_manual containing installation operating instructions and tutorials it requires r version or higher the r bioconductor_package ramigo provides an easy to use r interface to the amigo visualize web_server it provides a simple and elegant way to retrieve graphviz trees that display hundreds of go ids at once and efficiently study clusters or subcomponents of the go tree in graph form ramigo provides functions to convert a go tree into different formats and display it in cytoscape without leaving the r environment ramigo is therefore a perfect companion to gsea and go analyses in r as it helps one better analyse and interpret the long and sometimes complex lists of go identifiers that these analyses produce
