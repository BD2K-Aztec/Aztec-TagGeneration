genome_analysis spatial_regulation dominates gene function in the ganglia chain motivation to understand_the of neurons it is imperative to identify genomic dissimilarities within the heterogeneity of the neural system this is especially true for neuronal disorders in which spatial considerations are of critical nature for this purpose hirudo_medicinalis provides here an ideal system in which we are able to follow gene_expression along the central_nervous to affiliate location with gene behavior results in all million high_quality short_reads were sequenced on the illumina_hiseq platform at the single ganglion level thereafter a de_novo was performed using two state of the art assemblers trinity and trans abyss to reconstruct a comprehensive de_novo transcriptome classification of trinity and trans abyss transcripts produced a non redundant set of and transcripts bp respectively remarkably using trinity of the published medicinal leech messenger_rnas was identified for the innexin family all of the recently reported genes were identified spatial_regulation analysis across three ganglia throughout the entire central_nervous revealed distinct patterns of gene_expression these transcriptome_data were combined with expression distribution to produce a spatio transcripto map along the ganglia chain this study provides a resource for gene_discovery and gene_regulation in future_studies following the complete set of transcripts is elemental for uncovering novel molecular_components and for studying physiological_and next_generation technologies_provide cost_effective means for quantifying the transcriptome recent_technological have revolutionized the field making it possible to analyze the transcriptome of selected sets of cells within an organism leading to the collection of data at a high spatial transcriptomic resolution exploring gene_expression quantitatively in combination with the cellular physical distribution in an intact model may provide the link between genomic_information contextual function and behavior in the brain associating gene_regulation of collections of neurons within their spatial_organization and role is of special importance to the study of health and disease particularly it is important in neurodegenerative_diseases where loss of function is highly_correlated with abnormalities in form to perform such mapping the nervous_system of the medicinal leech hirudo_medicinalis was selected this system a favorable model for investigating development regeneration and repair provides a useful model due to its simple structure and distinct behaviors the central_nervous cns of the leech consists of a chain of ganglia that has been characterized anatomically and physiologically and presents high similarity between ganglia each such ganglion contains neurons most with known function and connections previous gene_expression studies on leech cns have resulted in the characterization of specific genes attempts have been made to clone genes of interest via the candidate_gene approach recently an expression sequence tag database was constructed and is now available to the scientific_community yet functional_genomic in the h medicinalis are in their infancy recent_approaches in rna_sequencing rna_seq analysis accommodate low amounts of total_rna multiple condition comparisons and overcome the de_novo challenge here an rna_seq method is used to study transcription along the leech cns the transcriptome of three ganglia is examined close to the head mid body and close to the tail this choice of three representative ganglia enables querying of gene_expression and linking gene_expression with cns spatial_organization at the single ganglion level the choice of three biologically distinct conditions and not the common two condition differential analysis adds a level of complexity enabling the identification of latent patterns of expression in the current study a transcriptome of the adult leech h medicinalis cns was produced a non redundant set of transcripts has been identified and analyzed in various forms including geneisoform relationships functional_relationships full_length analysis and gene_ontology to verify the full_length analysis and coverage level the innexin family which has been previously studied in the leech was tested h medicinalis and hirudo verbana to whom correspondence should be addressed a differential_expression over the three spatially distinct regions has been used to identify patterns of gene_expression the gene_expression were characterized and classified into nine major patterns demonstrating dominant expression distributions along the ganglia chain in the present study advantage is taken of a simple model the leech cns together with a novel differential_expression approach to combine the transcriptome with the spatial configuration thus producing a spatio transcripto map of the cns resultant data provide a highly useful functional and genomic resource for future systemic studies moreover the strategy for transcriptome_analysis presented here may be helpful in other similar transcriptome_studies along with the rapid advances in sequencing_technologies a set of bioinformatics_tools has recently been developed for shortread sequence_data assembly and analysis de_novo of short_reads without a known reference_genome is considered non standard and non trivial but still attracts enough attention to provide the community with an adequate set of tools whole transcriptome_sequencing provides a functional genomic view of the studied tissue recent_developments in high_throughput have provided a plethora of molecular data but a thorough account of rna expression levels in the h medicinalis is still lacking in this study a de_novo of transcriptome is produced using short_reads from non model annelids the h medicinalis for which public sequence_data are still limited the production of a verified transcriptome is used here as a tool to study the cns of h medicinalis h medicinalis is one of the most important annelids and as such a valuable model for studying nervous_system structure function development regeneration and repair more than million sequence_reads were generated for h medicinalis validation of the different assembly tools significantly_affects the assembly output and is needed for optimal results trinity and trans abyss have been used for the reconstruction of the h medicinalis transcriptome more reported mrnas of h medicinalis have been identified using trinity moreover examination of full_length transcripts reveals that trinity reconstructed fuller transcripts for the innexin family making trinity transcripts the choice for downstream_analyses furthermore we found that the n median and average lengths of the transcripts generated using trinity were longer and with higher similarity to related organisms as shown in supplementary table s a comparison with trans abyss a non redundant set of transcripts is reported the geneisoform relationship of the h medicinalis transcripts shows that the largest fraction of transcripts presents a single isoform about of the transcripts show significant_homology with swiss_prot sequences comparison with other openly available leech datasets the transcriptome of h robusta shows a identity at the amino_acid level supplementary interestingly a comparison with capitella capitata a polychaete shows similar high levels of amino_acid supplementary the unannotated transcripts might indicate novel and possibly species specific functions perhaps most importantly the expression pattern distribution in the leech nervous_system presents a significantly_larger class of transcripts that are co expressed along the leechs spatial configuration other patterns are much smaller and do not co express but rather dominate specific expression_patterns along the nervous_system this may indicate that i most of the transcripts tend to be located in the ganglia butare not ganglion specific for example hsp belongs to the previously described pattern which supports our classification patterns and ii within each group there is a sub group more dominant which may suggest that spatial_regulation dominates gene function in the ganglia chain in conclusion the specific genes and their spatial templates of expression across the cns of a whole organism provide the community for the first time a functional affiliation between genomic and nerve loci
