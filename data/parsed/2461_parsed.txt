inferring parental genomic ancestries using pooled semi_markov processes motivation a basic problem of broad public and scientific interest is to use the dna of an individual to infer the genomic ancestries of the parents in particular we are often interested in the fraction of each parents genome that comes from specific ancestries e g european african native_american etc this has many applications ranging from understanding the inheritance of ancestry related risks and traits to quantifying human assortative_mating patterns results we model the problem of parental genomic ancestry_inference as a pooled semi markov_process we develop a general mathematical framework for pooled semi_markov processes and construct efficient inference algorithms for these models applying our inference algorithm to genotype data from mexican trios and puerto_rican trios where we have the true genomic ancestry of each parent we demonstrate that our method accurately infers parameters of the semi_markov processes and parents genomic ancestries we additionally validated the method on simulations our model of pooled semi markov_process and inference algorithms may be of independent interest in other settings in genomics and machine_learning recent_developments in dna technology bring personal_genomics to reality this opens up unprecedented possibilities for individuals to learn about their genomic history e g ancestry family_history as well as their genomic future e g disease risk a particular aspect of personal_genomics that has garnered significant public and medical interest is the ability to precisely quantify the ancestry composition of ones genome consider a mexican individual as an example her genome_consists of alternating blocks of dna_sequences where each block has african european or native_american ancestry the length and frequency distributions of blocks from different ancestries reflect the patterns of admixtures over the last several centuries a substantial fraction of humans today are offsprings of historical mixing between distinct populations and their genomes are such mosaics of ancestry blocks the ability to quantify genomic ancestries has important biomedical implications for example african_ancestry is a risk_factor for asthma this partially explains the high prevalence of asthma inafrican american as well as puerto_ricans with larger african genomic ancestry in addition genomic ancestry gives insights into many social_science questions and expands the common notions of ethnicity and race given the genome of an individual recent machine_learning can accurately determine the fraction of this persons genome that originates from each ancestry however for many applications in biomedical and social_science research it is important to go beyond the individuals ancestry and to infer the genomic ancestries of the parents since most genetic datasets do not have genotype_information from the parents in studies of ancestry linked risk_factors genomic ancestry information of parents can be used to investigate how risks propagate through generations in social_science applications parental genomic ancestry can be used to understand genetic_basis of human mate selection a subject of substantial recent interest latino parents e g were shown to have significant correlations in their genomic ancestries
