an algorithm for automated layout of process description maps drawn in sbgn motivation evolving technology has increased the focus on genomics the combination of todays advanced_techniques with decades of molecular_biology research has yielded huge_amounts of pathway data a standard named the systems_biology sbgn was recently_introduced to allow scientists to represent biological_pathways in an unambiguous easy to understand and efficient manner although there are a number of automated layout algorithms for various types of biological_networks currently none specialize on process description pd maps as defined by sbgn results we propose a new automated layout algorithm for pd maps drawn in sbgn our algorithm is based on a force directed automated layout algorithm called compound spring embedder cose on top of the existing force scheme additional heuristics employing new types of forces and movement rules are defined to address sbgn specific rules our algorithm is the only automatic layout algorithm that properly addresses all sbgn rules for drawing pd maps including placement of substrates and products of process nodes on opposite sides compact tiling of members of molecular complexes and extensively making use of nested structures compound nodes to properly draw cellular locations and molecular complex structures as demonstrated_experimentally the algorithm results in significant improvements over use of a generic layout algorithm such as cose in addressing sbgn rules on top of commonly_accepted graph drawing criteria availability_and an implementation of our algorithm in java is available within chilay library https popular belief is that diagrams directly address peoples innate cognitive_abilities due to the fact that symbols diagrams and other graphical_representations vary_widely around the world it is necessary to have a common interpretation standard notations play_an in communication and facilitate rapid development in many research_areas to address_this in the field of systems_biology a group of modelers biochemists and software engineers published the systems_biology sbgn which allows scientists to represent biological_pathways and networks in an easy to understand and efficient way it consists of three complementary languages process descriptions pd activity flows and entity relationships the main motivation behind this study was to build a specialized automated layout algorithm for pd maps that comply with the conventions in sbgn pd maps our proposed algorithm adds the necessary heuristics to achieve this on top of a cose algorithm the first enhancement provides proper packing of complex members and disconnected molecules by using two different rectangle packing algorithms tiling and polyomino packing the second one supports port nodes and provides rotation ability for process nodes by introducing a new force type an important point to note here is that those enhancements are added without disturbing the force directed structure of the algorithm there is still room for improvement however especially in handling special cases such as irreversible processes our proposed layout algorithm has been integrated into chilay library which is also available through paxtools
