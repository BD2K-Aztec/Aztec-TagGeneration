structural_bioinformatics a quantitative model for oxygen_uptake and release in a family of hemeproteins motivation hemeproteins have many diverse functions that largely depend on the rate at which they uptake or release small ligands like oxygen these proteins have been extensively_studied using either simulations or experiments albeit only qualitatively and one or two proteins at a time results we present a physicalchemical model which uses data obtained exclusively from computer simulations to describe the uptake and release of oxygen in a family of hemeproteins called truncated hemoglobins trhbs through a rigorous statistical_analysis we demonstrate that our model successfully recaptures all the reported experimental oxygen association and dissociation kinetic rate_constants thus allowing us to establish the key_factors that determine the rates at which these hemeproteins uptake and release oxygen we found that internal tunnels as well as the distal_site water_molecules control ligand uptake whereas oxygen stabilization by distal_site residues controls ligand release because these rates largely determine the functions of these hemeproteins these approaches will also be important tools in characterizing the trhbs members with unknown_functions the combination of computer simulations and biochemical_experiments has become a reliable strategy to describe the underlying molecular_details of observed differences in the activity of proteins with an increasing amount of data on individual proteins the construction of mathematical_models that permit a more generalized understanding of these molecular_details has become a challenge of interest to many groups around the world the truncated hemoglobins trhbs are a family of hemeproteins that share a conserved three_dimensional structure as well as the structural positions of their active_site their diverse functions are related to their ability to uptake and release ligands with a wide_range of entry and exit rates because the ligands bind to the heme_group which is buried in the protein the ligand entry and exit rates depend to a great extent on the ligands ability to migrate to and from the active_site via three potential tunnels in the protein matrix as shown in each protein may present one or two open tunnels lined by particular residues defining its topology protein cavities have been identified several decades_ago through experiments in a xe atmosphere whereprotein sites with retained xe atoms were identified in the case of myoglobin for example several studies had demonstrated the importance of internal cavities as ligand hosts as well as part of migratory tunnels crystallographic studies of trhbs from mycobacterium_tuberculosis chlamydomonas eugametos and paramecium caudatum also highlight the importance of these cavities in the trhb protein_family several studies have shown that in addition to the presence and nature of these migratory tunnels certain active_site can also modulate ligand entry and exit in particular delaying ligand entry by stabilizing water_molecules that block accessibility to the heme or by delaying ligand exit by stabilizing the ligand itself experimentally it is possible to characterize ligand entry and exit by measuring the ligand association k on and dissociation k off kinetic rate_constants respectively specifically k on determines the rate at which the ligand reaches the protein heme_iron from outside the protein and k off determines the rate at which the ligand is released once it is bound to the iron both k on and k off have been reported for a number of members of the trhb family though the trhb family with members has only recently been identified a subset of members and several mutants have been characterized extensively by both biochemical_experiments and computer simulations in this study we utilize data from single_molecule computer simulations of these hemeproteins to build a theoretical_model that is in statistical agreement with all the oxygen k on and k off values reported in the literature namely all variables involved in the model are relevant corresponding coefficients are statistically_significant model_assumptions for quantifications are not violated and the model achieves a high predictive_ability considering the accuracy of this model we are able to confirm the main factors that control both ligand entry and exit for all the members studied and further propose two quantitative_approaches for predicting the oxygen association and dissociation_rate for the rest of the family_members because these rates largely determine the functions of these hemeproteins these approaches will be important tools in characterizing trhb members with unknown_functions based on our model we propose strategies for predicting both the oxygen association and dissociation_rate for the rest of the family_members which allows the development of whole family evolutionary and functional studies as shown in bustamante et_al the predictive capacity of our models together with the statistical_evaluation of the individual components included in each model provides a quantitative context in which we can understand the main factors controlling ligand uptake and release in the trhb family whereas internal tunnels and water_molecules in the active_site modulate ligand entry the nature of the active_site controls the kinetics of oxygen release the coordination process k bond accounts for the o feii binding process once oxygen is already in the active_site with no surrounding water_molecules considering that we use the same ligand in any case and taking_into that this process was shown to occur very fast it was not considered in our model depicted in red in in the same line our statistical_analysis shows that o migration to the solvent after the o feii bond_breaking dg out is not relevant to explain k off in this sense the results along the variability of the active_site show a high correlation where the more stabilized the o the lower the k off measured for example in the case of the wt form of mttrhbn the key structural position at the active_site labeled as b occupied by a tyr is one of the major responsible residues for its k off when this amino_acid is mutated to ala the k off increases substantially because the coordinated oxygen is strongly destabilized the same trend can be observed for many cases of key amino_acids including wt mb versus its mutant_form where the well known hise is mutated to gly going from a k off value of s for a deeper analysis of the conservation and variability of the active_sites along the trhb family_members see bustamante et_al regarding the role of the internal tunnels a clear example can be observed comparing the wt and a single mutant_form of mt trhbn where the mutation of a val to a phe at the structural position g promotes a times decrease in k on it is important to note that these two proteins have the same active_site amino_acids except for the g position that does not alter the water_molecules so the only difference accounting for the k on is the internal tunnel contribution in this case the o needs to overcome a higher barrier along the tunnel to reach the active_site mainly due to the size increase of the g amino_acid which is reflected in a higher dg in and consecutively in a lower k on for a comparison of all herein cases see supplementary tables s and s overall the varying capacity of main factors to modulate ligand entry and escape translates to diverse_biological for these hemeproteins for example hemeproteins with fast oxygen_uptake high k on and fast release high k off are generally oxygen transporters e g hb and mb whereas those with fast uptake high k on and slow_release low k off generally undergo multiple ligand reactivity since oxygen has to enter quickly and stays inside until the second ligand enters to react e g trhbn from m tuberculosis it is interesting to note that both entry and exit processes depend on active_site interactions amino_acids with positive charge_density regions in the active_site can both delay oxygen entry by retaining water_molecules and also delay oxygen exit by stabilizing the coordinated oxygen our models suggest therefore that the only way a protein can control ligand entry without modifying ligand exit is by modifying heme accessibility through tunnels or gates note that our model for k on does not account for internal hexacoordination phenomena which involves an active_site amino_acid occupying the sixth coordination position of the iron center hence our model describes the k on of pentacoordinated trhbs or the k on of the pentacoordinated state of a hexacoordinated trhb notice that the error values i in models and include the error inherent in the model as well as in the experimental_measurements for both k on model and k off models and the error was of the same order of magnitude as the variance among the experimental rate_constants reported independently in the literature by different groups and techniques this result strongly supports the absence of any significant theoretical misconceptions in the construction of the models themselves a special_consideration should be given to the r value which although is a good indicator of the goodness_of of the corresponding model it does not suffice to judge its accuracy a clear examplequantitative model for oxygen_uptake and release
