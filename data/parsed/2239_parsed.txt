htt db horizontally transferred transposable_elements database motivation horizontal_transfer of transposable htt elements among eukaryotes was discovered in the mid s as then new cases have been described new findings about htt are revealing the evolutionary impact of this phenomenon on host genomes in order to provide an up to date interactive and expandable database for such events we developed the htt db database results htt db allows easy access to most of htt cases reported along with rich_information about each case moreover it allows the user to generate tables and graphs based on searches using transposable_elements and or host_species classification and export them in several formats availability_and this database is freely_available on the web at http lpa saogab riel unipampa edu br httdatabase htt db was developed based on java and mysql with all_major tools and software_packages used are free for personal or non profit projects contact transposable_elements tes are mobile genes that replicate inside the host_genome moving from one genomic location to another tes are known as genomic parasites since they do not contribute to host fitness and exploit the hosts molecular_machinery for their replication however an increasing amount of evidence suggests that tes can also act as evolutionary engine of organism adaptations once these elements invade a new species they may be vertically transmitted to the entire progeny through the host gametes however due to their repetitive and mobile nature tes can damage the host_genome through chromosome_rearrangements and new insertions hence being counter selected at the host level in addition tes can be lost from host genomes through stochastic loss or genetic_drift all of these processes contribute to the extinction of tes from host genomes despite that almost all organism analysed to date have a proportion of its genomes composed by one hypothesis suggested to explain such contradiction is that tes are capable of invading new genomes through horizontal_transfer ht then escaping the natural fate of vertical extinction the horizontal_transfer of transposable htt elements between reproductively isolated eukaryotic_species has been intriguing geneticists and evolutionary_biologists since it was first reported in the mid s several new cases have been reported since then highlighting the potential impact of invading tes on host genome_evolution such a large amount of data boosted the due to the ever increasing number of htt events reported and the impact of such events on the host genomes we decided to create the htt database providing an easy way for researchers to browse the data and take knowledge based decision for future_research on this topic
