glass a comprehensive database for experimentally_validated gpcr ligand associations motivation g_protein gpcrs are probably the most attractive drug_target membrane_proteins which constitute nearly half of drug_targets in the contemporary drug_discovery industry while the majority of drug_discovery studies employ existing gpcr and ligand interactions to identify new compounds there remains a shortage of specific databases with precisely annotated gpcr ligand associations results we have developed a new database glass which aims to provide a comprehensive manually_curated resource for experimentally_validated gpcr ligand associations a new text_mining algorithm was proposed to collect gpcr ligand interactions from the biomedical_literature which is then crosschecked with five primary pharmacological datasets to enhance the coverage and accuracy of gpcr ligand association data identifications a special architecture has been designed to allow users for making homologous ligand search with flexible bioactivity parameters the current database contains unique entries of which the vast_majority stems from lig and associations with rhodopsin and secretin like receptors the glass database should find its most useful application in various in silico gpcr screening and functional_annotation studies availability_and the website of glass database is freely_available atg protein coupled receptors gpcr represent one of the largest families of transmembrane_proteins that bind extracellular molecules and activate intracellular_signal which mediate many physiological_functions through their interaction with heterotrimeric_g many human_diseases including cancer and diabetes have been found to be associated with the malfunction of the biological_roles of gpcrs currently of drugs on the market target gpcrs making them one of the most attractive membrane_receptors for drug_development while experiment based assays for novelchemical compounds remain the standard procedure for drug_discovery in silico screening is gaining increasing acceptance as an important complementary method to narrow down the drug searching scope and to guide experimental_design another advantage of the computational_approach is due to its high_speed and low_cost which enables high_throughput and large_scale database screening both the experimental and computational drug_discovery approaches rely on existing gpcr ligand experimental_data to provide insight for screening and selecting new drugs a variety of gpcr orientated databases such as gpcrdb tinygrap gpcr okb gdd and gpcr rd have been developed which generated important impacts on various molecule level studies on the elucidation of gpcr structure and function there are however very few databases that can provide comprehensive resources for gpcr ligand interactions that are essential in assisting gpcr virtual_screening studies van one difficulty in developing such databases is that the gpcrs can be associated with a large number of ligands in various binding_affinities and the gpcr ligand association data in many chemical libraries are often mixed with various false_positives a collection of gpcrligand associations with stringent experimental validations and careful human curation is essential to ensure the quality of the datasets second with the success of the sequencing and structural_genomics the number of available gpcr and ligand interactions increase rapidly but most of the new studies are scattered in a wide_spread of publications and archives which makes_it to keep the databases up to date for example glida was a useful gpcr ligand_binding database designed for chemical genomic drug_discovery but it has ceased updates to its server since october the current glida library contains around gpcr ligand entries whereas the amount of unique gpcr ligand interactions available in the literature in our estimation is above by the combination of the pharmacological database and literature_search the missing of such a substantial amount of new data significantly degrades the usefulness of the databases to the experimental and computational drug_discovery studies in this study we have developed a new gpcr ligand association glass database for use as a general platform in assisting gpcrrelated drug_screening studies drawing from multiple primary data_sources glass focuses on a comprehensive and yet precise collection of the experimentally_validated gpcr ligand interactions with strong affinities to ensure the completeness of the database and to keep it up to date we incorporate a newly_developed text_mining pipeline to search through pubmed literature to discover new gpcr ligand interactions which are then crosschecked with the primary pharmacological datasets to ensure the quality of data_collection all the gpcr ligand association data are manually_curated and made freely_available to the community
