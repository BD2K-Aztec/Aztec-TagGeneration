global copy_number profiling of cancer_genomes in this article we introduce a robust and efficient strategy for deriving global and allele specific copy_number alternations cna from cancer whole exome_sequencing based on log r ratios and b allele_frequencies applying the approach to the analysis of over skin_cancer samples we demonstrate its utility for discovering distinct cna events and for deriving ancillary information such as tumor_purity availability_and https github com xfwang closedna copy_number alternations cna have been extensively_studied in cancer copy_number amplifications and homozygous_deletions from cna play_an in the development of cancer genome_wide cna detection of large number of tumor_samples is a vital step to identify cancer driver events and to gain insights into cancer_progression and prevention next_generation ngs_technologies have quickly become the cna analysis platform of choice due to higher_resolution and sensitivity compared to traditional array based_approaches such as comparative_genomic cgh however ngs specific cna statistical and computational_methods are currently not well established and are mostly based on the total copy_number or losses as represented by the log_ratio of sequence_coverage in a tumor normal pair these relative measurements do not take into account tumor_purity clonality as well as other valuable information accrued by ngs_data in this correspondence we highlight a set of concepts and analytic tools that enables the fast and accurate dissection of wholegenome cna profiles by integrating the totality of information available from ngs_data based on whole_exome wes data of melanoma tumor normal pairs we demonstrate that our approaches allow for a more accurate estimation of copy_number and identification of otherwise undetectable cna patterns well developed array based cna analytical_tools are primarily based on the segmentation and smoothing of log r ratio lrr and b allele_frequency baf which provide orthogonal evidence for copy_number lrr corresponds to the difference in the hybridization signal in a particular genome region between normal and tumor dna and baf measures the relative_contributions of the maternal and paternal alleles to this signal most ngs based v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com tools however rely solely on lrr due to the inherent challenges in assessing baf first the density of observed single_nucleotide snvs is relatively sparse especially in wes also the accuracy of the baf measurement is dependent on the sequence_coverage which can vary between gene regions and sequencing modalities finally the baf is sensitive to sequencing and mapping errors therefore baf information remains underutilized in ngs experiments and baf is often used in an ad_hoc mannerin an attempt to validate the results obtained from lrr in this paper we propose a fast procedure that is based on both lrr and baf and that works seamlessly with existing ngs pipelines we show that the derived multivariate cna profiles allow for an in depth characterization of the somatic structural_variations in cancer samples a set of analysis scripts from vcf file preparation to the derivation of allele specific copy_numbers are provided in the pipeline package close a toolkit for cna loh analysis with sequencing_data and its companion r package close r
