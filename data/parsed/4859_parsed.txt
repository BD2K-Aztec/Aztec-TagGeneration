sequence_analysis viralfusionseq accurately discover viral integration_events and reconstruct fusion_transcripts at single_base insertional_mutagenesis from virus_infection is an important pathogenic risk for the development of cancer despite the advent_of discovery of viral_integration and expressed viral fusion_events are still limited here we present viralfusionseq vfs which combines soft_clipping information read_pair analysis and targeted de_novo to discover and annotate viralhuman fusions vfs was used in an rna_seq experiment simulated dna_seq experiment and re analysis of published dna_seq datasets our experiments demonstrated that vfs is both sensitive and highly_accurate availability vfs is distributed under gpl version at http hkbic viral_infection accounts for of human_cancers well known cancer associated viruses include the human_papillomavirus hpv and the epsteinbarr virus ebv which are present in nearly all cervical_cancers and nasopharyngeal_carcinoma npc respectively hepatitis_b hbv_infection is a strong etiologic_factor for hepatocellular_carcinoma worldwide some viruses like hpv and hbv commonly integrate into the host_genome where they predispose to genome_instability and cancer_risks nevertheless the ability to precisely locate the viral insertional sites has long been hindered by previous low_resolution techniques and thus limiting research into the mutagenic_effects of such integrations viral integration in the host can either be episomal or induce viralhuman fusion_transcript integration of hbv can be detected in as much as of hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc where clonal_expansion of the same integration_site has been reported it is hence not only important to identify the sites of genome integrations but also to discover transcribed viral human sequences which both may possess a functional role in tumorigenesis seqmap an earlier web_based system uses pre defined viral features to locate viral_integration unfortunately their framework is specific to the sequencing_platform and does not address the concerns many have of data privacy besides reliability of the putative fusion breakpoints was not evaluated more importantly as hbv has no preferential sites in the human_genome to be integrated into the framework could not discover novel viralhuman integrations more recently virusseq was proposed for detecting the presence of viral species in sequence_data and finding viral integration_events using discordant read_pair rp information through alignments virusseq was able to identify regions of a chromosome that fused with a virus here we propose a genome_wide viral fusion discovery and annotation_pipeline our method resembles crest and clipcrop both of which use soft_clipping to identify genomic structural_variations what sets our method apart from theirs is our focus on viral integration and the use of viral_genome s as the primary input to our pipeline our unified pipeline viralfusionseq vfs is used for discovering viral integration_events and expressed fusion_transcripts using high_throughput hts the most notable difference between vfs and other tools is that vfs uses both rp and clipped sequence cs information to find viral fusion_events and breakpoints supplementary section s using the latter vfs is able to discern fusion breakpoints accurately to single_base moreover vfs is generalized to major sequencing_platforms and is applicable to both dnaand rna_seq
