sequence_analysis talenoffer genome_wide talen off target prediction transcription_activator talens have become an accepted tool for targeted_mutagenesis but undesired off targets remain an important issue we present talenoffer a novel tool for the genome_wide prediction of talen off targets we show that talenoffer successfully predicts known off targets of engineered talens and yields a competitive runtime scanning complete mamma lian genomes within a few minutes availability talenoffer is available as a command_line program fromthe dna_binding of transcription activator like tal effectors is composed of highly_conserved tandem_repeats where amino_acids and of a repeat repeat variable diresidue rvd determine dna binding_specificity each repeat binds to bp of the dna in a contiguous non overlapping fashion recently we developed talgetter a tool for predicting putative targets of natural tal effectors and we showed that this tool achieves an improved prediction_accuracy compared with previous_approaches the dna_binding of tal effectors can be fused with a fok endonuclease domain to yield tal effector nucleases talens where homo or hetero dimers of talens need to bind to opposite strands of the dna in orientation and in a restricted distance range to specifically cut the dna double strand talens have been established as a second genomeediting technique besides zinc_finger nucleases although the binding of talens is highly_specific undesired off targets in addition to the targeted genomic_region remain an important issue that may cause severe side_effects hence tools for the computational_prediction of talen off targets have been developed namely idtale http idtale kaust edu sa and paired target finder ptf https tale nt cac cornell edu here we only consider ptf because the search for talen target application of idtale is not applicable to custom input_data in this article we present talenoffer an alternative tool for predicting talen off targets talenoffer applies the statistical_model of talgetter to the more complex problem of talen offtarget prediction this requires novel methods for ranking offtargets and accelerated scanning approaches to achieve acceptable runtimes which are explained in the following section within this window whenever we find a hit i e s t we also scan the reverse complement of the downstream sequence for sufficiently good hits given the second monomer y within the user specified distance range the scanning approach of talenoffer is based on this naive approach but uses a speed up strategy which is illustrated infor one talen monomer given the talen monomer we compute a partial score for each possible mer prefix and store it in lookup table together with the information whether a target_site with this prefix may yield a sufficiently_large total_score s i details in supplementary methods for lookup table we proceed in complete analogy using partially_overlapping mer infixes both lookup tables can be accessed efficiently given the prefix and infix of a putative monomer target_site scanning input_sequences for off target_sites we test whether both lookup tables indicate that the putative target_site under the sliding_window might exceed threshold t if this is the case we only need to compute the remaining score for the nucleotides beyond lookupto yield the total_score s if s exceeds the threshold we apply the same strategy for putative target_sites of the second monomer on the opposite strand within the user specified distance range in addition to this speed up strategy talenoffer is multithreaded to allow for simultaneously loading parsing and scanning input_data we present talenoffer a novel tool for the genome_wide prediction of talen targets and off targets which successfully predicts known off targets of engineered talens and yields a competitive runtime talenoffer is implemented using the open_source java_library jstacs and is available as a command_line program and as a galaxy web_application which can also be installed to a local galaxy server conflict of interest jb is part owner of a patent application regarding the use of tal effectors speed up strategy of talenoffer two lookup tables of partial scores are represented by boxes where the light shaded part of lookup table serves as condition for computing the partial likelihood of the dark shaded part the rightmost part of the putative off target_site only needs to be considered if both lookup tables indicate a score above the threshold
