genome_analysis metagenetack ab_initio detection of frameshifts in metagenomic_sequences frameshift fs prediction is important for analysis and biological_interpretation of metagenomic_sequences since a genomic_context of a short metagenomic_sequence is rarely known there is not enough data available to estimate_parameters of species specific statistical_models of protein coding_and the challenge of ab_initio fs detection is therefore two fold i to find a way to infer necessary model_parameters and ii to identify positions of frameshifts if any here we describe a new tool metagenetack which uses a heuristic_method to estimate_parameters of sequence models used in the fs detection algorithm it is shown on multiple test_sets that the metagenetack fs detection performance is comparable or better than the one of earlier developed program fraggenescan availability_and metagenetack is available as a web_server atmetagenomic sequences are obtained from environmental microbial_communities the short_sequences are usually sequenced using next_generation ngs_platforms such as roche and illumina or traditional_sanger each platform produces reads of different lengths and has different error models sequencing_platforms produce reads of nt errors are usually insertions_and indels in homopolymer regions illumina_platform currently generates sequences of length nt with substitutions constituting almost all errors sanger_sequencing produces reads that may contain both types of errors and the read_length is nt before gene calling quality_control methods are used to reduce errors on raw_reads e g trimming the error_prone nt in illumina read ends short_reads are assembled into longer shotgun sequences and contigs in assembled sequences the per nucleotide error_rate can be reduced from in raw_reads to as low as still errors may affect to of genes in assembled sequences even several thousand nucleotides_long metagenomic_sequences do not carry enough sequence_data to accurately estimate_parameters of statistical_models for protein coding_and moreover the performance of conventional tools of gene prediction and annotation are impaired by indels in protein_coding on the other hand tools of comparative_genomics that have certain power in detection of frameshifts interrupting evolutionary conserved_regions rely entirely on comparison with sequences from existing databases these tools would not help to analyse novel genes and genes having low similarity with known genes previously we have developed an algorithm and software_program genetack an ab_initio tool for finding frameshifts in prokaryotic_genomes since genetack requires a species specific statistical_model it cannot work with sequences shorter than several hundred kilobases the long enough sequence is necessary for self training of genemarks the gene finder providing model_parameters and gene predictions to genetack here we introduce an ab_initio frameshift finder metagenetack designed for metagenomic_sequences metagenetack uses a heuristic_method to infer model_parameters suitable for analysis of a short sequence at hand e g nt a recently_developed ab_initio gene finder fraggenescan is also able to detect frameshifts in short_sequences we have assessed the performance of metagenetack in tests on short_sequences from prokaryotic species we have shown that metagenetack performs comparably or better in frameshift detection than fraggenescan using a to denote the number of all fs predictions t to denote the number of predicted true_positives and s to denote the number of simulated frameshifts we calculated sensitivity sn t s and specificity sp t a note that this definition of specificity accepted in bioinformatics literature corresponds to the definition of precision in machine_learning publications accuracy of metagenetack was compared with accuracy of fraggenescan version downloaded from http omics informatics indiana edu fraggenescan fraggenescan requires users to select a sequencing method likely used for generating the input_sequence along with indication of approximate sequencing_error we chose the option sanger_sequencing with as it yielded the best results of fraggenescan among all available options the sn and sp values averaged on the whole set of genomes are shown in to give an example of genome specific values of sn and sp we provide supplementaryfor the set of nt fragments with containing fss results are averaged between sets of fragments with fs made by insertions and fs made by deletions see also in terms of sn sp metagenetack performed better than fraggenescan by the values of fraggenescan sn and sp differed by percentage_points whereas for metagenetack this gap was much smaller the differences were likely due to different methods of derivation of sequence models and differences in the hidden_markov architectures to assess how effective the filters were we evaluated metagenetacks performance produced with various combinations of filters and compared with performance of fraggenescan on fragment sets with insertion fs and sets with deletion fs here we show results for nt long_sequences with fragments containing frameshifts without filters the sn of metagenetack was close to the standard_deviation is and for metagenetack and fraggenescan respectively the new software_program metagenetack addresses the challenging question of predicting frameshifts in protein_coding of metagenomic_sequences without extrinsic knowledge an advantage of ab_initio approach is the ability to detect frameshifts in genes of orphan proteins that do not have known homologs we have shown that the accuracy of metagenetack is comparable or better than the accuracy of the ab inito gene prediction_tool fraggenescan most of the frameshifts predicted by metagenetack are supposed to result from sequencing_errors still like genetack the program is also able to detect frameshifts caused due to indel mutations and ones related to recoding programmed frameshifts involved in gene_regulation metagenetack could be integrated into pipelines of metagenomic sequence_annotation
