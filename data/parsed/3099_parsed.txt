databases_and mpmorfsdb a database of molecular_recognition features in membrane_proteins molecular_recognition features morfs are small intrinsic ally disordered_regions in proteins that undergo a disorder to order transition on binding to their partners morfs are involved in pro teinprotein interactions and may function as the initial step in molecular_recognition the aim of this work was to collect organize and store all membrane_proteins that contain morfs membrane_proteins constitute of fully_sequenced proteomes and are responsible for a wide_variety of cellular_functions morfs were classified according to their secondary_structure after interacting with their partners we identified morfs in transmembrane and peripheral membrane_proteins the position of transmembrane_protein morfs was determined in relation to a proteins topology all information was stored in a publicly_available mysql_database with a_user a jmol applet is integrated for visualization of the structures mpmorfsdb provides valuable information related to disorder based protein_protein in membrane_proteins intrinsically_disordered idps possess no rigid three_dimensional structure under physiological_conditions yet they are functionally_active idps are separated in fully disordered proteins and partially disordered proteins partially disordered proteins contain intrinsically_disordered idrs idrs are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes in all of prokaryotic proteins and more than half of eukaryotic_proteins contain idrs vast abundance and functional_importance characterize these proteins for a deeper_understanding of idps and idrs several databases have been developed disprot mobidb ideal comsin and d p provide information about experimentally_determined or theoretically predicted idps and idrs moreover a variety of predictors have been developed for the prediction of idrs from protein_sequence special cases of idrs are molecular_recognition features morfs or molecular_recognition elements morfs are small regions between and residues in proteins that undergo a disorder to order transition on binding to their partners proteins containing morfs play_an in molecular_recognition when they are bound to their partners morfs can take various shapes according to their secondary_structure they can form alpha_helices morfs beta_strands morfs irregular structures i morfs or a combination of the previous elements complex morfs a number of predictors are available for the prediction of morfs from protein_sequences membrane_proteins constitute of fully_sequenced proteomes and are responsible for a wide_variety of crucial cellular_functions such as binding and signaling membrane_proteins are separated in transmembrane_proteins peripheral membrane_proteins and lipid anchored proteins transmembrane_proteins are divided_into single spanning and multi spanning proteins according to the number of transmembrane_segments an important number of morfs can be found in membrane_proteins and especially in transmembrane_proteins idrs are included in both alpha_helical and beta_barrel transmembrane_proteins and occur mostly on the cytoplasmic side of human_plasma transmembrane_proteins mpmorfsdb is the first publicly_available database that collects and provides information about morfs found in membrane_proteins the database includes membrane_proteins containing morfs membrane_proteins are divided in transmembrane_proteins single spanning and multi spanning and peripheral membrane_proteins morfs were classified in categories according to their secondary_structure when bound to their partners with categorized as morfs as morfs as i morfs and as complex morfs in the main page of mpmorfsdb a user may find links to the following tools browse search blast_search and download through the browse page the user has the ability to browse all the entries moreover there is an option for browsing by membrane_protein type transmembrane or peripheral or by the secondary_structure of morfs morfs morfs i morfs and complex morfs through search the user may submit advanced queries whereas through blast_search we provide an interface for running blast_searches against the database each entry contains information about the respective membrane_protein and related morfs a jmol applet is integrated for visualization of the structures and cross_references to many publicly_available databases are included providing information for protein_domains molecular_interactions and diseases in the case of transmembrane_proteins we determined whether the morfs are positioned in the cytoplasmic or the extracellular_space we observed that the majority of morfs in transmembrane_proteins are found in the cytoplasmic side a database containing morfs in membrane_proteins was constructed data were collected with automated perl scripts and verified manually the whole process can easily be repeated and we intend to update the database every months the proteins in our database are highly_connected nodes in protein_interaction of mpmorfsdbs entries have more than five interactions in molecular interaction_databases and are essential to cell_survival mpmorfsdb provides an up to date dataset which can be used for the design and evaluation of methods predicting morfs in membrane_proteins the database will contribute to the emerging protein non folding problem and provide insights in disorder based interactions in membrane_proteins
