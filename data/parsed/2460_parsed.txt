inferring orthologous gene_regulatory using interspecies data fusion motivation the ability to jointly learn gene_regulatory grns in or leverage grns between related species would allow the vast amount of legacy data obtained in model_organisms to inform the grns of more complex or economically or medically relevant counterparts examples_include transferring information from arabidopsis_thaliana into related crop species for food_security purposes or from mice into humans for medical_applications here we develop two related bayesian approaches to network_inference that allow grns to be jointly inferred in or leveraged between several related species in one framework network information is directly propagated between species in the second hierarchical_approach network information is propagated via an unobserved hypernetwork in both frameworks information about network similarity is captured via graph_kernels with the networks additionally informed by species specific time_series when available using gaussian processes to model the dynamics of gene_expression results results on in silico benchmarks demonstrate that joint inference and leveraging of known networks between species offers better accuracy than standalone inference the direct propagation of network information via the non hierarchical framework is more appropriate when there are relatively few species while the hierarchical_approach is better suited when there are many species both methods are robust to small amounts of mislabelling of orthologues finally the use of saccharomyces_cerevisiae data and networks to inform inference of networks in the budding_yeast schizosaccharomyces_pombe predicts a novel role in cell_cycle for gas spac b c a beta glucanosyltransferase availability_and matlab_code is available from http go warwick ac uk system sbiology software the gene_regulatory grns of related species should share_common topological_features with one another by virtue of a shared_ancestry consequentially the joint inference ji of grns from gene_expression collected from different species should result in better overall accuracy in the inferred networks due to the increased amount of data from which to learn the shared components similarly the leveraging of a grn that has been experimentally_verified in one species into a related species should also improve the accuracy of inferred networks both tasks are related and require the leveraging of data between species either in the form of multiple time series gene_expression as is the case for ji or combinations of times series gene_expression data with experimentally_verified networks during network leveraging nl due to the increasing availability of heterogeneous datasets in a range of species flexible approaches to network_inference that can be adapted to both ji and nl tasks should be particularly useful and would allow vast_amounts of data and information available in model_organisms to be translated into more complex or medically or economically relevant ones although a number of methods that can directly leverage networks from one species to another exist such as network_alignment or graph_kernels these algorithms do not typically utilize other available data such as time series to refine the networks additionally network alignment_methods are of limited utility where little is known about the network in one of the species some existing_approaches that could be adapted to or have been applied to ji nl between species exist provided that the orthologues can be mapped between the species however complete lists of orthologues may not always exist or may be incomplete or incorrect one to one mapping however may not always be possible due to gene or chromosome duplications this effect may be particularly compounded in plant_species where whole ancestral_genomes may be duplicated or where hybridization events can result in multiple ancestral_genomes being combined into a single_organism in cases where no orthologues are known beforehand associations can be assigned within the inference procedure in the study by gholami and fellenberg and other approaches for ji in multiple species inferred networks represent an average network rather than a species specific one biologically the set of genes in one species may not fully correspond to the genes in another due to loss of genes emergence of proto genes or horizontal gene transfers and the network connections themselves may undergo rearrangement due to evolutionary_processes acting on the promoter_regions of the genes or on coding_sequences or else due to context specific effects arising in the different experimental_conditions these differences in network_structure may be just as significant as the underlying similarities and should therefore be inferred alongside the core aspects of the network that is while it is desirable to share_information between species we nonetheless wish to retain species specific elements increasingly it is common to measure time series data from which directed_graphs can be inferred consequentially new methods and approaches are needed that can handle time series data are flexible enough to deal with multiple orthologues and can be readily adapted to both ji and nl when required previous_approaches that can do so include the work by which uses heuristic models for evolution demonstrating the general usefulness of multi species network_inference in silico and in drosophila in this article we develop two related bayesian approaches to network_inference sections and that allow both the ji of grns in related species from time series data and the leveraging of networks from one species to another even when multiple copies of an orthologue exist in particular each node in the respective networks may be assigned a node label according to which orthologues the node has this labelling may come from manually_curated lists of orthologues or can be computed according to sequence_similarity crucially graph_kernels are used to quantify the similarity between labelled graphs allowing a joint prior to be placed over network_topologies that favours but does not strictly enforce similarity between networks the use of graph_kernels in this way opens up a diverse suite of nonparametric tools for characterizing network similarity within the inference procedure without the need to employ heuristic models of evolution as in zhang and moret finally a gaussian_process model is used to capture the dynamics of the time_series conditional on network_structure in the individual species allowing for species specific embellishments to the grns in section we characterize the performance of our methods using three different graph_kernels on a variety of in silico time series datasets and demonstrate that the methods are more accurate than related approaches which do not share_information between the species furthermore we demonstrate that the methods are robust to small amounts of orthologue mislabelling and node duplication in section we use these methods to leverage cell_cycle networks from the budding_yeast into the fission_yeast alongside s pombe time_series and to jointly infer networks in both s pombe and s cerevisiae from time series gene_expression this approach is able to recapitulate known interactions in the s pombe cell_cycle network and identifies a novel role for gas a beta glucanosyltransferase spac b c as a major hub in the s pombe cell_cycle finally in section we outline the advantages of this approach and discuss other possible applications and future_developments in sections and we characterize the performance of the orthologous causal structure identification ocsi algorithm on in silico benchmarks for which there are known gold_standards and compare with the causal structure identification csi algorithm in section we use ocsi to leverage cell_cycle networks from s cerevisiae into s pombe and also perform ji in both species deciphering complex biological_networks and elucidating how those networks influence emergent properties increasingly rely on piecing together many diverse sets of experimental_data the ability to leverage data from several related species is particularly desirable and would allow the vast amount of information obtained in modelorthologous gene_regulatory i organisms to be translated into more medically or economically relevant ones possible applications include the joint learning of grns associated with disease_progression in mice and humans or the direct leveraging of networks associated with seed yield seed_quality stress_tolerance or resistance that have been constructed in the model plant arabidopsis into crops despite the underlying similarities in the grns of closely_related however significant evolutionary differences may still exist that can confound standard_approaches to inferring grns from large_scale transcriptomics_data here we have developed two bayesian approaches to network_inference that allow for such leveraging of interspecies data these models perform better than a related approach on in silico benchmarks and are robust to small amounts of orthologue mislabelling and to gene_duplication we have also successfully used them to leverage information about the s cerevisiae cell_cycle network into s pombe and also performed ji between s cerevisiae and s pombe our analysis of the networks in s pombe showed some agreement with the literature although the true_positive was relatively low perhaps reflecting that the gold_standard networks we used did not necessarily contain many direct_interactions nonetheless our method identified a number of known key cell_cycle interactions and predicted a novel role for gas spac b c in cell_cycle activities the methods outlined here share many of the same principles as earlier works our methods however rely on graph_kernels to capture the similarity between labelled graphs rather than explicit evolutionary_models broadly speaking the labelling procedure requires that nodes to be assigned to groups which can be informed by manually_curated lists of orthologues or on the basis of sequence_similarity because the networks are additionally informed by time series data the method is robust to some mislabelling of nodes although more adaptive procedures can be envisaged in which node labels are assigned or refined within the inference procedure in general there is no explicit requirement to use labelled graph_kernels although doing so represents an effective way of encoding biological expectations that orthologues function similarly between species graph_kernels for unlabelled graphs do exist and could be used within ocsi which would favour similar structures between the networks as a whole without placing any implicit restraints on where a given node belongs with respect to the others that is the joint prior in the method would favour similar network_properties rather than similar biological positioning one possible future line of work could focus on combining labelled and unlabelled graph_kernels for situations in which only smaller sets of orthologues can be identified the diversity of graph_kernels however may be problematic as it is not immediately clear which graph_kernels yield the best results for a given situation here we have used three different graph_kernels with the wl kernel appearing to offer better performance than the graphlet and shortest_path kernels overall it is not currently clear why this might be although one possibility is that the graphlet and shortest_path kernels are not suited to the small or densely_connected networks we used for benchmarking alternatively the choice of b for the shortest_path and graphlet kernels may be inappropriate future approaches might therefore look to address how to tune b automatically within the algorithm as in it has been noted however that at high values of b the mcmc procedure that is a gibbs update of the parental set of each node in turn begins to fail due to the high modality in the parameter_space to develop approaches that can tune b more advanced mcmc algorithms will be needed alternatively another promising approach would be to automatically combine multiple graph_kernels together allowing for increased flexibility in characterizing network similarity albeit at additional computational costs finally as well as the flexibility conferred on the inference process by using graph_kernels our approach allows the possibility of exploiting other properties of graph_kernels because the graph_kernels we have used are positive semi definite this will allow algorithms that not only jointly infer networks over species but also tie those networks to phenotypic observations via a separate gaussian_process model utilizing the graph_kernels as a covariance function
