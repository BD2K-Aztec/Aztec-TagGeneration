effects of small particle numbers on long_term behaviour in discrete biochemical_systems motivation the functioning of many biological_processes depends on the appearance of only a small number of a single molecular_species additionally the observation of molecular crowding leads to the insight that even a high number of copies of species do not guarantee their interaction how single particles contribute to stabilizing biological_systems is not well understood yet hence we aim at determining the influence of single_molecules on the long_term behaviour of biological_systems i e whether they can reach a steady_state results we provide theoretical_considerations and a tool to analyse systems_biology models for the possibility to stabilize because of the described effects the theory is an extension of chemical organization theory which we called discrete chemical organization theory furthermore we scanned the biomodels_database for the occurrence of discrete chemical organizations to exemplify our method we describe an application to the template model of the mitotic spindle_assembly mechanism availability_and systems_biology heavily relies on the precise language of reaction_networks rns to describe many different processes in cells and other living_systems in a formal way molecules and reactions can be expressed in an explicit or implicit way these descriptions of the network only capture the static part of the model additionally the reactor i e a collection of molecules and the dynamics i e how to apply reactions to a reactor have to be specified there are many different ways to model the dynamics of the application of rules in a chemical system to approximate the inherently stochastic evolution of chemical systems typically ordinary_differential odes are in use in this case one assumes that a huge or even infinite amount of particles is present so that it is reasonable to assume continuous amounts or more precisely concentrations furthermore usually a well stirred reactor and time constant reaction_rates as well as a sequential application of rules are presumed depending on the type of system different kinetics like mass action or michaelismenten kinetics can be used when looking at qualitative properties we are often interested in the long_term behaviour i e the final states that the system is able to reach in continuous dynamical_systems given by the odes fixed points and limit cycles represent the final states of the system chemical organization theory cot was developed to better understand the long_term behaviour of chemical system by introducing chemically more relevant aspects and notions based on concepts of organization in biology cot was developed to deal with constructive systems i e systems in which new species appear and stay over a longer period so_far cot was applied successfully in various areas like chemical computing social_systems evolutionary_game hiv dynamics or checking systems_biology models for inconsistencies the theoretical results are based on the continuous dynamics and include the observation that in every fixed_point there is a chemical organization nevertheless their usefulness the benefit to use differential_equations with a rich arsenal of methods to find such solutions is finally limited by the fact that particle numbers are finite hence obviously not all properties of a systems behaviour can be detected already made some efforts to analyse small stochastic networks by analysing effects of small numbers of molecules on the stability of switches and by proposing an algorithm to enumerate the state_space for spaces with small copy_numbers with a limited number of newly produced molecules respectively discovered that for small sizes of reactors the ratio between the amounts of species in steady_state can change and hence called this effect discreteness induced inversion effect the inherent stochasticity of the dynamics in chemical systems gives rise to well established models like the algorithm developed by there the update of the molecules is based on the fact that the occurrence of a reaction depends solely on the abundance of molecules necessary for firing the reaction even though stochastic dynamics are much closer to a realistic system there are additional phenomena that are mostly not to whom correspondence should be addressed

of macromolecules and also pose the question so how do organisms manageand perhaps even capitalize onmolecular noise halling even asks do the laws of chemistry apply to living_cells in other words are the generally used settings for chemistry described above as the assumptions for the ode system correct for a living_cell after the initial observation of molecular crowding in cells recently even the tracking of single_molecule production is possible they discovered that proteins are produced in bursts from single messenger rna_molecules show how low molecule numbers change gene_expression reviews on macromolecular crowding and confinement are presented in on the theoretical side there is the idea of fractal kinetics and how macromolecular crowding implies these fractal kinetics other influences of the geometry by the kinetics are given in b enichou et_al in this article we put an emphasis on two aspects which we call particle effect of discrete systems first a small amount of molecules of one or more species present in the reaction vessel has an effect on the dynamical long_term behaviour of the system second the limitation of number of molecules in the reaction vessel is considered we aim to detect the ability of rns to stabilize because of the impact of small_molecular number or finite reactor size this can be achieved by extending the theory of chemical organizations for the extension we look at the system in a discrete way i e there is no concentration of molecules but rather a discrete amount of them this leads to discrete states and transitions between them given by possible sequences of reactions the dynamics usable with this theory was chosen as general as possible including mass action michaelismenten and maximal parallelism however only the simplest model assuming one transition per reaction will be used in the main text this setup yields a markov_chain model on a transition graph similar to cot the definition of discrete organizations is based on the closure and self maintenance properties these two notions can be adapted to a discrete setup all continuous organizations are found to be discrete chemical organizations as well this makes the extension sound the discrete organizations correspond to particular steady_states which we identified as caused by the described particle effects to distinguish between the so_far developed continuous cot and the discrete one we denote it by discrete chemical organisation theory dot for the introduction of all the necessary notions in cot and markov_chains we refer to supplementary sections and respectively we define discrete organizations in section a characterisation via communication class in supplementary section then establishes properties for small sizes of reactor vessels for rns with special structural_properties stronger results hold see supplementary section finally we use our findings to examine the template model of the mitotic spindle_assembly sac mechanism in section we use a java implementation which is also available online with its help we scanned the biomodels_database for the existence of discrete organizations see section we provided a novel method to predict possible steady_states of biological_models due to the occurrence of particle effects the theoretical_foundation is an extension of cot to discrete systems more precisely we gave the definition of discrete chemical organizations for transition graphs this turns out to be a generalization of the concept of chemical organizations which was originally aimed at continuous models we called the discrete organizations not found in cot purely discrete they represent potential steady_states due to particle effects i e effects of small_molecular numbers and or finite reactor size the former effect accounts for the biological_phenomena of small numbers of copies of a molecule molecular crowding and the spatial distribution of molecules in a cell the latter effect might seem less natural than the former because we consider reactors with an upper_bound on the number of molecules they contain however we want to mention two classes of example situations in which this is a reasonable assumption first if we consider reactions that model an inflow e g through channels in a membrane we can have the situation that inflow is blocked because of the already full inside of the reactor second if we model the spatial setting in a reactor we know that single_molecules occupy more space than a complex of molecules before the boxes refer to the states where for example in the top middle means there is one element of species a one of c and two of species b the state has the unique number and is part of the communication class with number the labels at the transitions are the transition_probabilities there are the pdorgs fa b cg with a generator fcg with a generator and fa bg with a generator the light blue coloured states show the generators of the pdorgs the grey states show the generators for the rest of organizations namely fag fbg and f g we refer to the supplementary_material section for how they can be calculated i
