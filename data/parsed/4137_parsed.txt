scalable clustering_algorithms for continuous environmental flow_cytometry motivation recent technological innovations in flow_cytometry now allow oceanographers to collect high_frequency flow_cytometry data from particles in aquatic_environments on a scale far surpassing conventional flow_cytometers the seaflow cytometer continuously profiles microbial phytoplankton populations across thousands of kilometers of the surface ocean the data streams produced by instruments such as seaflow challenge the traditional sample by sample approach in cytometric analysis and highlight the need for scalable clustering_algorithms to extract population information from these large_scale high_frequency flow_cytometers results we explore how available algorithms commonly used for medical_applications perform at classification of such a large_scale environmental flow_cytometry data we apply large_scale gaussian_mixture to massive datasets using hadoop this approach outperforms current state of the art cytometry classification algorithms in accuracy and can be coupled with manual or automatic partitioning of data into homogeneous sections for further classification gains we propose the gaussian_mixture with partitioning approach for classification of large_scale high_frequency flow_cytometry data availability_and source_code available for download at https github com jhyr kas seaflow cluster implemented_in for use with hadoop we present an exploration of scalable machine_learning solutions to a problem motivated by an emerging class of high_frequency continuous operation flow_cytometers existing analysis tools assume individual samples are processed independently these tools assume a small number of discrete independent samples and are therefore not appropriate for newer devices we therefore adapt and extend existing_methods to propose the first scalable accurate classification solution for large_scale continuous environmental flow_cytometry while this method has its roots in biological oceanography we show that the solutions identified for analyzing these datasets are applicable in other domains as well
