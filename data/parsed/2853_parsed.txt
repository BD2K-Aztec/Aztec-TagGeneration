megahit an ultra_fast single_node solution for large and complex metagenomics assembly via succinct de_bruijn megahit is a ngs de_novo assembler for assembling large and complex metagenomics_data in a time and cost efficient manner it finished assembling a soil metagenomics dataset with gbps in and h on a single computing node with and without a graphics_processing respectively megahit assembles the data as a whole i e no pre_processing like partitioning and normalization was needed when compared with previous methods on assembling the soil data megahit generated a three time larger assembly with longer contig n and average contig length furthermore of the reads were aligned to the assembly giving a fourfold improvement availability_and the source_code of megahit is freely_available at https github com voutcn megahit under gplv next_generation have offered new opportunities to study metagenomics and understand various microbial_communities such as human guts rumen and soil due to the lack of reference_genomes de_novo of metagenomics_data short_reads is a beneficial and almost inevitable step for metagenomics analysis this step is however constrained by the heavy requirement of computational_resources especially for large and complex datasets encountered in environmental metagenomics the soil metagenomics dataset recently_published by howe et_al comprises gbp even after trimming low quality bases the dataset was successfully assembled with preprocessing_steps including partitioning and digital normalization at present no de_novo assembler can assemble the data as a whole using a feasible amount of computer memory estimated memory requirement for soapdenovo and idba ud to assemble the soil data is at least tb as the volume of metagenomics_data keeps growing we are motivated to develop megahit an assembler that can assemble large and complex metagenomics_data in a time and cost efficient manner especially on a single_node server current maximum memory capacity gb for a socket server
