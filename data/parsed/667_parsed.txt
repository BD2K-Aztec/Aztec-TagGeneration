bayesian assignment of gene_ontology to gene_expression experiments motivation gene_expression assays allow for genome_scale analyses of molecular biological_mechanisms state of the art data analysis provides lists of involved genes either by calculating significance_levels of mrna_abundance or by bayesian assessments of gene activity a common problem of such approaches is the difficulty of interpreting the biological implication of the resulting gene_lists this lead to an increased interest in methods for inferring high_level biological_information a common approach for representing high_level information is by inferring gene_ontology go terms which may be attributed to the expression data experiment results this article proposes a probabilistic_model for go term inference modelling assumes that gene_annotations to go terms are available and gene involvement in an experiment is represented by a posterior_probabilities over gene specific indicator variables such probability measures result from many bayesian approaches for expression data analysis the proposed model combines these indicator probabilities in a probabilistic fashion and provides a probabilistic go term assignment as a result experiments on synthetic and microarray_data suggest that advantages of the proposed probabilistic go term inference over statistical_test based_approaches are in particular evident for sparsely annotated go terms and in situations of large uncertainty about gene activity provided that appropriate annotations exist the proposed approach is easily applied to inferring other high_level assignments like pathways availability source_code under gpl license is available from thethe well known gene_ontology go is at the center of different research_questions in systems_biology and bioinformatics even for well studied model_organisms such as saccharomyces_cerevisiae annotations of genes to ontology_terms is far from complete to improve this situation proposed a blast_based sequence_similarity analysis and machine_learning for a denovo annotation of genes to go terms novel scientific_discoveries require a constant updating of the standardized gene_ontology maintaining a well curated specification is a tedious and time consuming manual task for improving the reaction time propose inferring bayesian_networks by literature mining to generate domain specific ontologies automatically with the purpose of benchmarking gene_associations inferred with bayesian_networks to whom correspondence should be addressed propose using known go term annotations for assessing the significance of inferred associations research is also concerned with mapping biological_assays like expression experiments to global biological_function such approaches use known gene to go annotations and represent biological_function by assigning standardized go terms to experimental_data recent surveys show that a majority of these methods use statistical_test based_inference strategies are often modular and will first rank genes using state of the art expression data analysis which includes statistical_test based and bayesian_methods more recently the quantification of transcript_abundance from next_generation data attracted a lot of attention approaches like fatigo and ontoexpress rely on rank lists obtained from first level analysis separate the genes which are annotated to go terms into groups and use fishers_exact the hyper geometric distribution or similar approaches for calculating pvalues of go term enrichment all go terms with p values below a suitably chosen threshold are then assigned to the experiment with the inherent multiple_testing being tackled with stateof the art approaches separation into lists of active and inactive genes depends greatly on the chosen threshold as is illustrated in in particular conservative thresholds are likely to underestimate over representation of go terms by functionally_active genes a solution to this problem was suggested as fatiscan which repeatedly applies fatigo with different thresholds adjusts p values correspondingly and thus reduces the effect of choosing a particular threshold with baygo proposed a bayesian tool for inferring active go terms baygo is based on gene counts allows however for unobserved genes which may result from missing probes or poor_quality measurements the approach regards the true number of active and inactive genes as random_variables and infers active go terms by calculating significance_levels of lack of association via monte_carlo if all annotated_genes are observed the method will provide the same result as statistical_tests based on the hyper geometric distribution more recently proposed another bayesian_approach for counts based go term enrichment which considers the go dag structure to ease identification of groups of closely_related go terms a recent investigation in finds methodological biases in the assigned go terms which depend on the statistical_approach used for assessing significance their observation is likely caused by variations in the power of the tests which in generalthis article proposes a bayesian_approach for assigning go terms to expression experiments which can be used as a post_processing step to bayesian expression data analysis probabilities of go term activity are obtained by combining results from probabilistic expression analysis in a bayes consistent_manner calculations are isolated from pre_and processing and based on a tab_delimited representation of go term annotations and indicator probabilities which assess gene activity inference uses the variational bayesian_framework which warrants that computations can feasibly be carried_out on personal_computers the results of the proposed approach are compared against a counts based enrichment_analysis which uses fishers_exact synthetically generated data reveals that the proposed bayesian go term assignment provides more accurate results for sparsely populated go terms and in situations where expression data analysis has large uncertainty about gene activity in scenarios where a sufficiently large_number is annotated to go terms and where expression data allow assessing genes activity with high_probability the bayesian_approach and counts based enrichment_analysis provide similar results without however leading to situations which would disfavor the proposed bayesian_approach our assessment that go term activity can be more reliably inferred by quantitatively combining probabilities of gene activity is also supported by analysing probabilities of shared gene function in mammary_gland development and endothelial_cell compared with the go term ranking obtained in ref with fishers_exact we observe with the proposed approach a stronger enrichment of cell_death related go terms at the top of the go term rank list shared apoptosis events in these assays are expected from reports that endothelial_cell may play_an in mammary_gland development a second expression data_set by which investigates heat_shock stress in s cerevisiae lead to a much more clear_cut distinction between active and inactive genes in this situation we find a strong_agreement between the proposed bayesian go term assignment and the counts based enrichment_analysis and thus equal performance the experiments allow hence the conclusion that a bayesian go term assignment has the potential of outperforming countsbased enrichment_analysis in situations where go terms are sparsely annotated and gene activity is difficult to assess in situations with sufficiently many genes_annotated to go terms or with low uncertainty about gene activity both counts based enrichment and the proposed bayesian assignment will provide similar accuracies although the application of the proposed bayesian ontology assignment used gene_ontology and microarray_experiments as examples the method is easily generalized to other ontology annotations and expression experiments by adapting the preprocessing filters and exchanging expression data analysis the main limiting_factor of bayesian go term assignment is the requirement of bayesian indicator probabilities assessing gene activity for statistical_test based array analysis a comparable quantitative combination of p values using statistical meta_analysis can be obtained by applying the approach in ref
