prediction of therapeutic microrna based on the human metabolic_network motivation microrna mirna_expression has been found to be deregulated in human cancer contributing in part to the interest of the research_community in using mirnas as alternative therapeutic_targets although mirnas could be potential targets identifying which mirnas to target for a particular type of cancer has been difficult due to the limited knowledge on their regulatory_roles in cancer we address this challenge by integrating mirna_target metabolic modeling and context specific gene_expression data to predict therapeutic mirnas that could reduce the growth of cancer results we developed a novel approach to simulate a condition specific metabolic system for human hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc wherein overexpression of each mirna was simulated to predict their ability to reduce cancer cell_growth our approach achieved_accuracy in predicting the mirnas that could suppress metas tasis and progression of liver_cancer based on various experimental_evidences in the literature this condition specific metabolic system provides a framework to explore the mechanisms by which mirnas modulate metabolic_functions to affect cancer growth to the best of our knowledge this is the first computational_approach implemented to predict therapeutic mirnas for human cancer based on their functional role in cancer metabolism analyzing the metabolic_functions altered by the mirna identified metabolic genes essential for cell_growth and proliferation that are targeted by the mirnas availability_and see supplementary protocols andmicrorna mirna_expression has been found to be deregulated in human cancer some of the first mirnas identified to be involved in cancer were mir and mir which were found downregulated in most lymphocytic_leukemia patients others include oncogenic mir which promotes c_myc induced tumorigenesis in mice and a tumor_suppressor mirna let which inhibits expression of the oncogene ras in lung_cancer cell_lines further a global decrease in mirna_levels was observed in human_cancers knockout of the mirna processing enzymes drosha and dicer enhances cancer cell_growth in vitro and their invasiveness in mice confirming that widespread reduction in mirna_expression could promote tumorigenesis therefore mirnas could have intrinsic functions in tumor_suppression and be potential_therapeutic synthetic mirnas can be introduced into mammalian_systems as was shown in a pioneering study on therapeutic mirna delivery of mir s in a hcc mice model that successfully inhibited tumor_cell and induced cancer specific apoptosis although mirnas could be potential alternative targets for cancer treatment it has been difficult to identify which mirnas to target for a particular type of cancer as the underlying_mechanisms of how mirnas are involved in cancer are largely_unknown experimental_evidences of how mirnas regulate their targets in cancer_cells have been limited the expression of individual targets such as ras and e f o has been shown to be regulated by mirnas and thereby used to explain the association of mirnas with cancer however each mirna could regulate many target_genes and the same mirna could have oncogenic or anti tumorgenic activity depending on the context or cell_type in which the targets are expressed current computational studies focus primarily on analyzing mirna_expression to identify_mirnas that are differentially_expressed or signatures that can separate a particular cancer type from normal samples more advanced data_mining approaches integrate mirna gene_expression data and putative mirnagene interactions to identify regulatory_modules in which the mirna_expression is found to be negatively_correlated with putative targets in the cancer samples nevertheless it remains_unclear whether the altered mirna expressions are the cause or consequence of the carcinogenesis processes and which mirnas could be good targets for treatment furthermore as an mirna could simultaneously target many genes it has been difficult with current approaches to systematically predict the effect on perturbation of an mirna in this study we propose an alternative approach to tackle this problem and integrate putative mirnatarget gene interactions metabolic modeling and context specific gene_expression data our analysis focuses on the human metabolic system as abnormal metabolic_functions are known to be involved in supporting tumor_growth and proliferation to whom correspondence should be addressed for example most cancer_cells have higher glycolytic rates which is called warburg_effect a recent study on breast_cancer further uncovered alterations in glucose_metabolism mediated by the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase enzyme whose expression was found to be associated with poor_prognosis because metabolism plays_an in cell_growth and proliferation genes_regulating metabolism have been used as drug_targets in the treatment of cancer we hypothesize that mirnas could be implicated in the metabolic_regulation of cancer and study the targets of mirnas in the context of the human metabolic_network for which detailed mechanistic_information is available for systems modeling our approach takes_advantage of current knowledge of the human metabolic_network to reconstruct a context specific metabolic system for human liver_cancer hcc the model is used to predict mirnas whose overexpression or delivery could inhibit cancer cell_growth by downregulating its target metabolic genes by explicitly modeling the cancer phenotype as a specific metabolic_state we are able to predict not only the mirnas involved or altered in cancer but also the potential mirna_targets that could change the cancer metabolic_phenotype if perturbed these targets could be candidates in the treatment of the disease this is in contrast to previous_studies of mirna in cancer where the cancer phenotype is used as a label annotation of samples against another label of normal our approach provides a computational platform to integrate knowledge from different sources to study in silico the global effect of mirna perturbations on the metabolic_network and to generate hypotheses that could provide insights into the mechanisms_underlying the regulation of mirnas on cancer metabolism in this study we reconstruct a human context dependent metabolic_network to associate gene_expression changes with constraints on the reactions based on a reference metabolic_network e g the generic human metabolic_network and the context information obtained from gene_expression data of a particular phenotype of interest our approach estimates the activity change of each reaction and adjusts the upper_bounds i e the maximum capacity of the reaction to provide a new metabolic_network model that is specific to the condition the process is shown in and the algorithm is described in section information on the human liver specific gene_expression is obtained from a curated dataset in the literature our approach is applied to reconstruct a liver cancerspecific metabolic model from the human generic metabolic_network by setting the maximum capacity of the reactions based on context information obtained from gene_expression data of cancer samples the liver specific metabolic_network is used to predict the growth and proliferation rate of cancer_cells with fba section because cancer_cells modulate metabolic_functions to help support their rapid_growth and proliferation biomass_production was used as the objective_function to reflect the growth and proliferation rate of the cancer_cells the rate of biomass_production is based on experimentally_measured compositions of dna rna amino_acids and lipids in cancer_cells and reflects the maximum rate of cell_growth and proliferation that can be achieved to estimate the robustness of the network_reconstruction against potential noise from gene_expression data we applied fva on the reconstructed liver model fva performs a sensitivity analysis of the fluxes with respect to changes in reaction bounds that are determined by the gene_expression data the results of fva show that a reduction of the upper_bound in all the reactions that carry fluxes would only reduce the output of the model by no more than i e retain of the biomass_production on average the bounds need to be changed for any reaction that carry fluxes to be able to change biomass_production by nevertheless in our reconstruction for a reaction to have a reduction in the bounds requires all the genes in a particular enzyme complex that catalyze the reaction to have fold downregulation in expression therefore the fva results suggest a robust system that is insensitive to potential noise in the microarray_data
