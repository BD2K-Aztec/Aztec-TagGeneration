databases_and intermine a flexible data_warehouse system for the integration and analysis of heterogeneous_biological data intermine is an open_source data_warehouse system that facilitates the building of databases with complex data_integration requirements and a need for a fast customizable query facility using intermine large biological_databases can be created from a range of heterogeneous_data and the extensible data model allows for easy integration of new data types the analysis tools include a flexible query builder genomic_region search and a library of widgets performing various statistical_analyses the results can be exported in many commonly used formats intermine is a fully extensible framework where developers can add new tools and functionality additionally there is a comprehensive set of web_services for which client libraries are provided in five commonly used programming_languages integrative_analysis exploiting diverse datasets is a powerful approach in modern biology but it can also be complex and time consuming there are huge quantities of data available in a range of different formats and a high_level of computational expertise is often required for performing analysis even once the data have been successfully integrated into a single database for a general review of biological data_integration see triplet and intermine is a data_warehouse framework initially_developed for flymine to address_these for the drosophila community it is being adopted by a number of major model_organism databases including budding_yeast rat zebrafish mouse and nematode worm and is in use by the modencode projecta large_scale international initiative to characterize functional_elements in the fly and worm genomes as well as for drug_target drosophila transcription_factors and mitochondrial proteomics many features of the intermine system have been designed to lower the effort required for the setup and maintenance of large_scale biological_databases and these are outlined later in the text and discussed in more detail in the supplementary_material
