xqtl workbench a scalable web environment for multi level qtl_analysis xqtl workbench is a scalable web platform for the mapping of quantitative_trait qtls at multiple levels for example gene_expression eqtl protein_abundance pqtl metabolite abundance mqtl and phenotype phqtl data popular qtl_mapping methods for model_organism and human populations are accessible via the web user_interface modern high_throughput generate large_amounts of genomic transcriptomic proteomic and metabolomic_data however existing open_source web_based tools for qtl_analysis such as webqtl and qtlnetwork are not easily extendable to different settings and computationally scalable for whole_genome analyses xqtl workbench makes it easy to analyse large and complex datasets using state of the art qtl_mapping tools and to apply these methods to millions of phenotypes using parallelized big_data solutions xqtl workbench also supports storing of raw intermediate and final_result data and analysis protocols and history for reproducibility and data provenance use of molgenis helps to customize the software all is conveniently accessible via standard internet browsers on windows linux or mac and using java r for the server to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their option the first two authors should be regarded_as xqtl workbench provides a total solution for web_based analysis major qtl_mapping routines are integrated for use by experienced and inexperienced users researchers can upload raw_data run analyses explore mapped qtl and underlying information and link out to important databases new algorithms can be flexibly added immediately available to all users large analyses can be easily executed on a cluster or in the cloud future work include visualizations and search options to explore the results we also had an eu sysgenet workshop that envisioned further integration of xqtl with analysis tools like happy databases like genenetwork and the workflow manager tiqs
