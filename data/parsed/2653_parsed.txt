knowledge driven geospatial location resolution for phylogeographic models of virus migration diseases caused by zoonotic viruses viruses transmittable between humans and animals are a major threat to public_health throughout the world by studying virus migration and mutation_patterns the field of phylogeography provides a valuable_tool for improving their surveillance a key_component in phylogeographic analysis of zoonotic viruses involves identifying the specific locations of relevant viral_sequences this is usually accomplished by querying public_databases such as genbank and examining the geospatial metadata in the record when sufficient detail is not available a logical next step is for the researcher to conduct a manual survey of the corresponding published_articles motivation in this article we present a system for detection and disambiguation of locations topo nym resolution in full_text to automate the retrieval of sufficient metadata our system has been tested on a manually_annotated corpus of journal_articles related to phylogeography using integrated heuristics for location disambiguation including a distance heuristic a population heuristic and a novel heuristic utilizing knowledge obtained from genbank metadata i e a metadata heuristic results for detecting and disambiguating locations our system performed best using the meta_data heuristic precision recall and f score precision reaches when examining only the disambiguation of location names our error analysis showed that a noticeable increase in the accuracy of toponym resolution is possible by improving the geospatial location detection by improving these fundamental automated tasks our system can be a useful resource to phylogeog raphers that rely on geospatial metadata of genbank sequences zoonotic viruses are viruses that are transmittable between animals and humans leading to the rise or the re emergence of various diseases such as influenza rabies and ebola these viruses are an important threat to population health and are monitored by local national and international health_organizations to ensure_effective surveillance of these viruses it is essential to understand their origins mutations and their geospatial transmission_patterns in recent_years phylogeography the science that studies the geospatial lineage of species has been applied to virus_genomes to model their evolution and their diffusion among human and animal hosts phylogeography tracks the spread of these viruses by utilizing genetic sequence_data and its corresponding metadata related to the time of sample_collection and the location of the host in particular the geospatial metadata is vital to phylogeography since it is used to recreate the migration path of the virus phylogeography often includes the use of secondary data that has been deposited in public_databases by other researchers a popular resource is the genbank database which is maintained by the national_center ncbi with more than million virus sequences as of genbank provides abundant information on viral sequence_data however previous work has suggested that geospatial metadata when it is not simply missing can be imprecise in their article
