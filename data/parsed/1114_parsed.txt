systems_biology computational modelling of ly and trail_induced suggests dynamic_regulation of cflip motivation trail has been widely_studied for the ability to kill_cancer selectively but its clinical usefulness has been hindered by the development of resistance multiple compounds have been identified that sensitize cancer_cells to trail_induced the drug ly ly combined with trail caused synergistic greater than additive killing of multiple cancer_cell we used mathematical_modelling and ordinary_differential to represent how ly and trail individually affect hela_cells and to predict how the combined treatment achieves synergy results model based_predictions were compared with in vitro experiments the combination treatment model was successful at mimicking the synergistic levels of cell_death caused by ly and trail combined however there were significant failures of the model to mimic upstream activation at early time points particularly the slope of caspase_activation this flaw in the model led us to perform additional measurements of early caspase_activation surprisingly caspase exhibited a transient decrease in activity after ly treatment prior to strong activation cflip an inhibitor of caspase_activation was up regulated briefly after min of ly treatment followed by a significant down_regulation over prolonged exposure a further model suggested that ly induced fluctuation of cflip might result from tilting the ratio of two key species of reactive_oxygen ros superoxide and hydrogen_peroxide computational modelling extracted novel biological_implications from measured dynamics identified time intervals with unexplained effects and clarified the non monotonic effects of the drug ly on cflip during cancer cell_apoptosis combinations of drugs can have non obvious effects on a biological system and the magnitude of their final effect can be synergistic additive or antagonistic meaning larger the same as or smaller than the sum of the individual treatments for treating cancers some of the current_standards of care are combination_therapies but the development of synergistic combinations has been an expensive and laborious process of empirical testing computational modelling of pathway dynamics has the potential to predict the effects of combination_treatments and could be useful in the design of multi drug_therapies single perturbations of a system e g inhibiting an enzyme are commonly_studied using traditional experimental methods but combinations of perturbations too numerous to study experimentally can be examined using computational_tools based on existing_models that describe the effects of single drugs we used modelling to study the combination of trail and ly towards understanding their synergy and also aiding in the discovery of an unknown effect of ly the polypeptide ligand trail tnf related apoptosisinducing ligand or apo l induces death_receptor mediated_apoptosis programmed_cell according to a well studied pathway trail is currently undergoing phase i ii clinical_evaluation for a variety of cancers and it holds real promise as a therapeutic_strategy owing to its selective targeting of cancer_cells while sparing normal_tissues however development of resistance is a serious obstacle to the effective clinical use of trail and combination_therapies to overcome resistance to trail or to induce re sensitization to trail could be extremely_important for enabling trail based therapies to succeed the small_molecule compound ly ly has been shown to sensitize multiple cancer_cell to trail_induced and vincristineinduced apoptosis ly is an inactive analogue of the phosphoinositide_kinase pi k inhibitor to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as ly and is related to the non specific kinase_inhibitor quercetin ly produces high levels of ros reactive_oxygen which may be particularly harmful to cancer_cells that have high metabolic_rates and oxidative_stress our recent_studies found a synergistic anti cancer effect by combining ly and trail treating cells with low doses of trail plus with low doses of ly caused robust activation of the apoptotic_pathway while treatment with either agent alone caused minimal death we undertook the task of modelling the effects of ly in the network of trail_induced with the aim of evaluating whether the molecular effects known to be caused by ly were sufficient to explain the synergy of the ly trail combination we were successful in using modelling to recapitulate the synergistic levels of cell_death that were observed however the simulated activation_kinetics of pro_apoptotic caspase enzymes along the pathway showed poor correlation with experimental_data in particular there were large mismatches between simulation and experiment at early time points particularly for upstream regions of the pathway this suggested further experiments focusing on caspase_activation shortly after treatment new data revealed an even larger and more obvious mismatch between simulation and experimental_data specifically ly treatment had a brief inhibitory_effect on caspase min after treatment finally we modelled two sources of ros that might explain the effects of ly on caspase_activation and that might be relevant for other anti_cancer
