structural_bioinformatics rna_structure framework automated transcriptome_wide reconstruction of rna_secondary from high_throughput structure probing_data the rapidly increasing number of discovered non_coding makes the understanding of their structure a key feature toward a deeper comprehension of gene_expression regulation various enzymatic and chemically based_approaches have been recently_developed to allow whole_genome studies of rna_secondary several methods have been recently presented that allow high_throughput rna_structure probing cirs seq structure seq shape seq pars etc and unbiased structural inference of residues within rnas in their native_conformation we here present an analysis toolkit named rna_structure framework rsf which allows fast and fully_automated analysis of high_throughput structure probing_data from data pre_processing to whole transcriptome rna_structure inference availability_and rsf is written in perl and is freely_available under the gplv_license from http rsf the advent_of methods has rapidly led to the annotation of thousands of novel transcripts mostly lacking coding capabilities as for large ribonucleoprotein_complexes these rnas are thought to regulate_gene through interactions mediated by their structure in the last years a variety of methods have been developed to interrogate rna_secondary on a genome_wide scale but no tool has been developed to enable efficient analysis of the large amount of data generated by these methods with the exception of the seqfold package which has been developed to analyze pars data because the analysis of these data and the subsequent inference of rna_structures constitute a bottle neck of these protocols we here provide the rna_structure framework rsf an open_source framework to analyze highthroughput structure probing_data spd and to minimize the efforts to get from raw sequencing_reads to secondary_structures the advent of high througput rna_structure probing methods has provided a large amount of transcriptome_wide scale structural data although robust tools for the rapid elaboration of this information are currently missing rsf is a user_friendly toolkit that enables automated inference of rna_secondary on a transcriptome_wide scale in a few steps it can use data derived from many different structure probing methods both chemical cirs seq shape seq structure seq and enzymatic pars due to the rapid evolution of the field and to the absence of a golden_standard in the analysis of high_throughput spd the implementation of several different scoring normalization and structure_prediction enables a high degree of analysis flexibility to the user the use of high_throughput structure probing methodologies coupled to rsf provides an important toolkit for the genome_wide analysis of rna_structures conflict of interest none declared
