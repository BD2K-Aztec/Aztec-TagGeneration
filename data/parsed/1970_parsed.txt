gene network_inference by fusing data from diverse distributions motivation markov networks are undirected graphical_models that are widely used to infer relations between genes from experimental_data their state of the art inference procedures assume the data arise from a gaussian_distribution high_throughput omics_data such as that from next_generation often violates this assumption furthermore when collected data arise from multiple related but otherwise nonidentical distributions their underlying networks are likely to have common features new principled statistical_approaches are needed that can deal with different data distributions and jointly consider collections of datasets results we present fusenet a markov network formulation that infers networks from a collection of nonidentically distributed datasets our approach is computationally_efficient and general given any number of distributions from an exponential family fusenet represents model_parameters through shared latent_factors that define neighborhoods of network nodes in a simulation_study we demonstrate good predictive_performance of fusenet in comparison to several popular graph ical models we show its effectiveness in an application to breast_cancer rna_sequencing and somatic_mutation data a novel application of graphical_models fusion of datasets offers substantial gains relative to inference of separate networks for each dataset our results demonstrate that network_inference for non gaussian data can help in accurate modeling of the data generated by emergent high_throughput availability_and source_code is at https github com undirected graphical_models or markov networks are a popular class of statistical_tools for probabilistic description of complex associations in high_dimensional cf biological_processes in a cell involve complex interactions between genes and it is important to understand which genes conditionally depend on each other these dependencies can be inferred from the experimental_data and represented in a gene network as a popular_approach to network modeling markov networks are particularly appealing because they focus on finding such conditional dependence relationships intuitively the existence of a link between genes a and b in a markov network indicates that the behavior of gene a is still predictive of gene b given all available measurements about gene a and its immediate neighbors in a network hence markov networks can help us to find a rich set of direct dependencies between genes that are stronger than gene correlations markov networks have been well studied in bioinformatics and numerous applications are concerned with inferring the network_structure primarily from microarray and next_generation gene_expression data they are complementary but not superior to other gene network_inference approaches however the increasing variety of data generating technologies and heterogeneity of resulting data draw attention to two challenges in the context of markov network_inference inference from nongaussian distributed data and simultaneous inference from many datasets in bioinformatics many datasets are high_dimensional contain a limited number of samples with a large number of zeros and come from skewed distributions most existing_methods assume that data follow a gaussian_distribution while this assumption holds for typical log_ratio expression values from microarray_data it is violated for measurements obtained from sequencing_technologies fusenet is an approach for automatic inference of gene_networks from data arising from potentially many nonidentical distributions it is based on the theory of markov networks where the inferred network edges denote a type of direct dependence that is stronger than merely correlated measurements an appealing property of fusenet is its ability to estimate network edges by fusing potentially many datasets in the case studies fusenets models outperform several state of the art undirected graphical_models we show that fusenets high performance is attributed to the ability to model nongaussian distributions and fusion of data through sharing of latent representations our work here has broadened the class of off theshelf network_inference for simultaneously considering a wide_range of parametric distributions and has combined markov network_inference with data fusion
