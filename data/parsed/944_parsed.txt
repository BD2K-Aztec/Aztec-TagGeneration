genome_analysis chasm and snvbox toolkit for detecting biologically_important single_nucleotide in cancer thousands of cancer exomes are currently being sequenced yielding millions of non_synonymous variants snvs of possible relevance to disease_etiology here we provide a software toolkit to prioritize snvs based on their predicted contribution to tumorigenesis it includes a database of precomputed predictive features covering all positions in the annotated human exome and can be used either stand alone or as part of a larger variant discovery pipeline availability_and mysql_database source_code freely_available for academic government use ata fundamental goal of modern cancer_genomics studies is to understand how alterations in dna_sequence contribute to disease_susceptibility and prognosis targeted whole exome deep_sequencing is now affordable for many academic labs and the multitude of studies underway is yielding datasets of unprecedented magnitude while researchers have previously_developed methods to computationally predict the impact of single_nucleotide snvs to our knowledge there are no existing_tools capable of fast classification of very large snv datasets in cancer exomes we have previously_developed a computational_method cancerspecific high_throughput annotation of somatic_mutations chasm that predicts whether tumorderived somatic missense_mutations are important contributors to to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as cancer cell fitness here we describe a software_package that implements the chasm method the package includes a database of pre_computed predictive features called snvbox that facilitates rapid feature retrieval and classification of very large snv datasets furthermore the features in snvbox can be generally used to aid in the development of new classification algorithms that predict the impact of either germline or somatic snvs the chasm snvbox toolkit is the first distributable software_package that specifically targets somatic missense_mutations in cancer the learning_task of the random_forest is to discriminate between known drivers and a set of random passenger missense_mutations that match the mutation spectrum in a cancer type of interest chasm results are sensitive to this definition of mutation spectrum and users are encouraged to use the somatic variant_calls from their sequencing_data to make the best possible estimates of the spectrum supplementary_material while many snv classifiers are available through web interfaces these are not currently capable of handling large size custom datasets e g thousands to millions of snvs discovered in sequencing_projects some researchers have developed distributable packages that users can run on their local system to enable high_throughput snv processing these packages depend on third_party databases sequences alignments protein_structures specialized protein annotations and third_party software_packages the popular polyphen system for example requires installation of third_party software_packages in addition to three perl modules to our knowledge all available snv classification tools base their inferences on predictive features computed when a custom dataset is input to the system almost always using thirdparty databases and software in contrast the predictive features available in snvbox also calculated with many third_party tools have been exhaustively pre_computed allowing rapid retrieval for a custom dataset in benchmark testing retrieval of features for one million snvs took h on a dell r server with two amd opteron dual core bit cpus and gbs of ram chasm score computation for these one million mutations took an additional min and s finally the predictive features available in snvbox were designed to be useful for classification of both germline and somatic snvs we hope that snvbox will enable design of new improved machine_learning to predict the impact of snvs
