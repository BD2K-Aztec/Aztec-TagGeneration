power analysis and sample_size estimation for sequence_based association studies motivation statistical_methods have been developed to test for complex_trait rare_variant rv associations in which variants are aggre gated across a region which is typically a gene power analysis and sample_size estimation for sequence_based rv association studies are challenging because of the necessity to realistically model the underlying allelic architecture of complex_diseases within a suitable analytical framework to assess the performance of a variety of rv association methods in an unbiased manner summary we developed seqpower a software_package to perform statistical_power analysis for sequence_based association data under a variety of genetic_variant and disease phenotype models it aids epidemiologists in determining the best study_design sample_size and statistical_tests for sequence_based association studies it also provides biostatisticians with a platform to fairly compare rv association methods and to validate and assess novel association tests availability_and the seqpower program source_code multi_platform executables documentation list of association tests examples and tutorials are available at http bioinformatics org spower power analysis is one of the most crucial steps in designing complex_trait genetic_association the aim is to determine the power to detect an association for a specified sample_size or to estimate the sample_size for a given power for a variety of genetic_models and statistical_methods over the past_decade genomewide_association using single_nucleotide markers have been highly_successful in the study of complex_diseases with power analysis aided by software_packages such as genetic power calculator and cats currently there is growing interest in detecting complex_trait rare_variant rv associations using next_generation ngs_data many sequence_based rv association methods have been developed to jointly analyze_multiple snvs by aggregating them across a region e g a gene complexities arise making power and sample_size estimations for these rv association methods challenging the allelic architecture of rvs is dependent on population_genetic parameters which are difficult to realistically model additionally within a region the genetic effect_sizes of variants are not uniform and non causal_variants as well as variants with bidirectional effects e g protective and detrimental can be present also there can be genotyping error and missing_data this genetic complexity makes estimation of sample_size and power for rv association studies challenging owing to mathematical intractability application of theoretical power analysis is limited empirical power studies are also hindered by a lack of consistent implementation of many existing rv association methods to perform power analysis seqpower uses sequence_data generated via advanced genetic simulation technique as well as data derived from real_world ngs studies it generates qualitative_and trait qt data based on observed variants in the simulated genetic region analytic and empirical power analysis can be performed using a large variety of rv association methods seqpower is a practical tool for investigators to design adequately_powered rv association studies although the true underlying_genetic model is unknown using a range of models gene sizes allelic architectures effect_sizes etc an investigator can determine_whether a study has adequate power to at least detect associations with some of the genes involved in disease_etiology it is also an important tool to benchmark and comprehensively evaluate rv association tests and also aid in the development of new statistical methodologies
