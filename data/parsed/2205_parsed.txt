hippie a high_throughput identification pipeline for promoter interacting enhancer_elements we implemented a high_throughput identification pipeline for promoter interacting en hancer element to streamline the workflow from mapping raw hi c reads identifying dnadna interacting fragments with high_confidence and quality_control detecting histone_modifications and dnase hypersensitive enrichments in putative enhancer_elements to ultimately extracting possible intra_and chromosomal enhancertarget gene relationships availability_and this software_package is designed to run on high_performance clusters with oracle grid engine the source_code is freely_available under the mit_license for academic and nonprofit use the source_code and instructions are available at the wang lab website_http wanglab pcbi upenn edu hippie it is also provided as an amazon machine image to be used directly on amazon cloud with minimal installation contact genome_wide chromosome_conformation hi c has been utilized to reveal three_dimensional connectivity of chromatin_regions in eukaryotic nuclei because of its capability to capture all possible chromatin_interactions in a genome it has been recently employed to observe long_range regulatory_elements with their geographically proximal target gene_promoters although there have been workflows successfully expediting the analysis of one dimensional highthroughput_sequencing results such as whole_exome chip_seq dnase_seq and rna_seq there are limited tools to untangle two_dimensional dnadna physical_interactions using hi c datasets in an effort to reduce the obstacle of processing these largescale datasets and to establish an analysis protocol to detect candidate long_range regulatory_elements we implemented an automated workflow that processes hi c results starting from read_mapping with quality_controls and corrects for biases in interactions based on the linear distance mappability gc_content and fragment_lengths of each pair of hi c reads this pipeline identifies candidate promoterinteracting enhancer_elements by integrating hi c results with epigenomics data such as histone_modifications and dnase hypersensitivity sites
