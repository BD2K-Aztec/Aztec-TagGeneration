genome_analysis identification and removal of low complexity sites in allele specific analysis of chip_seq motivation high_throughput enable the genome_wide analysis of the impact of genetic_variation on molecular_phenotypes at unprecedented_resolution however although powerful these technologies can also introduce unexpected artifacts results we investigated the impact of library amplification_bias on the identification of allele specific as molecular_events from high_throughput sequencing_data derived from chromatin immunoprecipi tation assays chip_seq putative as dna_binding for rna_polymerase was determined using chip_seq derived from lym phoblastoid cell_lines of two parentdaughter trios we found that at high sequencing_depth many significant as binding_sites suffered from an amplification_bias as evidenced by a larger number of clonal reads representing one of the two alleles to alleviate this bias we devised an amplification_bias detection strategy which filters out sites with low read complexity and sites featuring a significant excess of clonal reads this method will be useful for as analyses_involving chip_seq and other functional sequencing assays availability the r package absfilter for library clonality simulations and detection of amplification biased sites is available from http the advent_of sequencing_technologies has enabled us to study the relationship between genomic_variants and various molecular_phenotypes at single basepair resolution to elucidate_the allele specific as gene_regulation such as those affected by cis_regulatory variants several studies have started to probe allele or individual specific changes in transcription_factor tf_binding and chromatin_states revealing that such changes are abundant and often correlate with gene_expression differences to detect these changes specialized computational workflows have been developed to eliminate several possible sources of bias inherently linked to the analysis of as behavior although the analysis may seem straightforward several technical hurdles need to be overcome to ensure reliable results these include for example the reference allele mapping bias i e the tendency of reads to map more frequently better to the reference allele than the alternative allele biases linked to duplicated genomic_regions quality of genotype_calls or the statistical_tests used here using rna_polymerase chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip sequencing_data from two parentdaughter trios from the genomes_project we studied another significant source of bias namely library amplification which can introduce a large number of false_positive as dna_binding asb events to address this bias we developed a two tiered amplification_bias detection strategy that filters out many of these likely false_positive sites and greatly_improves the overall reliability of the data this pipeline should prove useful for many studies aiming to use chip sequencing chip_seq technology to identify as molecular changes e g in proteindna binding or chromatin_structure it is now well recognized that high_throughput assays are susceptible to significant often non intuitive artifacts when used to detect as molecular_events here we report another such artifact intrinsic to deeply sequenced chip_seq libraries and likely other sequencing assays subject to pcr_amplification of a small amount of starting_material specifically we demonstrate that on identifying putative sites with as polr b occupancy we retain a clear excess number of sites that exhibit monoallelic dna_binding behavior we show that many of these sites suffer from pcr_amplification biases likely introduced during standard illumina library_preparation in a systematic study of basecomposition biases in illumina_sequencing libraries pcr during library_preparation was identified as the principal bias source although experimental strategies have been proposed to reduce this bias it is widely_accepted that it will be difficult to completely eliminate it unless pcr_amplification is avoided altogether however pcr free libraries require a substantial amount of input material rendering this rather unfeasible for approaches such as chip_seq where the sample material is often limiting consequently pcr amplification_bias should be accounted for when using chip_seq to detect as molecular events_involving transcription_factors cofactors and histone_modifications as observed in all chip_seq libraries suffered from this bias although the extent differed substantially between factors and libraries with first and third quartile of all accessible heterozygous snp sites exhibiting_low read_alignment complexity across nine additional assays profiled in the same individuals as polr b the later analysis included a previously_published dataset on ccctc binding_factor ctcf_binding in which of all accessible sites for as analysis were flagged as biased here we show that one of the sources of this bias is sequencing_depth given that the proportion of ma binding_events increases with increasing sequencing_depth one simple strategy to deal with this issue is to simply remove all clonal reads from the dataset however previous and our own studies demonstrate that many clonal reads likely constitute true signals removing all duplicate_reads from the polr b libraries leads to a strong reduction in the overall number of significant asb sites as well as to a depletion in sites with moderate asb signals irrespective of the strategy removing all a b consistency of allelic direction before and after filtering for amplification biased sites a reference allele ratios at shared asb sites between pairs of unrelated_individuals sites were accessible and significant in both individuals data from all paired individuals were pooled blue and red dots correspond to unbiased and biased sites respectively colored lines show linear_regression fits using all testable sites before filtering black unbiased sites blue and sites biased in one or both individuals red respectively b paternal allele ratios of significant asb site pairs that are located within polr b peaks data from all individuals were pooled blue and read dots correspond to unbiased and biased site pairs respectively colored lines show linear_regression fits using all testable site pairs black unbiased site pairs blue and site pairs with bias in one or both sites s red respectively clonal reads seems a rather overly cautious way of bypassing the pcr amplification_bias and is in fact counterproductive as it lowers the overall statistical_power asb sites and unnecessarily discards much of the sequencing_data we have presented a method to identify and reduce the bias of clonal amplification in as analysis of chip_seq this approach analyzes the read_alignment distribution around heterozygous snp sites and removes highly clonal lowcomplexity sites based on expectations about the distribution of reads covering snp sites given the current interest in understanding the interplay between dna_variants and gene_regulation this approach should be of general interest
