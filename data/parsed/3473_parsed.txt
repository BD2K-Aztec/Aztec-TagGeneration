genome_analysis pbsim pacbio reads simulator toward accurate genome_assembly motivation pacbio sequencers produce two types of characteristic reads continuous long_reads long and high_error and circular consensus sequencing short and low_error both of which could be useful for de_novo of genomes currently there is no available simulator that targets the specific generation of pacbio libraries results our analysis of pacbio datasets showed characteristic_features of pacbio reads e g the read_length of pacbio reads follows a log_normal we have developed a read simulator pbsim that captures these features using either a model based or sampling based method using pbsim we conducted several hybrid error_correction and assembly tests for pacbio reads suggesting that a continuous long_reads coverage depth of at least in combination with a circular consensus sequencing_coverage depth of at least achieved extensive assembly results the advent_of sequencing_technologies enables us to determine various genomes rapidly a number of sequencers have been developed e g illumina and solid and pacific_biosciences or pacbio for short has provided a unique sequencer which produces two types of reads i continuous long_reads clr long_reads with high_error and ii circular consensus sequencing ccs reads short_reads with low_error see supplementary tables s s for empirical statistics of clr and ccs reads these two types of read set could be useful for hybrid de_novo and using the pacbio sequencers chin and sorenson have determined the genome_sequences of two clinical vibrio_cholerae strains there are several simulators for reads produced by highthroughput sequencing_technologies such as pirs art grinder flowsim metasim and dwgsim in samtools see also supplementary however no read simulator has targeted the specific generation of pacbio libraries so_far we have therefore developed a simulator called pbsim that simulates both clr and ccs reads of pacbio sequencers we adopted two simulation_approaches i a sampling based simulation in which both length and quality_scores are sampled from a real read set and ii a model based simulation in addition we conducted hybrid error_correction and assembly tests for datasets simulated by pbsim suggesting that a clr coverage depth of at least in combination with a ccs coverage depth of at least achieved extensive assembly results
