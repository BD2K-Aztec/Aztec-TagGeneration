data_and two effective methods for correcting experimental high_throughput data motivation rapid advances in biomedical_sciences and genetics have increased the pressure on drug_development companies to promptly translate new knowledge into treatments for disease impelled by the demand and facilitated by technological_progress the number of compounds evaluated during the initial high_throughput hts step of drug_discovery has steadily increased as a highly automated large_scale process hts is prone to systematic_error caused by various technological and environmental_factors a number of error_correction methods have been designed to reduce the effect of systematic_error in experimental hts brideau et_al carralot et_al kevorkov and makarenkov makarenkov et_al malo et_al despite their power to correct systematic_error when it is present the applicability of those methods in practice is limited by the fact that they can potentially introduce a bias when applied to unbiased data we describe two new methods for eliminating systematic_error from hts_data based on a prior_knowledge of the error location this information can be obtained using a specific version of the t test or of the goodness_of test as discussed in dragiev et_al we will show that both new methods constitute an important improvement over the standard practice of not correcting for systematic_error at all as well as over the b score correction procedure brideau et_al which is widely used in the modern hts we will also suggest a more general data preprocessing framework where the new methods can be applied in combination with the well correction procedure makarenkov et_al such a framework will allow for removing systematic_biases affecting all plates of a given screen as well as those relative to some of its individual plates a typical drug_development project starts with a candidate identification phase in which a large chemical compound library is tested against a given biological target complex high_throughput equipment is employed at this to whom correspondence should be addressed stage to obtain precise estimates of compound activity levels the collected data are then used to identify the compounds that show the most promising drug like activity behavior the selected_compounds called hits typically undergo further testing to confirm their reproducibility and suitability for drug_development depending on the nature of the study the hits may be compounds with the highest activation capacity i e activation assays inhibition capacity i e inhibition assays or both the hit selection process assumes that the measurements taken by hts equipment accurately represent the activity levels of the tested compounds an important consideration for this to be true is that experimental_conditions are the same for all compounds of the screen biases in the measurements can nonetheless appear due to inconsistencies in the environmental_factors such as electricity temperature humidity or lighting changes organizational_factors can also have a significant systematic impact on the results of an hts campaign for example differences in the incubation time allow the solvent_evaporation to cause unintended variations in the solution concentrations highly_sensitive readers in particular can detect subtle differences among the tested molecules which misdirect follow_up efforts when they are due to bias rather than to biology as a result of systematic_bias causing under or over estimation of biological_activity inactive compounds may be incorrectly selected as hits false_positives whereas promising active_compounds may remain_undetected false_negatives in hts systematic_error is usually column or row dependent it is important to note that systematic_error can either affect compounds placed in the same well column or row location in all plates of the screen i e screen specific error or affect a column or row of a specific single plate of the screen i e plate specific error illustrates the presence of positional effects in two publicly_available experimental hts datasets mcmaster test_dataset used as a benchmark for the mcmaster data_mining and docking competition it contained the compounds intended to inhibit the escherichia_coli dihydrofolate_reductase dhfr and a dataset provided by the chemistry department of princeton university and consisting of a screen of compounds meant to inhibit the glycosyltransferase murg function of e coli examples demonstrate that systematic_biases in hts may have different screen specific and plate specific systematic deviations for instance in the mcmaster dataset the measurements in the column are globally over estimated but in plate they are rather under estimated similarly reveals apparent edge_effects in the princeton dataset with the values of the outer rows and columns being below the screen average this effect was not observed however for all plates of the princeton screen with an evident over estimation of the first column measurements detected in plate thus systematic error_correction methods should be able first to recognize the character of systematic_error affecting the data at hand and then remove it either from the whole assay and or only from the specific plates where it was detected in this article we describe two new methods for eliminating plate specific systematic_error and show how these methods can be applied in a more general correction framework that also includes the well correction procedure which allows for removing screen specific systematic_biases we described two new methods called mea and pmp allowing for elimination of plate specific systematic_error from experimental hts_data both methods rely on the prior information concerning the location of the rows and columns of the given plate affected by systematic_bias such information can be obtained by using the methodology described in we conducted a simulation_study with different hts plate sizes hit percentages and systematic_error magnitudes in this study the mea and pmp methods were compared with the b score and no correction strategies both new methods always outperformed the b score and no correction procedures when the number of the plates rows and columns affected by systematic_error was low in the simulations where the number of rows and columns affected by systematic_error could reach of the plates total number of rows and columns s the mea and pmp methods generally yielded better results than bscore when the hit percentage was under in a typical hts campaign the hit percentage is usually under or when the level of systematic_error was under sd the b score method showed a more stable behavior than mea and pmp only when the number of rows and columns affected by systematic_error hit percentage and systematic_error variance were high mainly due to a mediocre performance of the t test in this case mea was generally the best method for correcting systematic_error within well plates whereas pmp performed better for and well plates the analysis of the mcmaster data_mining and docking competition test assay showed that the new methods can be also applied in the combination with the well correction technique aiming to remove screen specific systematic_error hence a general data correction phase in hts permitting for the elimination of both screen and plate specific systematic_biases can be conducted in the following way normalize the raw measurements using percent of control normalized percent inhibition or z_score transformation this normalization step can be carried_out either on a plate byplate basis or for all assay measurements together i e when all plates have been processed under the same experimental_conditions perform the t test or goodness_of test on the hit distribution surface for the selected hit selection threshold if systematic_error is detected then carry out the well correction_method perform the t test or goodness_of test on each individual plate of the assay to identify its rows and columns affected by systematic_error as well as the error locations for all plates where systematic_error is detected correct the plate measurements by carrying out the pmp or mea method or alternatively the b score procedure in this study we addressed the issue of the commonly_considered additive systematic artifact that can be described using equation it is worth noting that the multiplicative type of systematic_bias affecting well i j of plate p and defined by
