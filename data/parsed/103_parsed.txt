a cross_species bi clustering approach to identifying conserved co regulated_genes motivation a growing number of studies have explored the process of pre implantation embry onic development of multiple mammalian_species however the conservation and variation among different species in their developmental_programming are poorly_defined due to the lack of effective computational_methods for detecting co regularized genes that are conserved across species the most sophisticated method to date for identifying conserved co regulated_genes is a two step approach this approach first identifies gene_clusters for each species by a cluster_analysis of gene_expression data and subsequently computes the overlaps of clusters identified from different species to reveal common subgroups this approach is ineffective to deal with the noise in the expression data introduced by the complicated procedures in quantifying gene_expression furthermore due to the sequential nature of the approach the gene_clusters identified in the first step may have little overlap among different species in the second step thus difficult to detect conserved co regulated_genes results we propose a cross_species bi clustering approach which first denoises the gene_expression data of each species into a data matrix the rows of the data_matrices of different species represent the same set of genes that are characterized by their expression_patterns over the developmental_stages of each species as columns a novel bi clustering method is then developed to cluster genes into subgroups by a joint sparse rank one factorization of all the data_matrices this method decomposes a data matrix into a product of a column vector and a row vector where the column vector is a consistent indicator across the matrices species to identify the same gene_cluster and the row vector specifies for each species the developmental_stages that the clustered genes co regulate efficient optimization_algorithm has been developed with convergence analysis this approach was first validated on synthetic data and compared to the two step method and several recent joint clustering_methods we then applied this approach to two real_world datasets of gene_expression during the pre implantation embryonic_development of the human and mouse co regulated_genes consistent between the human and mouse were identified offering insights into conserved functions as well as similarities and differences in genome activation timing between the human and mouse_embryos availability_and the r package containing the implementation of the proposed method in c is available at https github com javonsun mvbc git and also at the r platform https www r project org contact jinbo engr uconn eduthe process of mammalian pre implantation embryonic_development is characterized by the degradation of maternal rna stored in the oocytes and the gradual activation of the embryonic genome rapid advances in the whole_genome rna sequencing_techniques has led to a growing number of studies_exploring gene_regulation during preimplantation embryonic_development in different species several studies have shown that the timing of embryonic genome activation varies by species the understanding of this variation may bring insights into embryonic developmental_programming and species differences identifying the co regulated gene_clusters that are conserved across species is a key_component in the understanding of this variation such conserved gene_clusters are likely involved in common biological_processes that are fundamental to the embryonic_development of mammals however due to the lack of effective computational_methods there has been limited understanding of the conservation of gene co regulation during embryonic_development in a typical study of mammalian embryonic_development expression levels of all genes are collected at multiple developmental_milestones stages such as oocytes cell and cell embryos gene_expression data of different species are analyzed and compared to understand the similarities and variations in the embryonic_development of the species the most sophisticated method available so_far for identifying conserved co regulated_genes consists of two steps in sequence first co regulated gene_clusters are identified in each individual species by performing a cluster_analysis of their gene_expression data usually by a hierarchical_clustering method second by computing overlaps among identified clusters in different species co regulated gene_clusters that are conserved among species may be found this two step approach can be ineffective in two ways there are innegligible noises in the expression data resulted from the complicated procedures in quantifying gene_expression the noises may prevent the detection of biologically_meaningful and important gene_clusters for each species moreover the clusters identified in the first step may have no overlaps in the second step thus unable to identify_conserved gene_clusters in this paper we address these two issues by proposing a novel cross_species bi clustering approach a variety of methods have been proposed to reduce noise from a dataset such as those for smoothing out noise or identifying and removing outliers however a proper and effective noise_reduction method is problem specific to identify coregulated gene_clusters we search for genes that exhibit similar expression_patterns over the embryonic developmental_stages we define that an expression pattern or simply a pattern is a specific series of high and low_expression over a set of developmental_stages for example in a study with three stages oocytes cell and cell embryos the sequence ofis a pattern that a gene may follow indicating that the gene has high expression_level in oocytes but low levels in the cell and cell stages in order to reduce noise and focus on the biologically confirmed gene_expression we propose to transform the raw gene_expression data to reflect how closely the expression levels follow known patterns in the new data matrix rows represent genes and each column corresponds to a pattern in a pre compiled list of patterns each gene is measured by the similarity between its gene_expression path and each of the patterns in the list instead of a separate cluster_analysis for each species we propose to integrate gene_expression data of multiple species to search for confirmatory co regulated gene_clusters directly this integrative way of data analysis allows the searching process to target at the gene_clusters that show similar patterns across species the multi species joint cluster_analysis corresponds to a machine_learning principle multi view cluster_analysis where the same set of subjects i e genes here is viewed in different input spaces particularly here in the developmental_stages of different species further we need to determine the expression_patterns in each view i e the columns in each data matrix that are responsible for the grouping of subjects multiview cluster_analysis aims to group subjects into clusters in the same way no matter which view of data is used however most of the existing multi view clustering_methods assume that all columns in the data contribute equally in determining the clusters these methods cannot identify the specific patterns that the clustered genes actually follow even though a gene may follow multiple known patterns the number of these patterns is much smaller than the total amount of pre compiled biological patterns hence these existing multi view clustering_methods are not suitable for solving our problem we recently_proposed two new multi view bi clustering_methods that can identify consistent clusters across views and simultaneously specify a subset of variables in each view on which the genes in a cluster show high similarity however the algorithm developed in although is efficient has not obtained a theoretical guarantee for convergence so_far the method inrequires to predetermine the cluster_size i e the number of genes in a cluster before the algorithm can be applied which is obviously difficult to estimate for the gene co regulation problem in this paper we thus propose another new multi view bi clustering method that identifies both the gene_clusters consistent across multiple species views and the expression_patterns of the clustered genes for each species by a sparse rank one matrix_factorization this method decomposes a data matrix into a product of a sparse column vector and a sparse row vector the non zero entries of these vectors indicate the gene_clusters and the selected expression_patterns respectively we propose to use another sparse column vector to link the different data_matrices this column vector is used to enforce that the decomposed column vectors from every view correspond to the same subset of genes the resultant optimization_problem can be solved efficiently by developing an alternating optimization_algorithm compared to the methods in the proposed method is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point and does not require any prior_knowledge of cluster_size we compared the proposed method in simulations to the traditional two step approach and several latest multi view clustering_methods developed by others which demonstrated the superiority of our method we then used the proposed approach to analyze the pre implantation embryonic_development datasets of the human and mouse across the two species co regulated gene_clusters were identified to be conserved a gene_ontology analysis of the identified genes showed that they are involved in many fundamental biological_networks the expression_patterns associated with these clusters were compared between the human and mouse_embryos showing that there are both similarities and variations between the human and mouse in the gene activation timing during the early development we briefly introduce the notation used throughout this paper we use a bold font upper case letter such as x to represent a matrix a bold font lower case letter such as v to denote a column vector i j sun et_al and a lower case letter such as a to represent a scalar we denote the component of x at the ith row and jth column by xi j or x ij and the ith row and jth column of m respectively by xi and x j similarly we use vi to denote the ith component of v the frobenius norm of a matrix x is denoted by jjxjj f which is calculated as ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi p i p j jx ij j q further the norm of a vector v is denoted by jjvjj and calculated as p i jv i j where v i is its ith component the operator z u is the element wise product of z and u we use an italic upper case letter as s to represent a set of elements we first evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method using synthetic data and subsequently applied it to two real_world datasets of pre implantation embryonic_development in the human and mouse to demonstrate its advantage we compared the proposed multi view bi clustering method with several existing_approaches using synthetic data where we know the ground_truth the compared methods include both base_line approaches and advanced multi view clustering_methods that are recognized as the state of art in the machine_learning field these methods are briefly_describes as follows bullet single view overlap this is the traditionally and commonly used two step approach i e clustering analysis in each view separately followed by the computation of overlaps among clusters from different views we ran this two step approach with both the hierarchical_clustering as implemented in tool wgcna and the bi clustering via sparse rank one matrix_factorization as the clustering method on each view a cross_species bi clustering approach to identifying conserved co regulated_genes i bullet kernel addition product radial_basis rbf kernels of all views are combined via addition or component wise product spectral clustering was subsequently applied to the combined kernel to obtain clusters bullet feature concatenation data from all views were simply arranged together by feature concatenation and the rbf kernel of this combined data was calculated and used in spectral clustering to obtain clusters bullet co trained spectral homogeneous kernels among views are sought via iterative search in each iteration the kernel of one view is updated with information from the remaining views spectral clustering was subsequently used with these homogeneous kernels to obtain clusters bullet co regularized spectral this method also performs joint spectral clustering the eigendecomposition of the graph laplacian of all views is linked to obtain homogeneous eigenvectors that are used subsequently in k means to obtain clusters we have developed a new approach that can be used to identify coregulated gene_clusters that are conserved among multiple species using samples collected at a series of different time points such as during pre implantation embryonic_development the proposed approach consists of two components pattern preserving noise_reduction and multi view bi clustering via sparse rank one matrix_factorization we have developed an efficient algorithm that is guaranteed to converge for solving the optimization_problem in the proposed multi view bi clustering compared to the commonly used two step approach our approach is less vulnerable to noise in the gene_expression data and has the advantage of identifying conserved coregulated gene_clusters among species in this study we did not attempt to normalize data between species because in real_world situations direct comparisons in gene_expression levels among species may not be necessary however such normalization is intriguing and new strategies should be developed when a need is presented we have succeeded in identifying conserved co regulated gene_clusters between the human and mouse in their pre implantation embryos by applying the proposed approach the clusters not only represent functional gene_networks that conserved in embryogenesis between the two species but reveal similarities and differences in progression of developmental_programming of embryos across species the identification of these orchestrated functional changes is among the first step to unveil the little known embryonic programming and provide directions of future_research in embryogenesis even though the development of the proposed method is motivated by studying the pre implantation embryonic_development of multiple mammalian_species it can certainly be applied to many other similar situations the approach that we have proposed for cleaning the data can be employed to denoise other similar datasets when gene_expression are the focus of the study the proposed multi view bi clustering method is a general clustering approach and can be used in any multi view setting especially in situations where consistent gene_clusters across views only exist in the subspaces of the variables in the views because expression_patterns used here in noise_reduction are essentially variables that groups genes in the subsequent cluster_analysis the success of the method can be limited by the expression_patterns that are used we suggest using all patterns that potentially make biologic sense the method is flexible in that the patterns can be modified when new biological_questions arise when combined with the traditional two step clustering approach our method is a great tool to obtain more information from the same dataset
