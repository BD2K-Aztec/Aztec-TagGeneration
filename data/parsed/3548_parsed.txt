genome_analysis phylogenomic clustering for selecting non redundant genomes for comparative_genomics motivation analyses in comparative_genomics often require non redundant genome datasets eliminating redundancy is not as simple as keeping one strain for each named species because gen omes might be redundant at a higher taxonomic_level than that of species for some analyses some strains with different species names can be as similar as most strains sharing a species name whereas some strains sharing a species name can be so different that they should be put into different groups and some genomes lack a species name results we have implemented a method and web_server that clusters a genome dataset into groups of redundant genomes at different thresholds based on a few phylogenomic distance measures availability the web_interface similarity and distance data and r scripts can be accessed atgenomic databases contain several sequenced strains for species of high interest whereas other species contain only one genome and no evolutionarily close_relatives these biases might result in different qualities when predicting such features as functional interactions by comparative_genomics the problem has often been solved by using a measure of phylogenetic distance either directly as a score e g or for normalizing scores e g the problem has also been solved by choosing single representatives for particular clades e g moreno however selecting representatives by species name can be problematic because strains of different species for example escherichia_coli and shigella_flexneri can be so evolutionarily close that they should share their names whereas strains of single species such as prochlorococcus marinus might be very distant to each other moreno besides some sequenced_genomes do not have a species name and the level of acceptable similarity among genomes for some applications might be lower than the most common for species moreno the genomic similarity_score gss and other phylogenomic measures have been shown to concur with more computationally_demanding phylogenetic distances we have used gss to produce datasets of non redundant genomes maximizing the number of predicted interactions by phylogenetic profiles moreno hagelsieb and and other practical uses such as displaying the relationship between conservation of gene_order and genomic similarity the datasets were built by ordering the genomes available by importance e g escherichia_coli k would take priority because of its annotation_quality and then from largest to smallest we would then take the first genome in the list and put any genome with a gss above a chosen threshold into the list of redundant genomes in the present work we tested instead two clustering_methods to group genomes besides a couple variants of the gss and dna signatures as other research groups have asked us for lists of non redundant genomes here we make them available to the wider community gss a and gss b concentrate strains sharing species names strains in species into the range of the gss distribution whereas gss c spreads several of them between the and range thus gss c might be the least adequate for clustering redundant genomes because dna signatures are faster to calculate than gsss we are starting to experiment with dna signatures for our work in comparative_genomics thus we have also clustered our genome dataset based on di tri and tetra nucleotide signature distances dna signature distances among same species strains concentrate at the divisive coefficients were higher and thus better than the agglomerative coefficients using all three gsss and dna signature distances the coefficients using gss c were the lowest among all three gsss for both algorithms thus confirming that gss c is the least adequate for clustering genomes however dna signature distances produced the best overall clusters with divisive coefficients the appropriate threshold for defining groups of redundant genomes depends on the application e g moreno thus we recommend experimenting with different thresholds the web_site provides thresholds per measure that should suffice for such experimentation should other users prefer to experiment at thresholds other than those provided through the web_site we also provide the r scripts used to derive these groups and the pertinent distance similarity data with some effort inexperienced users would be able to modify these scripts to obtain groups at other thresholds finally we also provide cluster files that can be read by software for drawing and manipulating phylogenetic_trees newick format d i n u c l t r i n u c l t e t r a n u c lagglomerative divisive same species clustering most of the same species strains have gsss and dna signature distances gss b concentrates most of the same species strains above the score and gss c spreads them the most dna signatures produce the best clusters as shown by agglomerative divisive coefficients with divisive clustering producing slightly better clusters
