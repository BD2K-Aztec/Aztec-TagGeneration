genome_analysis h m detection of runs of homozygosity from whole exome sequencing_data runs of homozygosity roh are sizable chromosomal stretches of homozygous genotypes ranging in length from tens of kilobases to megabases rohs can be relevant for population and medical_genetics playing a role in predisposition to both rare and common disorders rohs are commonly_detected by single_nucleotide snp microarrays but attempts have been made to use whole_exome wes data currently available methods developed for the analysis of uniformly spaced snp_array maps do not fit easily to the analysis of the sparse and non uniform_distribution of the wes target design results to meet the need of an approach specifically tailored to wes data we developed h m an original algorithm based on heterogeneous hidden_markov that incorporates inter marker distances to detect roh from wes data we evaluated the performance of h m to correctly identify rohs on synthetic chromosomes and examined its accuracy in detecting rohs of different length short medium and long from real genomes_project data h m turned out to be more accurate than germline and plink two state of the art algorithms especially in the detection of short and medium rohs availability_and h m is a collection of bash r and fortran scripts and codes and is freely_available at https sourceforge net_projects h m runs of homozygosity roh are chromosomal stretches that in a diploid_genome appear in the homozygous state that is display identical alleles at multiple contiguous loci the study of roh can be relevant for both population and medical_genetics genomic roh patterns are governed by a number of factors among which population_genetic history e g historical bottleneck geographic isolation and population_size evolutionary_forces e g selective_sweeps and cultural habits or historical and geographical factors recent parental relatedness favors the formation of long roh several megabases that occur because of ibd identity by descent when the two alleles at a locus match because they originate from the same common_ancestor as opposed to identity by state when the two alleles at a locus match simply by coincidence homozygosity originating from the occurrence of individual ibd regions owing to parental relatedness autozygosity is known to possibly contain recessive highly_penetrant deleterious disease_causing surrounded by an unusually long homozygous haplotype this is the principle that inspired homozygosity_mapping in the study of rare recessive disorders affecting inbred individuals in outbred individuals short up to few hundreds of kilobases or mediumsized roh from hundreds of kilobases to a few megabases can surround disease_causing as well playing a role in predisposition to disease through the effect of mildly deleterious recessive variants to date roh detection has been achieved by microarraybased technologies currently available single_nucleotide snp_array platforms contain millions of markers from the hapmap project and have a mean snp to snp distance of around kb the past_few have seen the emergence of several next_generation ngs_platforms that are capable to sequence a full human_genome per week at a cost fold less than the previous methods the advent of ngs_platforms has revolutionized our ability of studying human genetic_variation allowing the achievement of large_scale re sequencing_projects such as the genomes_project gp and the cancer_genome www cancergenome nih gov recently the gp consortium by combining low coverage whole_genome wgs and high coverage whole_exome wes of individuals from populations has genotyped million single nucleotide polymorphic positions genomes this provided a genetic_map characterized by a mean snp to snp distance of bp and with of the inter marker distances under bp this catalog captures up to of accessible snps with minor_allele of to whom correspondence should be addressed at present the cost and the computational_complexity still limit the routine use of wgs and make wes an effective alternative that has been successfully used for the discovery of single_nucleotide short indels and copy_number and that can be applied to the detection of roh however the sparse nature of the wes target design makes this latter application challenging the distance between adjacent gp exomic snps ranges from bp to mb with an average value of around bp and consequently large roh may be covered by few and not uniformly spaced snps whereas small and isolated roh may display exceptionally_high marker_density currently available sliding_window methods such as plink or germline were developed for the analysis of uniformly spaced snp_array maps and do not fit easily to the analysis of the sparse and non uniform_distribution of wes snp maps the identification of long roh typically those detected in a context of consanguinity may be faced by applying these methods to wes data however medium or short roh cannot be as easily captured from wes data by using traditional sliding_windows approaches to meet the need of an approach specifically tailored to wes data which could overcome the inherent_limitations of currently available tools we developed a novel computational_approach homozygosity heterogeneous hidden_markov hmm for the identification of roh the algorithm is based on a heterogeneous hmm that incorporating the distance between consecutive polymorphic positions into the transition_probabilities matrix is able to detect with high_sensitivity roh of every genomic size the key feature of the algorithm is its heterogeneity which makes it well suited for wes data to evaluate the capability of this novel method to detect roh of different sizes we applied it to the analysis of a synthetic dataset and compared its performance with that of plink and germline on real wes data another method for homozygosity ibd detection from sequences based on a hmm algorithm ibdseq has recently been reported we did not compare h m with ibdseq because this latter method is conceived explicitly for genome_sequences and has never been applied to wes data as a whole the results we obtained in these analyses demonstrated that h m has the potentiality to capture most of the genomic roh that overlap regions covered by exomic targets and that it outperforms the existing algorithms especially in the detection of medium and short roh
