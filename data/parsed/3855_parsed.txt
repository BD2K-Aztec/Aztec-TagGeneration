sequence_analysis r plus toolbox an r bioconductor_package for analyzing roche sequencing_data the r plus toolbox is an r bioconductor_package for the analysis of sequencing_data projects generated with roches data analysis software can be imported into r allowing advanced and customized analyses within the r bioconductor environment for sequencing_data several methods were implemented extending the current functionality of roches software these extensions include methods for quality_assurance and annotation of detected variants further a pipeline for the detection of structural_variants e g balanced chromosomal_translocations is provided availability the r plus toolbox is implemented in r and available at http www bioconductor org a vignette outlining typical workflows is included in the package roche sequencing_technology produces hundreds of thousands of dna_sequences consisting of a few hundred nucleotides each thereby permitting highly_sensitive detection of molecular mutations roche developed the gs flx data analysis software that enables researchers to handle the challenging analysis of the massively_parallel sequencing_data the software implements a variety of standard analysis workflows but so_far an interface to programming_languages like r is not available hence a few specialized pipelines for highly customized analyses were developed in contrast to these software_packages we present an r package that expands roche gs flx software by offering access to sequencing results generated by roches software from within r based on the r bioconductor infrastructure for sequencing_data several new functions expanding the scope of roche gs flx software were implemented and further user_defined functions can easily be added in addition a pipeline for the detection of structural_variants such as balanced chromosomal_translocations or inversions was implemented which is a functionality with great utility in the characterization of complex cancer_genomes to whom correspondence should be addressed the r plus toolbox provides an interface to access sequencing_data processed with roche gs flx software from within r and offers many tools for quality reports annotation and advanced analyses users can add customized methods using the r bioconductor infrastructure hence the r plus toolbox is useful for custom analyses of sequencing_data and may further support a broad application of amplicon deep_sequencing in a diagnostic_laboratory in particular for the analyses of tumor_specimens
