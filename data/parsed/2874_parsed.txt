merp a high_throughput pipeline for mendelian randomization analysis we present a mendelian randomization mr pipeline merp to facilitate rapid causal_inference analysis through automating key_steps in developing and analyzing genetic instruments obtained from publicly_available data our tool uses the national_human catalog of associations to generate instrumental variable trait files and provides methods for filtering of potential confounding associations as well as linkage_disequilibrium merp generates estimated causal_effect scores via a mr score analysis using summary data for disease end_points typically found in the public_domain we utilize our pipeline to develop genetic instruments for seven traits and evaluate potential causal_relationships with two disease endpoints observing two putatively causal associations between blood_pressure and bone_mineral with type_diabetes our tool emphasizes the importance of careful but systematic_screening of large_datasets for discovery and systematic follow_up availability_and merp is a free open_source project and can be downloaded atthe surge in genome_wide gwas has generated an abundance of single_nucleotide snps associated with a wide_range of phenotypes resulting in a rapidly_growing body of research employing a statistical_method utilizing snps as instrumental_variables to draw causal_inference between traits and diseases hern n and this method termed mendelian randomization mr represents a genetic version of the randomized_control where genetic_variants are selected to correspond exclusively to a biomarker for which a causal estimate to a disease outcome is desired the approach can address confounding by the fact alleles assort randomly at meiosis and also addresses reverse causality by the fact that disease_states do not influence germline genetic_variation in alone mr related studies were published thus the limiting_factor is no longer obtaining results from association studies but rather how we take advantage of these data efficiently and appropriately in mr studies today and in the future as the number of gwas and high_throughput studies extends the catalog of disease and trait associations tools primed to take advantage of these data as they are produced will be essential the research_community performing mr studies would be well advantaged by a computational_pipeline that facilitates the use of the largest datasets available supporting the labor_intensive process of curating data streamlining the selection of genetic_variants at an appropriate level of linkage_disequilibrium ld with one another if combined into a genetic score and finally evaluated for association with confounding_factors such a tool would generate hypotheses thatcould help facilitate rapid transmission of discoveries to the research and ultimately clinical communities after sufficient evidence of causality has been accrued to address these aims we present merp a computational_pipeline to facilitate mr studies at high_throughput we present merp as a tool to help facilitate the labor_intensive steps in instrument creation for mr studies and one valid score based analytical_approach to summarize causal_association one caveat of the score based_approach is the concern of heterogeneity as multiple genetic mechanisms or pathways may impact the trait of interest and subsequently the outcome differently however this hypothesis of heterogeneity is itself a testable one for multiple_variants aggregated in a score one that can be evaluated given the output from merp with this output merp also empowers users to investigate individual variants selected in their instrument potentially applying prior_biological to their inference which may be critical to the longer_term success of such studies it is critical to emphasize that the evidence generated in an initial screen from merp adds but one piece of evidence to establish causality an overwhelmingly compelling case for causality must involve further statistical_analysis studies in model systems key insights into biological_mechanisms and ideally evidence from interventional_studies where applicable a case built for ldl c and chd was done in precisely this way over the course of more than years of directed research_effort thus we suggest that data_mining and filtering strategies provided by merp are themselves not to be taken lightly and serve as the first piece of evidence to focus on potentially meaningful relationships that undoubtedly require additional lines of evidence to provide casual evidence beyond a reasonable doubt
