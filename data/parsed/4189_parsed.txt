sequence_analysis sensitive and fast mapping of di base encoded reads motivation discovering variation among high_throughput sequenced_genomes relies on efficient and effective mapping of sequence_reads the speed sensitivity and accuracy of read_mapping are crucial to determining the full spectrum of single_nucleotide snvs as well as structural_variants svs in the donor genomes analyzed results we present drfast a read_mapper designed for di base encoded color_space sequences generated with the ab solid platform drfast is specially_designed for better delineation of structural_variants including segmental_duplications and is able to return all possible map locations and underlying sequence_variation of short_reads within a user specified distance threshold we show that drfast is more sensitive in comparison to all commonly used aligners such as bowtie bfast and shrimp drfast is also faster than both bfast and shrimp and achieves a mapping speed comparable to bowtie availability the source_code for drfast is available atgenomic variation between individuals or across species ranges from single_nucleotide snps and structural_variation to larger chromosomal_rearrangements thanks to the improvements in sequencing_technologies large_scale genome_variation studies such as the genomes_project genomes have made it possible to better characterize normal human genomic_variation and disease the development of high_throughput hts technologies has changed the landscape of genome research the first commercially_available hts technology was from roche life_sciences and was used to sequence the genome of james watson it was followed by other second generation sequencing_platforms that generate orders_of more data for a fraction of the cost such as illumina_genome and ab solid mckernan to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded as joint first third generation sequencing_platforms are now under development and heliscope and pacbio rs were recently made available however for the time being they produce reads with higher_error analysis of genomic_variation using sequencing starts with mapping the randomly sheared and ideally uniformly sampled dna_fragments from the genome different properties and error models of sequence_reads generated by these technologies require the development of specialized read_mapping algorithms for each platform for accurate read_alignment and characterization of genomic_variants this becomes more complicated for short_reads due to repeats and duplications in genomes they can map to multiple_locations with equal sequence_identity leveraging the high sequence_coverage and randomly selecting one best location when a read cannot be unambiguously placed has proven to be effective in discovering snps and small_indels in relatively non complex areas of the genome however structural_variation detection sensitivity is shown to benefit from tracking all map locations of the reads including suboptimal alignments and characterization of segmental_duplications is extremely resistant against mapping the reads uniquely read_mappers can be broadly classified into two categories according to the method used to index the reference_genome using either hash tables or suffix_arrays compressed through the ferragina manzini index with the use of the_burrows hashbased aligners such as maq shrimp mrfast mrsfast and bfast have poorer_performance in comparison to suffix_array based aligners e g bwa bowtie when dealing with short_reads however their relative performance increases considerably and surpasses the suffix_array based aligners when the read_length and thus the number of errors mismatches or indels that need to be tolerated increase in this article we describe a hash based read_mapping algorithm named di base read fast alignment search tool drfast designed for the di base encoded color_space reads generated with the solid platform the main advantage of di base encoding is increased base call accuracy due to each base being represented by two colors this helps in differentiating base_calling errors color_space errors from real sequence variance thereby increasing the reliability of detected genomic_variants we show that mapping speed of drfast is higher than other solid enabled hash based read_mappers bfast and shrimp to measure the performance of drfast we compared its two variants to popular color_space read_mappers currently available parameters we used the following parameter_settings for these mappers bullet drfast e error threshold for different runs bullet bowtie n v error threshold for different runs a for reporting all s output in sam format c color_space mapping bullet shrimp m score for match i score for mismatch x score for color_space error u ungapped alignment o maximum number of alignments for a read n number of threads h alignment identity bullet socs x number of bases to trim s mismatch sensitivity t mismatch tolerance m maximum number of alignments for a read indicates to report all t number of threads l yes consider the lower case bases in genome bullet mapreads s color_space mapping m number of mismatches allowed a count adjacent mismatches as one mismatch z maximum number of alignment for a read bullet perm seed s full sensitivity for two snps v number of mismatches we used the same parameters for reporting all mapping locations when available to ensure a fair comparison note that bwa and maq are not considered here since they ignore the first two characters of solid reads data reference_genome and computing_power we used both simulated_and for comparisons we simulated three sets each with million_reads of length_bp sampled randomly from chromosome of human_reference ncbi build as follows bullet set we transformed the reads to color_space with no color errors and no mismatches in addition we randomly_selected million bp long_reads from publicly_available color_space reads generated from the genomes of na srx na srx and na we used the human_reference ncbi build unmasked as the reference_genome in all our experiments the benchmarking results we report are performed on a server with bit intel_xeon processor and gb of ram time accuracy and sensitivity results we give the comparison results for all the mappers above with respect to the proportion of the reads that have at least one map location on the reference_genome sensitivity total number of map locations found comprehensiveness and time needed to map the reads shows the results on simulated_datasets with error threshold of color errors and mismatches except in the case of perm where we allowed up to four mismatches due to recommendations of its developers drfast maps all the reads from simulated_datasets back to the reference_genome very efficiently the closest competitor to drfast appears to be bowtie which is in general slower than drfast ct and is not sensitive although bowtie with a parameter setting of v seems to map each read to more locations than drfast when no substitutions are present set or a single color error is added set this is simply due to bowtie not being stringent on the number of errors it permits disregarding the parameter setting we noticed that there are mapping locations with more than five color errors when the reads involve a nucleotide_substitution set the number of mapping locations are lower than that of drfast what is more interesting is the number of reads that can be mapped to the reference_genome it seems like bowtie can map at most of the reads even when they include a single color error set in contrast drfast both variants map of the reads when the errors are in the form of nucleotide_substitutions the proportion of reads_mapped by bowtie drops to since bowtie was the closest competitor to drfast we performed another experiment on the same datasets by increasing the error threshold to interestingly for this setting the proportion of reads_mapped by bowtie is almost matching the mapping sensitivity of drfast however both in terms of time and the number of map locations drfast both variants perform better than bowtie especially when errors set for color errors and set for nucleotide errors are present as all three sets are generated from chromosome with at most two errors added a sensitive mapper should be able to map all reads to chromosome when the error threshold is set to in order to experimentally check the accuracy of all locations found by drfast we simulated the corresponding illumina_reads letterspace and aligned to chromosome using mrsfast as seen infor sets and drfast finds slightly more mappingdisease susceptibility and genome_evolution although there are inherent accuracy and bias problems associated with different sequencing_platforms we can also leverage the different strengths of these technologies to increase confidence and and structural_variation discovery for species where a reference_genome is available as in human mapping sequence_reads to this reference assembly is the first step in genome_analysis sensitivity and accuracy as well as the speed of read_alignment are crucial for precise characterization of genomic_variants to this end many mapping algorithms were developed focusing mainly on the illumina_genome data and very little effort was devoted to analyze color_space reads generated with the solid platform the main limitation of the solid aware read_aligners is that they were not optimized for structural_variation detection except for shrimp which is more powerful in mapping to more complex areas of the genome and they are unusable for segmental_duplication analysis due to their unique mapping_approach on the other hand by tracking all possible map locations and underlying sequence_variation drfast provides an opportunity to better access and increase mappability in repeat and duplication rich areas of the genome that are known to harbor much structural_variation although the sensitivity of drfast is higher than the other aligners we also demonstrate speed enhancements of both dynamic_programming and color transformation versions through its readiness to be integrated to variationhunter for more sensitive sv discovery to novelseq to characterize novel sequence insertions and usability for segmental variation detection drfast is an_important for recovering additional genetic_variation from di base encoded color_space sequencing
