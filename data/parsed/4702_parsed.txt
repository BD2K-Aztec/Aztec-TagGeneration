data_and toward an automatic method for extracting cancer and other disease related point_mutations from the biomedical_literature motivation a major_goal of biomedical_research in personalized_medicine is to find relationships between mutations and their corresponding disease_phenotypes however most of the disease related mutational data are currently buried in the biomedical_literature in textual form and lack the necessary structure to allow easy retrieval and visualization we introduce a high_throughput computational_method for the identification of relevant disease mutations in pubmed_abstracts applied to prostate pca and breast_cancer bca mutations results we developed the extractor of mutations emu tool to identify mutations and their associated genes we benchmarked emu against mutationfindera tool to extract point_mutations from text our results show that both methods achieve comparable_performance on two manually_curated datasets we also benchmarked emus performance for extracting the complete mutational information and phenotype remarkably we show that one of the steps in our approach a filter_based on sequence_analysis increases the precision for that task from to pca and from to bca we also show that this high_throughput approach can be extended to other diseases discussion our method improves the current status of disease mutation databases by significantly increasing the number of annotated mutations we found and mutations manually verified to be related to pca and bca respectively that are not currently annotated for these cancer_types in the omim or swiss_prot databases emus retrieval_performance represents a fold_improvement in the number of annotated mutations for pca and bca we further show that our method can benefit from full text analysis once there is an increase in open_access availability of full_text relating human genomic_variation to disease risk is one of the major challenges of personalized_medicine during the past_decade hundreds of mutations in the human_genome have been associated to disease_phenotypes when available this information can be integrated into the analysis of genomic_variation of individual_genomes which is crucial to developing personalized_medicine approaches yet mutational information is for the most part in textual form and not organized for easy identification and association to the corresponding disease phenotype moreover the complexity of natural_language and the continuous exponential_growth of literature repositories e g pubmed make extracting this information challenging publicly_available databases like online_mendelian omim and swiss_prot contain categorized protein and dna mutational information with explicit associations to cancer and other diseases other resources focus on specific diseases such as cancer e g cancer gene index or specific chromosomal_locations these databases are currently constructed and curated manually which is a slow_process that limits the number of cancer mutations available to the biomedical community text_mining to find reported mutations in these databases have yielded up to sensitivity but to date no accurate automatic_methods to find disease related mutations are available several algorithms have been developed to extract mutational data from the biomedical_literature all of these methods implement standard regular expressions to identify either the point_mutations alone e g mutationfinder or both the mutations and their associated gene and protein_names e g mema mutext most of the mutation gene recognition methods implement standard regular expressions and generate text collections of the point_mutation information some however provide algorithmic and interface alternatives for instance mutation grab uses graph_based expressions to identify mutations while mutationminer uses structural visualizations to display them overall most methods have focused on the extraction of point_mutations and their association with specific genes with reasonable accuracy however generating a resource of disease related mutations is still a challenge page this section is organized by the different steps in our procedure to extract disease mutations namely creating the mutationdisease related corpus using emu to extract mutations which is benchmarked against mutationfinder and estimating the overall performance precision in terms of identifying correct mutational information genes and disease association of our approach in this section we discuss the results for the comparison of i two methods to extract mutations emu versus mutationfinder and ii the advantages_and of using seq filter we also discuss mapping the mutations found by emu to diseasemutation reference_databases in addition we discuss the feasibility of applying our approach to other diseases and to full_text as well as the main challenges we foresee in the complete automation of the annotation of disease mutations extracted from pubmed_abstracts
