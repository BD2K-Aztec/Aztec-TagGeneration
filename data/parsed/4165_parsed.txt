genetics_and securema protecting participant privacy in genetic_association meta_analysis motivation sharing genomic_data is crucial to support scientific investigation such as genome_wide however recent investigations suggest the privacy of the individual participants in these studies can be compromised leading to serious concerns and consequences such as overly restricted access to data results we introduce a novel cryptographic strategy to securely perform meta_analysis for genetic_association in large consortia our methodology is useful for supporting joint studies among dispar ate data sites where privacy or confidentiality is of concern we validate our method using three multisite association studies our research shows that genetic_associations can be analyzed efficiently and accurately across substudy sites without leaking information on individual participants and site level association summaries availability_and our software for secure meta_analysis of genetic_association securema is publicly_available at http github com xieconnect securema our customized secure computation framework is also publicly_available at http github comdecreasing costs in sequencing_technologies in combination with large repositories of clinical information has enabled the discovery of novel associations between genetic_variants and disease these achievements are facilitated by increased collection and reuse of genomic_data as well as broad efforts to obtain larger_sample by sharing and combing data for increased statistical_power meta_analysis is a common solution for aggregating substudy results across large consortia to achieve_this in fact meta_analysis is responsible for of the genometrait associations listed in the nhgri genome_wide gwas catalog at the same time the sensitive nature of genomic_data has led to numerous discussions around the governance of genomic records currently policy and advisory groups recommend removing identifying information e g personal names to uphold the privacy of study participants presidential commission for the study of bioethical yet the efficacy of such protections is increasingly being questioned various studies demonstrate that the identity of participants as well as sensitive information such as disease status can still be inferred from the shared genomic_data this can occur by leveraging an individuals genome_sequence or the study summary_statistics about associations such as genotype_frequencies and allelic regression_coefficients that would be used in meta_analysis most recently it was shown that an individuals identity could be ascertained through y chromosome short_tandem y strs using public genealogy databases on the internet while certain privacy attacks may seem non trivial in the knowledge necessary to be executed they have already raised serious concerns from scientists policy_makers and the general public they have also led to reduced sharing of genome_sequences and site level summary_statistics for instance based on the nih and wellcome_trust stopped sharing aggregate genomic_data directly to the public these demonstrations have also influenced proposed regulations e g some of which would designate all biospecimens and their derived data as identifiable u s department h h s to address the privacy_concerns on individual genomic_information as well as site level summary_statistics we engineered a practical protocol to securely perform meta_analysis for genotypephenotype association studies across substudy sites in large consortia our protocol leverages cryptographically secure technology to provide provable security guarantees unlike alternative proposals in our protocol substudy sites retain full control of their respective individual participants data and local site analyses this allows each site to make appropriate adjustments to effect_estimates to account for to whom correspondence should be addressed study specific differences in design which is pervasive in multisite studies but not supported in our protocol also allows sites to contribute to meta_analysis without exposing site level summary_statistics such comprehensive protections make our protocol impervious to popular privacy attacks over genomic_data at both the individual and site level in this article we demonstrate the design and implementation of our secure meta_analysis protocol called securema and provide empirical evaluations with three separate multisite genetic_association this work illustrates that the privacy of individual participants and site level summary_statistics in genetic_association meta_analysis can be guaranteed without sacrificing the ability to perform analysis that use shared data our proposal securema is useful for running joint studies over disparate data sites in large consortia where privacy or confidentiality is a concern if appropriately implemented our approach can prevent privacy intrusions posed by the attacks published to date while there are opportunities to make this protocol more efficient and to incorporate quality_control measures we believe it is possible to enable much broader analytic access to genomic_data for the purposes of effect estimation and statistical_association via meta_analysis
