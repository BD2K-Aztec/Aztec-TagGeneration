systems_biology contextual analysis of rnai based functional screens using interaction networks motivation considerable attention has been directed in recent_years toward the development of methods for the contextual analysis of expression data using interaction networks of particular interest has been the identification of active subnetworks by detecting regions enriched with differential_expression in contrast however very little effort has been made toward the application of comparable methods to other types of high_throughput data results here we propose a new method based on co clustering that is specifically_designed for the exploratory_analysis of large_scale rnai based functional screens we demonstrate our approach by applying it to a genome_scale dataset aimed at identifying host_factors of the human pathogen hepatitis_c hcv in addition to recovering known cellular modules relevant to hcv_infection the results enabled us to identify new candidates and formulate biological_hypotheses regarding possible roles and mechanisms for a number of them for example our analysis indicated that hcv similar to other enveloped_viruses exploits elements within the endosomal pathway in order to acquire a membrane and facilitate assembly and release this echoed a number of recent_studies which showed that the escrt iii complex is essential to productive_infection contact an important challenge in the analysis of high_throughput datasets such as transcriptomic and proteomic_data is the integration of prior_knowledge in their interpretation one class of methods that has arisen to address this challenge is gene_set gsa motivated by the increasing body of evidence that cellular_responses are usually organized into pathways or active modules gsa methods try to assess the overall association between the phenotype of interest and known groupings of genes by comparing the latter with the data although hugely successful as evidenced by a large body of literature gsa suffers from a number of drawbacks probably foremost of these and somewhat ironic is its reliance on predetermined gene_sets as a consequence of this dependency gsa cannot be expected to whom correspondence should be addressed to discover novel pathways in addition with few exceptions see gsa algorithms treat pathways simply as sets i e they completely ignore information on the individual interactions between entities e g topology such information could potentially also be of use to complement the shortcomings of gsa methods that try to more generally integrate interaction with expression data outside the scope of canonical pathways have emerged we collectively refer to these as significant area search sigarsearch methods one of the earliest of these was the co clustering approach by in their paper they proposed to cluster genes based on a distance_function that integrated measures of both expression correlation and interaction_network proximity almost at the same time presented a method that framed the contextual interpretation task as an optimization_problem specifically they defined a scoring_function on subnetworks based on the data values of the genes included in a subgraphand employed a search algorithm to find high_scoring regions because the underlying combinatorial problem i e that of finding the maximal scoring connected subgraph with additive scores defined on the vertices was proven to be np_hard the authors proposed a heuristic strategy based on simulated_annealing similar to gsa the interpretative power of sigarsearch is also limited by the scope of the background_knowledge information that is used i e the interaction_network however a key difference between the two paradigms exists owing to the different roles that gene groups play in them whereas gsa requires that these be specified beforehand sigarsearch actually tries to infer such modular relationships between genes directly at least the ones relevant to the current expression data subject to the binary relations encoded in the network thus sigarsearch is potentially able to discover new groupings which could for example correspond to uncharacterized protein_complexes or pathways this capability is particularly relevant if the background network used consists of or includes interactions taken from unbiased large_scale interaction screens e g using y h or tap ms see shoemaker and panchenko for a review of such methods the optimization framework introduced byfor sigarsearch later inspired the development of several improvements for example a number of groups proposed the use of alternative heuristic search_strategies such as the greedy approaches of others proposed extensions to the scoring system such as including scores defined on the edges interactions instead of just the vertices genes subsequently pointed_out that the existing_methods based on the optimization framework
