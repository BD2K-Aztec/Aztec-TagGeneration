data_and netpathminer r bioconductor_package for network path mining through gene_expression netpathminer is a general framework for mining from genome_scale networks paths that are related to specific experimental_conditions netpathminer interfaces with various input_formats including kgml sbml and biopax files and allows for manipulation of networks in three different forms metabolic reaction and gene representations netpathminer ranks the obtained paths and applies markov model_based and classification methods to the ranked paths for easy interpretation netpathminer also provides static and interactive_visualizations of networks and paths to aid manual investigation availability the package is available through bioconductor and from github atmining subnetworks from genome_scale biological_networks is an important step in biological data analysis because as their size and complexity increase manual_analysis becomes infeasible various methods for subnetwork mining from experimental_data are available where output subnetworks are expressed as sets of nodes frequent subgraphs or linear paths we focus on linear paths which are particularly useful by carrying an intuitive meaning as in metabolic reaction paths and signaling_cascades currently software for mining paths from networks is hampered by two main challenges i the lack of a universal parsing tool for different pathway types and database file_formats in fact pathways can be diverse such as metabolic or signaling representing chemical conversions or protein interactions respectively also pathway_information in databases can be accessed through different file_formats with each format representing pathway structure and annotation differently ii the lack of effective visualizations for a different network types and b up to thousands of paths currently available tools are either specific to particular pathway types or file_formats an earlier approach pathranker is limited to mining paths from metabolic_networks constructed from kgml files providing static visualization on one network representation only tools like pathview and rbiopaxparser also construct networks from only one file_format we present netpathminer an r package to overcome the two main challenges describes the process flow implemented in our package see next section and supplementary_materials for details netpathminer implements a flexible module based process flow for network path mining and visualization which can be fully integrated with user customized functions netpathminer enables fast processing for all kgml sbml and biopax formats into genome_scale or signaling_networks see supplementary figures s and s in detail netpathminer also provides path highlighting over three different representations and interactive_visualizations making the analysis of even thousands of output paths possible we present netpathminer an easy to use r package for network path mining netpathminer constructs genome_scale networks from kgml sbml and biopax files overcoming the limitations of current_tools netpathminer summarizes output paths using machine_learning and provides different visualizations easing manual investigations all modules in netpathminer can be used independently particularly the pathway file processing module and replaced with user customized modules future_developments include supporting other network representations such as rule_based modeling formats as inputs and outputs for broader integration rows and their reactions columns e probability that a top path belongs to a cluster
