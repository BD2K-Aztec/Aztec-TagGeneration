bioimage_informatics cellh a format for data_exchange in high_content high_throughput microscopy data require a diversity of analytical_approaches however the construction of workflows that use algorithms from different software_packages is difficult owing to a lack of interoperability to overcome_this we present cellh an hdf data format for cell_based in high_throughput microscopy which stores high_dimensional image data along with inter object_relations in graphs cellh browser an interactive gallery image browser demonstrates the versatility and performance of the file_format on live_imaging data of dividing human cells cellh provides new opportunities for integrated data analysis by multiple software platforms availability source_code is freely_available at www github com cellh under the gpl license and at www bioconductor org_packages release bioc html rhdf html under the artistic license demo data_sets and the cellh browser are available at www cellh org a fiji importer for cellh will be released soon recent advancements in microscope automation enable highcontent screening at unprecedented throughput and spatio temporal_resolution cell_based typically involve segmentation of individual objects cells within the imaging field followed by quantification of cell morphologies powerful algorithms have been developed for learning based_segmentation and quantification and classification of cell morphologies application of any of these methods to large_scale biological data requires sophisticated workflow management and efficient batch processing for which different software platforms have been developed in practice the analysis often asks for the combination of methods that are available in distinct software platforms integration by re implementation into a single_platform is inefficient and error_prone a preferable approach is integration by interoperability of tools here we propose a versatile data format for serialization disk based storage and exchange of high_content data and processing results this provides a flexible and sustainable solution for the development of integrated analysis_pipelines based on multiple software platforms to facilitate the exchange of microscopy image data the open microscopy environment project ome has developed a standardized file_format ome tiff which can store raw microscopy_images along with experimental meta_information supplementary semantically typed data hypercubes have been proposed to store multi_dimensional high_content data in a hierarchical fashion based on extensible markup_language and the hdf data model which is optimized for efficient storage and rapid access of large_scale multi_dimensional data however complex object relationships as for example lineage trees of dividing cell_populations that can comprise millions of cell objects cannot be efficiently processed when stored in textual data_formats such as extensible markup_language used in ometiff and semantically typed data hypercubes object_relations are represented by network graphs following standard formats such as graphml and graphviz these text_based formats however are designed mainly for visualization of graphs and cannot be efficiently enriched with high_dimensional binary_data an integrated data format representing both machine_readable graph structures and multivariate object features has not been reported in the field of bioimaging with cellh we introduce an efficient mechanism representing both object_relations in graphs along with high_dimensional object data
