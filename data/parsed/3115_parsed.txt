msaviewer interactive javascript visualization of multiple_sequence the msaviewer is a quick and easy visualization and analysis javascript component for multiple_sequence data of any size core_features include interactive navigation through the alignment application of popular color schemes sorting selecting and filtering the msaviewer is web ready written entirely in javascript compatible with modern web_browsers and does not require any specialized software the msaviewer is part of the biojs collection of components availability_and the msaviewer is released as open_source under the boost software license documentation source_code and the viewer are available at http msa biojs net multiple_sequence msa is a fundamental procedure to capture similarities between sequences of nucleotides dna rna or of amino_acids protein biologically_meaningful msas highlight and capture sites with significant evolutionary_conservation msas are essential to predict aspects of protein_structure e g secondary_structure or protein disorder and function e g binding_sites or localization msas can be used to understand genomic_rearrangements to derive sequence_homology and to identify evolutionary_rates msas are widely used to display complex annotations relating to structure and function and to transfer those annotations to sequences that lack annotations many tools are available to view and analyze msas including standalone applications and web applets with the recent widespread_adoption of javascript as the leading programming_language for interactive web_applications new msa viewing tools compatible with modern web_browsers have been developed and made available biojs is one particular collection of javascript components with growing applications in biology it is interoperable with many other data visualization_tools here we describe the biojs msaviewer it is readily loaded into web_pages to visualize and analyze msa datasets of arbitrary sizes msaviewer implements most features commonly available in other popular msa viewing software including scrolling selecting highlighting cross_referencing with protein feature annotations and phylogenetic_trees a detailed comparison of features is in supplementary table s percentage sequence_identities relative to consensus consensus_sequence not shown are listed for each sequence filled red rectangles indicate sequence annotations provided by the user here secondary_structure of predictprotein red frames indicated by two black arrows are clusters of residues of ebolavirus vp responsible for binding to karyopherin alpha nuclear transporters to suppress antiviral_defense mechanism in human d a compact overview msa showing a birds eye view of the full alignment yellow rectangles are two highlighted clusters in the main msa panel despite the overall sequence_homology the highlighted regions in ebolavirus ebov proteins binding karyoprotein differ from those in llovu cuevavirus llov and lake victoria marburgvirus marv marv is known to not suppress hosts antiviral_defense mechanism though no experimental information on binding of llov vp to karyoproteins is available to date the comparison of its sequence and structural_features suggests a mechanism that is more similar to ebov than to marv
