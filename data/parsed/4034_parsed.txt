rna rocket an rna_seq analysis resource for infectious_disease research downloaded from motivation rna_seq is a method for profiling transcription using high_throughput and is an important component of many research_projects that wish to study transcript_isoforms condition specific expression and transcriptional structure the methods tools and technologies used to perform rna_seq analysis continue to change creating a bioinformatics challenge for researchers who wish to exploit these data resources that bring together genomic_data analysis tools educational material and computational infrastructure can minimize the overhead required of life_science researchers results rna rocket is a free service that provides access to rna_seq and chip_seq analysis tools for studying infectious_diseases the site makes available thousands of pre indexed genomes their annotations and the ability to stream results to the bioinformatics resources vectorbase eupathdb and patric the site also provides a combination of experimental_data and metadata examples of pre_computed analysis step_by guides and a user_interface designed to enable both novice and experienced users of rna_seq availability_and rna rocket is available at rnaseq pathogenportal org source_code for this project can be found at github com cidvbi pathogenportal transcriptomic_analysis using high_throughput continues to increase in popularity due to low sequencing_costs its sensitivity reproducibility and its ability to sample the entire transcriptome as an active area of research there are many variations of rna_seq protocols data types and tools that continue to evolve as a result there is no one size fits all solution for doing rna_seq analysis the range of considerations facing life_scientists who want to leverage this technology can demand significant investment of time and resources for this reason we have created rna rocket an rna_seq analysis service that enables infectious_disease research for prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens as well as vectors and host genomes rna rocket is built on galaxy with modifications to help simplify the process for routine use and provide a guided user experience rna rocket integrates data from the patric eupathdb and vectorbase bioinformatics resource centers brcs and is provided by pathogen portal pathogenportal org a resource linking all brcs funded by the national_institute of allergy and infectious_diseases niaid the rna rocket service leverages multiple open_source software_tools to provide a free resource where users can upload their rna_seq align them against a genome and generate quantitative transcript profiles this service also provides streaming of alignment and annotation results back to the appropriate brc so that users can view results in the relevant brc using annotations and tools provided in support of transcriptomic_analysis the pathosystems resource integration center patric is the all bacteria bioinformatics resource center patricbrc org patric provides researchers with an online resource that stores and integrates a variety of data types e g genomics transcriptomics protein_protein d protein_structures and sequence typing data along with any associated metadata the eukaryotic pathogen databases eupathdb eupathdb org provide access to a variety of data types from important human and veterinary parasites such as plasmodium malaria cryptosporidium cryptosporidiosis and kinetoplastida i e trypanosoma_brucei and leishmania_species vectorbase vectorbase org is a bioinformatics resource for invertebrate vectors of human parasites and pathogens it currently hosts the genomes of organisms including mosquitoes of which are anopheles species tsetse flies ticks lice kissing bugs and sandflies the rna rocket project modifies the existing galaxy code so that galaxy workflows can be constructed in advance by system administrators and shared to users through a tiered menu system this menu system referred to as launch pad organizes rna_seq processing_steps conceptually and gives increasing detail as the user progress towards launching a job i e an analysis step this system also asks the user to populate their project space known as a history in galaxy terms with the necessary files before attempting to configure the parameters for their job this is designed to minimize confusion when attempting to setup an analysis and promote organization for projects involving many files and processing_steps using the workflow system rna rocket provides pre formulated solutions for common problems that users encounter these workflows are easily adapted to new tools and are publicly_available for download to enable offline analysis and customization for researchers rna rocket provides example data from each of the brc projects so that users can familiarize themselves with the site using real_data some of these data are provided through the driving biological project dbp initiative research_projects competitively enabled through niaids brc program designed to drive innovation at the brc sites based on the needs of the research_community each dataset is provided as both before and after project spaces so that users can import the project into their own user space run their own analysis and view pre_existing results see the supplementary_material for more details on this data by combining experimental concepts with file based requirements the user_interface aims to guide life_science researchers through the process of rna_seq while making them aware of quality_control caveats after results have been computed at the rna rocket site they can be streamed back to the respective brc depending on the reference organism selected for analysis this provides users with the ability to process and analyze their rna_seq remotely without having to download potentially large files to their own computer rna rocket is a free service that can be used by life_science researchers to process and analyze their rna_seq the site maintains up to date genome and annotation data through niads bioinformatic resource centers by leveraging brc data and the galaxy system the rna rocket project can provide up to date tools and capability despite the rapidly_changing landscape of rna_seq analysis
