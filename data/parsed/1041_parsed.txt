coma server for protein distant homology_search detection of distant homology is a widely used computational_approach for studying protein evolution structure and function here we report a homology_search web_server based on sequence profileprofile comparison the user may perform searches in one of several regularly updated profile databases using either a single_sequence or a multiple_sequence as an input the same profile databases can also be downloaded for local use the capabilities of the server are illustrated with the identification of new members of the highly_diverse pd d e xk nuclease superfamily the concept of homology common evolutionary origin is at the heart of most studies dealing with protein_sequence structure and function in the absence of protein_structure inference of homology usually has to rely exclusively on sequence_data at present most sensitive sequence_based use comparison of multiple_sequence msa represented as either hidden_markov or sequence_profiles new sequencebased methods may help in revealing previously_unappreciated evolutionary_relationships even for proteins with known structures with the goal of improving distant homology detection we have recently_developed a new method coma comparison of multiple_alignments based on sequence profileprofile comparison the new method has at least two major features distinguishing it from other profileprofile comparison methods the first feature is position specific variable gap penalties that are more biologically_relevant than the fixed ones the second one is a global_score system leading to improved estimation of statistical_significance of detected similarities the standalone software implementing the coma method provides all the tools necessary for profile search and construction of custom profile databases making it suitable for large_scale studies however the use of standalone tools requires a certain level of expertise and substantial computer resources thus to make this method accessible for larger biological community we have developed a web_server the server is based on the latest_version of the coma algorithm which is almost fold faster than the to whom correspondence should be addressed original one without sacrifice in sensitivity this has been achieved by the introduction of simple heuristics to filter out clearly random matches by requiring several high_scoring segments on the same diagonal of the dynamic_programming matrix the server includes a number of add ons for easier analysis and interpretation of homology_search results such as merging alignments of multiple hits and structure modeling the portability of the standalone software has also been improved by changing representation of profile databases from binary to the text format thus the regularly updated server profile databases can be downloaded and used locally on different platforms here we describe major features of the coma server and provide an example of its use for uncovering distant homology
