systems_biology optimal metabolic route search based on atom mappings motivation a key computational_problem in metabolic_engineering is finding efficient metabolic routes from a source to a target_compound in genome_scale reaction_networks potentially considering the addition of new reactions efficiency can be based on many factors such as route lengths atoms conserved and the number of new reactions and the new enzymes to catalyze them added to the route fast algorithms are needed to systematically search these large genome_scale reaction_networks results we present the algorithm used in the new routesearch tool within the pathway tools software this algorithm is based on a general branch and bound search and involves constructing a network of atom mappings to facilitate efficient searching as far as we know it is the first published algorithm that finds guaranteed optimal routes where atom conservation is part of the optimality criteria routesearch includes a graphical_user that speeds user understanding of its search results we evaluated the algorithm on five example metabolic_engineering problems from the literature for one problem the published solution was equivalent to the optimal route found by routesearch for the remaining four problems routesearch found the published solution as one of its best scored solutions these problems were each solved in less than s of computational time availability_and routesearch is accessible at biocyc org by using the menu command metabolism metabolic routesearch and by downloading pathway tools pathway tools software is freely_available to academic users and for a fee to commercial users download from http biocyc org metabolic engineers seek to modify the metabolic_network of an organism to efficiently produce novel chemical products with applications including the production of biofuels and specialized chemicals the space of potential modifications is a large one given that metabolic databases such as metacyc and kegg contain thousands of enzyme_catalyzed that could be engineered into an organism how do we balance the cost of engineering the organism against the efficiency of the resulting pathways the methods we present assume that the users begin with a source feedstock compound and a target product compound and that they aim to find the optimal metabolic routes that connect those compounds within a genome_scale reaction_network the methods further assume that the reaction_network is annotated with atom mappings which describe the path of each atom in a metabolic reaction from a reactant compound to a product compound the methods allow the starting reaction_network of the organism to be supplemented with additional reactions from an external reaction library which for our routesearch program is the metacyc database routesearch searches for multiple optimal routes where optimality is essentially based on minimizing the number of native reactions of the route the number of non native reactions introduced in the route from the external library and the number of atoms lost from the start compound to the target_compound according to the atom mappings of the reactions we believe that these optimality criteria in particular reducing the loss of atoms from the start compound to the target_compound are likely to provide good route candidates for metabolic_engineering routesearch can also aid scientists in solving a simpler problem than the engineering of new metabolic routes namely the understanding of metabolic routes in existing metabolic_networks scientists want to explore alternative routes within an organisms natural metabolic_network for transforming a given starting compound into a product compound we present the algorithm used by the web based_interactive tool routesearch to find optimal metabolic routes optimality is based on the number of reactions used the provenance of the reactions natural or engineered and the atoms conserved by the route from the source compound to the target_compound as far as we know it is the first published exact algorithm that guarantees optimality of the routes found based in part on the number of atoms conserved from the source to the target_compound routesearch is implemented in common lisp and is available at the biocyc org web_site for any of the organism specific metabolic_networks within biocyc by using the menu bar command metabolism metabolic routesearch but without use of an external reaction library metacyc can be used as the reaction library by downloading pathway tools and running it as a local web_server sections and present the routesearch search algorithm which is based on the branch and bound algorithm applied to a precompiled metabolic_network graph that we call a mapped network the efficiency of the algorithm is discussed as is its method of using atom mappings to trace atoms conserved in metabolic routes the atom mapping data used were to whom correspondence should be addressed computed by a technique presented inand applied to the metacyc multi organism database version to produce atom mappings for biochemical_reactions these atom mappings are used for all other databases available at the biocyc org web_site section_describes the routesearch graphical_interface which allows users to specify and control routesearch searches and speeds user understanding of the paths found by routesearch including the atoms that are conserved from source to target_compound section_presents an empirical validation of routesearch on five example metabolic_engineering problems from the literature for three problems the published solution was equivalent to the optimal route found by routesearch for the remaining two problems the published solution was found by routesearch but was not the optimal_solution section compares routesearch with previous work on metabolic route searching algorithms for efficiency the metabolic route searches are done on mapped networks that are constructed using compounds reactions and atom mappings their construction is explained in the following section
