sequence_analysis improving snp discovery by base alignment_quality i propose a new application of profile_hidden in the area of snp discovery from resequencing data to greatly reduce false snp calls caused by misalignments around insertions_and indels the central concept is per base alignment_quality which accurately measures the probability of a read base being wrongly aligned the effectiveness of baq has been positively confirmed on large_datasets by the genomes_project analysis subgroup availability one of the leading sources of errors in snp discovery is errors caused by indels current solutions include realignment and filtering snps around predicted indels however realignment is computationally_intensive filtering snps around predicted indels is hampered by indel discovery which itself is a harder problem this article aims to provide an effective and efficient solution to sorting out snps caused by misalignments to begin with we need to make a distinction between read_mapping and read_alignment which are often taken as synonymous i define the alignment of a read as the set of coordinate pairs of read and reference bases that are placed together while define the mapping of a read as the coordinate interval between the first and the last reference bases inclusive in the alignment we say an alignment is correct if all bases are aligned correctly and say a mapping is correct if it overlaps the true mapping therefore an alignment can be wrong even if the underlying mapping is correct wrong alignments are mostly caused by the ambiguity in the presence of indels when we are unsure whether differences should be explained by mismatches or by indels they tend to reoccur in the same context and deceive snp callers into calling false snps to account for the intrinsic alignment ambiguity i model the read_alignment with a profile hmm and compute a per base alignment_quality baq to directly evaluate the probability of misalignment of each base i will show that by replacing the original base_quality with the minimum between the base_quality and baq we can dramatically improve the snp accuracy
