databases_and adme sarfari comparative_genomics of drug_metabolizing systems motivation adme sarfari is a freely_available web_resource that enables comparative_analyses of drug_disposition genes it does so by integrating a number of publicly_available data_sources which have subsequently been used to build data_mining services predictive tools and visualizations for drug_metabolism researchers the data include the interactions of small_molecules with adme ab sorption distribution metabolism and excretion proteins responsible for the metabolism and transport of molecules available pharmacokinetic pk data protein_sequences of adme related molecular_targets for pre clinical model species and human alignments of the orthologues including information on known snps single_nucleotide and information on the tissue_distribution of these proteins in addition in silico models have been developed which enable users to predict which adme relevant protein targets a novel compound is likely to interact with the aim of drug_discovery is to design and deliver a potential therapeutic_agent not only efficacious for the chosen disease but also with an acceptable dosage and safety_profile it is important to understand how a drugs disposition and its interaction with drugmetabolizing enzymes and transporters in pre clinical species are likely to translate to humans this could contribute to a more refined means of predicting human systemic_exposure and any adverse_events such as drugdrug_interactions or tissue_specific toxicities arising from the species specific disposition of the drug_molecule and or its metabolites there are a large number of examples where expensive clinical drug_development programs had to be terminated due to an unfavourable pk profile for example in the literature there is evidence on several drug_candidates that are metabolized by aldehyde_oxidase aox e g where large species differences in gene structure and regulation have led to wide variance of exposure and consequently efficacy and safety between species currently identifying and integrating adme absorption distribution metabolism and excretion related data in a consistent way to aid species pk investigations is not a trivial process for this reason we have developed a new computational system called adme sarfari which integrates genetic proteomic phenotypic and molecule interaction data and offers the potential of becoming a resource for community adme data_exchange and re use the primary data source for interaction and pharmacokinetic pk data is the chembl database to broaden the scope and analytical power of adme sarfari we have included data from resources such as pharmaadme http www pharmaadme the adme sarfari interface presents the user with a series of sections which correspond to the different datasets parsed and loaded into the adme sarfari system the different sections are homepage orthologues tissues bioactivities molecules pharmacokinetics and about as well as being able to generate complex workflows which can help answer adme related_questions the user is free to browse and export data from the systems various sections without needing to run a pre_emptive search
