gene_expression molecular causes of transcriptional_response a bayesian prior_knowledge approach_motivation the abundance of many transcripts changes significantly in response to a variety of molecular and environmental_perturbations a key_question in this setting is as follows what intermediate molecular perturbations gave rise to the observed transcriptional changes regulatory programs are not exclusively governed by transcriptional changes but also by protein_abundance and post_translational making direct causal_inference from data difficult however biomedical_research over the last decades has uncovered a plethora of causal signaling_cascades that can be used to identify good candidates explaining a specific set of transcriptional changes methods we take a bayesian_approach to integrate gene_expression with a causal graph of molecular_interactions constructed from prior_biological in addition we define the biological_context of a specific interaction by the corresponding medical_subject terms the bayesian_network can be queried to suggest upstream_regulators that can be causally_linked to the altered expression_profile results our approach will treat candidate regulators in the right biological_context preferentially enables hierarchical exploration of resulting hypotheses and takes the complete network of causal_relationships into account to arrive at the best set of upstream_regulators we demonstrate the power of our method on distinct biological_datasets namely response to dexamethasone treatment stem_cell and a neuropathic_pain model in all cases relevant biological_insights could be validated availability_and source_code for the method is available upon request the abundance of many transcripts changes significantly in response to a variety of molecular and environmental_perturbations to understand the details of the transcriptional_response it is often useful to annotate the biological_function of the changed transcripts using gene_set enrichment_methods ackermann and strimmer give a comprehensive_overview andprovide a recent performance assessment of many methods however a key_question often remains what intermediate molecular perturbations gave rise to the observed transcriptional changes the situation is complicated by the fact that regulatory programs are not necessarily governed by transcriptional changes but also by protein_abundance and post_translational as changes beyond the transcriptional level are rarely measured direct inference of causal_relationships is difficult and an active field of research a number of statistical and network_reconstruction methods have been used to identify potential gene_regulatory directly from the gene_expression and large_scale datasets although these methods demonstrate great_potential for deciphering mechanisms of regulation they require a large number of expression_profiles and genetic data moreover determining the sign and direction of the causality can be challenging over the last decades biomedical_research has uncovered a plethora of causal signaling_cascades such prior_knowledge can be used to identify good candidates to explain a specific set of transcriptional changes and point to others that cannot be explained satisfactorily by current knowledge the use of prior network or pathway_knowledge has_received in recent_years emmert streib andprovide a recent review more closely_related to our method developed an approach based on reasoning on structured collection of causal_relationships to analyze the most likely regulators of expression changes derived from type_diabetes patients and recovered known key_genes in diabetes and proposed new regulators constructed a causal graph from a set of causal_relationships extracted from the biomedical_literature and introduced a scoring_scheme to identify putative upstream_regulators for any given input dataset based on the set of causal_relationships encoded as the causal graph essentially for each putative upstream_regulator the method makes predictions of the downstream transcriptional effects upregulation or downregulation using the causal_relationships the predictions are then compared with the observed data and based on the number of correct and incorrect predictions a score is assigned to the upstream to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com regulator the statistical_significance of the scores is measured using an analog of the fishers_exact although this method is able to distinguish the upstream_regulator whose associated transcripts have significantly different distribution form the background it does not take the full topology of the network into consideration more precisely each regulator is considered in isolation and the joint_distribution of the network is not taken into consideration moreover the model makes no assumption on the applicability of the causal_relations in the context under which the experiment is performed in this work we construct a bayesian_network from the same knowledgebase as in consisting of a set of nearly causal_relations extracted from nearly peer_review pubmed full articles the bayesian_network can be queried to suggest upstream_regulators hypotheses that can be causally_linked to the altered expression_profile in a manner that takes the entire topology of the network as well as the context under which the experiment is performed into consideration the noise in the observation is also taken into consideration directly most methods integrating network data into the analysis process differ in at least one key point from our bayesian_approach namely i the use of non causal non signed proteinprotein_interaction ii the use of non bayesian approaches iii a focus on identifying active subnetworks or enriched_gene but not the contextual prediction of upstream_regulators active in a given experiment a potential problem with our and related approaches is the availability of a suitable knowledgebase of causal_relationships fortunately public_repositories are starting to appear for our purposes the openbel portal www openbel org is the most relevant example it provides an open_source framework to specify parse and manipulate causal_relationships and also offers a test corpus under a creative commons license of causal statements manually extracted from pubmed articles the biological examples in this work rely on a licensed extended knowledgebase from commercial vendors i e ingenuity www ingenuity com and selventa www selventa com that consists of about statements selventa makes a subset of their knowledge_base available at the openbel site in this article we present a bayesian methodology capable of identifying specific plausible and testable biological hypothesis consistent with the observed gene_expression data we do this by reasoning over a massive knowledge_base of prior_biological extracted from the literature our method is an extension of the approach developed by there the statistical_significance of upstream_regulators is tested in isolation i e the existence of alternative regulators is not taken into consideration when assessing the significance our method generalizes this by constructing a bayesian_network from the knowledge_base and considering the joint probability_distribution of the possible molecular drivers of the observed expression_profile see_supplementary for benchmark results additionally our new method models the context of the experiment by introducing the enriched mesh_terms of the network of differentially_expressed as nodes in the bayesian_network this will significantly remove the noise and redundancy in the network in conclusion we find that our new method is well able to identify the key_regulators in simulated and actual biological data the nature of the output is well suited for the direct proposal of novel testable_hypotheses such as a role for il of endocrine pancreas_development or the causal aspect of ifng in a system as noisy as a surgical in vivo model of pain we are currently pursuing an extension of our method that will integrate higher_level causal drivers in the network finally our method provides a natural framework for integrating omic scale dataset with prior_biological to identify concise coherent and testable biological hypothesis
