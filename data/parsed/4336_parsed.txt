sorting the nuclear proteome motivation quantitative experimental analyses of the nuclear interior reveal a morphologically structured yet dynamic mix of membraneless compartments major nuclear events depend on the functional_integrity and timely assembly of these intra nuclear compartments yet unknown drivers of protein mobility ensure that they are in the right place at the time when they are needed results this study_investigates determinants of associations between eight intra nuclear compartments and their proteins in heterogeneous genome_wide data we develop a model based on a range of candidate determinants capable of mapping the intra nuclear organization of proteins the model integrates protein interactions protein_domains post_translational modification_sites and protein sequence_data the predictions of our model are accurate with a mean auc over all compartments of we present a complete map of the association of mouse nuclear_proteins with intra nuclear compartments each decision is explained in terms of essential interactions and domains and qualified with a false discovery assessment using this resource we uncover the collective role of transcription_factors in each of the compartments we create diagrams illustrating the outcomes of a gene_ontology associated with an extensive range of transcription_factors the analysis suggests that pml_bodies coordinate regulatory immune_responses the cell_nucleus has morphologically_distinct sub compartments however unlike cytoplasmic_organelles the sub compartments within the nucleus are not membrane enclosed but rather are formed via recruitment of proteins rna and dna the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into the nucleus and their subsequent association with its sub compartments represent two distinct levels of cellular_regulation at the first level nuclear_import and export of proteins is largely governed by the nuclearmembrane associated nuclear_pore npc along with a set of proteins that recognize and actively assist cargo_proteins the import signals used by cargo_proteins to bind with carrier_proteins were recently extensively explored and modelled in contrast at the second level of regulation the to whom correspondence should be addressed mechanisms_underpinning the sorting of proteins into intra nuclear compartments are not well understood the continuous flux of proteins into and out of the nucleus as well as among intra nuclear compartments underpins central events such as dna_replication mrna_processing and ribosome_biogenesis hence to understand these events we need to fully appreciate the mechanisms of intra nuclear trafficking we are now at a stage when we have access to experimental_evidence of abundance localization and modification on a proteomic scale however the information offered by many high_throughput techniques does not illustrate the functional purpose of nuclear_proteins and compartment structures computational modelling on the other hand may be able to elucidate functional_roles not captured by any individual existing experimental technology when attempting to gain insight into the underlying_mechanisms of translocation the ability of a model to provide explanations for its predictions is as important as the predictions accuracy several predictors have been reported that evaluate the tendency of a protein to associate with a nuclear compartment however these predictors do not provide clear information as to what factors influence these predictions additionally most models are not designed to incorporate any of the constraints that are fundamental to translocation existing predictors do not recognize that proteins can associate transiently with several compartments at different stages or that molecular_interaction is a prime means of establishing and retaining such associations instead the output of these predictors may be influenced by broad sequence_similarity lacking specific detail of any underlying cause this study explores determinants of intra nuclear compartment association in heterogeneous genome_wide data and develops a model capable of mapping the intra nuclear organization of proteins we use this model to predict the association of the mouse proteome with different intra nuclear compartments we also portray transcription_factors in terms of how they associate with nuclear architecture to impart novel insights about their spatial synergy we assign functional_roles to individual compartments via their constituent regulatory_proteins using over represented gene_ontology go terms in shared target_genes we introduce a computational_model that integrates evidence garnered from protein interaction domain and post_translational data to systematically address fundamental_questions of nuclear compartment localization we use a bayesian_network a probabilistic and transparent modelling framework whose decisions can clearly be traced back to the influence of the provided biological_features after carefully designing and training our model we identify and make available the determinants of intra nuclear compartment association of the full mouse nuclear proteome the model_predicts intra nuclear compartment associations of each protein with an accuracy substantially above chance auc is and indicates the individual_factors that influence its decisions the mobility of a nuclear protein is typically determined by its interaction with other nuclear components and is often modulated by post_translational including sumoylation we also note that specific functional_domains are sometimes enriched in compartments and can be used to determine likely associations this work presents a unique intra nuclear protein association map involving all the main compartments for mouse proteins and provides detailed justifications for each individual prediction this resource will enable cell biologists to effectively investigate what compartments a protein of interest is likely to associate with and identify the factors including interactions and domain features that modulate this sorting or at least unify proteins from the same compartment whether nuclear compartments in general fill a regulatory_role remains an open questionbut our analyses lend significant support to the idea that pml_bodies and chromatin are implicated in regulatory_processes we offer an analysis that is not simply based on individual tfs but one that groups them according to compartment association to identify their downstream_targets we publish detailed gene_ontology diagrams for each compartment that will allow biologists to investigate the statistical support for any regulatory_function and to guide targeted experimentation shows the prediction_accuracy for
