network orientation via shortest_paths the graph orientation problem calls for orienting the edges of a graph so as to maximize the number of pre specified sourcetarget vertex pairs that admit a directed path from the source to the target most algorith mic approaches to this problem share a common preprocessing_step in which the input graph is reduced to a tree by repeatedly contracting its cycles although this reduction is valid from an algorithmic perspective the assignment of directions to the edges of the contracted cycles becomes arbitrary and the connecting sourcetarget paths may be arbitrarily long in the context of biological_networks the connection of vertex pairs via shortest_paths is highly motivated leading to the following problem variant given a graph and a collection of sourcetarget vertex pairs assign directions to the edges so as to maximize the number of pairs that are connected by a shortest in the original graph directed path this problem is np complete and hard to approximate to within sub polynomial factors here we provide a first polynomial size integer_linear formulation for this problem which allows its exact solution in seconds on current networks we apply our algorithm to orient proteinprotein_interaction in yeast and compare it with two state of the art algorithms we find that our algorithm outperforms previous_approaches and can orient considerable parts of the network thus revealing its structure and function availability_and the source_code is available atproteinprotein interactions ppis form the skeleton of signal_transduction in the cell although many of these interactions carry directed signaling information current ppi measurement technologies such as yeast_two and coimmunoprecipitation reveal the presence of a signal flow but not of its directionality identifying this directionality is fundamental to our understanding of how signaling_networks function although some interactions are naturally directed such as kinasesubstrate and phosphatasesubstrate interactions kpis the directions of the vast_majority of ppis remain_unknown from a theoretical point_of graph orientation problems have been studied by several authors in the following we emphasize algorithmic results pertaining to mixed graphs i e graphs with both directed and undirected edges which are the focus of this work showed that the problem of orienting a mixed graph so that it admits directed paths for a given set of sourcetarget vertex pairs is np complete showed that the corresponding maximization problem is np_hard to approximate to within a factor of and provided a sublinear approximation for it recently studied the problem of orienting the edges of an undirected graph so as to maximize the number of pre specified sourcetarget pairs that admit a directed shortest_path between them i e a directed path whose length is equal to the distance between them in the unoriented graph they showed that for an undirected graph with a vertex set of size n edge set of size m and p source target pairs the problem is np_hard to approximate within factors of op and om for any fixed and provided an approximation algorithm with a factor of omaxfn pg ffiffi p for the k length bounded orientations in a weighted undirected graph which aims to maximize the weight of all satisfied paths between sources and targets with length at most k showed that while the resulting problem is np_hard it can still be approximated to within a factor o k k in the biological domain previous work to infer interaction directionality has mostly used unsupervised methods with the exception of which represents each directed interaction using topological_features and trains a classifier to predict the directions of unseen interactions specifically previous unsupervised methods relied on information from perturbation experiments in which a gene is perturbed cause and as a result other genes change their expression levels effects to guide the inference they assumed that for an effect to take place there must be a directed path in the network from the causal gene to the affected gene as there are many paths that can link two proteins in the interaction_network previous solution methods relied on either length bounded paths or parameterized and integer_programming techniques the former are limited by the length of the considered paths at most five the latter while producing highly_precise predictions are limited in their coverage as they start by contracting cycles of the input network eliminating the vast_majority of the interactions on the network from further consideration it is likely that biological_responses are controlled by relatively short signaling_cascades however in a large_scale network enumerating all possible paths between two vertices can still be computationally_intractable even when considering only paths of limited length in this article we propose an orientation method that overcomes the limitations of previous_approaches by focusing attention on shortest_paths which allows the efficient to whom correspondence should be addressed representation of all such paths and avoids the contraction problem the method aims to orient the edges of an input graph g so that a maximum number of input sourcetarget pairs admit a directed source to target path whose length is the shortest possible i e equal to distance between the two vertices in g our algorithm builds on a first efficient for realistic instances integer_linear ilp formulation of the problem allowing the computation of optimal solutions in seconds on current networks we applied our method to large_scale datasets of yeast physical_interactions and evaluated it using cross_validation experiments our method outperformed two previous stateof the art orientation methods by a significant margin the orientation of a network is key to understanding its function here we have presented the shortest approach which allows us for the first time to confidently orient the majority of the edges in a network the most natural use of such an orientation is in enhancing methods for pathway inference specifically current pathway inference algorithms like receive as input an undirected ppi_network and search for likely paths that start and end at specific proteins the search_space of such methods can be greatly_reduced by the orientation information to test the potential utility of our orientation method in a pathway inference context we checked its power in filtering candidate pathways by their agreement with the predicted orientations to this end we inspected the sourcetarget pairs connected by more than one possible pathway within the networks in section i in the orientation instance because of there are possible shortest_paths from source to target paths per sourcetarget pair however when filtering these paths against the confident orientation predictions only on average per pair remain ii in the orientation instance because ofthere are shortest_paths from source to target on average per pair of which only on average per pair agree with the confident orientations thus the use of our method can potentially reduce_the by up to performance comparison of gitter and shortest using different confidence cutoff labels denote the confidence cutoff used by shortestnote algorithm run times in seconds the full dataset was used with source target pairs
