mugbas a species free gene based programme suite for post gwas analysis genome_wide between molecular_markers and phenotypes are now routinely run in model and non model species however tools to estimate the probability of association of functional_units e g genes containing multiple_markers are not developed for species other than humans here we introduce mugbas multi species gene based association suite software that estimates the p value of a gene using information on annotation single marker gwa results and genotype the software is species and annotation independent fast highly parallelized and ready for high_density marker studies availability_and https bitbucket org capemaster mugbas contact with the availability of high_density panels genome_wide gwas have become a standard for dissecting the architecture of complex_traits this is true for humans and other species the underlying idea of gwas is simple find marker trait associations exploiting the linkage_disequilibrium ld that exists between causative mutations which we ignoreand flanking markers of known chromosomal position a number of well established approaches can be used in a standard gwas these generally use many thousand and sometimes millions of markers statistical thresholds are set considering multiple_comparisons and may exclude a number of moderate or small effects actually associated with the traits investigated reducing the number of tests while maintaining all the information provided by high_density panels would be a clear advantage in addition once significant signals are detected different strategies are used to tag the candidate causative_genes sometimes all genes lying in the significant snp s flanking region are included in further analyses sometimes only the gene closest to the signal is further investigated these choices are arbitrary may end up in choosing the wrong genes or in including a large number of false candidate_genes methods have recently been proposed to overcome_these using a priori_knowledge the candidate pathway analysis and gene based association strategies restrict gwa studies to known genes or gene subsets resizing the multiple_testing and increasing the power of the analyses bioinformatics_pipelines are generally developed for the analysis of human and model_organisms and are often not suited to the analysis of other species this is the case of the vegas software developed for gene based analyses in humans in fact this plink based software expects data from autosomes and pre_calculated ld values available for human hapmap phase data here we introduce mugbas a software based on vegas that uses gwas data and a given annotation typically genes but any region is suitable to estimate gene based and region based association p values the suite is species and annotation free ready to analyze high_density data from any diploid species
