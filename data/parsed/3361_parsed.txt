genetics_and opticall a robust genotype_calling algorithm for rare low_frequency and common_variants motivation existing microarray genotype_calling adopt either snp by snp snp wise or sample by sample sample wise approaches to calling we have developed a novel genotype_calling algorithm for the illumina_platform opticall that uses both snp wise and sample wise calling to more accurately ascertain genotypes at rare low_frequency and common_variants results using data from individuals from the british_birth genotyped on the immunochip we estimate the proportion of snps lost to downstream_analysis due to false quality_control failures and rare_variants misclassified as monomorphic is only with opticall in comparison to and for illuminus genosnp and gencall respectively we show that opticall accurately captures rare_variants and can correctly account for snps where probe intensity clouds are shifted from their expected positions availability_and opticall is implemented in c for use on unix operating_systems and is available for download atburgeoning whole_genome and whole_exome projects are likely to require large_scale microarray_based follow_up studies already custom arrays such as metabochip and immunochip utilize snps identified through population_based sequencing_efforts such as genomes to better survey loci known to underpin variation across related_phenotypes typically the allelic probes on these custom arrays have undergone less stringent quality_control qc compared to those that make it onto mass produced gwas arrays this drop in probe quality in addition to a greater focus on low_frequency and rare_variants those with minor_allele and respectively the presents many problems for existing genotype_calling genotype_calling use normalized measures of dna_binding to allele specific probes to ascertain the genotype of an individual at a given snp as an example a wild_type homozygous genotype at a particular snp would have a high_intensity value for the wild_type allelic probe and little or no intensity for to whom correspondence should be addressed the alternative allelic probe a heterozygous sample would have intermediate intensities for both probes existing callers vary in both the statistical_models they apply and how they utilize the intensity data across individuals and snps illuminas proprietary genotype_calling software gencall uses a custom clustering_algorithm that encompasses several biological heuristics to determine genotypes from intensity clouds obtained by gathering all individuals at a single snp if less than three well defined genotype clusters are observed gencall uses a neural_network model to estimate the location and shape of the undefined clusters gencall is designed to work on illumina arrays and being based on a pretrained neural_network its performance on a new dataset is dependent on how close the new data matches the data used to train the network another commonly used genotype_calling algorithm illuminus also designed for illumina arrays again clusters intensity data across samples on a per snp basis using an unsupervised_clustering method based on a mixture_model of students t distributions this unsupervised_approach removes the need for a called training_set however low_frequency snps and or small_sample can result in poorly_defined clusters and inaccurate genotype_calls due to the small number of rare allele observations discovered within sample intensity data also tended to cluster into three distinct genotype_groups on the basis of this observation they created genosnp a within sample genotype_calling algorithm clustering within sample can be advantageous for rare_variants and small_sample as three well defined clusters are always observed a drawback of the approach is that intensity variation between snps is not accounted for resulting in inaccurate genotype_calls for snps where intensity clusters are shifted from their expected positions we have developed opticall a novel genotype_calling algorithm that uses both within and across sample intensity data to accurately ascertain genotypes from across the minor_allele frequency_spectrum in the following sections we describe opticall and compare its output to that from existing algorithms using samples from the british_birth genotyped on the immunochip an illumina iselect hd custom array to test the performance of opticall and compare it to existing algorithms we used data from individuals from the british_birth who were genotyped using the immunochip an illumina iselect hd custom array designed for deep replication of autoimmune_disease genome_wide results and fine_mapping within known autoimmune disease_loci genotypes were called at snps using opticall gencall illuminus and genosnp default_parameters were used when running each of the algorithms the genotype data from each algorithm underwent a simple qc protocol to reflect a typical association study snps failed qc if they had a call rate or hwe p shows the qc results for each caller across the dataset calls from illuminus and genosnp produce the most discordant results at qc with and unique qc passes and fails respectively whereas gencall and opticall appear to have more overlapping qc outcomes with other callers
