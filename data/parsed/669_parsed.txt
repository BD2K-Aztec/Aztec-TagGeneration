systems_biology bayesian correlated clustering to integrate_multiple datasets motivation the integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems_biology and genomic medicine modern high_throughput generate a broad array of different data types providing distinctbut often complementaryinformation we present a bayesian_method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets which we refer to as mdi multiple dataset integration mdi can integrate_information from a wide_range of different datasets and data types simultaneously including the ability to model time series data explicitly using gaussian processes each dataset is modelled using a dirichlet multinomial allocation dma mixture_model with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets results using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets we show that mdi is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously and that it successfully captures the underlying structural_similarity between the datasets we also analyse a variety of real saccharomyces_cerevisiae datasets in the two dataset case we show that mdis performance is comparable with the present state of the art we then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene_expression chromatin immunopreci pitationchip and proteinprotein_interaction data to identify a set of protein_complexes for which genes are co regulated during the cell_cycle comparisons to other unsupervised data_integration tech niquesas well as to non integrative approachesdemonstrate that mdi is competitive while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods availability a matlab_implementation of mdi is available fromthe wide_range of modern high_throughput genomics technologies has led to a rapid increase in both the quantity and variety of functional_genomics data that can be collected for example large_scale microarray chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_chip and tandem_affinity datasets are available for a broad selection of organisms providing measurements of mrna_expression proteindna binding and proteinprotein_interactions ppis in the forthcoming era of personal genomic medicine we may reasonably expect genome_sequences and other forms of high_throughput data such as gene_expression alternative_splicing dna_methylation histone_acetylation and protein abundances to be routinely_measured for large_numbers of people the development of novel statistical and computational methodology for integrating diverse data_sources is therefore essential and it is with this that the present work is concerned as is common in statistics and machine_learning data_integration techniques can be broadly categorized as either supervised where a training gold_standard set with known labels is used to learn statistical relationships or unsupervised where there is no training_dataset but we nevertheless seek to identify hidden structure in the observed data e g by clustering our proposed method is unsupervised but there are also a number of supervised_learning algorithms that are designed to integrate_multiple data_sources we now briefly mention these for the sake of completeness these have proven highly_successful in several contexts often when predicting whether a link or interaction exists between two genes or proteins depending on the application the link might represent to provide just a few examples protein protein binding or a synthetic sick or lethal interaction or might indicate that the two genes have been implicated in the same biological_process approaches for predicting these links often proceed by collecting a gold_standard set of positive_and interactions see for contrasting examples and then training statistical_models e g decision_trees naive_bayes classifiers that predict the presence absence of these interactions these models may then be applied to predict the presence absence of previously_unknown interactions because training and prediction are performed on the basis of information collected from multiple different data_sources these approaches provide a form of data_integration such supervised data_integration techniques have proven highly_effective for predicting interactions some of which may then be verified experimentally e g moreover the work ofdemonstrates that such approaches may be used to integrate whole genome_scale datasets the bayesian_network approach ofwas a precursor to many of these supervised approaches but differs from the others in that it uses knowledge to whom correspondence should be addressed the author s published_by this is an open_access the terms of

to integrate predictions derived from diverse datasets here we propose a novel unsupervised_approach for the integrative modelling of multiple datasets which may be of different types for brevity we refer to our approach as mdi simply as a shorthand for multiple dataset integration we model each dataset using a dirichlet multinomial allocation dma mixture_model section and exploit statistical_dependencies between the datasets to share_information section mdi permits the identification of groups of genes that tend to cluster together in one some or all of the datasets in this way our method is able to use the information contained within diverse datasets to identify groups of genes with increasingly specific characteristics e g not only identifying groups of genes that are co regulated but additionally identifying groups of genes that are both co regulated and whose protein products appear in the same complex informally our approach may be considered as a correlated clustering model in which the allocation of genes to clusters in one dataset has an influence on the allocation of genes to clusters in another this contrasts with simple clustering_approaches such as k means hierarchical_clustering etc in which the datasets are clustered independently or else concatenated and treated as a single dataset it also clearly distinguishes our methodology from biclustering e g biclustering is the clustering of both dimensions in a single dataset e g both genes and experiments in a gene_expression dataset mdi in contrast clusters a single dimension e g genes across multiple datasets biclustering is not applicable here as the datasets can be arbitrarily different making any clustering across all features difficult mdi avoids the problem of comparing different data types by instead learning the degree of similarity between the clustering structures i e the gene to cluster allocations in different datasets section mdi makes use of mixture_models which have become widespread in the context of unsupervised integrative data modelling e g gaining increased popularity in recent_years the principal advantages of using mixture_models are as follows i they provide flexible probabilistic_models of the data ii they naturally capture the clustering structure that is commonly present in functional_genomics datasets and iii by adopting different parametric forms for the mixture components they permit different data types to be modelled see also section an early application to data_integration is provided by who performed integrative modelling of gene_expression and binding_site data as part of our approach we infer parameters that describe the levels of agreement between the datasets our method may thus be viewed as extending the work of in this regard mdi is also related to the approach of which models the correlation between data_sources as part of a method that classifies genes as targets or non targets of a given transcription_factor tf using chipchip gene_expression and dna_binding data as well as information regarding the position of genes on a gene network perhaps most closely_related to mdi in terms of application are the methods of and icluster adopt a mixture modelling approach using a hierarchical_dirichlet dp to perform integrative modelling of two datasets as well as significant methodological_differences the principal practical distinction between this approach and mdi is that we are able to integrate more than two datasets any or all of which may be of different types section like mdi the icluster method ofpermits integrative clustering of multiple genomic_datasets but uses a joint latent_variable model for details see in contrast to mdi icluster seeks to find a single common clustering structure for all datasets moreover icluster must resort to heuristic approaches to estimate the number of clusters whereas mdi infers this automatically section we demonstrate that mdi provides results that are competitive with the two dataset approach of savage et_al in section and provide a comparison of results obtained using mdi icluster and simple clustering_approaches in the supplementary_material the potential biological_applications of our approach are diverse as there are many experimental platforms that produce measurements of different types which might be expected to possess similar but not necessarily identical clustering structures for example in the two dataset case related methodologies have been used to discover transcriptional modules and prognostic cancer_subtypes through the integration of gene_expression data with tf_binding chipchip data and copy_number data respectively a related approach was also used byto investigate the correspondence between transcriptomic and proteomic expression_profiles in the example presented in this article we focus on the biological_question of identifying protein_complexes whose genes undergo transcriptional co regulation during the cell_cycle the outline of this article is as follows in section we briefly provide some modelling background and present our approach inference in our model is performed via a gibbs_sampler which is provided in the supplementary_material in section we describe three case study examples in all of which we use publicly_available saccharomyces_cerevisiae bakers yeast datasets we present results in section and a discussion in section we have presented mdi a novel bayesian_method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets we have established that mdi provides competitive results with an existing method for integrating two datasets section and is also able to integrate collections of more than two datasets sections and our application to a three dataset example section demonstrated that requiring agreement across multiple datasets of different types can enable us to identify clusters of genes with increasingly specific shared characteristics moreover we have found that sharing_information across multiple datasets can improve cluster quality mdi adopts a modelling approach distinctly different from those adopted by existing integrative modelling_methods for example the model ofperforms integrative modelling of two datasets only achieved by introducing a fused context in which the two datasets are modelled together via a product of likelihoods in addition to two unfused contexts in which the two datasets are modelled separately this is analogous to introducingand modellingan additional dataset in contrast mdi introduces just a single_parameter k r for each pair of datasets section and it is this that provides mdi with the flexibility to perform integrative modelling of multiple datasets the scalability of mdi may be further improved through parallelization of the type described by this is an important direction for future work
