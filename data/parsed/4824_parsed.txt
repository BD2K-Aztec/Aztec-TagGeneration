sequence_analysis using population data for assessing next_generation performance motivation during the past_years whole_exome has become a standard tool for finding rare_variants causing mendelian_disorders in that time there has also been a proliferation of both sequencing_platforms and approaches to analyse their output this requires approaches to assess the performance of different methods traditionally criteria such as comparison with microarray_data or a number of known polymorphic_sites have been used here we expand such approaches developing a maximum_likelihood framework and using it to estimate the sensitivity_and of whole exome_sequencing results using whole exome_sequencing for a panel of individuals we show that estimated sensitivity_and are similar to those calculated using microarray_data as a reference we explore the effect of frequency misspecification arising from using an inappropriately selected population and find that although the estimates are affected the rankings across procedures remain the same availability_and an implementation using perl and r can be found at busso ncl ac uk username igm password z z nts the identification of sequence_variants predisposing to diseases that follow mendelian_inheritance patterns is a common application of next_generation a key_step in these approaches is the identification of variants shared among affected relatives b c usually a variant is defined as a deviation from a reference_sequence next_generation of material enriched for exonic sequences has been successful in many cases but has failed to identify the causative variants in others such apparent failures may have many causes but also focus attention on the desirability of simple measures to assess the results of the sequencing and analysis_pipelines used in disease mapping efforts it is clearly desirable to have a high_probability of identifying a true variant while the number of falsely identified_variants remains_low this will reduce the amount of work needed for validation of candidate variants which is typically undertaken using sanger_sequencing or genotyping approaches our objective is to develop a simple and flexible_approach for assessing the performance of a whole exome or genome sequencing_experiment it should allow assessing the whole process from sample_preparation to variant_calling the focus is on the detection of single base sequence_variants as opposed to changes in copy_number or large rearrangements one approach is to compare the identified_variants with variants known to be present or absent for this purpose variants are commonly compared with the results of genotyping microarrays e g this allows for the probability of a specific variant at a given position in an individual to be considered as either or the price of this certainty is additional experimental costs an alternative is to use variants where the probability of occurrence in a specific sample can be ascertained thus allowing the probability of a variant present at a specific position to assume values other than or here we formalize the second approach using sites known to be polymorphic in the human population this approach can be seen as an extension of methods that rely on quality_criteria such as the number of variants found in sites known to be polymorphic in the human population e g we compare our results with those obtained using microarray_data and use our method to assess different analysis_pipelines and to explore the importance of analysis parameters and coverage depth as we are using known polymorphisms we also investigate the influence of the population that was used to characterize the polymorphisms on the results the use of microarrays to assess the accuracy of variant identification is likely to lead to biased results as the polymorphisms present on microarrays usually exclude variants such as small insertion deletions indels such variants also represent a challenge for variant_calling in next_generation in the last paragraph we therefore explore different analysis_pipelines for indel calling the results of such comparisons can be summarized in many ways commonly used metrics include for example the number or proportion of previously_reported variants among the detected deviations from the reference_sequence as our focus is on a to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work dichotomous outcome i e the presence_or of a variant at a particular position we use here the probabilities of identifying the variant at a site that carries a variant and of identifying no variant at a site where only the reference_sequence is present we refer to these probabilities as sensitivity_and in this section we first explore some applications of the method proposed then compare its results with estimates generated using the genotypes obtained through the microarray as the true genotypes the method only requires that the allele_frequencies in the population from which the samples were drawn are known however this may not be the case therefore we explore the effects of population misspecification pipelines compares sensitivity_and estimates achieved using different alignment and variant_calling program combinations the values are based on samples for eight samples ssaha failed to produce results and generated the messages error memory allocation failed cannot allocate memory or error memory allocation for array of fasta structures failed cannot allocate memory represented for each combination are the median and the upper and lower quartiles interestingly the alignment programs appear to have a stronger_effect on sensitivity whereas the variant_calling programs appeared to effect specificity more strongly all aligners yield similar specificities when used in combination with samtools and the combinations novoalign samtools and bwa samtools provided the highest sensitivity therefore we used novoalign as aligner and samtools as variant caller as the standard pipeline for subsequent analyses the estimates for the specificity using samtools with any aligner were in excess of parameter selection each alignment and variant_calling program has a range of parameters which can be set by the user in general default values are provided but these may not always be appropriate and altering these parameters can have a marked effect on sensitivity_and our procedure can be used to next_generation performance investigate such effects as an example we explore the effect of varying the quality thresholds for variant_calling using the novoalign samtools pipeline this threshold is the minimum base_quality at a position for a read required for that read to be included in the variant call for that position shows that altering this parameter has a dramatic effect on sensitivity with a rapid drop when the values are set above the effect on specificity is more modest and increasing the values beyond has only a limited effect coverage explores the effects of average coverage as expected sensitivity increases with increasing_coverage with the parameters we used there is a substantial_loss of sensitivity when the average coverage was fold specificity shows little variation with increasing_depth at low coverage finding evidence for a variant generally becomes more difficult thus leading to a low sensitivity and high_specificity microarray comparison for samples data were available from both platforms the variants were called using the novoalign samtools pipeline with default_parameters compares sensitivity_and figures estimated using genotype microarray_data fourth column and our method with two different sets of allele_frequencies second and third column the frequencies used for the estimates in the third column were calculated from the genotyping_results for the samples we see that compared with the microarrays both specificity and sensitivity estimates are slightly_lower by the frequency method using the ceu population frequencies second column one possible contributor to this effect is that the estimates are distorted because the allele_frequencies do not match the frequencies in our sample in fact the difference is smaller when the allele_frequencies used are derived from the genotyping_results third column it should also be mentioned that specificity estimates are in the order of these estimates however are based only on a limited number of polymorphic_sites sites suggesting that the ability to adequately assess changes in the specificity will be limited this is reflected in the correlation between the estimates_obtained from microarrays and from population frequencies although there is a good correlation between the estimates for the sensitivity r p x the correlation for specificity is rather poor although still significant r p x exploring the effect of parameter choice represented is the effect of minimum base_quality threshold on estimated sensitivity panel a and specificity panel b each point on the graph represents the result for a single sample analysed using the minimum base_quality threshold given in the abscissaallele frequency effects the method we propose uses allele_frequencies in the estimation of sensitivity_and allele_frequencies vary between populations and the ethnicity of the individuals who provided a sample may not always be precisely known we therefore explored how the use of alternative allele_frequency data from a variety of populations would influence our results explores the effects of using the allele_frequencies for hapmap populations in the estimation of the performance of the pipelines used previously the figure suggests that misspecification of population frequencies tends to lead to lower estimates of both sensitivity_and however the lines connecting the values for different pipelines calculated using different allele_frequencies tend to be parallel this indicates that the results are correlated p for all comparisons suggesting that although the estimates may vary the different pipelines will tend to be in the same order shows the results for different indel calling pipelines for all pipelines the sensitivity is substantially lower than the values obtained for single base_substitutions compare with we also observe that samtools has the lowest sensitivity whereas gatk performed best we also saw that the combination bwa gtak performed best the higher specificity value achieved by dindel is likely due to the minimum variant call threshold used in analysis the average estimates for sensitivity using the bowtie gatk and novoalign gatk pipelines are and respectively the approach we presented here estimates two parameters the sensitivity and the specificity of variant_calls in a next_generation experiment by comparing the observed variants with population allele_frequency data in a maximum_likelihood framework we illustrated some of its potential applications by comparing analysis_pipelines and variant_calling parameters and exploring the effects of differences in coverage as both sensitivity_and are influenced by various experimental factors including sample_preparation the sequencing itself and the bioinformatic pipelines used to analyse data the procedure could be used to assess the performance of a sequencing_experiment globally and could complement other commonly used approaches such as the assessment of base call quality or of coverage metrics
