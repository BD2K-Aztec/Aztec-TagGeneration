luciphor site localization of generic post_translational from tandem_mass data we present luciphor a site localization tool for generic post_translational ptms using tandem_mass data as an extension of the original luciphor version for phosphorylation_site localization the new software provides a site level localization score for generic ptms and associated false_discovery called the false localization rate we describe several novel features such as operating system independence and reduced computation time through multiple threading we also discuss optimal parameters for different types of data and illustrate the new tool on a human skeletal_muscle dataset for lysine_acetylation availability_and the software is freely_available on the sourceforge websitepost translational modifications ptms induce conformational changes in proteins that influence their enzymatic_activity subcellular_localization and or their binding_affinity high_throughput analysis of ptms is typically achieved through mass_spectrometry ms where tandem ms_ms mass_spectra are searched against a sequence database allowing for ptms a major_challenge in the interpretation of ms_ms data for ptms is that database search_engines can correctly match a peptide_sequence with incorrectly localized ptm s these errors are not controlled by the type_i of peptide_identification because each peptide has a different degree of uncertainty as far as site localization is concerned for this reason the conventional target_decoy framework often leads to underestimation of the error_rates for site localization of ptms hence an additional procedure to control the number of false site localizations is necessary when reporting ptm localization analysis results at the proteome scale
