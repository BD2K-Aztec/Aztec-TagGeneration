semiconductor sequencing how many flows do you need motivation semiconductor sequencing directly translates chemically encoded information a c g or t into voltage signals that are detected by a semiconductor device changes of ph value and thereby of the electric_potential in the reaction well are detected during strand synthesis from nucleotides provided in cyclic repeated flows for each type of nucleotide to minimize time requirement and costs it is necessary to know the number of flows that are required for complete coverage of the templates results we calculate the number of required flows in a random_sequence model and present exact expressions for cumulative_distribution expected value and variance additionally we provide an algorithm to calculate the number of required flows for a concrete list of amplicons using a bed file of genomic positions as input we apply the algorithm to calculate the number of flows that are required to cover six amplicon panels that are used for targeted_sequencing in cancer research the upper_bounds obtained for the number of flows allow to enhance the instrument throughput from two chips to three chips per day for four of these panels availability_and the algorithm for calculation of the flows was implemented in r and is available as package ionflows from the cran repository for more than years the chain termination method developed bywas the predominating method for dna_sequencing pyrosequencing was one of the first methods for dna_sequencing that is based on sequencing by synthesis rather than chain termination since the late s further next_generation ngs methods have been developed and a technology_development race started to achieve the genome most of the ngs_technologies such as pyrosequencing or illumina_sequencing rely on the generation of light_signals upon incorporation of one of the four nucleotides a c g or t into the new dna_strand in contrast semiconductor sequencing uses a different approach that is based on direct measurement of electric_potential changes induced by the release of protons h during strand synthesis in semiconductor sequencing the reaction wells are sequentially flooded by one of the nucleotides a c g and t whenever the offered nucleotide is complementary to the template dna_strand at the actual position it is incorporated into the new strand and induces a change in the electric_potential in the reaction well using the scalable technology of ion sensitive field_effect isfet organized in highly_integrated circuits millions of wells can be interrogated at the same time an isfet detects a voltage signal allows sequencing of templates of a length of up to bp or bp using a novel chemistry the ion personal genome machine pgm system is suited for targeted_sequencing of disease_relevant regions of the human_genome or complete sequencing of smaller genomes e g of microbes ion pgm sequencing kit includes reagents for sequencing of amplicons up to bp using this sequencing kit a total number of flows can be executed which are usually split to and running of two sequencing chips here we present an approach to compute the number of flows required to sequence a dna_template of length n these are the main results of our study i while k n flows are needed to sequence each template of length n to the full_length in most situations a much lower number of flows suffices ii in a random_sequence model we calculate the cumulative_distribution of the number of required flows and its expected value and variance iii we provide an algorithm to calculate the number of required flows for a concrete amplicon panel from a bed file of genomic positions in semiconductor sequencing the sequencing_depth and the number of flows are independent quantities we present a formula to calculate the sequencing_depth from the number of amplicons and the number of samples that are sequenced in parallel
