gene_expression iqrray a new method for affymetrix microarray quality_control and the homologous organ conservation score a new benchmark method for quality_control metrics motivation microarray_results accumulated in public_repositories are widely reused in meta_analytical studies and secondary databases the quality of the data obtained with this technology varies from experiment to experiment and an efficient method for quality_assessment is necessary to ensure their reliability results the lack of a good benchmark has hampered evaluation of existing_methods for quality_control in this study we propose a new independent quality metric that is based on evolutionary_conservation of expression_profiles we show using large organ specific data_sets that iqrray a new quality_metrics developed by us exhibits the highest correlation with this reference metric among metrics tested iqrray outperforms other methods in identification of poor_quality arrays in datasets composed of arrays from many independent experiments in contrast the performance of methods designed for detecting outliers in a single experiment like normalized unscaled standard_error and relative log expression was low because of the inability of these methods to detect datasets containing only low quality arrays and because the scores cannot be directly compared between experiments thousands of microarray_results are available in public_repositories such as the gene_expression and arrayexpress this wealth of expression data covering many organisms tissues developmental_stages diseases and treatments is now available for meta_analyses system biology studies and use in secondary databases combining results from several independent studies allows improved detection of differentially_expressed and analysis of biological_pathways and co expression networks these vast transcriptomic resources have been also extensively used for functional gene_annotation and reanalysis of lists of candidate_genes obtained with high_throughput experiments these tasks are facilitated by large secondary databases such as genevestigator biogps the gene_expression atlas or bgee that allow mining of many microarray_experiments at the same time additionally there are many more specialized databases which for example collect data only from a selected species or for diseases or provide resources for more specific analyses such as coxpresdb for studying co expressed genes or tisged for the analysis of tissue_specific gene_expression the quality of results that can be derived from meta_analysis and database_searches of microarray_data depends directly on the quality of the arrays themselves despite this there are still no objective_criteria that allow discrimination between low and high_quality arrays by quality in this context we understand the agreement between microarray_gene level estimations and true gene_expression a proper quality_control procedure should report whether the amount of biological_information captured by the microarray experiment is sufficient to answer a particular biological_question the most common approach to quality_assessment of microarray_results makes the assumption that the majority of arrays in each dataset is of good quality and various parameters serve to identify outlier arrays this task is relatively easy when the dataset is large but the analysis often lacks power when only a few arrays are analyzed together moreover in the case of a dataset with a high proportion of low quality arrays e g microarray_results derived from degraded rna samples the good quality arrays might actually be removed to decrease variability of the dataset this approach is also powerless to detect datasets composed only of low quality samples most of the existing_methods of quality_control of affymetrix microarrays use specific features of these chips such as control probes pairs of mismatch mm and perfect match pm probes or the fact that there are many probes gathered in probe_sets targeting the same transcript the degradation of transcripts starts from the end thus the ratio of abundance of ends serves in molecular_biology practice as an indicator of to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work
