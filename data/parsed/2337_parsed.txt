identity by descent filtering of exome_sequence for disease_gene in autosomal_recessive disorders motivation next_generation and exome_capture technologies are currently revolutionizing the way geneticists screen for disease_causing in rare mendelian_disorders however the identification of causal_mutations is challenging due to the sheer number of variants that are identified in individual exomes although databases such as dbsnp or hapmap can be used to reduce the plethora of candidate_genes by filtering out common_variants the remaining set of genes still remains on the order of dozens results our algorithm uses a non homogeneous hidden_markov that employs local recombination_rates to identify chromosomal_regions that are identical by descent ibd in children of consanguineous or non consanguineous_parents solely based on genotype data of siblings derived from high_throughput using simulated and real exome_sequence we show that our algorithm is able to reduce_the for the causative disease gene to a fifth or a tenth of the entire exome availability an r script and an accompanying tutorial are available atthe identification of genes underlying mendelian_disorders for the past several decades has mainly proceeded by means of positional_cloning to identify chromosomal linkage intervals followed by the sequencing of candidate_genes efforts at diseasegene identification involving linkage_analysis or association studies usually result in a genomic interval of cm containing up to genes although computational_methods can be used to prioritize_candidate sequencing large_numbers of candidate_genes remains a time consuming and expensive task and it is often not possible to identify the correct disease gene by inspection of the list of genes within the interval recently whole_exome i e the targeted capture of protein coding_exons followed by massively_parallel next_generation ngs has been demonstrated as an effective approach to identify genes underlying mendelian_disorders using a small number of affected_individuals sequenced individuals typically have on the order of five to ten thousand variant_calls representing either non synonymous_substitutions in protein_coding alterations of the canonical splice_site dinucleotides or small_indels ns ss i even after filtering out common_variants using data from dbsnp the hapmap project and related resources such as the genomes_project the number of potentially disease_causing ns ss i variants can remain_high if the exome of a single patient is considered in isolation many disease_causing were completely unsuspected on the basis of previous_knowledge and software_tools that aim at predicting the damaging_effect of non synonymous variants are currently unable to reliably_distinguish between disease_causing and other variants groups who have performed diseasegene identification projects by exome_sequencing have developed analysis strategies based upon searching for potentially_damaging rare_variants found in the same gene in sets of multiple unrelated patients affected by the same mendelian disorder although this strategy has been applied successfully in sequencing_projects with two affected_individuals and occasionally even with a single affected individual in many cases multiple candidate_genes remain after applying computational filters based on rarity or presence of a mutation in multiple affected patients this means that additional analysis of multiple candidate_genes or other procedures would often be needed to identify the disease gene following exome_sequencing of single families with a mendelian disorder we will refer to the above described procedure for searching for a disease gene by exome_sequencing in multiple unrelated patients asthe algorithm presented here infers the locations of ibd chromosomal segments from the exome sequences of siblings affected by an autosomal_recessive hereditary_disease without requiring sequence_data from the parents the disease gene must be located in such an ibd region the analysis of chromosomal_regions that are identical by descent is a fundamental tool in linkage_analysis of pedigree data and in population_genetics studies such as genome_wide in this work we have presented a method for detection of ibd regions in the exome sequences of two or more related individuals affected with an autosomal_recessive disease in contrast to homozygosity_mapping approaches designed for the analysis of children of consanguineous matings our procedure was developed to work for consanguineous or non consanguineous_families with the recent advent of exome and genome_sequencing for medical_diagnostics there is a pressing need for computational procedures that make maximum use of the information provided by the sequences for the rapid and correct identification of medically relevant mutations recent results have shown that even in populations such as europeans that are well represented in dbsnp and hapmap very high numbers of novel snps still remain to be found this is likely to be even more the case in other population groups and this will be an important issue given that many families affected by rare recessive syndromes come from small_populations for which only scarce variational data are available the main_drawback of filtering approaches that rely on a computational_prediction of pathogenicity as well as filtering approaches that focus on sets of variants that intersect in all analyzed samples of affected_individuals is the possibility of false_negative not all disease associated mutations are predicted to be pathogenic by current_algorithms and not all disease_causing are called to the correct genotype in all samples the benefit of error robust ibd classification is thus fold on the one hand it is an effective tool for reducing the genomic search_space and on the other hand it is an effective means for identifying sequencing_errors the posterior_probability computed by our algorithm additionally provides an estimator of how likely the classification is to be correct the interpretation of these values is difficult it has to be noted that error probabilities as well as ibd classification probabilities are often of a conditional nature the constraint of being a rare_variant increases the error probability tremendously that is a variant call at a dbsnp position is much more likely to be a correct one compared with a call at a non dbsnp position the same holds true for ibd classification errors a limitation of our method is the fact that regions of high linkage_disequilibrium in a population are more likely to be falsely classified as an ibd region in future work we plan on analyzing how homozygosity runs as well as population specific linkage disequilibria may be incorporated to further reduce error_rates in ibd classification
