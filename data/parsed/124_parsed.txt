adephylo new tools for investigating the phylogenetic_signal in biological_traits adephylo is a package for the r software dedicated to the analysis of comparative evolutionary data phylogenetic_comparative initially aimed at accounting for or removing the effects of phylogenetic_signal in the analysis of biological_traits however recent_approaches have shown that considerable information can be gathered from the study of the phylogenetic_signal in particular close examination of phylogenetic structures can unveil interesting evolutionary_patterns for this purpose we developed the package adephylo that provides tools for quantifying and describing the phylogenetic structures of biological_traits adephylo implements tests of phylogenetic_signal phylogenetic distances and proximities and novel methods for describing further univariate_and phylogenetic structures these tools open up new perspectives in the analysis of evolutionary comparative_data availability the stable version is available from cran http cran r project org_web adephylo the development version is hosted by r forge http r forge r project org projects adephylo evolutionary comparative_data consists of biological_traits observed in several taxa forming the tips of a phylogenetic_tree phylogenetic proximity most often engenders non independence in the distribution of traits between closely_related taxa challenging the assumption of independence among observations required by classical statistical_tools used for modeling relationships between traits this phylogenetic autocorrelation often referred to as phylogenetic_signal has initially been perceived as a source of nuisance in the analysis of life_histories consequently phylogenetic_comparative pcms first focused on partialling out the effects of phylogenetic_signal in the correlative analysis of biological_traits e g however precious information can be to whom correspondence should be addressed gained from studying the phylogenetic_signal e g for identifying different selective regimes detecting shifts in correlation patterns on a phylogeny or inferring changes in rates of evolution o moreover phylogenetic_signal can also indicate interesting evolutionary_processes such as divergence of life_histories trade_offs or niche conservatism the r package adephylo aims to complement existing pcms by implementing tools for describing the phylogenetic_signal and uncovering phylogenetic patterns from evolutionary comparative_data in large phylogenies i e including thousands of tips these metrics can be used to code the phylogenetic structure either under the form of a matrix of distances disttips proximities proxtips or as orthonormal bases orthobasis phylo these different representations of phylogenetic_information give rise to a diversity of methods for the analysis of phylogenetic comparative_data phylogenetic proximities are used in the abouheifs test which provides a nonparametric procedure for detecting phylogenetic_signal abouheifs test is implemented by the function abouheif moran which performs independent monte_carlo tests for each trait of the analyzed dataset this approach can be used together with other classical tests of phylogenetic_signal such as pagels and blombergs k the latter being implemented in the r package picante as a complement to testing procedures adephylo implements tools for describing phylogenetic structures the decomposition of a quantitative_trait onto an orthonormal basis describing the topology of the tree is implemented by the function orthogram this approach proposes a series of statistical_tests as well as a visual description of the phylogenetic_signal allowing to infer where phylogenetic dependence occurs in the tree the function orthobasis phylo extends this approach by proposing new orthonormal bases based on different phylogenetic metrics therefore allowing considerable flexibility in the description of phylogenetic_relationships lastly adephylo also implements the phylogenetic principal_component ppca a novel method for investigating phylogenetic structures in multivariate comparative_data the function ppca performs the analysis while other procedures summary plot screeplot and scatter allow for extracting useful information and plotting results of a ppca adephylo is distributed with a tutorial and nine published datasets that are used to illustrate specific methodological points in appendix a supplementary_material we illustrate some features of adephylo using the maples data published in ackerly and donoghue we first test for the presence of phylogenetic_signal in the data using the function abouheif moran revealing four phylogenetically structured traits using ppca we unveil a phylogenetic pattern opposing taxa from either side of node which is remarkably_similar to the four traits identified as phylogenetically structured and points to the likely ancient divergence in life_histories of the species considered
