madgene retrieval and processing of gene identifier lists for the analysis of heterogeneous microarray_datasets madgene is a software environment comprising a web_based database and a java_application this platform aims at unifying gene identifiers ids and performing gene_set madgene allows the user to perform inter conversion of clone and gene ids over a large range of nomenclatures relative to species we propose a set of functions to facilitate the analysis of gene_sets and we give two microarray applications to show how madgene can be used to conduct meta_analyses availability the madgene resources are freely_available online from http www madtools org a website dedicated to the analysis and annotation of dna microarray_data the analysis of heterogeneous data is a time consuming and tedious task many tools exist for mapping gene ids across several references and species see references in supplementary_material although these resources offer many interesting options our platform has the advantage of integrating three essential features the capacity to annotate heterogeneous id lists a large coverage of species and an easy to use application for investigating multiple gene_lists which includes relational operators and multiple statistical_tests a wide_range of analyses can be conducted from gene_lists for concision sake we only focused on a particular example of use gene_lists taken from public microarray samples we give two applications to indicate the pertinence and reliability of our tool the first one compares samples issued from several human datasets related to duchenne_muscular dmd the second application identifies matching regions between two hierarchical clusterings related to two species human dmd and mouse mdx all the computations were performed with emadgene all the figures were drawn using r graphical functions
