cas designer a web_based for choice of crispr_cas target_sites we present cas designer a user_friendly program to aid researchers in choosing appropriate target_sites in a gene of interest for type_ii crispr_cas derived rna_guided endonucleases which are now widely used for biomedical_research and biotechnology cas designer rapidly provides the list of all possible guide rna_sequences in a given input dna_sequence and their potential_off including bulge type sites in a genome of choice in addition the program assigns an out of frame score to each target_site to help users choose appropriate sites for gene_knockout cas designer shows the results in an interactive table and provides user_friendly filter functions availability_and free access attargeted genome_editing based on the type_ii clustered_regularly crispr and crispr associated cas protein system from the prokaryotic adaptive_immune is now widely used for biomedical_research and biotechnology crispr rna_guided endonucleases rgens consist of the cas protein and guide rnas grnas which are provided as two small_rnas sequencevariable crrna and invariable trans activating crispr rna tracrrna or as single_chain grnas in which essential portions of crrna and tracrrna are linked rgens cleave target dna in a sequence dependent_manner the repair of the resulting doublestrand breaks dsbs by endogenous mechanisms gives rise to targeted_genome modifications in cells and whole organisms in addition to the base_pairing between grnas and target dna cas also contributes to rgen specificity by recognizing a protospaceradjacent motif pam downstream of the grna target_sequence cas proteins derived from different organisms recognize distinct pam sequences however rgens can also cleave off target dna sites with several mismatches or with missing or additional nucleotides compared to grna sequences we and others have presented computer programs that help researchers choose appropriate target_sites for cas nucleases to the best of our knowledge however there is no web_based for providing the list of all possible grnas in a given input dna_sequence with their potential_off with a dna or rna bulge in a genome of choice and with customizable pam sequences appropriate for cas derived from species other than s pyogenes here we present cas designer a quick grna designing tool for various type_ii cas nucleases which lists all possible grna sequences from a given input dna_sequence along with their potential_off in a genome of interest notably cas designer rapidly searches for potential_off with a dna or rna bulge furthermore cas designer provides an out of frame score for each grna to help choose appropriatesites for gene_knockout cas designer is available as a commandline program or at our website
