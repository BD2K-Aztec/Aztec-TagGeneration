mining viral_proteins for antimicrobial and cell penetrating drug_delivery peptides motivation the need for more effective and safer pharmaceuticals is a persistent quest microbial adaptations create the need to permanently develop new antimicrobials amps for instance similarly intracellular_delivery of drugs is still a challenge and translocation of membranes for drug_delivery is an area of intense research peptides can be used both as amp drug leads and drug carrier_systems for intracellular_delivery multifunctional proteins are abundant in viruses but surprisingly have never been thoroughly screened for bioactive peptide_sequences results using the ampa and cellppd online tools we have evaluated the propensity of viral_proteins to comprise amp or cell_penetrating cpps capsid_proteins from both enveloped and non enveloped_viruses and membrane and envelope_proteins from enveloped_viruses in a total of proteins from viruses were screened to detect the presence of potential amp and cpp sequences a pool of and cpp and amp sequences respectively were discovered the capsids of flaviviruses are the best sources of these peptides reaching more than of cpp sequence_coverage per protein selected sequences were tested_experimentally and validated the results overall this study reveals that viruses form a natural multiva lent biotechnological platform still underexplored in drug_discovery and the heterogeneous abundance of cpp amp sequences among viral families opens_new in viral biologyviruses are molecular machines that are present in all sorts of environments and conditions being the most abundant entity in the biological world traditionally considered as a threat to most living_systems viruses are now seen also as an asset in biotechnological and biomedical_research taking_advantage of their natural properties such as encapsulation of materials self packing cell internalization by diverse routes and multivalent post_translational and chemical_modifications to display surface ligands viruses are now important tools in the fields of nanoengineering and nanomedicine for instance viral like particles are used for gene_delivery and viral_capsid nanocapsules to incorporate bioactive_compounds there is a constant endless quest from the scientific and pharmaceutical communities to find innovative approaches to overcome issues on safety or efficacy of current drugs such as the increased microbial resistance to conventional antibiotics or the inability of most therapeutic_molecules to reach their cellular_targets peptide and protein based drugs are good drug leads because they can find use as amp and cpp are typically short cationic peptides usually amino_acid long that are found in a wide_diversity of natural sources from microbes to plants and animals amp and cpp sequences may result from the identification of bioactive_compounds on natural extracts in silico analysis of natural proteins de_novo or structure_based or chimeras of peptide_fragments and supplementary concerning amp and cpp from natural origin shows that only a few of them identified up to now rely on viral protein_sources albeit rare viral based cpp are more frequent than amp which is in agreement with data in the literature interestingly the first cpp that was discovered was from a viral source frankel andfound that the hiv transcription transactivating protein tat could enter cells and translocate into the nucleus in addition to tat there were cpp found in proteins from other viruses such as herpes_simplex herpesvirus human_respiratory hepatitis_b flock house virus and alphaviruses more recently our group characterized dengue_virus capsid_protein denv c as a supercharged protein scp with ability to efficiently deliver nucleic_acids into a wide_range of cells two intrinsic denv c domains with cpp properties pepm and pepr were identified supplementary moreover all flavivirus capsid_proteins revealed to belong to the scp family suggesting that these proteins contain intrinsic cellpenetrating domains despite being more rare amp have also been found in viral_proteins amp sequences were found in proteins of hepatitis_b bacillus phage spbeta bean golden mosaic_virus lactococcus phage mv pneumococcus phage dp and streptococcus phage cp the rapidly_expanding primary data volume on both amp and cpp raised the need to create systematic databases with their sequences origin activity and mode of action supplementaryshows a summary of the available repositories on amp and cpp it is noticeable that the information regarding cpp is confined to cppsite whereas for amp several databases exist a search in camp and cppsite databases shows that about and of the known amp and cpp respectively are from natural origin from those only of the amp and of the cpp are from viral source in this study we performed a thorough search for the discovery of amp and cpp in all structural viral_proteins available in the viralzone database using ampa and cellppd servers respectively supplementary an amp cpp sequence heat map was thus obtained for each protein the corresponding amp and cpp sequences are libraries of potential antibiotic and drug_delivery drug leads respectively to be further explored as a basic proof_of validation of viral amp and cpp discovery we screened denv c protein for amp and cpp supplementary obtained supplementary section and viral_proteins xls provide more details regarding the predicting tools parameters and analysis as well as the viral_proteins used in the query we used denv c as a model protein to validate the metaanalysis described above ampa retrieved the sequence as amp and cellppd identified the entire_sequence of the protein as having cpp properties supplementary the peptide which sequence corresponds to amino_acid from denvc is known as pepr and has been characterized experimentally as an antibiotic supplementary the whole protein has cell penetrating ability which is characteristic of scp this ability is maintained by the individual_domains of the protein supplementary in addition two other proteins with well characterized amp and cpp domains were also used to validate the methodology hiv tat and the human_neutrophil bactericidal_permeability bpi supplementary hiv tat is the template for one of the gold_standard cpp tat the protein region comprised by amino_acid was targeted by cellppd and includes the tat sequence amino_acid ampa revealed sequences and as intrinsic amp motifs in agreement with experimental_data ampa also retrieved the bpi amp domains corresponding to the sequences and which are included in the kda n_terminal fragment of rbpi this fragment is known for the strong amp activity cellppd is a svm tool trained with several proteins including hiv tat but not bpi or denv c the cpp sequence found in tat reveals the self consistency of the method the retrieval of amp and cpp validated experimentally in these proteins demonstrates the robustness of the method to identify positive hits the possibility of false_positives in the libraries of new cpp and amp however remained and had to be addressed experimentally fourteen cpp sequences and amp sequences were selected to be tested_experimentally for their efficacy a broad range of conditions hydrophobicity amphipathicity and hit scores were covered supplementary_information section supplementaryand cell penetration in a human cell_line and antibacterial_activity against two bacterial_strains reveal that very few false_positives exist for cpp in contrast with amp amp found range from moderate to extremely potent but the fraction of false_positives is significant cellppd retrieved extensive putative cpp regions in c proteins of flaviviruses amp profiling despite less consistent is still significantly shared over these proteins and supplementary this homogeneity is not surprising because all documented flaviviruses c proteins are scp the same evaluation was carried_out for flaviviruses e and m structural proteins supplementary figs s and s these proteins share higher sequence_conservation than c proteins the search for amp and cpp sequences within m proteins revealed that these proteins lack amp sequences and are poor in cpp sequences as for e proteins the results show that within the sequences the region between amino_acid and has high propensity to be a cpp this result is consistent with the fact that e proteins are involved in promoting viral host membrane hemifusion during viral_infection summarizes the data of the occurrence of intrinsic amp and or cpp sequences in each class of structural proteins from flaviviruses c proteins clearly show high potential as sources for peptide_sequences with cell penetrating properties moreover data inare the families with the biggest relative_abundance of cpp or amp domains it is important to stress that all families have proteins with a significant extent of cpp domains ranging from nearly in the envelope_proteins of double_stranded to more than in the c proteins of ssrna the data collected allowed identifying and new viruses derived amp and cpp respectively the similarity among the new amp is nil supplementary_information section although there is mild similarity among new cpp both libraries are remarkable considering that they are the result of guided rational drug_discovery viruses encode package and transport viral nucleic_acids it is therefore not surprising that they contain proteins with domains that are membrane active amp or cpp the unusually_high charge_density of viral c proteins compatible with its inherent genome binding and delivery functions is the basis for the huge potential these molecules have to include amp and cpp sequences nevertheless the incidence of cpp on specific protein classes with preferred viral families shows this property fits specific_biological viruses form functional macromolecular assemblies of proteins genomic_data rna or dna and in some cases lipids which are geometrically organized and very elegantly built these entities self assemble forming metastable structures interact with membranes host and viral while transporting nucleic_acids multifunctional proteins confer greater evolutionary fitness to a virus with length wise restrained genomes a strategy also shared in some bacteria such as e coli completely adapted to surpass different chemical and cellular barriers to fulfill its ultimate_goal viruses are in general composed by very few genes thus viral_proteins must be fraction of amp and cell penetrating domains in structural viral_proteins ss single_stranded ds double_stranded positive_sense negative sense rt reverse transcribing the percentage of amino_acid present in cpp cpp or amp amp domains was calculated as detailed in section of supplementary_information for capsid envelope and membrane_proteins from flaviviruses and viral classes according to the baltimore classification as cataloged in viralzone only viruses with characterized structural protein capsid envelope and membrane sequences in uniprot were selected for the analysis background colors
