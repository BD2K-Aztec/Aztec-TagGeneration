databases_and advance_access genetic simulation resources a website for the registration and discovery of genetic data simulators many simulation_methods and programs have been developed to simulate genetic data of the human_genome these data have been widely used for example to predict properties of populations retrospectively or prospectively according to mathematically intractable genetic_models and to assist the validation statistical_inference and power analysis of a variety of statistical_models however owing to the differences in type of genetic data of interest simulation_methods evolutionary features input and output_formats terminologies and assumptions for different applications choosing the right tool for a particular study can be a resource_intensive process that usually involves searching downloading and testing many different simulation programs genetic simulation resources gsr is a website provided by the national_cancer nci that aims to help researchers compare and choose the appropriate simulation tools for their studies this website allows authors of simulation software to register their applications and describe them with well defined attributes thus allowing site users to search and compare simulators according to specified features availability http popmodels cancercontrol cancer gov gsr contact owing to the cost and availability of genetic samples lack of knowledge of causal_variants that contribute to observed phenotypes and mathematical intractability of complex evolutionary_models computer simulations have been widely used among many applications to predict_outcomes under realistic genetic scenarios e g to compare and verify analytical_methods or tools e g and to estimate_parameters of evolutionary_models e g with increasing power of personal_computers and the availability of computer clusters novel simulation_methods and sophisticated simulation programs have been and continue to be developed to simulate genetic data for new application areas such as large_scale genomic studies despite the availability of a large number of simulation programs choosing appropriate simulation programs for a particular research_topic can be a time consuming process that usually involves studying downloading and testing many different tools with varying quality adding to the difficulties is the fact that many software applications lack comprehensive documentation and use implicit assumptions and terminologies that are familiar only to researchers in particular research_areas as a result at an nci sponsored conference meeting participants recommended creating a web_resource that summarizes available genetic simulation programs genetic simulation resources gsr is a website provided by nci that aims to help researchers compare and choose the right simulation tools for their studies this website allows authors of simulation software to register their applications and describe them with standardized attributes that are understandable to researchers in diverse research_areas visitors of this website can browse a catalogue of genetic data simulators review simulators of interest and search and compare simulators according to specified features this pre sorting allows researchers to focus on the most applicable simulators before starting the time consuming process of downloading and testing the packages themselves
