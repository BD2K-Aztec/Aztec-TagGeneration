sequence_analysis a matlab based tool for accurate detection of perfect overlapping and nested inverted_repeats in dna_sequences palindromic sequences or inverted_repeats irs in dna_sequences involve important biological_processes such as dnaprotein binding dna_replication and dna transposition development of bioinformatics_tools that are capable of accurately detecting perfect irs can enable genome_wide studies of ir patterns in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes different from conventional string comparison approaches we propose a novel algorithm that uses a cumulative score system based on a prime number representation of nucleotide_bases we then implemented this algorithm as a matlab based program for perfect ir detection in comparison with other existing_tools our program demonstrates a high_accuracy in detecting nested and overlapping irs availability_and the source_code is freely_available onpalindromic sequences or inverted_repeats irs are sequences that can form complementary pairing with themselves found in abundance throughout both eukaryotic and prokaryotic_genomes the ability of irs to self pair allows for the formation of dna secondary_structures that serve as intermediates in biological_reactions such as dna_replication and transposition cruciforms can initiate dna_replication by changing the supercoiling level or chromatin_structure affecting the binding of dna_replication regulatory_factors dna hairpins are a result of the palindromic nature of perfect and imperfect irs allowing them to act as the binding_sites of dimeric regulatory_factors and aid in the transposition process both perfect and imperfect irs also have an impact on genomic_structure transposons prefer palindromic insertion_sites transposons can be present in eukaryotic_genomes in a nested manner by occurring within other transposons hence analysis of nested and overlapping perfect irs can aid in a variety of research_areas including the study of regulatory_factor binding_sites and of nested transposons currently available tools in the detection of palindromes do not perform well in terms of result quality to make genome_wide studies of palindromic sequences feasible we need to develop efficient and accurate tools for detecting both perfect and quasi palindromic sequences palindromes contain mismatches and or non palindromic spacers here we describe a novel algorithm for a tool detecting perfect irs implemented as a matlab function capable of running on genome_scale inputs then process each remaining substring with a filtering step to eliminate non irs that happen to be balanced in nucleotide numbers different from conventional string comparison approaches adopted in the existing_tools our matlab program uses a novel prime number based algorithm and can accurately detect nested and overlapping irs of lengths ranging from to nt this tool is practically feasible for perfect ir detection in large dna_sequences hence this tool will assist in the effective and accurate detection of perfect irs in a genome_wide scale
