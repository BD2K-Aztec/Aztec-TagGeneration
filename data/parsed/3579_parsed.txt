genome_analysis pipit visualizing functional_impacts of structural_variations pipit is a gene centric interactive visualization_tool designed to study structural genomic_variations through focusing on individual genes as the functional_unit researchers are able to study and generate hypotheses on the biological impact of different structural_variations for instance the deletion of dosage sensitive genes or the formation of fusion_genes structural_variation is defined as a change of genomic_dna greater than kb in size and can be either balanced or unbalanced a structural_variation may be benign it may influence phenotypes it may predispose to or cause diseases and it may be transmitted to next generations in addition it may also result in the formation of new transcripts through gene_fusion or exon_skipping when breakpoints disrupt gene structures understanding the structural_change in the genome as well as its functional impact is critical for studying phenotypic variations and genetic_diseases in human and model_organisms when structural_variations are studied the structure of these variants are usually visualized by encoding breakpoints on a linear or circular layout other visual encodings such as dot plot and graph representations show the changes in the reference_genome introduced by the structural_rearrangement these visual encodings pose two challenges in analysis of structural_variation data first they focus on size and position rather than the consequence of structural_rearrangement second they introduce an implicit correlation between size and effect whereas small structural_variations may have more severe effects than some large variations therefore an effective visual encoding of structural and copy_number based on functional_units is essential to gain insights into impact on human_health and disease we introduce an exploratory visualization_tool named pipit which uses a novel gene centric visual encoding to examine how gene structures individually are affected by structural_variants pipit takes a genome_variation format file as input and encodes an affected gene structure as a disk showing how it is modified and oriented towards other genes by means of this data abstraction the focus of the structural_variants is shifted from the genomic_distance to the biologically_relevant feature i e the underlying genes this encoding enables swift visual_inspection of genes that are affected by structural_variants which may be examined further if deemed interesting not constrained or biased by variation sizes pipit permits in depth analysis and exploration of structural_variation data pipit introduces a novel visualization paradigm and user_interaction method to examine structural_variants based on the affected gene region it facilitates the study of structural_variants from a gene centric perspective to investigate various events for instance how known dosage sensitive genes are affected or whether gene_fusions are formed future work includes extending the functional_unit to encompass important regulatory_elements as elaborated in the encode_project additionally functions to compare multiple samples from various data_formats such as variant_call and options to incorporate other conventional linear or circular representations are essential for more comprehensive study of structural_variants funding iminds university of leuven research council
