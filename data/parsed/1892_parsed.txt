genetics_and fsuite exploiting inbreeding in dense snp chip and exome data fsuite is a user_friendly pipeline developed for exploiting inbreeding information derived from human genomic_data it can make use of single_nucleotide chip or exome data compared with other software the advantage of fsuite is that it provides a complete suite of scripts to describe and use the inbreeding information it includes a module to detect inbred individuals and estimate their inbreeding_coefficient a module to describe the proportion of different mating types in the population and the individual probability to be offspring of different mating types that can be useful for population genetic_studies it also allows the identification of shared regions of homozygosity between affected_individuals homozygosity_mapping that can be used to identify rare recessive_mutations involved in mono genic or multifactorial_diseases inbreeding is a central concept in genetics in population studies the inbreeding_coefficient f of individuals is evaluated to characterize mating habits in rare_disease studies homozygosity_mapping has been widely and successfully used to localize variants with strong recessive effect by searching for regions homozygous by descent hbd on pedigrees with inbred cases with the availability of dense genome_wide genetic data it is now possible to study inbreeding for individuals without genealogical information several software_packages are available to estimate inbreeding_coefficients using genetic data some of these provide single point_estimates of the inbreeding_coefficient such as plink and genome_wide complex_trait other programs allow the detection of hbd segments in individuals such as plink runs of homozygosity rohs beagle and ibdld however none of these applications provides an integrative solution to exploit inbreeding information fsuite is a user_friendly pipeline composed of several functions integrating festim software it estimates f and proposes population_genetic statistics that are not available in other software such as detecting inbred individuals and inferring parental mating types a homozygosity_mapping statistic with heterogeneity hflod is proposed which gives more importance to hbd segments on individuals with small f with these features it is easy to perform the hbd gwas strategy i e homozygosity_mapping on inbred cases from genome_wide gwas to detect mendelian sub entities of complex_diseases fsuite also provides graphical outputs to facilitate interpretations of homozygosity_mapping results
