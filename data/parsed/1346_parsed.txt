gene_expression detecting differential_protein in large_scale population proteomics motivation mass_spectrometry ms based high_throughput quantitative_proteomics shows_great in large_scale clinical bio marker studies identifying and quantifying thousands of proteins in biological_samples however there are unique challenges in analyzing the quantitative proteomics_data one issue is that the quantification of a given peptide is often missing in a subset of the experiments especially for less abundant peptides another issue is that different ms experiments of the same study have significantly varying numbers of peptides quantified which can result in more missing peptide abundances in an experiment that has a smaller total number of quantified peptides to detect as many biomarker proteins as possible it is necessary to develop bioinformatics_methods that appropriately handle these challenges results we propose a significance analysis for large_scale proteomics_studies salps that handles missing peptide intensity values caused by the two mechanisms mentioned above our model has a robust performance in both simulated_data and prote omics_data from a large clinical study because varying patients sample qualities and deviating instrument performances are not avoidable for clinical studies performed over the course of several years we believe that our approach will be useful to analyze large_scale clinical proteomics_data availability_and r codes for salps are available atmass spectrometry ms in large_scale clinical studies provides new insights into how disease affects our bodies at the molecular level identifying and quantifying thousands of proteins in patients samples even though ms is a powerful_tool in biomedical_research it is subject to white_noise chemical noise and stochastic variation needing robust and sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms one of the challenges in analyzing ms data is the absence of peptide abundance in a subset of the measurements peptides are often not observed because of their low_intensities and this intensity_dependent missing trend can introduce bias into downstream_analyses when it is ignored suggested a normalization procedure using the top l ordered statistics of peptide intensities in each sample l is a user_defined threshold and proposed an imputation approach modeled the random missing mechanism and the peptide intensity_dependent missing mechanism assuming that instrument detection_thresholds vary from one peptide to the other carried_out an intensity based analysis and a presence absence analysis separately and controlled their false_discovery in they argued that logistic_regressions were not adequate to analyze presence absence data when all intensity values were missing for one group however it is not a problem of the logistic_regression but rather a problem of the test_statistics in the logistic_regression in the situation when all or almost all peptide abundances are missing wald tests overestimate p values of the significant tests but log likelihood_ratio do work reliably thus using a mixture_model approach with proper test_statistics instead of fitting two models separately may be better another challenge in the ms data analysis is that experiments sometimes have different total numbers of quantified peptides this phenomenon is often observed in ms studies and is inevitable for large_scale clinical studies because the studies are often performed over the course of several years the quality of patient samples varies because of their different storage time and the performance of the instrument s changes due to the tuning of the ms instruments or the degradation of the liquid_chromatography lc columns over time varying total numbers of quantified peptides result in unequal numbers of missing peptide values across experiments an experiment with a smaller total number of quantified peptides has more missing peptide abundances for example let us assume that experiment a produced quantified peptides and experiment b produced only quantified peptides because the quality of biological_sample b was not as good as a then experiment b has missing peptide intensities compared with experiment a now to investigate this missing mechanism further assume that one peptide named x is present in experiment a but absent in to whom correspondence should be addressed experiment b another peptide named y is present in both experiments the reason why peptide x is absent in experiment b but present in experiment a can be one of the following i peptide x is less abundant in experiment b than in experiment a intensity_dependent missing mechanism ii peptide x is not abundant enough to be in the top quantified peptides total quantification dependent missing mechanism or iii peptide x is missing at random here the total quantification dependent missing mechanism should not be confused with the intensity based missing mechanism the total quantificationdependent missing mechanism implies that peptide x may be less abundant than peptide y that is listed in the top quantified peptides of experiment b however such missing_values are not informative because we are not comparing peptide x with peptide y at least not in this article but comparing the abundances of the peptide x between the experiment a and b thus it would introduce bias if we blindly use the censored approach proposed previously assuming the missing_values are caused by the lower abundance of peptide x in experiment b compared with experiment a karpievitch et_al are only from the intensity_dependent missing mechanism the missing_values in part b result from both the intensity and total quantification dependent missing mechanisms because the missing_values resulting from the varying total quantification are not informative one way to deal with these missing_values is to remove them in this article we propose a significance analysis for largescale proteomics_studies salps that filters the totalquantification dependent missing_values and makes use of the intensity_dependent missing_values using simulated_data we show how salps performs with the missing_values generated from the two mechanisms finally we demonstrate our model performance using proteomics_data of human blood_monocytes in a large_scale clinical study of trauma
