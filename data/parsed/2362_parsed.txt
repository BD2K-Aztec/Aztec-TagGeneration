databases_and impact of ontology evolution on functional_analyses motivation ontologies are used in the annotation and analysis of biological data as knowledge accumulates ontologies and annotation undergo constant modifications to reflect this new knowledge these modifications may influence the results of statistical applications such as functional enrichment_analyses that describe experimental_data in terms of ontological groupings here we investigate to what degree modifications of the gene_ontology go impact these statistical_analyses for both experimental and simulated_data the analysis is based on new measures for the stability of result sets and considers different ontology and annotation changes results our results show that past changes in the go are non uniformly_distributed over different branches of the ontology considering the semantic relatedness of significant categories in analysis results allows a more realistic stability assessment for functional enrichment studies we observe that the results of term enrichment_analyses tend to be surprisingly stable despite changes in ontology and annotation contact ontologies are increasingly used in the life_sciences they provide a uniform vocabulary to describe and structure a domain of interest as a prime example the gene_ontology go contains knowledge about biological_processes bps molecular_functions mfs and cellular_components ccs the categories of go are presented as a directed_acyclic dag with the edges representing relationships between the categories higher_level categories represent more abstract descriptions and encompass all child categories these categories are used to semantically describe genes and gene_products genes are therefore described by the particular category to which they are annotated and by extension by all parent categories that give a more abstract description applications that perform functional_enrichment of gene_sets take advantage of this property to identify more general_categories that contain significantly more signal than expected at random ongoing scientific_research provides new domain_knowledge that needs to be incorporated into ontologies and annotations in the case of go these changes are incorporated on a regular basis with regular public releases this ontology evolution has been previously analyzed and yielded insights into the differences between ontology versions typical ontology changes include the addition of new categories and relationships as well as the revision of the existing structure these ontological modifications can trigger changes in the annotation e g when a category is removed the annotations need to be moved or deleted further annotations may be edited to reflect new knowledge or to eliminate inconsistencies the go has evolved substantially since its inception in its three sub ontologies evolved at different rates and in different ways between and bp increased by about compared with cc and mf see supplementary applying the method described in we can identify how much different parts of go have evolved by aggregating the change intensity in subtrees illustrates that different subsections of the go mf evolve differently the non uniform_distribution of changes may have an effect on functional enrichment_analyses the aforementioned studies only considered changes in the ontology while neglecting the potential effects on downstream_analyses for example how these changes may lead to different results in functional enrichment_analyses while it is rather obvious that the high degree of occurred changes in go and its annotations will impact analysis results it is still unknown whether earlier_findings are significantly affected or even invalidated the impact of ontology changes on functional enrichment_analyses may depend on where the changes are located in the ontology and what kind of changes dominate for example additions of categories at the leaf level might be less critical than structural revisions within the ontology we provide a method to test to what degree changes of go and go annotations goas may affect functional enrichment_analyses we demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of our approach by analyzing two real_world experimental_datasets as well as random datasets for the experimental_datasets we provide an in depth study of the underlying changes and their impact on the analysis results the presented analysis is informative for both ontology curators and users of functional enrichment_methods to whom correspondence should be addressed
