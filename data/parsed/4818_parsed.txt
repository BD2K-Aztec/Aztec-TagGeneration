using isoelectric_point to determine the ph for initial protein crystallization trials motivation the identification of suitable conditions for crystallization is a rate_limiting in protein structure_determination the ph of an experiment is an important parameter and has the potential to be used in data_mining studies to help reduce the number of crystallization trials required however the ph is usually recorded as that of the buffer_solution which can be highly inaccurate results here we show that a better estimate of the true ph can be predicted by considering not only the buffer ph but also any other chemicals in the crystallization solution we use these more accurate ph_values to investigate the disputed relationship between the pi of a protein and the ph at which it crystallizes availability_and data used to generate models are available as supplementaryas the predominant method used to determine molecular_structure x_ray can provide information on the atomic_level processes of proteins and in turn enable the development of therapeutic_drugs in order to determine the structure of a target protein by x_ray the protein must be cloned and expressed before the soluble_fraction is purified for crystallization only when diffraction quality crystals are obtained can the structure be determined although many protein_structures have been solved to date these only account for some of all possible protein targets with membrane protein_structures being particularly challenging and underrepresented the use of a priori information about a protein to ascertain the optimal initial_conditions before experimentation could help reduce the number of trials required which is valuable when protein sample availability is scarce following the advent of online repositories such as the protein_data pdb and the biological macrmolecule crystallization database set up specifically for the development of crystallization strategies it has been possible to analyse the data from successful experiments and determine favourable regions of crystallization parameter_space it has been shown that protein_family can indicate a region of parameter_space in which a protein is likely to crystallize and that properties such as amino_acid frequency sequence_length grand average of hydrophobicity gravy and isoelectric_point pi as well as other properties can determine a proteins propensity to crystallize investigations have also indicated that the isoelectric_point could be used to determine the ph at which a protein with an acidic isoelectric_point is likely to crystallize
