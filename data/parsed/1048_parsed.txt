combining tree based and dynamical_systems for the inference of gene_regulatory motivation reconstructing the topology of gene_regulatory grns from time series of gene_expression data remains an important open_problem in computational_systems existing grn_inference algorithms face one of two limitations model_free are scalable but suffer from a lack of interpretability and cannot in general be used for out of sample predictions on the other hand model based_methods focus on identifying a dynamical_model of the system these are clearly interpretable and can be used for predictions however they rely on strong assumptions and are typically very demanding computationally results here we propose a new hybrid_approach for grn_inference called jump exploiting time series of expression data jump is based on a formal on off model of gene_expression but uses a non parametric procedure based on decision_trees called jump trees to reconstruct the grn topology allowing the inference of networks of hundreds of genes we show the good performance of jump on in silico and synthetic networks and applied the approach to identify regulatory_interactions activated in the presence of interferon_gamma availability_and our matlab_implementation of jump is available atcomputational reconstruction of gene_regulation from expression data is a central problem of systems_biology gene_regulation is a complex process involving multiple control steps at the chromatin transcriptional_and level given the difficulty in measuring and modelling all of these individual processes the identification of a suitable abstraction and associated statistical_inference methodology is vital the gene_regulatory grn abstraction aims at explaining the joint variability in the expression levels of a group of genes through a sparse pattern of interactions elucidating the topology of grns can provide_important in the fundamental biology of the system and suggest possible intervention points in biomedical_applications inferring the topology of a grn from gene_expression timeseries data has been a subject of intense research in computational_biology over the last years current approaches can be broadly divided_into model based and model free approaches model based_methods start by formulating a computational_model of the system usually in the form of differential or difference equations and recast the network_inference problem as learning the parameters of such a model to achieve a sparse pattern of interactions such methods usually employ sparsity inducing priors in a bayesian setting or regularization penalties in an optimization based scenario model based_methods have many appealing qualities the assumptions made are transparently stated and most importantly the generative perspective enables principled predictions of expression levels under perturbations however model based_methods are not free from limitations they tend to be computationally_intensive particularly in a bayesian setting and their parametric nature usually implies very stringent assumptions about the dynamics e g linear which may be difficult to justify biologically model_free avoid the pitfalls of model based_methods by greedily optimizing information_theoretic measures of co variation between pairs of genes such methods typically have good scalability enabling reconstructions of networks of hundreds of genes and have consistently achieved state of the art reconstruction performance in comparative evaluations the lack of an underpinning model also enables great flexibility as the interactions between genes are not constrained to follow a parametric functional representation such flexibility comes at a cost though model_free by their very nature do not have clearly defined semantics in terms of dynamical_systems and cannot be used for prediction in a straightforward way furthermore incorporation of side information which is natural in model based_methods is generally challenging in model_free in this article we aim to bridge the gap between model based and model_free by proposing a hybrid_approach to the network_inference problem called jump our approach starts from a welldefined biologically_plausible model of gene_expression the on off model of gene_expression which we use to model the dynamics of individual nodes reconstruction of the edges is instead based on a non parametric tree based method modelled on the state of the art genie method adapting the tree based method to the probabilistic setting is a novel challenge in machine_learning and involves devising a novel decision function for learning the tree here we introduce the jump tree which uses the marginal likelihood of the nodes dynamical_model as a decision function this choice has several benefits it embeds the tree based learning procedure in the probabilistic_model effectively grounding it as a greedy solution to structure_learning in a large latent_variable model furthermore the use of the marginal likelihood means our method inherits the ease with which side information can be incorporated in probabilistic_models our experiments with both synthetic and real_data show that jump has good scalability and achieve competitive or better results than state of the art alternatives we evaluated the proposed jump procedure on several in silico networks as well as one synthetic network irma as a case study we applied the procedure to expression data from macrophages treated with interferon_gamma ifnc to identify ifnc activated regulatory_interactions in all our experiments ensembles of trees were grown and the main parameter k of the extra trees was set to the number of input candidate regulators for the in silico and irma networks k p where p is the number of genes in the network and k in the case of the ifnc network see later for the description of that experiment elucidating the topology of grns is a fundamental step towards our understanding of how a cell or an organism can respond to its environment despite years of concerted_efforts by the computational_biology community this task is still far from complete and a unified_framework for grn_inference remains_elusive here we presented jump a novel approach to grn_inference which attempts to combine the interpretability of model based_methods with the scalability of greedy model_free thus bridging the gap between the two main classes of grn_inference approaches experiments on simulated and synthetic data show that jump is always competitive and often outperforms state of the art grn_inference procedures while an experiment on a real_dataset shows its potential for biologically_meaningful hypothesis_generation it has good scalability with respect to the number of genes and keeps its good performance when inferring large_networks from a modelling point_of results show that jump yields good predictions of promoter states and that despite its simplicity the on off model is flexible enough to allow good fits of the data while we believe that jump is a step in the right direction we also acknowledge that the complexity of gene_regulation will pose a strict limit to the potential of grn_inference from expression datathe highest aupr is shown in bold for each network the highest aupr is shown in bold for each network the highest aupr is shown in bold in each case alone a first limitation comes from the assumption that the messenger_rna level can be used as a proxy for the protein activity which is often not correct a simple improvement of jump would thus be the exploitation of protein data which are becoming less rare gradually to predict the target promoter states another important direction is the integration in grn_inference algorithms of complementary data such as microrna expression chromatin protein_protein or microbiomes and some promising initial steps in this direction are being taken e g the probabilistic generative_model underlying jump would allow the incorporation of additional information in a natural way via a modification of the likelihood_function while the non parametric tree based_approach would ensure the scalability of the whole procedure using the method on large_networks with relatively few observations may incur co linearity problems i e genes that have very similar profiles leading to confounding_factors in the inference a simple fix to this would be to pre process the data with some clustering_algorithm this would further increase scalability at the cost of some interpretability ultimately a major_limitation for many studies in computational_biology is the lack of systematic large_scale gold_standards on which to evaluate the models this generalized fact reinforces the need for a tight coupling between experimental and theoretical research and we hope that inference methods such as jump could be useful in prioritizing experimental_designs
