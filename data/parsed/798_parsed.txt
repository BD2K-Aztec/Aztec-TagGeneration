blockclust efficient clustering and classification of non_coding from short_read rna_seq profiles non_coding ncrnas play_a in many cellular_processes such as rna_splicing translation gene_regulation however the vast_majority of ncrnas still have no functional_annotation one prominent approach for putative_function assignment is clustering of transcripts according to sequence and secondary_structure however sequence_information is changed by post_transcriptional and secondary_structure is only a proxy for the true d conformation of the rna polymer a different type of information that does not suffer from these issues and that can be used for the detection of rna classes is the pattern of processing and its traces in small rna_seq data here we introduce blockclust an efficient approach to detect transcripts with similar processing_patterns we propose a novel way to encode expression_profiles in compact discrete structures which can then be processed using fast graph_kernel techniques we perform both unsupervised_clustering and develop family specific discriminative models finally we show how the proposed approach is scalable accurate and robust across different organisms tissues and cell_lines availability the whole blockclust galaxy workflow including all tool dependencies is available atgenome wide sequencing revealed that dna is pervasively transcribed with the majority of the dna encoding for non_coding ncrnas ncrnas are important parts of cellular_regulation that were long ignored but have received an increasing level of attention over the past_decade there have been reports of up to predicted ncrnas in the human_genome alone the vast_majority of them having no functional_annotation while the exact numbers and even the magnitude of regulators and interactions are of course a matter of discussion they reflect the current challenge for the analysis of whole transcriptome_data comparatively assigning a putative_function to ncrnas requires the detection of rna_families or classes with a common function rna_families contain sequences that are related via evolution whereas the members of rna classes are defined only by a common function without evolutionary_relationship with mirnas and snornas being well known examples rfam is the largest known collection of known rna_families however only a minor part of the transcriptome is covered by those examples for that reason will et_al there are however several caveats if one relies only on the genomic_sequence and its predicted_secondary first the genomic_sequence is often changed by post_transcriptional the database of rna_modification pathwayslists types of modifications from methylation of rna bases to editing events like c to u or a to i editing see e g su and randau or second the reliability of the classification depends on the quality of secondary_structure which is often low see e g the reason is not only that the energy_model for secondary_structure is incomplete but rna modifications and the influence of rna_binding also add layers of complexity in the case of transcriptome_data an additional problem is that often the full transcript is not seen in the deep_sequencing this implies that one has to perform local secondary_structure which is an even harder task third relying on structure is optimal for structured ncrna but would miss many long ncrnas that often do not have a conserved_structure for a review see e g there is however a similarity other than the genomic_sequence and its predicted_secondary that can be used for the detection of rna classes namely the pattern of processing and its traces in small rna_seq data the reason is simply that these processing_patterns depend on the functional molecule and its d structure and thus should carry information not only about the structure of the polymer but also about all modifications and processing of the rna_molecule this is well understood for prominent examples like mirna where most pre mirna have a hairpin_structure with a nt overhang that are processed into a double_stranded consisting of the mirna and its complement mirna see e g for alternative processing modes see e g computational_approaches for finding new mirnas in deep sequencing_data such as mirdeep rely on the detection of traces of this process it has now become clear that this is not limited to mirna

mrnas into smaller rnas is a widespread regulatory_mechanism examples are trna where there are several species of trna derived fragments such as trna halves trf u trf or cca trf are known similarly snorna derived sdrnas fragments are specific for the snorna class and the size and position distribution of the sdrnas are conserved across species in this article we introduce blockclust an efficient approach to detect transcripts with similar processing_patterns we propose a novel way to encode expression_profiles in compact discrete structures which can then be processed using fast graph_kernel techniques note that in this work we do not deal with long rna_sequences such as messenger_rnas which require to deal with exon boundaries or with extreme variability in length and expression levels rather we consider the transcripts that are retrieved from small rna_seq protocols and we therefore optimize blockclust to process transcripts characteristic of small ncrnas of length nt we perform both unsupervised_clustering and develop ncrna family specific discriminative models finally we show how the proposed approach is scalable accurate and robust across different organisms or
