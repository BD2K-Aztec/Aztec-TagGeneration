reconstructing the temporal_progression of hiv immune_response pathways motivation most methods for reconstructing response networks from high_throughput data generate static models which cannot distinguish between early_and response stages results we present timepath a new method that integrates time series and static datasets to reconstruct dynamic_models of host response to stimulus timepath uses an integer_programming formulation to select a subset of pathways that together explain the observed dynamic responses applying timepath to study human response to hiv led to accurate reconstruction of several known regulatory and signaling_pathways and to novel mechanistic_insights we experimentally_validated several of timepaths predictions highlighting the usefulness of temporal models availability_and data supplementary text and the timepath software are available fromhigh throughput data measuring various aspects of several biological_systems is rapidly_accumulating these include rna_seq studies profiling of micrornas chip_seq epigenetics studies information about protein interactions within a cell and information on interactions between host_proteins and pathogen environmental_factors such datasets provide_extensive information about the sets of genes that are activated their regulation and their interactions both within a cell and between cellular_proteins and the environment or pathogen however integrating these datasets to reconstruct a unified view of the networks and pathways that are activated in order to identify potential interventions that may lead to a desired response remains_a several methods have been proposed to integrate various biological_datasets for this task however the vast_majority of these methods are aimed at obtaining static networks that do not provide temporal_information making it hard to determine the various stages associated with the system being studied for example waves of expression changes or the optimal time to apply an intervention consider the hiv_infection while the development of highly_active has made it possible to delay the progression of hiv_infection the persistence of the virus rapid development of resistance and inability to completely eliminate the virus still pose major challenges for effective hiv management hiv infects a host_cell by a sequential_process involving several temporal events these start with binding of the viral envelope_protein to the host_cell receptor followed by reverse transcription and integration of proviral_dna early infection stage next viral_proteins are produced facilitating viral_replication intermediate_stage finally new viruses are released late_stage while several studies have experimentally quantified the large_scale changes and host_pathogen for hiv_infection to date no models exist to fully link these high_throughput temporal datasets with the underlying dynamic networks that lead to the observed responses a small number of methods have been proposed for reconstructing dynamic_interaction networks from high_throughput data these methods utilize the relatively small number of time series datasets to determine temporal_information for the mostly static interaction datasets either directly by projecting the time series data on the known interaction networks or indirectly by looking at targets of transcription_factors tfs and v c the author published_by
