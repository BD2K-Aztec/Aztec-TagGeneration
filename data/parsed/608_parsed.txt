databases_and automated structural_classification of lipids by machine_learning motivation modern lipidomics is largely dependent upon structural ontologies because of the great diversity exhibited in the lipidome but no automated lipid classification exists to facilitate this partitioning the size of the putative lipidome far exceeds the number currently classified despite a decade of work automated classification would benefit ongoing classification efforts by decreasing the time needed and increasing the accuracy of classification while providing classifications for mass_spectral identification algorithms results we introduce a tool that automates classification into the lipid maps ontology of known lipids with accuracy and novel lipids with accuracy the classification is based upon simple chemical characteristics and modern machine_learning the decision_trees produced are intelligible and can be used to clarify implicit assumptions about the current lipid maps classification_scheme these characteristics and decision_trees are made available to facilitate alternative implementations we also discovered many hundreds of lipids that are currently misclassi fied in the lipid maps database strongly underscoring the need for automated classification availability_and source_code and chemical characteristic lists as smarts search strings are available under an open_source at https www github com princelab lipid classifier lipids are a fundamental component of biological_systems and perform diverse roles in many cellular_pathways they comprise several thousands of structurally_distinct species whose diversity is preserved by dedicated cellular_systems the lipid_composition of a cell is linked to its function hence lipids are excellent subjects for gaining insight into biological_systems and predicting abnormalities indeed lipids are known to play_a in diverse_diseases afflicting millions including obesity diabetes asthma hypertension arthritis and cancers lipidomicsthe analysis of the lipid_composition localization and activity of a cellular or physiological systemis a burgeoning field of research one major_difficulty in studying lipids is dealing with their great structural_diversity to help address this challenge the lipid maps consortium has created and is refining the lipid maps lipid classification system lmlcs which has become the de facto ontology used in lipid research with this ontology the lipid research_community is able to discuss predicted lipid properties and cellular_functions in ways that would otherwise be impossible indeed classification of biomolecules is a prerequisite to any systems_biology approach this is particularly true in the area of mass_spectrometry identification where theoretical fragmentation spectra used for matching with each experimental_spectrum are generated by different sets of rules based on a biomolecules type protein metabolite etc the principle holds true for lipids nearly all existing identification approaches require that a lipid be classified although sometimes implicitly to generate a theoretical spectrum from a lipids structure classification makes possible restricted search_space structural comparisons and even fundamental tasks such as representing lipids in a systematic fashion the benefits resulting from classification are definite but these benefits are currently inaccessible to lipids which have not been previously classified in an enormous feat lipid maps has classified over lipids over the last years still there are more than lipid_species and probably more when considering oxidative modifications yet undiscovered natural_products and unanticipated future synthetic modifications and although automatic classification tools have been alluded to currently there is no publicly_available software for the automated classification of lipids although classification can be performed_manually manual classification cannot be used in any automated software pipelines does not scale well and may not always be accurate we present an approach to generate a classifier trained on the lmlcs which can be used to classify novel lipids automatically and assist in manual classification workflows the classification model for each dataset produces decision_tree output for both manual interpretation and programmatic analysis as in
