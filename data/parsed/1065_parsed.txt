gene_expression comparative_study of rna_seq and microarray derived coexpression_networks in arabidopsis_thaliana motivation coexpression_networks are data derived representations of genes behaving in a similar way across tissues and experimental_conditions they have been used for hypothesis_generation and guilt by association approaches for inferring functions of previously_unknown genes so_far the main platform for expression data has been dna_microarrays however the recent development of rna_seq allows for higher accuracy and coverage of transcript populations it is therefore important to assess the potential for biological investigation of coexpression_networks derived from this novel technique in a condition independent dataset results we collected publicly_available illumina rna_seq high_quality arabidopsis_thaliana samples and generated pearson_correlation coexpression_networks these networks were then compared with those derived from analogous microarray_data we show how variance stabilizing transformed vst rna_seq samples are the most similar to microarray ones with respect to inter sample variation correlation_coefficient distribution and network topological architecture microarray networks show a slightly_higher score in biology derived quality_assessments such as overlap with the known proteinprotein_interaction and edge ontological agreement different coexpression_network centralities are investigated in particular we show how betweenness_centrality is generally a positive marker for essential genes in a thaliana regardless of the platform originating the data in the end we focus on a specific gene network case showing that although microarray_data seem more suited for gene network reverse_engineering rna_seq offers the great advantage of extending coexpression analyses to the entire transcriptome the comprehensive understanding of the functional molecular_mechanisms in the cell is a major_challenge of modern biology network representations have been successfully used to capture various cellular relationships ranging from proteinprotein_interactions to gene regulations and metabolic conversions in these networks biological_entities e g genes proteins and metabolites are represented as nodes and their interactions are represented as edges biological_networks can be assembled either by gathering all existing experimental knowledge over relationships between these entities or alternatively when this kind of data is missing they can be reconstructed by educated inferences based on data profiles the latter approach often dubbed biological_network reverse_engineering has great cost and time advantages over for instance classical forward genetics approaches as it allows to reduce the experimental_investigation to a subset of candidates potentially involved in a particular biological_process in the specific case of reverse engineered gene_networks the last decade has witnessed an avalanche in the availability of transcript_expression data provided mainly by microarray_data which has in turn fueled the generation of coexpression_networks coexpression_networks are undirected graph representations of transcriptional co behaviour between genes within an organism in such graphs genes are connected by edges representing the similarity in their expression pattern across several experiments in which both genes are quantified these similarities are usually calculated by simple methods like pearson_correlation d or by more sophisticated approaches such as mutual_information or linear modelling a significance value is usually associated to each edge to estimate the amount of coexpression between any gene_pair in the case of pearson_correlation this value is the pearson_correlation pcc which ranges from perfect negative linear coexpression to perfect positive linear coexpression whereas no correlation signifies the overall lack of linear relationships between the transcript quantities of the two genes coexpression_networks have been widely generated and exploited in studies aimed at the identification of novel gene_functions via the guilt by association paradigm which assumes that similar expression_patterns correspond to similar functions times of activation or cellular_compartments noteworthy successes of this approach have been obtained for example in identifying novel genes involved in plant cell_wall starch metabolism and in the human b cell leukaemia signal_transduction at the same time several standalone coexpression tools have been developed to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com together with freely_accessible online_databases coexpression_networks have also been studied topologically generally showing a modular_structure and a scale_free distribution of their connectivity barabasi meaning that most genes have a small number of coexpressors while a few genes behave as coexpression hubs however the vast_majority of these studies have neglected the growing availability of rna_seq which provide several potential advantages over microarrays first of all rna_seq does not require prior_knowledge of the studied organism extending its usage even to poorly_characterized organisms both for standard purposes transcriptome definition and differential_gene and for any derived application such as sample clustering or coexpression analysis furthermore rna_seq allows for the identification of all transcripts whereas microarrays usually cover only a subset of the transcriptome for example in arabidopsis_thaliana the most used microarray for quantitative transcriptomics the affymetrix ath covers reliably and unambiguously only genes based on the most recent customcdf annotation which is only a subset of the entire_genome genes in the tair annotation release finally rna_seq has the potential to detect novel transcribed loci on annotated genomes splicing variants and allele specific events massively increasing the investigative capability over these molecular phenomena in the present study we try to determine_whether rna_seq can be efficiently used for coexpression analysis to do so we derive coexpression_networks from a set of high_quality illumina based rna_seq a thaliana experiments and compare them with those extracted from biologically analogous and equally sized microarray_data we determine the nature of these networks both biologically and topologically with an overview on different network centralities and their association with gene_essentiality in arabidopsis finally we focus on two specific gene cases showing how the increased detection range of rna_seq can indeed cover missing areas of the coexpression_networks our results describe the first large_scale samples attempt to use rna_seq collected from multiple tissues and experimental_conditions for gene network reverse_engineering we show that coexpression_networks generated from this novel technology are indeed realistic and accurate with accuracy increasing together with network stringency validating the assumption that rna_seq based coexpression is a better thanrandom selector of real biological_relationships supplementary_file s however our results show that microarray_based coexpression_networks based on simple correlation achieve a higher similarity to biological_networks and at the same time show a low overlap with rna_seq based representations unexpectedly although arabidopsis coexpression_networks are generally positive predictors of proteinprotein_interactions the overlap is quite small and associated to weak mccs in all cases all rna_seq networks show a scale_free topology as previously_noted on a smaller dataset but no rna_seq dataset allowed to reach microarray like network qualities neither as raw counts nor after two popular normalization procedures rpkm and vst and and vst normalized data possess microarray like behaviour with regards to correlation_coefficient distribution and topological network_properties size and degree_distribution and e amongst rna_seq vst networks also possess the highest proximity to microarray networks detected by hierarchical_clustering supplementary_file s and edge intersection supplementary_file s rpkm and raw count networks perhaps owing to the heteroscedasticity of these types of data differ more markedly from microarray networks than vst networks we also find that coexpression_network betweenness_centrality can be calculated from rna_seq and used as a positive marker for a thaliana essential genes the task of identifying essential genes has been called the most important task of genomics based target_validation as these genes are extremely_important not only to understand the minimal requirements for life but also because they are excellent drug_targets another important application of coexpression analysis is in the identification of novel genes and novel gene_functions to this respect we show how rna_seq can be complementary to microarray_data in describing the functional neighbourhood of a pectin metabolism gene or to confirm the connection with jasmonate of a poorly_characterized putative transcription_factor supplementary_file s there are at least a thaliana genes_annotated on the tair genome but not represented by any probeset on the affymetrix ath microarray_platform of these genes have no functional_annotation neither experimentally inferred nor predicted in silico which gives rna_seq the unique possibility to functionally investigate a previously uncovered portion of the transcriptome this potential can indeed be transposed to other organisms as well given the fair conservation of coexpression across species at least in the plant_kingdom all data investigated in this article are preloaded and can be freely analysed by the corto coexpression tool despite its obvious advantages the unexpected relative underperformance of rna_seq versus microarrays in network_reconstruction raises an important caveat on its direct usability for coexpression analysis at least by the simple pearson_correlation criteria used in this work the creation of novel approaches to properly normalize and interpret gene count correlations generated by next_generation will pose a future fundamental challenge for coexpression investigators
