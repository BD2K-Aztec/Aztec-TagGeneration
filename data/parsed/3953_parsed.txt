regional heritability advanced complex_trait for gpu and traditional parallel architectures motivation quantification of the contribution of genetic_variation to phenotypic_variation for complex_traits becomes increasingly compu tationally demanding with increasing numbers of single_nucleotide and individuals to meet the challenges in making feasible large_scale studies we present the regional heritability advanced complex_trait software adapted from advanced complex_trait and in turn genome_wide complex_trait it is tailored to exploit the parallelism present in modern traditional and graphics_processing gpu accelerated machines from workstations to supercomputers results we adapt the genetic_relationship matrix estimation algorithm to remove limitations on memory allowing the analysis of large_data we build on this to develop a version of the code able to efficiently exploit gpu accelerated systems for both the genetic_relationship matrix and restricted_maximum reml parts of the analysis offering substantial speedup over the traditional central_processing version we develop the ability to analyze_multiple small regions of the genome across multiple compute nodes in parallel following the re gional heritability approach we demonstrate the new software using gpus in parallel on one of the worlds fastest supercomputers availability the code is freely_available www epcc ed ac uk software products contact a gray ed ac ukthe majority of traits of interest in relation to animal and human disease livestock breeding and natural and artificial selection can be described as complex in that they are determined by large_numbers of genetic_and as well as their interactions statistical_analysis techniques can be used to quantify the contribution of genetic_variation to phenotypic_variation for complex_traits and genomic prediction large cohorts and dense single_nucleotide snp panels including millions of snps are required to achieve sufficient_statistical for mapping and increased accuracy at the expense of increased computational demand it is of vital importance to tailor algorithmic implementation as closely as possible to modern computational hardware to make the desired studies feasible modern workstations or nodes typically contain one or a few central_processing units cpus each with multiple cores and a memory of limited size larger systems can be built by interconnecting multiple nodes many systems now also feature augmentation with graphics_processing gpus traditionally used for computer gaming these contain typically hundreds_or of simplistic cores and can offer substantial computational advantages when used in conjunction with cpus as compute accelerators thus increased computational performance comes at the cost of increased architectural complexity traditional programming_languages can target only a single core of a single_cpu to fully_exploit modern resources one must embrace parallel programming techniques for each of the different types of parallelism described above different techniques must be used and these can be combined to form hybrid programs able to perform well on systems ranging from simple workstations to the largest of supercomputers in we presented advanced complex_trait acta a software_package for quantifying the contribution of genetic_variation to phenotypic_variation for complex_traits using core functionality from the genome_wide complex_trait gcta software but with dramatically improved computational performance on modern multi core cpus in this article we introduce regional heritability advanced complex_trait reacta a derivative of acta offering several key_advantages in addition to the preexisting functionality first as described in section the genetic_relationship matrix grm estimation algorithm has been adapted to remove memory size limitations and allow the analysis of large_datasets building on this we have developed a version able to exploit gpu accelerated architectures as described in section in section we describe development of functionality allowing a regional heritability approach in which multiple compute nodes can be used in parallel to automatically analyze_multiple small regions of the genome finally in section we present results comparing the performance of the cpu and gpu versions and showcase a demonstrative run using gpus in parallel on one of the worlds largest supercomputers note that whether using the regional heritability approach or not our developments preserve numerical consistency for both grm files and reml results with the original gcta software all our developments are thoroughly tested through use of an automated test suite containing a range of datasets and use cases where of course gcta does not have the functionality to automatically analyze_multiple regions but one can compare single regions manually to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com
