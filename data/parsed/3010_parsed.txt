sequence_analysis mitoseek extracting mitochondria information and performing high_throughput mitochondria sequencing analysis motivation exome_capture kits have capture efficiencies that range from to a significant amount of off target reads are from the mitochondrial_genome these unintentionally sequenced mitochon drial reads provide_unique to study the mitochondria genome results mitoseek is an open_source that can reliably and easily extract mitochondrial_genome information from exome and whole_genome sequencing_data mitoseek evaluates mitochondrial_genome alignment_quality estimates relative mitochondrial copy_numbers and detects heteroplasmy somatic_mutation and structural_variants of the mitochondrial_genome mitoseek can be set up to run in parallel or serial on large exome sequencing_datasets next_generation ngs has enabled high_throughput production of sequencing_data at a low_cost projects such as the cancer_genome tcga and the genomes_project have generated huge_amounts of sequencing_data ngs_data are rich and informative and contain many off target reads that are often ignored but which may be biologically_relevant sequencing_data outside capture regions can produce reliable variation data mitochondrial_dna mtdna sequences are recoverable in exome_sequencing even when the mtdna is not included in the target_region picardi and pesole also provided scripts for assembling mitochondrial_genome exome_sequencing based on those findings we designed and implemented a tool mitoseek for high_throughput secondary mitochondrial data_mining from exome_sequencing or whole_genome sequencing_data mitoseek extracts mitochondrial information from exome_sequencing and performs analyses on four major mitochondrial factors heteroplasmy somatic_mutations relative copy_number and large structural changes owing to the limitation of exome_sequencing mitoseek is not capable of calculating absolute_copy of mtdna only relative mtdna_copy also owing to noise in the sequencing_data mitoseek is more suited to detecting large copy_number rather than small copy_number mitoseek is designed to work with paired_end sequencing_data rather than single_end sequencing_data given the large abundance of paired_end sequencing_data mitoseek is designed with accessibility in mind it considers many unique parameters that have not been implemented by other genome_analysis tools it is the only sequencing analysis tool that reports allele counts separately by forward and reverse strands critical information for assessing strand bias mitoseek creates opportunities for high_throughput mitochondrial sequencing data_mining from existing large exome_sequencing databases
