de_novo motif_discovery facilitates identification of interactions between transcription_factors in saccharomyces_cerevisiae transcriptional_regulation plays_a in gene_expression it typically takes_place after the binding of transcription_factors tfs to specific promoter_regions of genes usually gene_expression is regulated by a group of tfs instead of a single tf when the influence of one tf on its target_genes depends on the presence_or of another tf it is said that these two tfs have interactions in gene_regulation this article aims at discovering tftf interactions that happen on the tf_binding tfbss of the target_genes the two tfs share correct predictions of such interactions are important in studying gene_regulation to whom correspondence should be addressed so_far several types of tftf interactions have been observed and discussed as exemplified in two tfs tf and tf might form a complex and then bind to a common tfbs which is often represented by a tf binding_motif alternatively they might utilize the dna_binding of tf to bind to dna in this case we say that tf indirectly binds to the tfbs piggy back in bothand the two tfs interact with each other through direct proteinprotein_interactions ppis on the other hand it is possible that both tf and tf have their own dna_binding and respective tf_binding as exemplified in tf and tf may not have direct contact but transcription is affected when either one is absent in this type of tftf interaction the tfs regulate expression of the target_genes without directly interacting with each other demonstrates the situation that tf and tf compete for the same tfbs furthermore more complicated situations might exist for example in tf and tf alternatively cooperate with another tf to regulate genes correct prediction of tftf interactions is a prerequisite for understanding transcriptional_regulation according to the fact that an interacting tf pair would jointly regulate a set of target_genes it is intuitively considered that the interaction of a tf pair can be detected by exploring the degree of shared target_genes before going into interaction inference a reliable list of the target_genes of a tf should be constructed recent_advances of highthroughput tools provide such valuable information for example chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip chip_chip measures the binding_affinity of tfs on specific dna_sequences in vivo two groups previously_published considerably large_datasets of chip_chip for yeast these resources have been widely utilized to predict tf_binding and discover cooperating tfs in recent_years another useful technique to effectively detect tfdna interactions in vitro is protein binding microarrays pbms respectively produced datasets of pbm experiments and discovered yeast tfbss based on the detected dna_sequences in this article we proposed a new method that incorporates de_novo motif_discovery in the procedures of analyzing chip_chip data the discovered motifs were employed to refine the lists of target_genes which further improve the accuracy of predicting interactions between tfs by estimating the degree of target overlap between two tfs more correctly the evaluation conducted in this study reveals that the proposed method simtfbs outperforms three nave methods and two recent_studies the predicted tftf interactions are shown to improve the modularity of the currently annotated interacting network which might be still largely incomplete
