structural_bioinformatics apoc large_scale identification of similar protein pockets motivation most proteins interact with small_molecule ligands such as metabolites or drug_compounds over the past several decades many of these interactions have been captured in high_resolution atomic_structures from a geometric point_of most interaction sites for grasping these small_molecule ligands as revealed in these structures form concave shapes or pockets on the proteins surface an efficient method for comparing these pockets could greatly assist the classification of ligand_binding prediction of protein molecular_function and design of novel drug_compounds results we introduce a computational_method apoc alignment of pockets for the large_scale sequence_order independent structural_comparison of protein pockets a scoring_function the pocket similarity_score ps score is derived to measure the level of similarity between pockets statistical_models are used to estimate the significance of the ps score based on millions of comparisons of randomly related pockets apoc is a general robust method that may be applied to pockets identified by various approaches such as ligand_binding as observed in experimental complex structures or predicted pockets identified by a pocket detection method finally we curate large benchmark_datasets to evaluate the performance of apoc and present interesting examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the method we also demonstrate that apoc has better performance than the geometric hashing based method siteengine availability_and the apoc software_package including the source_code is freely_available cssb biology gatech edu apoc in a biological cell small_molecule ligands such as metabolites or drug_compounds constantly interact with their protein receptors this gives rise to or modulates various aspects of protein_function understanding how these interactions take place has been one key goal of many research_efforts for several decades accompanying the advance of structural_determination techniques such as x_ray and nmr tens_of of structures of proteins in complex with small_molecule ligands have been determined at atomic_resolution and deposited in the protein_data pdb thus there is a diverse collection of high_resolution snapshots of proteinligand_interactions that can be examined to help provide functional insight ligand_binding on protein_surfaces where direct_physical contacts form between small_molecule ligands and proteins are of special interest from a structural prospective most of these sites are located within a concave shaped_structure known as a pocket owing to this characteristic a pocket may be detected through a geometrical analysis of protein_structure consequently a number of methods have been developed to predict ligand_binding exploiting the idea among them surfnet uses a sphere filling technique to locate a pocket pocket and ligsite adopt grid based_approaches and cast identifies the pocket through delaunay triangulation and the shape theory alternatively several methods using energy based or template based strategies have also been proposed see a recent review it should be recognized that a protein surface is bumpy and the boundaries of pockets depend on a series of extrinsic and to some extent arbitrary choices e g how far should a pocket extend towards the open space and how high must a ridgeline be for it to delineate two disjoint but adjacent pockets versus a single united pocket the large number of available structures in the pdb provides opportunities for comparative_studies of ligand_binding in general small_molecule ligands can interact with proteins of different structural folds do pockets that recognize similar ligands share some common structural_features if such features exist can we use it to predict protein_function to answer_these global structural_comparison often is not adequate and it is necessary to develop methods for local structural_comparison dedicated to the geometric and or physicochemical features of the protein pockets themselves among existing_methods for pocket comparison a heuristic maximum clique finding algorithm has been widely implemented e g as in cavbase isocleft and soippa in these methods pockets are represented by pseudoatoms all atoms or c atoms and an associated graph is generated wherein nodes are pairs of atoms from two pocket structures and edges represent a similarity relationship the maximum clique found in this graph corresponds to the optimal alignment between the pocket structures another popular type of algorithm used for aligning pocket lining residues is geometric hashing e g siteengine instead of using atoms to represent a pocket spherical harmonics or d zernike descriptors have to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com been proposed to describe protein pockets the reduced pocket descriptors permit fast computation but they do not return a detailed alignment of pocket residues which is useful for certain studies such as the identification of mutations corresponding to subtle changes of substrate_specificity an existing pocket comparison method is usually tied with a specific pocket detection procedure and it is difficult to extend its usage to generic pockets detected by different procedures this difficulty is partly caused by the fact that many scoring_functions for measuring pocket similarity are dependent on the size of the pockets different pocket detection methods can assign different sizes and or numbers of pockets for the same structure as in the case of a global structural_alignment a linear normalization of a similarity_score by the size of a pocket does not eliminate the size dependence issue which is usually non linear most approaches do not properly estimate the statistical_significance of their similarity_score this becomes an issue when one performs large_scale comparisons of the entire pdb to address_these we introduce a new method apoc for the sequence_order independent structural_alignment of pockets on protein_surfaces below a length independent scoring_function ps score is first introduced this is followed by a description of the algorithm which includes iterative dynamic_programming and iterative integer_programming procedures to obtain an optimal sequence_order independent alignment between two protein pockets we then introduce subject control sets for largescale benchmark tests and describe the results of apoc on three types of pockets detected by different pocket detection methods two interesting examples from the benchmark sets are presented finally we compare the performance of apoc to a publicly_available method siteengine
