sequence_analysis rvboost rna_seq variants prioritization using a boosting method motivation rna_seq has become the method of choice to quantify genes and exons discover novel transcripts and detect fusion_genes however reliable variant identification from rna_seq remains_challenging because of the complexities of the transcriptome the challenges of accurately mapping exon boundary spanning reads and the bias introduced during the sequencing library_preparation method we developed rvboost a novel method specific for rna variant_prioritization rvboost uses several attributes unique in the process of rna library_preparation sequencing and rna_seq analyses it uses a boosting method to train a model of good quality variants using common_variants from hapmap and prioritizes and calls the rna variants based on the trained model we packaged rvboost in a comprehensive workflow which integrates tools of variant_calling annotation and filtering results rvboost consistently outperforms the variant quality_score recalibration from the genome_analysis tool kit and the rna_seq variant_calling pipeline snpir in rna_seq samples using ground_truth variants from paired exome_sequencing several rna seqspecific attributes were identified as critical to differentiate true and false variants including the distance of the variant positions to exon boundaries and the percent of the reads supporting the variant in the first six base_pairs the latter identifies false variants introduced by the random hexamer priming during the library_construction availability_and the rvboost package is implemented to readily run in mac or linux environments the software and user_manual are available at http bioinformaticstools mayo edu research rvboost rna_seq has become popular with the decreasing cost and its potential to quantify exon transcript_levels over a large_dynamic discover novel transcripts identify various splicing mechanisms and detect fusion_genes however while the variant identification from dna_sequencing is becoming a routine_practice the variant detection from rna_seq remains_challenging because of the complexity of the transcriptome the ambiguities in mapping exon boundary spanning reads and the artifacts introduced in rna_seq library protocols because expressed genetic_variants have more immediate impact on the protein_function compared with the dna_variants we were motivated to develop a reliable rna_seq variant_prioritization method in general variant detection from massive_parallel data involves two steps first is variant_calling which outputs all positions with any evidence of alternative alleles compared with reference an essential next step is variant_prioritization and filtering to obtain reliable variants of high_confidence for dna sequencing_data the most widely used variant_prioritization method is a mixture_model based_classifier variant quality_score recalibration vqsr within the genome_analysis gatk vqsr integrates multiple attributes annotations of the variants all of which are based on features of sequencing including the depth of coverage strand bias mapping qualities and variant position bias toward the end of the reads vqsr uses variants reported in hapmap as the training source to calculate a filtering criterion and then predicts true novel variants another method snpir proposes a series of arbitrary hard thresholds to filter and reduce the number of false variants after careful examination of the rna_seq variant detection process we proposed to include rna specific attributes annotations for the variant_prioritization model in addition to the features included in gatk furthermore we observed that the gaussian_mixture and the parameter selection used in vqsr are not ideal for modeling these features and proposed to use a boosting method that uses generalized_linear as its base learners this method called the rna variant boosting rvboost is a ranking machine to a train a model based on common_variants in hapmap and b rank the variants accordingly to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup comwe implemented a comprehensive workflow using the framework of gatk that incorporates rvboost to facilitate reliable rna_seq variant_prioritization this workflow outputs called variants with detailed annotations in both the standard variant_calling format vcf and the tab_delimited text format we have shown that rvboost outperforms vqsr in rnaseq samples with paired exome_sequencing we also introduced a key concept of train set quantile score or the train q score to help users determine their preferred precision_recall trade_off
