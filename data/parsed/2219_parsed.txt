genetics_and hla imp an integrated framework for imputing classical hla_alleles from snp genotypes motivation genetic_variation at classical hla_alleles influences many phenotypes including susceptibility to autoimmune_disease resistance to pathogens and the risk of adverse_drug however classical hla_typing methods are often prohibitively_expensive for large_scale studies we previously described a method for imputing classical alleles from linked snp_genotype here we present a modification of the original algorithm implemented in a freely_available software_suite that combines local data preparation and qc with probabilistic imputation through a remote server results we introduce two modifications to the original algorithm first we present a novel snp selection function that leads to pronounced increases up by in some scenarios in call rate second we develop a parallelized model_building algorithm that allows us to process a reference_set of over individuals in a validation experiment we show that our framework produces highly_accurate hla_type imputations at class_i loci for independent datasets at call rates of imputation_accuracy is between and at the four digit level and over at the two digit level we demonstrate utility of the method through analysis of a genome_wide for psoriasis where there is a known classical hla risk_allele hla c we show that the imputed allele shows stronger association with disease than any single snp within the region the imputation framework hlaimp provides a powerful_tool for dissecting the architecture of genetic_risk within the hla availability hlaimp implemented in c and perl is available from http oxfordhla well ox ac uk and is free for academic use an individuals human_leukocyte hla_type which describes the primary structure of the antigen presenting classical hla proteins is an essential immunogenetic parameter which influences susceptibility to many autoimmune and infectious_diseases the risk of certain types of cancer wang to whom correspondence should be addressed transplant compatibility and the likelihood of adverse_drug in many autoimmune_diseases the hla contributes the major fraction of genetic_risk it is generally believed that this is related to variation in the hla proteins binding_affinities but the exact nature of the underlying_mechanisms has remained_elusive in most cases because of the functional_importance of the proteins there is a considerable need for hla_type data in biomedical_research either as an explanatory_variable for example in searching for factors_influencing adverse_drug or a covariate for example in looking for secondary risk_factors in the hla where there is a well characterized primary classical risk_allele hla_type information can be useful in interpreting_results from genomewide_association gwas for example a recent gwas on psoriasis identified a snp at the erap locus which is associated with a significant increase in disease risk but only in hla c positive individuals however lab based hla genotyping through either direct_sequencing allele specific amplification or hybridization is typically slow and relatively expensive costs are several hundred dollars per individual for high_quality allelic information at key class_i loci in contrast imputation of classical alleles from linked snp data while it can never achieve the degree of certainty of lab based_methods is fast and inexpensive this is particularly true for samples for which genome_wide snp data have been collected as part of a gwas in such situations imputation can be performed at no additional_cost and with sufficient accuracy to enable the analysis of large_scale datasets imputation of classical hla_alleles is complicated by the genomic_features of the hla including extensive polymorphism e g hlab with alleles long_range haplotype backgrounds and the influence of natural_selection dehave shown that while some classical alleles can be tagged by single snps this is not generally true and experience has shown that standard snp tagging approaches do not perform consistently well to overcome these problems we previously_developed a probabilistic_approach to classical hla allele imputation here referred to as the ldmhc algorithm which assesses the degree of relatedness between a chromosome with unknown hla_type but known snp types in the region and a reference_set of both snp and hla typed chromosomes based on snp genotypes alone prior to the actual imputation procedure the employed statistical_model is constructed by iteratively selecting informative snps in the reference_set from
