exploring the potential of template based modelling motivation template based modelling can approximate the unknown structure of a target protein using an homologous template structure the core of the resulting prediction then comprises the structural regions conserved between template and target target prediction could be improved by rigidly repositioning such single_template structurally_conserved fragment regions the purpose of this article is to quantify the extent to which such improvements are possible and to relate this extent to properties of the target the template and their alignment results the improvement in accuracy achievable when rigid fragments from a single_template are optimally positioned was calculated using structure pairs from the homstrad database as well as casp and casp target best template pairs over the union of the structurally conserved_regions improvements of in root_mean deviation rmsd and in gdt ha were commonly observed a generalized_linear revealed that the extent to which a template can be improved can be predicted using four variables templates with the greatest scope for improvement tend to have relatively more fragments shorter fragments higher percentage of helical secondary_structure and lower sequence_identity optimal positioning of the template fragments offers the potential for improving loop modelling these results demonstrate that substantial improvement could be made on many templates if the conserved fragments were to be optimally positioned they also provide a basis for identifying templates for which modification of fragment positions may yield such improvements knowledge of the structure of a protein is crucial to an understanding of its function experimental determination of protein_structure is far from keeping pace with the discovery of the amino_acid of proteins thus to further our understanding of the molecular_function of organisms using the growing volume of genomic_information it is necessary to be able to accurately_predict protein_structure from the amino_acid template based modelling tbm the most accurate method of predicting protein_structure exploits the structural_similarities to whom correspondence should be addressed shared between two related proteins as the amino_acid of related proteins diverge through evolution each accumulates insertions deletions and mutations these modifications are manifested in shifts and rotations of structural_elements local deformations and changes in side_chains while the fold of the protein tends to be maintained it is this structural_similarity of related proteins that is exploited by tbm beginning with its amino_acid the unknown or target structure is predicted by approximating it with the structural_features putatively conserved between itself and a known homologous template structure in general tbm proceeds by first identifying the template structures that best approximate the target and subsequently attempting to remove any differences that have accumulated between the target and templates of the two approaches currently adopted one predicts the target by optimizing restraints on inter atomic distances and torsion_angles restraints derived in part from the templates e g modeller in the alternative approach tbm involves the direct_transfer of backbone and or side chain coordinates from the templates to the target structure wherever the targettemplate sequences are aligned it is this last approach with which we are concerned here the component steps of this approach have been modified little since the work of these are i aligning a template and target_sequence ii using the structure from sequence_regions conserved between the template and target to predict the target structure iii prediction of non conserved_regions iv side chain addition and v refinement modification of the resulting predictions current modelling_methods are largely successful in finding the initial approximation that is in selecting the best template and aligning this with the target in the two most recent biennial protein_structure experiments casp and casp for example optimal or nearoptimal template selection and alignment was achieved for most proteins with readily_identifiable templates in spite of this success the majority of final predictions from tbm methods remain inferior to the direct_transfer of coordinates from the best template to the target based on an optimal templatetarget alignment the accuracy with which a template approximates a target is directly related to their sequence_identity si templates with residues identical to the target generally approximate the core to around root_mean deviation rmsd and this may improve to rmsd when sequence_identities rise even for templates with high si to the target differences in packing and contacts may result in the mainchain conformation of the template and target differing by up to several angstroms it is therefore important that tbm be able to predict structures that improve upon the template and for this it is necessary to modify and refine the backbone unfortunately reliable_methods of template refinement have so_far been elusive to completely predict the structure of the target often requires the modelling of regions with no corresponding residues in the templatea consequence of the insertions_and that have occurred as proteins evolve the resulting gaps within the predicted structure must be filled using loop prediction_methods the accuracy of loop prediction is reduced by the distortions present in the unmodified template relative to the target particularly in the residues adjacent to the gaps in the targettemplate alignment known as anchor regions a further benefit of improving upon the template structure may thus be improved accuracy of anchor regions which could then yield more accurate prediction of loops modifying a template to better approximate the target is equivalent to adjusting for the structural_differences that have accumulated between two homologues previously examined the sources of structural_differences within the backbone of conserved_regions and identified all differences as a combination of rigid shifts and rotations of the conserved_region and local deformation of the backbone using proteins from the eight families known at that time the way structural_differences were manifest between homologues was related to both si and type of secondary_structure although a small number of studies such ashave observed shifts and rotations of structural_elements within homologues and some structure alignment_algorithms implement flexible structures no other study quantifies the sources of structural_variation in the conserved_regions of homologues since the analysis of homologues by given that more than proteins have been experimentally_determined in the intervening period it now seems prudent to revisit this topic how much of the structural difference observed between two homologues results from the shifts and rotations of the structural_elements and how much from changes in local conformation this question is critical for determining the nature of the differences that exist between two homologues at one extreme if a large proportion of the differences observed derives from shifts and rotations then such modifications should be considered prior to exploring local changes at the other extreme if all of the differences observed are from changes in local conformation then a tbm algorithm should focus solely on modifying the local conformation here we analyse the extent to which differences between the homologous_proteins are a consequence of shifts and rotations of the conserved_regions we demonstrate the potential value of optimizing the positioning of template regions conserved within the target showing that the accuracy with which the conserved fragments within a template structure can approximate the target is predicted by the number and length of structurally conserved_regions within the alignment the helical proportion of the target and the si we also show that half of the anchor regions have rmsd to the native_conformation decreased by at least when fragments are shifted optimally thus providing scope for more accurate loop modelling the contributions of the current article are fold first the article quantifies the ultimate extent of improvement possible through rotation and translation of structurally conserved_regions of a template so defining the distance to the finish line for such model refinement second the article finds a relationship between the extent of improvement possible and the properties of both the template and the target so providing initial guidelines for establishing the distance to the finish line for a given template it remains as future work to provide explicit rules for repositioning fragments relating the translation and rotation required to local and global properties of the template and target
