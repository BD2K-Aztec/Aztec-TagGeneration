disgenet rdf harnessing the innovative power of the semantic_web to explore the genetic_basis of diseases motivation disgenet rdf makes available knowledge on the genetic_basis of human_diseases in the semantic_web gene_disease gdas and their provenance metadata are published as human_readable and machine processable web resources the information on gdas included in disgenet rdf is interlinked to other biomedical databases to support the development of bioinformatics approaches for translational_research through evidence_based exploitation of a rich and fully interconnected linked open data availability_and http rdf disgenet org contact support disgenet orgadvancements in experimental_technologies give an unprecedented capacity of description of a patient from a molecular point_of translational bioinformatics envisions to push forward biomedical discoveries and to enhance healthcare practice by bridging the gap between these two worlds to create this synergistic translation between molecular data and clinical events it is crucial a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between genotype phenotype and environment that underlie human_diseases to explore these complex relationships current biomedical_research requires leveraging and linking different types of information such as genetic_basis of diseases disease_biomarkers drug therapeutic_applications and side_effects or effects of exposure to environmental_factors but this integration is challenging as the information is fragmented in resources dispersed and often technology or domainspecific or importantly hidden in free_text the emerging semantic_web is gaining momentum in life_sciences as it provides standards to set a semantic and syntactic interoperable infrastructure for data_integration over the web the increasing publication of open biomedical databases structured and interlinked using the w c resource_description rdf and web_ontology owl technologies through projects such as bio rdf and the ebi rdf platform paves the way to answer more complex and sophisticated crossdomain questions in this paper we present disgenet rdf a new open resource in the semantic_web and a new facet of disgenet disgenet is one of the most comprehensive databases on gene_disease gdas for the study of the molecular mechanisms_underpinning human_diseases most of the gdas in disgenet in version have been identified by text_mining the literature using befree and are integrated with curated gdas from a variety of authoritative sources on human_genetics data each gda is explicitly annotated with its supporting evidence which makes disgenet a resource of reference for evidence_based knowledge_discovery with the publication of disgenet rdf we aim to foster the development of bioinformatic_tools to leverage biomedical big_data and to facilitate knowledge navigation and discovery to support translational_research disgenet rdf is a new open resource to harness the semantic_web for new discovery opportunities on the genetic_basis of human_diseases the publication of disgenet rdf and the implementation of an sparql endpoint offer the possibility to integrate disgenet with other lod resources to answer complex biomedical questions disgenet rdf web_site supplies supporting documentation and query examples to help users getting started our aim is to make disgenet information more discoverable and to integrate it with the current open life_science knowledge in order to support projects on the aetiology of human_diseases drug_discovery and toxicological research
