quantifying the distribution of probes between subcellular_locations using unsupervised pattern unmixing motivation proteins exhibit complex subcellular distributions which may include localizing in more than one organelle and varying in location depending on the cell_physiology estimating the amount of protein distributed in each subcellular_location is essential for quantitative_understanding and modeling of protein dynamics and how they affect cell behaviors we have previously described automated methods using fluorescent_microscope images to determine the fractions of protein fluorescence in various subcellular_locations when the basic locations in which a protein can be present are known as this set of basic locations may be unknown especially for studies on a proteome_wide scale we here describe unsupervised methods to identify the fundamental patterns from images of mixed patterns and estimate the fractional composition of them methods we developed two approaches to the problem both based on identifying types of objects present in images and representing patterns by frequencies of those object types one is a basis pursuit method which is based on a linear mixture_model and the other is based on latent_dirichlet lda for testing both approaches we used images previously_acquired for testing supervised unmixing methods these images were of cells labeled with various combinations of two organelle specific probes that had the same fluorescent_properties to simulate mixed patterns of subcellular_location results we achieved and correlation between estimated and underlying fractions of the two probes fundamental patterns with basis pursuit and lda approaches respectively indicating that our methods can unmix the complex subcellular_distribution with reasonably high_accuracy to investigate the subcellular_localization of proteins at a proteomewide scale we need to be able to characterize all observed patterns identification of subcellular localization_patterns from fluorescence_images using supervised_machine has become an established method with excellent results in its field of application to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as however this method is by design limited to hard assignments to classes predefined by the researcher some researchers have explored using unsupervised_learning technologies which do not require the researcher to specify classes these methods still result in each protein being assigned a single label however not all proteins can be thus characterized in particular there are many proteins that exhibit mixed patterns i e patterns that are composed of more than one location for example while some proteins locate in the nucleus and others locate in the endoplasmic_reticulum there is a third group that locates in both of these locations a simple class assignment does not adequately represent the relationship between these three possibilities one alternative is to assign multiple labels to a single pattern in one large_scale study of the yeast proteome a third of proteins were annotated with multiple_locations which demonstrates that this is not a problem confined to special_case proteins however this approach fails to quantify the contribution of each element and shows the need for a system that directly models the mixture phenomenon we have previously presented some methods that address this pattern unmixing problem in a supervised setting given images of fundamental patterns e g nuclear and endoplasmic_reticulum in the above example and mixed images map mixed images into a set of coefficients one for each fundamental pattern these methods were observed to perform well on both synthetic and real_data in recovering the underlying mixture coefficients which had been kept hidden from the algorithm however the supervised approach still requires the researcher to specify the fundamental patterns of which other patterns are composed for example for the quantitative analysis of translocation experiments as a function of time or drug_concentration the extreme points could be easily_identified as the patterns of interest however they are still inapplicable to proteome_wide studies where it would be a difficult and perhaps impossible task to identify all fundamental patterns that are present we note that the set of fundamental patterns that can be identified depends both on the specific cell_type and the technology used for imaging highresolution confocal microscopes being able to distinguish patterns that lower_resolution systems cannot therefore it is necessary to tackle the unsupervised pattern unmixing problem given a large collection of images where none has been tagged as being a representative of a fundamental pattern map all images into a set of mixture coefficients automatically derived from the data a the algorithms use a collection of images as input in which various concentrations of two probes are present the concentrations of the mitotracker and lysotracker probes are shown by increasing intensity of red and green respectively example images are shown from wells containing only mitotracker b only lysotracker c and a mixture of the two probes d in this article we present and compare methods to address this problem using a test_dataset previously created to test supervised unmixing methods we have described two approaches for performing unsupervised unmixing of subcellular_location patterns and demonstrated good performance with both on a test_dataset acquired by high_throughput microscopy and previously used for testing supervised methods in our supervised work we had presented two methods one based on a linear mixture whose adaptation to the unsupervised case results in the basis pursuit method described here and another based on multinomial mixtures which results in the lda model the newer lda model led to slightly better results than the basis pursuit method this model has the apparent disadvantage that it does not return examples of the underlying patterns which couldfor the two fundamental patterns we display the average coefficient for the three discovered fundamental patterns potentially make interpretation harder however we observed that this was empirically not a major_issue as the identified bases were indeed well aligned with the underlying hidden concentrations as opposed to forming a complex_mixture with a difficult interpretation the methods are comparable in terms of computational_cost as it is the image_processing feature computation and particularly the k_means that has the highest cost the clustering is done over objects and even this evaluation set of k images resulted in k objects once the clustering is done both algorithms are very fast therefore in their current forms the lda algorithm is superior it is notable that both unsupervised methods led to higher correlation with the underlying coefficients than the supervised methods a possible cause of this is the appearance of new object types in the mixture patterns under the unsupervised framework with massive clustering these objects might be assigned labels different from the ones of the fundamental patterns while in the comparison of results for different unmixing methods the inferred fraction of pattern is displayed as different intensities of gray black corresponding to pure pattern the design matrix which was kept hidden from the algorithms is shown on the top left for comparison the other three panels are results of computation
