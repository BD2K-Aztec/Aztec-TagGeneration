multilevel regularized_regression for simultaneous taxa selection and network construction with metagenomic count_data motivation identifying disease associated taxa and constructing networks for bacteria interactions are two important tasks usually studied_separately in reality differentiation of disease associated taxa and correlation among taxa may affect each other one genus can be differentiated because it is highly_correlated with another highly_differentiated one in addition network_structures may vary under different clinical conditions permutation_tests are commonly used to detect differences between networks in distinct phenotypes and they are time consuming results in this manuscript we propose a multilevel regularized regression_method to simultaneously identify taxa and construct networks we also extend the framework to allow construction of a common network and differentiated network together an efficient algorithm with dual formulation is developed to deal with the large_scale n m problem with a large number of taxa m and a small number of samples n efficiently the proposed method is regularized with a general l p p penalty and models the effects of taxa abundance differentiation and correlation jointly we demonstrate that it can identify both true and biologically_significant genera and network_structures availability_and software mlrr in matlab is available atmassive s rrna and whole metagenomic shortgun sequencing_data have been generated due to advances in next_generation the goals of metagenomic research are to investigate the hostmicrobiota associations and bacteria interactions and examine how changes in microbiota may affect metabolic_functions and human disease two crucial research problems disease associated taxa genera operational_taxonomic selection and correlation network constructions are usually studied_separately both filter and model based_approaches have been proposed to detect differences in bacteria composition and relative_abundance filter_based statistical_tests select disease associatedbacteria features one at a time and suffer from multiple_comparisons problem modelbased approaches on the other hand identify disease associated taxa through building a sparse prediction model and are efficient for explicitly evaluating the predictive_power of multiple taxa however these methods mainly focus on differences in abundance without considering the interactions among taxa biological and taxa association networks have been constructed with various methods such networks investigate the interactions and causality among group of genes systematically metabolic_networks have also been proven to be powerful_tools for studying the physiological and biochemical characteristics of various functional and evolutionary properties of a cell a local poisson graphical loglinear model and a bayesian generalized graphical_model have been proposed recently for constructing association networks based on rna_seq among all the methods various graphical_models with l regularization are perhaps the most common approach for graphical structure estimation l regularized approaches are based on neighborhood selection for each variable gene i they build a l based sparse regression_model for each x i with the remaining variables x i fx j jj ig and determine the sparse graphical_model with the collected regression_coefficients they have also been extended to dependency network construction with sparse bayesian_network structure_learning l based_approaches automatically identify a number of dependent genes and are computationally_efficient for large_scale network construction but these approaches construct the network without considering differentiation of the genes across different clinical conditions in addition parameters estimated from l penalized_regression are asymptotically biased and l does not always identify the true model consistently therefore elastic_net with al al a which is equivalent to l p p was proposed for choosing highly_correlated genes and l p p penalized_regression was proposed for reducing the biases of estimates in this article we develop sparse multilevel_models for simultaneous gene_selection and network construction and simultaneous common and differentiated network construction under different clinical conditions an efficient algorithm with duality and a general l p p penalty is also developed to deal with the n m problem efficiently we also propose a novel criteria entitled mean parameter difference mpd for k and p selection our methods will be evaluated with simulated and real metagenomic count_data since the variance of metagenomic counts depends on the mean count the data are first transformed to a normal distribution using the arcsin and log_ratio variance stability methods we demonstrate that the proposed approaches successfully_identify true and biological important taxa and network_structures associated with the disease
