genetics_and popoolation identifying differentiation between populations using sequencing of pooled_dna samples pool seq sequencing pooled_dna samples pool seq is the most cost_effective approach for the genome_wide comparison of population samples here we introduce popoolation the first software_tool specifically_designed for the comparison of populations with pool seq data popoolation implements a range of commonly used measures of differentiation f st fishers_exact and cochran mantel_haenszel test that can be applied on different scales windows genes exons snps the result may be visualized with the widely used integrated genomics viewer next_generation of pooled_dna samples allows the comparison of population samples on a genomic_scale thus facilitating the transition from single marker studies to population_genomics due to its cost_effectiveness pool seq can be used for a range of applications the most intuitive application is the comparison of natural_populations to perform standard population_genetic on a genomic_scale e g the comparison of natural arabidopsis lyrata populations from different habitats allowed the characterization of genes involved in heavy_metal tolerance also in experimental_evolution studies pool seq has been used to identify genomic_regions that show high differentiation between different selective treatments finally pool seq offers an enormous_potential for selective genotyping while several tools for analyzing pool seq data of single populations are already available to our knowledge no standalone software to whom correspondence should be addressed tool is available for the comparison of pool seq data for multiple_populations popoolation is a software_tool dedicated to the comparison of allele_frequencies between populations
