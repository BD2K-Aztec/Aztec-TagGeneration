data_and building a high_quality sense inventory for improved abbreviation disambiguation motivation the ultimate_goal of abbreviation management is to disambiguate every occurrence of an abbreviation into its expanded form concept or sense to collect expanded forms for abbreviations previous_studies have recognized abbreviations and their expanded forms in parenthetical expressions of bio medical texts however expanded forms extracted by abbreviation recognition are mixtures of concepts senses and their term variations consequently a list of expanded forms should be structured into a sense inventory which provides possible concepts or senses for abbreviation disambiguation results a sense inventory is a key to robust management of abbreviations therefore we present a supervised approach for clustering expanded forms the experimental result reports f score in clustering expanded forms we then investigate the possibility of conflicts of protein and gene names with abbreviations finally an experiment of abbreviation disambiguation on the sense inventory yielded accuracy and f score using the dataset obtained from medline_abstracts availability the sense inventory and disambiguator of abbreviations are accessible atabbreviations substitute for fully expanded terms e g computed_tomography through the use of shortened term forms e g ct in the bio medical_literature abbreviations are used for various important terms including genes proteins diseases and chemical names results of our experiment section show that of uniprot entries include abbreviations in description and gene name fields reported that abbreviations are used more frequently than expanded forms abbreviations present two major challenges to bio medical text_mining term variation and ambiguity we consider an information_retrieval system that collects documents referring to polymerase_chain because polymerase_chain might be abbreviated as pcr the system is expected to retrieve documents in to whom correspondence should be addressed in this article we described an approach for building a sense inventory of abbreviations results showed that single link clustering with the ml based similarity measure contributed to abbreviation disambiguation the proposed method obtained accuracy and f score on the training and test_sets obtained from medline although the performance figure of abbreviation disambiguation is roughly comparable to the previous work we specially demonstrated the quality of the sense inventory on which abbreviations are disambiguated into concepts or senses results also show that broader contexts e g abstracts and sentences were more useful than local contexts e g neighbor words for abbreviation disambiguation a future direction of this study is to apply the methodology of abbreviation management for medline_abstracts to full paper articles because the proposed method can handle variation and ambiguity problems of abbreviations we plan to explore the impact of abbreviation disambiguation to other textmining tasks such as information_retrieval named_entity and co reference resolution
