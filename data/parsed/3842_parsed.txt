data_and quantitative_trait prediction based on genetic_marker array data a simulation_study motivation using simulation_studies for quantitative_trait qtl we evaluate the prediction quality of regression_models that include as covariates single_nucleotide snp genetic_markers which did not achieve genome_wide significance in the original genome_wide but were among the snps with the smallest p value for the selected association test we compare the results of such regression_models to the standard approach which is to include only snps that achieve genome_wide significance using mean square prediction_error as the model metric our simulation_results suggest that by using the coefficient of determination r value as a guideline to increase or reduce the number of snps included in the regression_model we can achieve better prediction quality than the standard approach however important parameters such as trait heritability the approximate number of qtls etc have to be determined from previous_studies or have to be estimated accurately height is one of the classic human traits studied by many statisticians it is easy to measure and data are readily available galton and fisher studied the problem extensively using a model of polygenesa large number of independently segregating genes each contributes a small equal and direct effect on the observed continuous phenotype fisher illustrated that mendelian approach and the biometric approach to population_genetics can be bridged using height as an example there are many subsequent studies on the genetic_variations of height in different population height is found to be highly_heritable its heritability is for european_populations and for asian_populations with the advent of genome_wide snp chip technology it is now feasible to search for genetic_associations with height at a genome_wide level several genome_wide gwass for height have been conducted by and have been combined using meta_analysis approaches based on a total_sample of to whom correspondence should be addressed we examine scenarios with different number of qtls and and different values of the overall heritability h in terms of the genetic effect_sizes of each qtl we evaluate two models an additive uniform genetic model where each qtls contribution is equal and an additive geometric where each qtls contribution follows a geometric sequence to the effect of the trait to assess the performance of the standard approach i e the inclusion of snps in the regression_model that achieve genomewide significance we assess the statistical_power to discover the qtls in the training_dataset for the additive uniform genetic model our simulation_results are summarized insnps in the regression_model increases the number of non qtl also increases and eventually the quality of the prediction is affected the association tests find most of the qtls if the heritability is high for traits with lower heritability more non qtls will be included by chance however as expected the value for r continues to increase as the number of predictive snps increases and seems to be a good indicator of the number of qtls found note that the r value we used is computed directly from the training_set theoretically it is always bounded between and it is different from the r value from the validation dataset if r is small the signal is too weak to detect the qtls too many non qtls are included in the predictive set hence the prediction outcome will be poor regardless however if r is sufficiently_large it indicates that most of the qtls have already been included the prediction outcome will be reasonable if we just use or reduce the number of significant snps for the prediction model for values of r between and we can safely increase the number of snps in the prediction model if we want to improve the quality of prediction if a reference validation dataset is available the actual number of snps to be included in the prediction model can be set to where the minimum mspe is for the additive geometric genetic model the association_signal is concentrated on a very small number of qtls the effects from subsequent qtls beyond the first few are too weak to be detected in the training_set and also too small to contribute substantially to the prediction model the results are summarized in the plots of since this scenario for the qtl distribution is not supported by current gwass it is not further discussed in this manuscript besides uniform and geometric series a recent paper byproposes a method to estimate the effect size_distribution based on gwas we have not assessed the different prediction qualities based on those distribution estimates in this report as we have demonstrated by the simple_linear technique it is very difficult to determine the optimal number of markers that should be used for prediction the minimum mspe and probably other metrics as well depends on other model_parameters the standard model which uses only the significant snps was compared page
