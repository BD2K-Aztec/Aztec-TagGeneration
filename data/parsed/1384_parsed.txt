differential regulation enrichment_analysis via the integration of transcriptional_regulatory and gene_expression data motivation although many gene_set have been proposed to explore associations between a phenotype and a group of genes sharing_common biological_functions or involved in the same biological_process the underlying_biological of identified gene_sets are typically unexplained results we propose a method called differential regulation based enrichment_analysis for gene_sets dragen to identify gene_sets in which a significant proportion of genes have their transcriptional regulatory_patterns changed in a perturbed phenotype we conduct comprehensive simulation_studies to demonstrate the capability of our method in identifying differentially_regulated gene_sets we further apply our method to three human microarray expression datasets two with hormone treated and control samples and one concerning different cell_cycle results indicate that the capability of dragen in identifying phenotype associated gene_sets is significantly superior to those of four existing_methods for analyzing differentially_expressed gene_sets we conclude that the proposed differential regulation enrichment_analysis method though exploratory in nature complements the existing gene_set and provides a promising new direction for the interpretation of gene_expression data with the maturation of high_throughput techniques such as dna_microarrays and rna_sequencing rna_seq in gene_expression on a genome_wide scale interpretations of the vast amount of gene_expression data have now become a standard task in biological studies as a typical example genes_differentially in normal and cancer samples are often identified as associated with the cancer of interest thereby providing clues for finding biomarkers and drug_targets for the diagnosis and treatment of the cancer nevertheless a biological_function is usually raised by the collaborative effects of multiple gene_products instead of individual proteins with this understanding methods have been proposed to find or rank sets of differentially_expressed forming the research direction of gene_set to mention a few proposed a method called gsea gene_set to detect pre defined gene_sets that are enriched with differentially_expressed based on a weighted kolmogorovsmirnov statistic put forward a method called overrepresentation analysis ora to determine which part of a gene_set is differentially_expressed by making use of the hypergeometrical distribution relied on a permutation approach to prioritize gene_sets that are composed of a large proportion of marginally differential expressed genes and named their method significance analysis of function and expression safe although the earlier methods are capable of providing a list of differentially_expressed gene_sets from a collection of pre defined candidates two important questions remain largely untouched in the gene_set literature first how to take regulatory_relationships between genes in a candidate gene_set into consideration second what is the reason behind the observation that a gene_set is differentially_expressed to answer the first question several network based_methods have been proposed in the literature for example netgsa adopted a mixed_linear to test the significance of gene_sets gene graph enrichment_analysis ggea detected consistency between transcriptional regulatory_relationships and gene_expression levels by using a petri_net with fuzzy_logic pathway recognition algorithm using data_integration on genomic models paradigm incorporated pathway interactions as well as many types of omics_data to infer activities of pathways in patients differential_expression for pathways deap was capable of detecting paths in input pathways with the most differential_expression these methods addressed the first question by taking regulatory_relationships or interactions between genes into consideration but left the second question unanswered the expression of a gene is a complicated process regulated by several factors among which transcription_factors tfs play a to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com crucial_role therefore the change of the expression_level of a gene in an abnormal phenotype may mainly be attributed to the alteration of the genes transcriptional_regulatory pattern it has been reported that such alterations in transcriptional_regulation usually initiated by mechanisms such as genetic and epigenetic_modifications are often observed among abnormal phenotypes including the vast categories of cancers for example mutations occurring in tfs can lead to retargeting on the promoters of specific oncogenes in breast_cancer mutations occurring in the promoter_region of the telomerase enzyme coding_gene can drive the development of melanoma more generally tf encoding_genes with chromosomal_translocations have been distinguished resulting in mistargeting and transcriptional dysregulation among cancers furthermore by investigating transcriptional_regulatory constructed for different cell_lines with chip_seq it has been reported that a large proportion of regulatory_interactions vary across different phenotypes however such significant alterations in transcriptional_regulation which typically occur in specific cellular environments in response to stimuli accompanying abnormal phenotypes can hardly be identified and explained by the traditional analysis of differential expression_patterns of the genes involved indeed in order to capture subtle changes of transcriptional regulatory_patterns in abnormal phenotypes a novel computational_approach beyond the traditional identification_of or gene_sets is required with the above motivation we propose to connect the observed expression levels of a set of genes with their underlying transcriptional regulatory_patterns and further detect alterations in the regulatory_relationships from gene_expression data specifically we achieve_this by putting forward an approach_called differential regulation based enrichment_analysis for gene_sets dragen that integrates gene_expression data and a transcriptional_regulatory to identify differentially_regulated gene_sets dragen uses a linear_regression to explain the relationship between the expression_level of a target_gene and that of a tf thereby connecting regulatory_patterns between tfs and target_genes to their expression_profiles with this rigorous statistical_model dragen converts the problem of detecting differentially_regulated gene_sets to a series of hypothesis_testing problems followed by the fusion of multiple p values to obtain the statistical_significance of each candidate gene_set thereby enabling the ranking of the candidates we conduct comprehensive simulation_experiments to demonstrate the superior_performance of dragen apply it to an estradiol treated mcf cell_line an androgen treated lncap cell_line and a hela cell_line at different cell_cycle and show the capability of this method in finding gene_sets associated with relevant phenotypes
