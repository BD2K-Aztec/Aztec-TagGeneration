bioinformatics_discovery sequence_analysis two distinct ssb protein_families in nucleo cytoplasmic large dna_viruses motivation eukaryote infecting nucleo cytoplasmic large dna_viruses ncldvs feature some of the largest genomes in the viral world these viruses typically do not strongly depend on the host dna_replication systems in line with this observation a number of essential dna_replication proteins such as dna_polymerases primases helicases and ligases have been identified in the ncldvs one other ubiquitous component of dna replisomes is the single_stranded ssb protein intriguingly no ncldv homologs of canonical ob fold containing ssb proteins had previously been detected only in poxviruses one of seven ncldv families i was identified as the ssb protein however whether i is related to any known protein_structure has not yet been established results here we addressed the case of missing canonical ssb proteins in the ncldvs and also probed evolutionary_origins of the i family using advanced computational_methods in four ncldv families we detected homologs of the bacteriophage t ssb protein gp we found the properties of these homologs to be consistent with the ssb function moreover we implicated specific_residues in single_stranded at the same time we found no evolutionary link between the t gp like ncldv ssb homologs and the poxviral ssb protein i instead we identified a distant relationship between i and small protein b smpb a bacterial rna_binding thus apparently the ncldvs have the two major distinct sets of ssb proteins having bacteriophage and bacterial origins respectively the largest currently known viruses belong to the group of eukaryotic nucleo cytoplasmic large dna_viruses ncldvs at present this group of double_stranded dna_viruses is classified into seven families replication of these large viruses typically does not strongly depend on the host dna_replication and transcription systems in line with the large genome_size and the relative replication independence comparative_genomics studies revealed that ncldv genomes encode essential dna_replication proteins including dna_polymerase helicase and primase however conspicuously absent among the identified conserved ncldv protein_families were canonical single_stranded ssb proteins the ssb function in nature is strongly associated with the specific structural solution oligonucleotide binding ob fold featuring a five stranded barrel capped with an helix to our knowledge there are only two documented exceptions where the structure of an ssb protein is unrelated to ob fold the two exceptions include adenovirus and thermoproteales a clade of hyperthermophilic crenarchaea given the importance of ssb proteins in various dna transactions the seeming absence of canonical ob fold ssb proteins in ncldv genomes was all the more intriguing although in poxviruses one of seven ncldv families the ssb protein i has been identified whether it is based on the ob fold or some unrelated structure has not yet been established in this study we aimed to resolve the puzzle of missing canonical ob fold ssb proteins in the ncldvs and to explore the evolutionary_origins of the enigmatic poxviral ssb protein_family
