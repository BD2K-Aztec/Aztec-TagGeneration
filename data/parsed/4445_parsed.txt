structural_bioinformatics structural and energetic determinants of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase sulfation specificity motivation tyrosine sulfation is a type of post_translational ptm catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases tpst the modification plays_a in mediating proteinprotein_interactions in many biologically_important processes there is no well defined sequence_motif for tpst sulfation and the underlying determinants of tpst sulfation specificity remains_elusive here we perform molecular_modeling to uncover the structural and energetic determinants of tpst sulfation specificity results we estimate the binding_affinities between tpst and peptides around tyrosines of both sulfated and non sulfated proteins to differentiate them we find that better differentiation is achieved after including energy costs associated with local unfolding of the tyrosine containing peptide in a host protein which depends on both the peptides secondary_structures and solvent_accessibility local unfolding renders buried peptidewith ordered structures thermodynamically available for tpst binding our results suggest that both thermodynamic availability of the peptide and its binding_affinity to the enzyme are important for tpst sulfation specificity and their interplay results into great variations in sequences and structures of sulfated peptides we expect our method to be useful in predicting potential sulfation sites and transferable to other tpst variants our study may also shed light on other ptm systems without well defined sequence and structural specificities after their synthesis in the ribosome many proteins undergo post_translational ptm such as glycosylation phosphorylation and peptide hydrolysis before reaching their fully functional_forms tyrosine sulfation is a common ptm occurring on many proteins that transit through the golgi_apparatus such as extracellular_matrix proteins serine_protease and g_protein so_far hundreds of tyrosine sulfated proteins have been identified and more are likely to be discovered a list of sulfated proteins can be obtained from the uniprot database a major functional role of tyrosine sulfation is to mediate proteinprotein_interactions sulfation is vital for many biological_functions as indicated in studies showing that postnatal viability vision fertility and growth are affected in mice in the absence of sulfation the functioning of many proteins including p_selectin chemokine_receptors platelet_glycoprotein ib depends on tyrosine sulfation for example the sulfation of tyrosine in the chemokine_receptor is necessary for hiv_gp mediated entry of hiv into cd t lymphocytes a detailed understanding of the molecular_mechanism of tyrosine sulfation is therefore important for manipulating such modifications regulating cell_signaling and drug_development sulfation is catalyzed by the tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase tpst enzymes which reside inside the golgi_apparatus the process involves the transfer of a sulfo group from a bound phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate paps to the phenol group of tyrosine in humans two isoforms tpst and tpst are found with sequence_identity between them the functional differences between the isoforms or the necessity of two such isoforms are not well established sulfation occurs only on specific tyrosines in proteins even though up to of tyrosines in a cells proteome can be sulfated the location of sulfated tyrosines are not known for many proteins hence neither the exact role of sulfated tyrosines in these proteins nor the mechanism by which the tyrosines are selected for sulfation is fully understood analysis of the amino_acid flanking sulfated tyrosines suggested some general_features such as the presence of acidic and small residues absence of disulfide_bonds or glycosylated residues and a reduced number of hydrophobic_residues in the vicinity of sulfated tyrosines however there are also many exceptions to these general_characteristics of sequence_specificity for example mutational_studies reported an enhanced sulfation efficiency when tyrosines were flanked by basic_residues therefore in contrast to other ptms such as n glycosylation which recognizes structurally available nx t s triplets a well defined sequence_specificity for tyrosine sulfation cannot be established owing to the lack of obvious sequence_patterns sophisticated statistical_tools have been developed to predict potential to whom correspondence should be addressed locations of sulfation sites in a given protein sulfinator constructed four different hidden_markov to recognize sulfated tyrosine_residues depending on their locations in the sequence near n_terminal near c terminal in the center of a window of at least amino_acids and in windows containing multiple tyrosines in predsulsite physicochemical_properties of amino_acids along with predicted secondary_structures and amino_acid sequence_order are considered in a supported vector machine svm the svm algorithm has also been applied in another predictor based on predicted secondary_structures and solvent_accessible these statistics based tools work satisfactorily in their test cases and have been useful in experimental_studies of protein sulfation however these training based statistical_methods depend heavily on the quality of the training_set such as the coverage and completeness which is not the case for the increasing list of sulfated proteins identified experimentally as a result many exceptions were observed in cases beyond the training_sets and these methods are also not transferable to other tpst variants such as recently_discovered bacterial tpsts most importantly many of these methods are sequence_based and the constructed predictors lack structural or physicochemical insights to the molecular_mechanism of tyrosine selection by tpst enzyme recently a high_resolution structure of human tpst has been solved at a resolution in complex with a high_affinity peptide using x_ray making it possible to study the structural and energetic determinants of tpst sulfation specificity in this work we adapt eris a method developed to compute protein_stability changes on mutations to estimate the binding_affinities between tpst and various peptide substrates to differentiate sulfated and non sulfated sequences that have been experimentally_verified we find that the peptidetpst binding_affinities cannot separate the sulfated and non sulfated sequences satisfactorily better differentiation is achieved after including energy costs associated with local unfolding of the tyrosinecontaining peptides in the host protein which depends on both the peptides secondary_structures and solvent_accessibility the thermodynamic population of the locally unfolded peptides determines the availability of the peptide for tpst binding and subsequent catalysis therefore our study suggests that both the thermodynamics accessibility of a peptide and its binding_affinity to tpst are important for sulfation the interplay of these two factors allows a great variety in sequences and structures of sulfated peptides where a buried peptide with well defined secondary_structure might be sulfated if the peptide undergoes local unfolding making itself available for enzyme binding the tpsp enzyme has an n_terminal cytoplasmic_domain a transmembrane_domain anchoring the protein in the golgi membrane a putative stem region and a luminal domain that catalyzes the tyrosine sulfation the protein exists as a homodimer and the structure of the catalytic_domain has been solved recently in its dimeric_form pdb id ap the peptide binds to a welldefined deep pocket a part of which is at the inter monomer interface
