data_and anatomical entity mention recognition at literature scale motivation anatomical entities ranging from subcellular structures to organ_systems are central to biomedical_science and mentions of these entities are essential to understanding the scientific_literature despite extensive efforts to automatically analyze various aspects of biomedical_text there have been only few studies focusing on anatomical entities and no dedicated methods for learning to automatically recognize anatomical entity mentions in free form text have been introduced results we present anatomytagger a machine_learning system for anatomical entity mention recognition the system incorporates a broad array of approaches proposed to benefit tagging including the use of unified_medical umls and open biomedical_ontologies obo based lexical resources word representations induced from unlabeled text statistical truecasing and non local_features we train and evaluate the system on a newly_introduced corpus that substantially extends on previously available resources and apply the resulting tagger to automatically annotate the entire open_access scientific domain literature the resulting analyses have been applied to extend services provided by the europe pubmed central literature_database availability_and all tools and resources introduced in this work are available from http nactem ac uk anatomytagger during the past_two there has been increasing research interest in the development of resources and methods for automatically processing the biological and medical scientific_literature to address the multiple challenges created by its size and increasingly rapid_growth annotated resources and tools targeting various aspects of scientific texts have been introduced including for example mentions of gene names chemicals and organisms relations such as proteinprotein_interactions drugdrug_interactions and molecular_events and biological_processes such as gene_expression protein_phosphorylation viral_infection and angiogenesis much of recent work in biomedical natural_language and text_mining has focused on molecular level entities and processes addressing e g the detection of gene name mentions and proteinprotein_interaction statements however a comprehensive analysis of biomedical_text requires automatic systems to address entities also at other levels of biological_organization in this study we focus on the development and large_scale application of a machine_learning system on for the recognition of mentions of anatomical entities organism parts at levels of organization between the molecular and the whole organism building on a state of the art entity mention tagger based on conditional_random we implement and evaluate a variety of approaches for improving mention recognition_performance for training and evaluation we extend existing corpora through manual_annotation to create a large open domain cross_species resource covering both publication abstracts and full text documents the developed integrated system anatomytagger can be applied either as a standalone tagger a component in pipelines based on the unstructured information management architecture uima or as a web_service and complements existing_tools for the recognition of molecular_entities and whole organism mentions to facilitate comprehensive analysis of entity references in biological and medical text to further advance such analysis and to demonstrate the feasibility of large_scale tagging we apply the system to all available open_access domain publications recognizing million anatomical entity mentions the contribution of this study is thus fold the introduction of a new integrated corpus the detailed_evaluation of multiple methods and resources for anatomical entity tagging the implementation of a new system incorporating the best performing approach to tagging and the application of this tagger to the entire openaccess literature all contributed tools and resources are made available under open licenses we have presented anatomytagger a system for the recognition of anatomical entity mentions in free_text the machine learningbased tagger integrates a variety of techniques shown to benefit tagging performance including manually_curated lexical resources word representations induced from unannotated text statistical truecasing and non local_features evaluation demonstrated that all techniques incorporated into anatomytagger were beneficial compared with a strong baseline tagger and that the final integrated system outperforms previously_introduced methods for comparable tasks we then applied a uima implementation of the tagging pipeline to the entire open_access biomedical literatureover full text documentsto create an automatically tagged resource of million entity mentions we are currently applying the method to the entire europe pubmed central literature and integrating the results into the europe pubmed central search and analytics services all tools and resources introduced in this work are available under open licenses from http nactem ac uk anatomytagger
