structural_bioinformatics galaxygemini a web_server for protein homo oligomer structure_prediction based on similarity a large number of proteins function as homo oligomers therefore predicting homo oligomeric structure of proteins is of primary importance for understanding protein_function at the molecular level here we introduce a web_server for prediction of protein homo oligomer structure the server takes a protein monomer structure as input and predicts its homo oligomer structure from oligomer templates selected based on sequence and tertiary quaternary_structure similarity using protein model structures as input the server shows clear improvement over the best methods of casp in predicting oligomeric structures from amino_acid availability http galaxy seoklab org many proteins self assemble into oligomers to perform their biological_functions for example certain enzymes form substrate binding_pockets at their dimer interfaces whereas antibodies form oligomers to create additional binding_sites increasing effective binding_affinity via a multivalent effect pluckthun many membrane_proteins also form oligomers for effective signal_transduction knowledge of the protein oligomeric_state is therefore crucial for understanding protein_function at the molecular level in the case of experimental protein_structures deposited in the protein_data pdb oligomeric states may be annotated by the authors or can be assigned from crystallographic information through the protein interfaces surfaces and assembly pisa database when such information is not available e g for protein model structures prediction of the oligomeric_state is required recent_studies that homology_based homo oligomer prediction_methods can be more powerful than ab_initio methods methods for prediction of protein oligomeric structures were assessed in a blind fashion for the first time in the th critical assessment of protein_structure casp in this experiment participants were asked to predict homo oligomer structures from amino_acid surprisingly no method performed better than navenave predictors that take the top ranking protein by hhsearch sodingsoding as a template implying that the current methods for prediction of oligomeric structures are ineffective with substantial room for improvement in this context we introduce a new web_server galaxygemini for predicting protein homo oligomer structure which shows clear improvement over navenave predictors on two test_sets identification of the correct number of subunits in an oligomer was evaluated by measuring the relative accuracy for more precise evaluation of the predicted structure the contact agreement score s agree was measured which reflects the fraction of correctly modeled interface contacts in the complex both measures were used in the casp assessment and explained in supplementary_information galaxygemini increased relative accuracy from for the navenave predictor naveseqscorenaveseqscore that takes the hhsearch top ranker by sequence score to for the training_set pisa benchmark set and from to for the test_set casp set the sum of s agree over the targets increased from to for the training_set and from to for the test_set when experimental monomer structures were used as input supplementary when tertiary_structures predicted by galaxytbm were used as input for the casp set the sum of s agree increased from to d for target based comparison galaxygemini outperforms all other casp predictors including navenave predictors by the two measures implying that galaxygemini may be successfully_applied to sequence_based oligomeric structure_prediction a successful example of casp target t na highlights the strength of galaxygemini supplementary this protein forms a dimer through an inter chain sheet the best template determined by the naveseqscorenaveseqscore grg is monomeric but galaxygemini successfully selects a dimer template fm which has an oligomer structure similar to the native_structure resulting in a high s agree of
