an integrative somatic_mutation analysis to identify pathways linked with survival_outcomes across cancer_types motivation identification of altered pathways that are clinically_relevant across human_cancers is a key challenge in cancer_genomics precise identification and understanding of these altered pathways may provide novel insights into patient_stratification therapeutic_strategies and the development of new drugs however a challenge_remains in accurately identifying pathways altered by somatic_mutations across human_cancers due to the diverse mutation spectrum we developed an innovative approach to integrate somatic_mutation data with gene_networks and pathways in order to identify pathways altered by somatic_mutations across cancers results we applied our approach to the cancer_genome tcga dataset of somatic_mutations in cancer patients with different types of tumors our analysis identified cancer_type altered pathways enriched with known cancer relevant_genes and targets of currently available drugs to investigate the clinical_significance of these altered pathways we performed consensus clustering for patient_stratification using member genes in the altered pathways coupled with gene_expression from patients from tcga and multiple independent cohorts confirmed that the altered pathways could be used to stratify patients into subgroups with significantly different clinical_outcomes of particular significance certain patient subpopulations within the last few years studies using high_throughput have highlighted the fact that the development and progression of cancer hinges on somatic alterations these somatic alterations may disrupt gene_functions such as activating oncogenes or inactivating tumor_suppressor and thus dysregulate critical pathways contributing to tumorigenesis therefore precise identification and understanding of disrupted pathways may provide insights into therapeutic_strategies and the development of novel agents many large_scale cancer_genomics studies such as the cancer_genome tcga and the international cancer genome consortium icgc have performed integrated analyses to draft an overview of somatic alterations in the cancer genome many of these studies have reported novel candidate cancer genes_mutated at high and intermediate frequencies in specific cancers as well as across many cancer_types however it is still a challenge to translate somatic_mutations in tumors into the pathway model for clinical use recently in order to improve the clinical_relevance and utility of somatic_mutation analyses proposed integrating somatic_mutation data with molecular_interaction for patient_stratification they demonstrated that inclusion of prior_knowledge captured in molecular_interaction could improve identification of patient subgroups with significantly different histological pathological or clinical_outcomes and discover novel cancer related pathways or subnetworks in a similar manner other network based_methods have demonstrated that incorporating molecular_networks and or biological_pathways can improve accuracy in identifying cancer related pathways one limitation of these network based_methods is that they are not designed to fully utilize large_scale somatic_mutation data from multiple_cancer to determine which particular pathways are altered by somatic_mutations across a range of human_cancers in addition due to the incomplete knowledge of existing gene_sets and or pathway_databases these methods are limited in detecting pathways based on a number of altered genes_annotated in existing gene_set and pathway_databases alternatively the methods that build pathways de_novo without incorporating biological prior_knowledge can be applicable to detecting altered pathways but these methods were also not designed to detect cancer_type or commonly altered pathways to address these we developed an algorithm named ntripath network regularized sparse non negative tri matrix_factorization for pathway identification to integrate somatic_mutation genegene_interaction networks and gene_set or pathway_databases to discover pathways altered by somatic_mutations in cancer patients with different types of cancers incorporating existing gene_set or pathway_databases enables ntripath to report a list of altered pathways across cancers and make it easy to determine compare which particular pathways are altered in a particular cancer type s in particular the use of the large_scale genome_wide somatic_mutations from cancer patients enables ntripath to explore modular structures of mutational data within a cancer type and or across multiple_cancer using matrix_factorization to identify cancer_type or commonly altered pathways in addition the use of genegene_interaction networks with somatic_mutation and pathway_databases enables ntripath to classify genes which were not annotated in existing pathway_databases as new member genes of the identified altered pathways based on connectivity in the genegene_interaction networks the questions that we investigate here are whether large_scale integrative somatic_mutation analysis that integrates somatic_mutations across many cancer_types with the genegene_interaction networks and pathway database can reliably identify cancer_type or common pathways altered by somatic_mutations across cancers whether the identified pathways can be used as a prognostic_biomarker for patient stratificationwith the assumption that the altered pathways contribute to cancer_development and thus impact survival in these experiments we demonstrated that the cancer_type and commonly altered pathways identified by ntripath are biologically_relevant to the corresponding cancer type and are associated with patient survival_outcomes we also showed that cancerspecific altered pathways are enriched with many known cancerrelevant genes and targets of available drugs including those already fda_approved these results imply that the cancer specific altered pathways can guide therapeutic_strategy to target the altered pathways that are pivotal in each cancer type we conducted simulation_experiments using synthetic datasets to investigate the performance of ntripath to discover cancer typespecific altered pathways and identify new member genes in the pathways then we performed experiments with tcga mutation profiles to identify cancer_type altered pathways across cancers in the experiments using tcga datasets we first ran ntripath to identify cancer_type altered pathways across cancers to investigate the clinical_relevance of the identified cancer_type pathways we collected gene_expression data from tcga and independent datasets and performed consensus clustering using the member genes in the identified cancer_type pathways for patient_stratification
