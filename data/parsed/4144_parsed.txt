'sciencenet' towards a global search and share engine for all scientific_knowledge modern biological_experiments create vast_amounts of data which are geographically distributed these datasets consist of petabytes of raw_data and billions of documents yet to the best of our knowledge a search_engine technology that searches and cross_links all different data types in life_sciences does not exist we have developed a prototype distributed scientific search_engine technology sciencenet which facilitates rapid searching over this large data space by bringing the search_engine to the data we do not require server farms this platform also allows users to contribute to the search index and publish their large_scale data to support e science furthermore a community driven method guarantees that only scientific content is crawled and presented our peer to peer approach is sufficiently scalable for the science web without performance or capacity tradeoff availability_and the free to use search portal web_page and the downloadable client are accessible at http sciencenet kit edu the web_portal for index administration is implemented in asp net the askme experiment publisher is written in python and the backend yacy search_engine is based on java most commonly known search_engine technologies bing google are based on popularity ranking algorithms however scientific_research has special requirements for search_engines that cannot be addressed by popularity ranking in all cases special search_engines for example scirus pubmed google_scholar web_of scopus concentrate more on providing content from scientific_journals and literature other meta search_engines cross_link several centralized databases via a single search interface for example bioinformatic harvester eb eye entrez ensembl string todays scientific search queries require searching across different data_sources that are geographically distributed often different data types like high_content hcs image data or sequence_based data require special databases that present a challenge to the global search_methods mentioned above the latest_developments in high content high_throughput microscopy and nextgeneration_sequencing routinely produce experimental_datasets in the terabyte tb range resulting in millions of data_files to the best of our knowledge there is no central_database to encompass all experiment datasets due to the fact that large_scale data_handling is a challenge for any known data publication platform uploading all this data to a centralized database is currently too time consuming and expensive also maintaining a centralized infrastructure over the years is costly consequently it is likely that no single library alone will be able to index the entire science web research strongly benefits from accessible data that provides a valuable resource for comparative and novel studies thus a decentralized search and publishing network that can handle multiple data types at different locations will significantly improve the scientific_research process
