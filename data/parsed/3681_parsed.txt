prediction of ribosome footprint profile shapes from transcript sequences motivation ribosome_profiling is a useful technique for studying translational dynamics and quantifying protein_synthesis applications of this technique have shown that ribosomes are not uniformly_distributed along mrna_transcripts understanding how each transcript specific distribution arises is important for unraveling the translation mechanism results here we apply kernel smoothing to construct predictive features and build a sparse model to predict the shape of ribosome footprint profiles from transcript sequences alone our results on saccharomyces_cerevisiae data show that the marginal ribosome densities can be predicted with high_accuracy the proposed novel method has a wide_range including inferring isoform specific ribosome footprints designing transcripts with fast translation speeds and discovering unknown modulation during translation availability_and a software_package called riboshape is freely_available at https sourceforge net_projects riboshapegene expression is a fundamental biological_process consisting of two parts transcription of mrnas from dnas and translation of proteins from mrnas studying the genome_wide dynamics of both processes is crucial for understanding how cells function and respond to various environmental_conditions thereby giving rise to the impressive complexity of living_organisms due to technological challenges translation has not been studied as extensively as transcription but recent_advances in experimental_protocol and sequencing_technology are providing an unprecedented opportunity to examine the translation process at base_pair resolution ribosome_profiling applies either translation inhibitors or a flash freeze protocol to immobilize the ribosomes walking along the transcript and the ribosome occupied regions each of length nucleotides can then be extracted and sequenced providing detailed positional_information about ribosomes such snapshots of ribosome footprints enable quantitative monitoring and analysis of translational dynamics making ribosome_profiling an important technique for studying protein_synthesis in particular it has been shown that protein_abundance correlates better with ribosome densities than with mrna_abundance various factors may influence the translation mechanism it has been proposed that the differential usage of synonymous codons also known as the codon_usage is driven by evolutionary_forces to facilitate translation speed this hypothesis is supported by the finding that transcripts with wobble base_pairing encounter slower elongation and also by the analysis of trna adaptation_index tai another hypothesis associates the mrna secondary_structure with translation efficiency in particular near initiation sites studies have found that initiation is the rate_limiting of translation and that ribosome densities tend to be higher near initiation sites in saccharomyces_cerevisiae also positively_charged on nascent peptides have been found to influence the footprint abundance we refer the reader tofor a review of the major findings from utilizing ribosome_profiling although the debate surrounding the main determinant of translational dynamics remains_open the above_mentioned hypotheses have one thing in common that is the transcript sequence_context plays an important role in governing the efficiency of translation hence investigating how transcript specific distributions arise and to what extent they depend on the transcript_sequence is essential toafter the filtering step described in section we grouped genes according to their length into bins codons codons codons codons and codons we then decomposed each ribosome footprint profile using wavelet_analysis with daubechies basis and eight scales as illustrated in for comparison we also considered a model with the symmetric kernel f n with the same set of bandwidths as well as a model with no kernel smoothing we trained the regression_model using n randomly_chosen genes where n is the number of genes in the corresponding bin and chose the regularization_parameter in via five fold_cross using the training data then the model was tested on the genes that were left out and the process was repeated until every gene has been tested results of chx treated footprints in various spaces are summarized in the average performance is presented in terms of the pearson_correlation between the predicted and the true ribosome marginal densities notice that our method using asymmetric kernels achieved high_accuracy in subspaces v through v this suggests that the global shape of transcript specific ribosome footprint profile is well captured by our proposed kernelsmoothed codon sequences the performance in the subspace v k decreases as k increases this is partly due to noise in the read_alignment or the sequencing noise inherent in ribosome_profiling thus wavelet_analysis is useful for studying the limit of the ribosome_profiling technique and focusing on the reliable signals the results from using non smoothed codon sequences were the least accurate supporting that the neighboring codons or interference play_an in ribosome footprint distributions using asymmetric kernel smoothing produced more accurate results than using a symmetric kernel the same trend also holds for flash freeze ribosome profiles the performance of our method on chx treated ribosome profiles was better than that on the flash freeze profiles this may be due to the large_amplitude of ramps near the end in chx treated profiles these ramps contribute significantly to global shapes and can be well captured by asymmetric kernel smoothing in general our method with asymmetric kernels was able to predict the global shape of transcript specific ribosome density with high_accuracy however for the flash freeze data the correlation in the subspace v was relatively poor for the genes shorter than codons this is because the global shape of their profiles in this subspace was rather flat for the flash freeze data if the mean squared error is used as the performance measure the results for shorter genes are not so much worse than that for longer genes as an example shows the ribosome density of ybr w in various subspaces and the corresponding predictions for both chx treated and flash freeze profiles shows heatmaps of the regression_coefficients for transcripts of length codons in the space v this result shows that cga arginine ccg proline and cgg arginine have a strong influence on the global shape of ribosome occupancy in flash freeze data while cga and cgg seem to have the dominant effect in chx treated data this may be related to wobble base_pairing which has been found to be associated with slow elongation in particular high ribosome occupancy has been observed on wobble paired proline ccg g u base_pairing and arginine cga i a pairing by furthermore cga is one of the codons with the most prolonged elongation rates consistent with lareau et_al to examine further how the distribution of codons may affect the shape of ribosome footprint profiles we carried_out a slidingwindow analysis for each transcript using a window_size of codons for each transcript we first identified all windows for which the average ribosome density was larger than twice the transcript wide average ribosome density and then considered those windows for codon enrichment_analysis for each selected window let x x x x denote the observed codon distribution where x i is the number of codons of type i within the window we compared this observed codon distribution with the expected accuracy of the prediction of marginal densities for chx treated and flash freeze ribosome footprint data ns sk and ask respectively denote using no kernel smoothing using symmetric kernel f n and using asymmetric kernels f sg f srg the pearson_correlation between the prediction and the measured ribosome density was averaged over genes the results are listed for different spaces s and various gene lengths the prediction achieves high_accuracy in the global shape spaces e g v and v as the scale increases i e as the index m of v m increases prediction becomes more difficult length method chx subspace s flash freeze subspace s codons prediction of ribosome footprint profile shapes from transcript sequences i distribution g g g g where g i denotes the expected number of codons of type i within the window assuming sampling codons without replacement according to the codon distribution in the entire transcript note that g follows a multivariate hypergeometric_distribution we performed a paired_t on x and g over the selected windows and identified the codons enriched in high ribosomeoccupancy regions we then compared the p values from the enrichment_analysis with the frequencies of the regression_coefficients being nonzero as illustrated in the scatter_plot for flash freeze data shows that all of the significantly_enriched codons were selected frequently by the regression_model codons that were selected frequently but not significantly_enriched in high_density regions might have been selected for prediction in low ribosomal density regions for example it has been observed previously that ggg and gtt are some of the codons with the least footprint abundance for the chx treated data there were a few codons enriched significantly but not selected frequently this could be due to technical biases in the data discussed in section our results on s cerevisiae data especially the chx treated footprints show that the global shape of transcript specific ribosomein particular they show that codons cga ccg and cgg strongly influence the global shape of ribosome occupancy in flash freeze data while cga and cgg seem to have the dominant effect in chx treated data i t y liu et_al density can be predicted with high_accuracy this suggests that the ribosome distribution along a transcript indeed depends on the sequence_context in particular we find a few codons that dominate the global shape these codons influence the ribosome density not only at the site where they appear but also their neighboring positions there are several possible reasons why applying kernel smoothing to codon sequences helps in predicting the shape of transcriptspecific ribosome occupancy profile one possible reason is the interference among ribosomes another possible explanation is that the physical footprint of each ribosome spans multiple codons codons lastly it has been shown that positively_charged on nascent peptides significantly slow down ribosomes downstream from where the residues are encoded among all the methods compared the asymmetric kernel smoothing performed the best this could be due to the directional movement of ribosomes and the aforementioned effect of positively_charged on downstream elongation speeds also ramps can be better predicted using asymmetric kernels which partly explains why the prediction_accuracy for chx treated ribosome profiles was slightly better than that for flash freeze profiles there are other factors not incorporated into our current model that could also help to explain ribosome distributions e g mrna secondary_structure notice that in the results for chx treated ribosome footprints we achieved better performance in shorter genes when applying a sliding_window to genes with a prediction correlation_coefficient below and of length codons we observed that the correlation was lower near the end furthermore when computing differences between the observed ribosome densities and the predicted densities from these poorly predicted genes we noticed a weak positive correlation r between the differences and the likelihood of double_stranded conformations i e the pars parallel analysis of rna_structure scores of secondary_structure defined byin a genome_wide measurement although many potential factors including mrna secondary_structure codon_usage trnaadaption index etc are not explicitly incorporated into our model most of these factors depend on the sequence_context this may be one of the reasons why considering transcript sequences alone enables reasonably accurate prediction of ribosome footprint profile shapes it is possible that some of the features learned by our predictive_model are due to technical biases in the data library_construction is a possible source of bias due to technical_artifacts artieri and fraser found three types of nucleotide biases by comparing mrna fragments unprotected by ribosomes with ribosome footprints to identify shared biases these include an enrichment of adenine at the and ends and a depletion of cytosine at the fourth nucleotide position in both the mrna and ribosome footprint reads however we note that the flash freeze ribosome footprint data we analyzed were generated using a comprehensive set of adapter sequences to avoid the biases discussed in artieri and fraser furthermore the flash freeze protocol avoids the ribosome run off phenomenon that can occur in chx pre_treatment different models have been proposed in the literature to estimate elongation rates developed a continuous time discrete state markov_model to simulate translational dynamics in which initiation and elongation rates were inferred using the cell_volume ribosome abundance and trna abundance these elongation rates were codon dependent but not position dependent the model proposed bywas based on flow conservation and it assumed that the occurrences of the same codon within an mrna_transcript have the same dwell time and hence the same elongation_rate our results suggest that these models should take the codon position into account in other words the elongation_rate at a particular position along a transcript not only depends on the codon at that position but also the neighboring codons and how the neighboring codons are ordered part of the results presented in this paper is based on combining four publicly_available datasets this overcomes the difficulty of sparse sampling that other work may encounter e g although our study is limited to the steady_state distribution of ribosomes it examines the extent to which the sequence_context influences ribosome distributions under normal conditions one of the important_applications of our method is to examine the positions where the steady_state prediction is significantly different from the actual measurements these positions may lead to important findings of unknown_factors that regulate translation for example our proposed method can be applied to cells grown under various environmental_conditions or to ribosome profiles_obtained by different inhibitors e g harringtonine anisomycin another application is the inference of isoform specific ribosome footprints it is known that many human genes have more than one isoform and these isoforms contribute to the complexity of phenotypes studying the translation of specific isoforms requires correctly assigning ribosome footprints to them however since the footprints of ribosomes are short nucleotides identifying the correct isoform becomes challenging our method provides a likelihood_function for ribosome location and can facilitate sequence_alignment when more than one alignment exists synthetic_biology is another active research area that can benefit from our work the ability to predict and compare the ribosome densities along different transcripts under various environmental_conditions can facilitate the search for sequences with optimal translational properties and reduce the number of experimental_trials necessary to build and test the sequences
