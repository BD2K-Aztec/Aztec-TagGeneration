genome_analysis expedit a webserver to explore human rna_editing in rna_seq experiments expedit is a web_application for assessing rna_editing in human at known or user specified sites supported by transcript data obtained by rna_seq experiments mapping data in sam bam format or directly sequence_reads in fastq short_read archive sra format can be provided as input to carry out a comparative_analysis against a large collection of known editing sites collected in darned database as well as other user provided potentially edited positions results are shown as dynamic tables containing university of california santa_cruz ucsc links for a quick examination of the genomic_context availability expedit is freely_available on the web atrna editing is a post_transcriptional mechanism challenging the central dogma of molecular_biology according to such phenomenon genetic_information is enzymatically overwritten at specific sites to generate transcripts different from their corresponding genomic templates for a comprehensive_review see historically rna_editing has been described for the first time as the insertion and the deletion of uridine residues in mitochondrial rnas of kinetoplastid protozoa nowadays the term rna_editing is also used to indicate post_transcriptional changes due to specific base_substitutions such alterations may affect coding as well as non_coding located in different cellular_compartments and occur in a variety of organisms including prokaryotes animals plants and viruses through unrelated biochemical_mechanisms in mammals and in particular in human nuclei the a to i conversion is the most frequent type of rna_editing catalyzed by the adar adenosine_deaminase acting on rna family of to whom correspondence should be addressed enzymes that requires double_stranded as a substrate to carry out the deamination inosines are commonly interpreted as guanosines by splicing and translational machineries as well as sequencing enzymes several a to i changes have been described in coding_regions causing amino_acid with functional consequences the vast_majority of editing sites however have been recently found in repeated regions of the human_genome and especially in alu rich segments although the functional and physiological role of many human edits is currently elusive the molecular_mechanism of rna_editing is indispensable to preserve the cellular_homeostasis deregulation of rna_editing has been associated to a variety of pathological phenotypes including several neurodegenerative_diseases moreover mice_lacking the adar activity die during or soon after the weaning a to i conversions in human have been mainly discovered computationally by analyzing alignments of messenger_rna mrna expressed_sequence est_sequences against their source genome padlock experiments in combination with deep_sequencing have also been used to confirm computationally selected editing candidates in different human tissues nowadays editing changes are known in human and they are freely_available through the specialized darned database the extraordinary coverage provided by rna_seq methodology can now provide a comprehensive transcriptome snapshot dramatically improving our understanding of gene_expression dynamics in different tissues developmental_stages or pathological_conditions massive transcriptome_sequencing offers the great opportunity to explore and investigate posttranscriptional changes due to rna_editing indeed the huge amount of short_reads generated by the rna_seq provides significant support for individual genomic positions after the appropriate mapping strategy and facilitates the identification of a to g conversions rna_seq experiments therefore may allow large_scale detection of editing sites thus contributing to elucidate their functional_roles in a variety of tissues developmental_stages and physiological_conditions a large amount of rna_seq is now publicly_available through the sra repository at national_center ncbi however no tool has been developed so_far to investigate such data as well as newly produced rna_seq to fill this gap we developed an ad_hoc web
