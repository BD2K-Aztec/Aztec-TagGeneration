demonstrate its ability to infer tumor impurity and ploidy and identify genomic_aberrations in complex tumor_samples availability_and the climat software_package can be freely downloaded atvarious aberrations such as amplification deletion and translocation of segmental regions are common features of cancer_genomes and play_an in tumorigenesis and progression it is reported that dysfunction of oncogene and tumor_suppressor is related to frequent genomic_aberrations genomic_aberrations in specific regions have been used as an indicator of aggressiveness of cancer and clinical_outcome genome_wide copy_number cna and loss_of loh are two essential features of cancer_genomes and accurate detection of these abnormalities is a crucial step to assess genomic_aberrations and cancer_related experimental_technologies are now available for high_throughput profiling of genome_wide aberrations in tumor_samples such as array_comparative single_nucleotide snp_genotyping array and more recently whole_genome wgs technology for massively_parallel of dna by allowing for comprehensive analysis of genomic_aberrations in cancer_genomes wgs has been demonstrated as an efficient platform for studies of human_cancers although several computational_approaches have been proposed for assessing genomic_aberrations from tumor sequencing_data most of these methods do not effectively address the critical issues encountered in interpreting complex tumor_samples for example tumor_samples are often infiltrated with normal stroma resulting in inevitable contamination of normal dna and dilution of somatic aberration signals impurity of tumor sample can significantly alter wgs_data and therefore complicates genomic aberration detection especially when normal cells dominate in tumor_samples recent_studies such as freec and apolloh have been proposed to address_this freec constructs copy_number and b allele_frequency baf profiles to detect cna and allelic content in cancer_genomes with optional correction for tumor impurity apolloh is designed for loh detection using tumor normal paired_samples and the issue of tumor impurity is addressed by a two component mixture_model for allelic read_counts in addition to tumor impurity tumor aneuploidy is another critical issue in genomic aberration detection which is caused by various numerical and structural chromosomal_abnormalities frequently observed in cancer genome although apolloh introduces a delicate statistical_model to eliminate the effect of tumor impurity it does not take account of tumor aneuploidy in modeling and analyzing tumor wgs_data to handle aneuploid tumor_samples freec provides to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms

please_contact permissions_oup com an option for users to input tumor ploidy currently automatic correction for tumor aneuploidy using wgs_data still remains_a theoretically it is often difficult to determine the actual ploidy of cancer_cells by sequencing_technology in some particular cases somatic aberration signals could present similar characteristics among genomes of different ploidy which makes it hard to accurately estimate the tumor ploidy it should be pointed_out that complicated interpretation of wgs_data are even more challenging in tumor_samples confounded by both tumor impurity and aneuploidy as they usually cannot be solved separately so_far only a few algorithms have been proposed for analyzing wgs_data of impure tumor_samples with aneuploidy for example cnanorm uses a mixture normal distribution for ratios of tumor normal read_counts to correct tumor impurity and aneuploidy however cnanorm assumes that the most common component in the normal mixture is diploid which may not hold for aneuploid tumor_samples moreover it cannot detect loh in cancer_genomes another approach absolute is originally introduced to detect cna from snp_array by inferring tumor impurity and ploidy although it can be adapted to analyze dna sequencing_data a previous study shows that the underlying statistical_models used by absolute do not comprehensively describe the characteristics of dna sequencing_data and therefore may sometimes gravely misestimate the tumor impurity and ploidy recently markus et_al introduced a novel method called patchwork for allele specific copy_number analysis of sequenced tumor_tissue in consideration of tumor impurity and tumor aneuploidy which requires intermediate arguments determined by users in addition it is noteworthy that another method called theta was proposed recently to analyze tumor sequencing_data theta mainly focuses on the inference of cancer subclones in heterogeneous tumor_samples and cannot detect loh in cancer_genomes as it only utilizes read count_data therefore it is essential to develop an efficient approach for analysis of tumor sequencing_data by comprehensively addressing the challenge of tumor impurity and aneuploidy in this study we present a novel method called climat cna and loh assessment in impure and aneuploid tumors to detect genomic_aberrations with automatic correction for both tumor impurity and aneuploidy without requiring a matched normal sample climat fully explores both read_depth rd and allele_frequency derived from tumor wgs_data and provides extensive data_processing procedures including elimination of sequencing mapping bias and quantile normalization qn of allele_frequency data by adopting an integrated hidden_markov hmm that quantitatively delineates tumor impurity and ploidy climat provides accurate identification of various kinds of genomic_aberrations even for highly impure tumor_samples with aneuploidy we apply climat to both simulated and real tumor data and the results demonstrate the superior_performance of climat in analysis of genomic_aberrations using tumor wgs_data
