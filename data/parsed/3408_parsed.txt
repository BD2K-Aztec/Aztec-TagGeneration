genome_analysis paired_end rad_seq for de_novo and marker design without available reference motivation next_generation have facilitated the study of organisms on a genome_wide scale a recent method called restriction_site associated dna_sequencing rad_seq allows to sample sequence_information at reduced complexity across a target_genome using the illumina_platform single_end rad_seq has proven to provide a large number of informative genetic_markers in reference as well as non reference organisms results here we present a method for de_novo of paired_end rad_seq data in order to produce extended contigs flanking a restriction_site we were able to reconstruct one tenth of the guppy genome represented by bp contigs associated to ecori recognition_sites in addition these contigs were used as reference allowing the detection of thousands of new polymorphic_markers that are informative for mapping and population genetic_studies in the guppy availability a perl and c implementation of the method demonstrated in this article is available under http guppy weigelworld org weigeldatabases radmarkers as package rapid the availability of increasing amounts of dna sequence_information has greatly_facilitated studying of many biological_questions especially in the context of genome_evolution natural_variation and adaptive_processes and association_mapping nextgeneration_sequencing ngs_technologies have revolutionized the field of genome research at first by allowing cheap resequencing projects for organisms with an already existing reference_genome recently more and more methods have been developed incorporating ngs to analyze also non reference organisms taking_advantage of improvements such as longer read_lengths and pairedend pe reads however de_novo assemblies of large_genomes from very short_reads remain difficult in spite of recent improvements in assembly algorithms yet for a large number of interesting questions a high number of genetic_markers equally_distributed over the genome would already be very informative even without a complete_genome to whom correspondence should be addressed developed a protocol for high_throughput of restriction_site rad tags using the illumina_platform radseq it has the advantage that only a reduced representation of the genome is sequenced leading to deep sequence_coverage of fragments near a specific type of restriction_site they showed that single_end se sequencing of rad tags could be used for rapid marker development in stickleback for which a reference_genome is available since then se rad_seq has become a popular tool in next generation population_genetics in addition illumina pe sequencing could extend the sequence_information on each side of the restriction_sites because each rad can provide a unique genomic_sequence tag that can be characterized without its immediate genomic_context the first reads may be aligned to each other building subsets that are associated to one restriction_site each as a strategy for obtaining longer sequence_tags we exploited the fact that random mechanical shearing leads to a family of staggered second reads that can be assembled to longer subsets associated to the re site defined by the first read cluster this strategy subdivides the assembly problem into a high number of less complex local assemblies in this study we analyze pe rad_seq data from two very diverged guppy populations namely quare and cumana which have been previously used to generate a genetic_linkage the guppy poecilia retitculata is an important model_organism in ecological genetics and adaptation to contrasting habitats has been extensively_studied in field_experiments however due to the lack of a sufficient number of genetic_markers the molecular background is still unknown we show that our approach can generate de_novo rad tags that are bp_long and cover of the guppy genome furthermore these tags can be used as reference to design thousands of new polymorphic_markers useful for population_genetic and mapping studies all tools developed for the analysis can be downloaded from http guppy weigelworld org weigeldatabases radmarkers as package rapid
