gene_expression independent surrogate_variable to deconvolve confounding_factors in large_scale microarray profiling studies motivation a common difficulty in large_scale microarray_studies is the presence of confounding_factors which may significantly skew estimates of statistical_significance cause unreliable feature_selection and high false_negative to deal with these difficulties an algorithmic framework known as surrogate_variable sva was recently_proposed results based on the notion that data can be viewed as an interference pattern reflecting the superposition of independent effects and random noise we present a modified sva called independent surrogate_variable isva to identify features correlating with a phenotype of interest in the presence of potential_confounding using simulated_data we show that isva performs well in identifying confounders as well as outperforming methods which do not adjust for confounding using four large_scale illumina_infinium dna_methylation datasets subject to low signal_to and substantial confounding by beadchip effects and variable bisulfite conversion_efficiency we show that isva improves the identifiability of confounders and that this enables a framework for feature_selection that is more robust to model_misspecification and heterogeneous phenotypes finally we demonstrate similar improvements of isva across four mrna_expression datasets thus isva should be useful as a feature_selection tool in studies that are subject to confounding availability an r package isva is available from www cran r project org confounding is a common problem in large_scale microarray profiling studies for example a study profiling hundreds of samples over a relatively large number of chips is vulnerable to confounding by chip effects even if the study is well designed and balanced in relation to the phenotype of interest logistical or sample quality_issues may induce confounding moreover inter chip variation cannot always be corrected for even to whom correspondence should be addressed with powerful inter array normalization techniques such as quantile normalization global normalization_methods such as quantile normalization may also not be desirable if they obscure biologically_important global differences between samples as it may happen for example in dna_methylation studies a further difficulty is that often the confounding_factors cfs are unknown to the experimentalist or if known may be subject to substantial uncertainty or measurement_error in these scenarios techniques that have been used to explicitly adjust for known and error_free confounding_factors cannot be used cfs may affect estimates of statistical_significance in various ways given a phenotype of interest one of the most important measures of statistical_significance is the false_discovery fdr which can be thought of as the posterior_probability that a feature declared to be positive is a true null a common_assumption in estimating the fdr is the statistical independence of the multiple tests this independence condition is however frequently violated as features often exhibit strong correlations these correlations could be biological or they could be due to experimental factors such as chip effects not taking these correlations into account can lead to instability of ranked gene_lists skew estimates of statistical_significance and affect the power of a study confounding may also increase the variability within phenotypes thus turning true_positives into false_negatives and hence leading to unacceptably large miss rates to deal with these issues an algorithm known as surrogate_variable sva was proposed and shown to lead to improved estimates of statistical_significance biological accuracy and reproducibility the main concept behind sva is to model the potential_confounding which may or may not be known as singular vectors so_called surrogate variables derived from a singular_value svd by definition these surrogate variables are linearly uncorrelated leading to an sva model in which the residual noise is effectively white we propose that cfs would be better modeled as statistically independent surrogate variables as modeling them as such better reflects the way the confounding noise is generated for example given a gene_expression study where the phenotype of interest is clinical_outcome it is clear that two confounders such as beadchip and age are statistically independent_variables it therefore seems natural to model the effect of these factors on the data as statistically
