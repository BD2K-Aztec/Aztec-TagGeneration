gene_expression temporal waves of coherent gene_expression during drosophila embryogenesis motivation animal_development depends on localized patterns of gene_expression whole_genome methods permit the global identification of differential expression_patterns however most gene_expression clustering_methods focus on the analysis of entire expression_profiles rather than temporal segments or time windows results in the current study local clustering of temporal time windows was applied to developing embryos of the fruitfly drosophila_melanogaster large_scale developmental_events involving temporal activation of hundreds of genes were identified as discrete gene_clusters the time duration analysis revealed six temporal waves of coherent gene_expression during drosophila embryogenesis the most powerful expression waves preceded major morphogenetic_movements such as germ band elongation and dorsal closure these waves of gene_expression coincide with the inhibition of maternal transcripts during early development the specification of ectoderm differentiation of the nervous_system differentiation of the digestive_tract deposition of the larval cuticle and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton during global morphogenetic events we discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the gene_regulatory governing drosophila_development availability data and software are available from the uc berkeley web resourcedrosophila embryogenesis has been divided_into separate stages each stage marked by global changes of embryo morphology such as cellularization gastrulation germ band elongation gbe germ band retraction gbr or dorsal closure dc different parts of an embryo might undergo simultaneous morphological changes parallel developmental_events such as dc and head involution might begin at the same time stages but terminate at different stages based on the time and the duration parameters to whom correspondence should be addressed the parallel events can be mapped to a d parameter_space and separated thus parallel and temporally overlapping events can be separated and analyzed locally with respect to distinct time and duration parameters these parameters are convenient for the classification of peaks of gene_expression observed in the global time series data presence of temporal peaks of expression with similar time duration properties might indicate a functional link between genes even if the genes expression_profiles are not similar complete expression data have been obtained for the entire developmental time course of drosophila_melanogaster using both expression and tiling microarrays previous_analyses of these datasets have shown that the vast_majority of genes exhibit at least fold expression changes during embryogenesis and most genes have two or more major temporal peaks of expression during the life_cycle such reengagement of genes and gene_networks has recently been demonstrated during the development of the mosquito embryo anopheles_gambiae d papatsenko m levine and u goltsev personal communication these studies suggest that morphologically_distinct and temporally separated developmental_events such as formation of the serosa and cuticle depend on the deployment of coherent gene batteries a recent study by hooper and co workers identified a number of time points during fly development when clusters of genes coherently change their expression levels using an approach initially introduced for the analysis of development in dictyostelium hooper and co workers have identified several coherently switching classes of genes in drosophila including maternal off switch activated on switch and transient peak expression types this clustering strategy relies on local similarities coherent on off switches in the global expression data the time duration analysis of fly development described in this study represents an unsupervised_learning algorithm a supervised method was introduced earlier similar to the temporal clustering method implemented by hooper and co workers technically the method can be classified as a query driven local clustering of time series expression data in this study the search patterns queries were temporal sequences corresponding to two major types of gene activity peak transient type and switch activated type the search patterns were matched to the expression_profiles locally time windows in orderpage
