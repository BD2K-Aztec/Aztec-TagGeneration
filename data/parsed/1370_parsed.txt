bioimage_informatics determining the subcellular_location of new proteins from microscope images using local_features motivation evaluation of previous systems for automated determination of subcellular_location from microscope images has been done using datasets in which each location class consisted of multiple_images of the same representative protein here we frame a more challenging and useful problem where previously_unseen proteins are to be classified results using cd tagging we generated two new image datasets for evaluation of this problem which contain several different proteins for each location class evaluation of previous methods on these new datasets showed that it is much harder to train a classifier that generalizes across different proteins than one that simply recognizes a protein it was trained on we therefore developed and evaluated additional approaches incorporating novel modifications of local_features techniques these extended the notion of local_features to exploit both the protein image and any reference markers that were imaged in parallel with these we obtained a large accuracy improvement in our new datasets over existing_methods additionally these features help achieve classification improvements for other previously studied datasets availability the datasets are available for download at http murphy lab web cmu edu data the software was written in python and c and is available under an open_source at http murphylab web cmu edu software the code is split into a library which can be easily reused for other data and a small driver script for reproducing all results presented here a step_by tutorial on applying the methods to new datasets is also available at that address generation of images of cells and tissues is increasingly easy with the advent of automated microscopes the capability for data generation has out stripped the capability for visual data analysis this has led to extensive work on automated methods for interpreting microscope images the problem of classification of subcellular patterns has received particular attention and a number of datasets and classifiers have been described these datasets typically feature one different protein for each class of interest with multiple_images for the same tagged protein on these datasets better than human performance has been reported this previous work implicitly assumed that results obtained in those datasets can be generalized to the problem of classifying previously_unseen proteins in this work we test this assumption using two new datasets where there are multiple proteins in each location class and multiple_images per protein these datasets were created using nih t cell_lines expressing_green gfp_tagged proteins created by cd tagging we tested classifiers using a cross_validation protocol whereby images from the same protein are never present in both the training and testing sets this is a stricter proxy for cross protein generalization than randomizing by image and guards against the possibility that learning is based on properties of the tagging method e g intensity or too specific to the protein in question e g a particular subpattern of an organelle with this protocol and existing_methods generalization accuracy was only for our new datasets we therefore investigated whether improved generalization could be obtained using alternative feature representations of the images many previous systems use image level features such as texture_features but some specialized features for cell images have also been proposed including features for single_cell regions in fact historically classification on cell segmented images was reported first in the computer vision literature local_features such as the scale invariant feature transform introduced by lowe have shown good results in many settings they have not been widely used in bioimage analysis there are a few uses of patchbased methods a basic form of these features object level features which can be seen as a form of local_features were used for subcellular_location unmixing both in supervised and unsupervised modes local_features as presented in the literature are generally defined on a gray_scale image and do not take advantage of the multiple image channels frequently acquired by fluorescent_microscopy there is some work on natural scene color images van_de but it does not directly apply to fluorescence microscopy_images for analyzing subcellular patterns where one channel is privileged depicting the protein distribution of interest and others serve as references naturally the simplest protocol is to ignore all but the primary channel however the use of a reference channel can provide additional important information particularly at the local_level for example we could distinguish between two vesicle classes that appear similar in the primary protein channel but differ in distance from the nucleus because the region containing vesicles will appear differently in the reference nuclear channel we present a simple protocol to take these reference channels into account using these features we obtain a large accuracy gain on our datasets we also use other datasets to further validate the value of the features and find that they lead to good results in all tested datasets widefield confocalon the left and nucleoli on the right second row of confocal_images cytoplasmic pattern on the left mitochondrial pattern on the right images are false color the red channel shows the nuclear marker hoechst the green channel is the gfp_tagged protein images shown are the first image in their classes and have not been manually chosen the widefield images were automatically acquired and the quality is lower than if they had been manually acquired images have been contrast stretched for publicationthis work frames the subcellular_location problem as recognizing different proteins in the same class while this may have been implicit in previous work it was not directly tested by datasets with a single representative protein per location class we introduce two new datasets which contain multiple proteins per class and multiple_images per protein we observed that when cross_validation was performed over proteins the resulting accuracy was much lower than when it was performed over images where it is comparable with other datasets this is intuitive as it is an easier problem to recognize proteins that are in the training_set than proteins that are only in the same class in particular in the first case it is possible that the system distinguishes the proteins by artifacts of the tagging or variation in subpatterns our data show that it is incorrect to assume that the high_accuracy values obtained in datasets composed of multiple_images of the same protein imply that the system would generalize well to other proteins in the same location class our datasets are publicly_available there is still a lot of room for improvement in accuracy and we hope that other researchers will test their methods on this harder problem we also introduce a new methodology for classification of subcellular_location patterns which is based on interest point detection and local feature analysis we developed a protocol to integrate the information in reference channels which are typically acquired in parallel to the protein of interest we implemented this method based on surf but the protocol is a generic method and could be applied to other local feature_sets such as scale invariant feature transform or any combination of detector and descriptor on our new datasets these methods performed better than the traditional whole field features by percentage_points a difference that is highly statistically_significant we tested these features on traditional datasets as well on these the baseline methods already perform well and there was less room for improvement in four cases the results are statistically_indistinguishable from the baseline it should be noted though that in no dataset did we observe that adding the local_features lead to a statistically distinguishable worse_outcome these features have the further advantage that they are computed on the raw images without any pre_processing such as background correction or contrast_enhancement no tuning is necessary for adapting to new datasets and it is flexible for application to large_datasets therefore we recommend that local_features with reference information be added to the standard toolkit for bioimage classification
