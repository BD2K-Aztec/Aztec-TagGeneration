systems_biology identification of important regressor groups subgroups and individuals via regularization methods application to gut_microbiome data motivation gut_microbiota can be classified at multiple taxonomy levels strategies to use changes in microbiota_composition to effect health improvements require knowing at which taxonomy level interventions should be aimed identifying these important levels is difficult however because most statistical_methods only consider when the microbiota are classified at one taxonomy level not multiple results using l and l regularizations we developed a new variable_selection method that identifies important features at multiple taxonomy levels the regularization parameters are chosen by a new data adaptive repeated cross_validation approach which performed well in simulation_studies our method outperformed competing_methods it more often selected significant_variables and had small false_discovery and acceptable false_positive applying our method to gut_microbiota data we found which taxonomic_levels were most altered by specific interventions or physiological_status with improved culture independent techniques a typical study of gut_microbiota now involves data from numerous microbes the microbes are classified at multiple taxonomy levels namely phylum class order family genus and species each taxonomy level has many subdivisions and the number of subdivisions increase on progression from phylum to species level strategies to use changes in microbiota_composition to effect health improvements require knowing at which taxonomy level interventions should be aimed levels to target are those with subdivisions identified as having an impact on the target health_outcome from a biological_perspective only a few subdivisions at each level are believed to play a role in certain health_outcomes identifying the few important subdivisions at each level is difficult however because of the increasing number of subdivisions on progression from phylum to species level and because the microbial data are typically based on small_sample thus a method that overcomes these difficulties and identifies important subdivisions at multiple taxonomy levels is needed this biological problem corresponds to a variable_selection problem where the variables are grouped at multiple levels and the number of variables p far exceeds the sample_size n we suppose that each level has sparse effects in the microbiota data sparse effects mean that only a few subdivisions within a particular taxonomy level actually impact the health phenotypes of interest for our purposes we consider the case where variables are divided_into groups and subgroups within the groups our interest thus is developing a method that selects important groups e g phyla subgroups e g families and individual predictors e g genera selecting variables clustered into groups and subgroups is challenging when the variables are divided only into groups without subgroups a popular technique is the group_lasso which selects an entire group of variables to be included or excluded from the model the group_lasso however has substantial drawbacks first the method assumes that the model submatrices for each group are orthonormal when orthonormality is not satisfied the group_lasso may select an incorrect model second the group_lasso does not achieve sparsity within each group which can be useful for the microbial data we could design more specific strategies for changing microbiota_composition if we knew which particular families i e subgroups in phyla i e group impacted health phenotypes of interest to overcome the deficiencies of the group_lasso recently_proposed the sparse group_lasso sgl the method imposes no orthonormality requirements on the group model submatrices and achieves sparsity between and within groups through a clever use of themethod for generalized gradient_descent the sgl works well when variables are clustered into groups but not when they are clustered at more than one levela feature inherent to gut_microbiota data to whom correspondence should be addressed to accommodate selecting important groups subgroups and individual predictors we propose three new algorithms the first algorithm the sparse group subgroup lasso sgsl generalizes the work of it is based on using l and l regularizations in a linear_regression convex non linear_regression are discussed in the supplementary_material our two other proposed algorithms use appropriate combinations of already existing variable_selection procedures first we propose applying the group_lasso to the groups followed by sgl applied to the subgroups second we propose applying the group_lasso to both the groups and subgroups followed by applying the lasso to select among the individual predictors we demonstrate in a simulation_study that our first algorithm outperforms the other two sgsl is a special_case of the tree structured group_lasso where nodes on the tree represent groups or subgroups of features and leaf nodes represent individual_features the tree structured group_lasso however uses a smoothing proximal gradient method to prune the entire tree collectively whereas our method uses an accelerated generalized gradient_descent approach to determine sparsity among groups then subgroups and then individual_features moreover we consider a tree without cycles meaning there is no overlap between groups subgroups of features i e each individual feature only belongs to one subgroup and each subgroup only belongs to one group hence our problem differs from the overlapping group_lasso as in the analysis of breast_cancer gene_expression data where the interest is finding important pathways among overlapping genes our problem also differs from a hierarchical variable_selection where a feature is subject to selection only after another feature is selected first we do not impose this requirement like other lasso based procedures sgsl also requires selecting tuning parameters for which we propose a data adaptive approach our approach involves multiple applications of fold_cross that we show performs well in selecting the tuning parameters through various simulation_studies therefore the main contributions from our work include i a new variable_selection procedure sgsl which identifies important groups subgroups and individual predictors through combined l and l regularizations ii we show that achieving sparsity at multiple levels cannot be achieved through simple combinations of existing lasso approaches we show that such combinations will select relevant_features less often than sgsl or never section iii we provide a data adaptive cross_validation approach that improves over the traditional cross_validation to select the tuning parameters iv in microbiome data our method identifies which taxonomic_levels were most altered by specific interventions or physiological_status the rest of the article is as follows section_describes sgsl and section evaluates its performance compared with competing_methods in section we describe the microbiota data that motivated this methodology and analyze the data section concludes the article we applied the same seven variable_selection techniques from the simulation_study to the microbial data we found that our proposed procedure selected the entire_family streptococcaceae in the firmicutes phyla to have an effect on expression of mrna for cd the family consisted of lactococcus and streptococcus genera in comparison sgl and lasso were only able to pick one member from this family streptococcus which indicates the inflexibility of these latter two methods in selecting important families i e subgroups having our method select the streptococcaceae family makes sense as members of streptococcaceae flourish in nutrient rich environments such as an overfed subjects gut e g obese_mice moreover mice in this study experienced chronic_inflammation secondary to obesity and hyperglycemia as evidenced by elevated adipose cd arising from macrophage_infiltration of adipose_tissue at present it seems unlikely that simple chronic caloric excess promoted streptococcaceae abundance in the obese_mice as this relationship was not seen in newly obese miceand supplementary secondary_effects appear to play a role as changes in host inflammatory_state were previously associated with streptococcaceae family_members in hosts with either strongly_positive or negative_energy intestinal infusion of fecal_microbiota from lean donors improved glucose_metabolism in obese humans with metabolic_syndrome in conjunction with a reduction in the streptococcaceae family_member streptococcus_bovis in the small_intestine obesity driven type_ii and metabolic_syndrome are considered chronic inflammatory_states in recent_studies the streptococcaceae family has been shown to be associated with inflammation of various origins and in an energy independent fashion first host physiology can influence the composition of the microbiota for example poor glucose control in a cohort of european women was associated with streptococcus sp c second microbiota_composition can modulate host physiology in a variable way for example formula_feeding is associated with increased frequency of pediatric intestinal_inflammation including necrotizing_enterocolitis in a mouse_model formula_feeding increased lactococcus at the expense of lactobacillus and altered host gene_expression to indicate increased oxidative_stress inflammation and impaired defense capacity third showed that microbiota_composition determines host health_outcome in response to identical dietary shifts in this case microbiota from twin_pairs the disease kwashiorkor variably provoke disease depending on the complexity and adequacy of the diet stability and resilience of intestinal microbial_diversity is an active area of research and it is now recognized that chronic alterations in host environmental_exposure e g diet and physiological_state e g obese can influence intestinal_microbiota and likewise microbiota can respond to diet to increase decrease susceptibility of the host to disease our results further highlight the need to understand temporal dimension of interventions to improve efficacy were linked to cd expression in adipose_tissue of mice with chronic obesity all other methods could not detect this relationship in the supplementary_material we analyze a second microbiome dataset in which only our method and lasso detects an important individual bacterial genus the data we analyzed were classified into different taxonomies following pyrosequencing which can result in some genera being more diverse if consistently sized operational taxa are needed one could use operational_taxonomic clustering the human_microbiome consortium still regardless of the classification our method is applicable thus one could apply our method using the different classifications to gain insight into how microbes impact health related features of course which classification to use depends on the projects overall goal and available resources
