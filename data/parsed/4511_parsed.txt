sequence_analysis systematic_comparison of rna_seq normalization_methods using measurement_error models_motivation further advancement of rna_seq technology and its application call for the development of effective normalization_methods for rna_seq currently different normalization_methods are compared and validated by their correlations with a certain gold_standard gene_expression generated by a different technology or platform such as real_time reverse_transcription qrtpcr or microarray are usually used as the gold_standard although the current approach is intuitive and easy to implement it becomes statistically inadequate when the gold_standard is also subject to measurement_error me furthermore the current approach is not informative because the correlation of a normaliza tion method with a certain gold_standard does not provide much information about the exact quality of the normalized rna_seq measurements results we propose to use the system of me models based on qrt_pcr microarray_and gene_expression data to compare and validate rna_seq normalization_methods this approach does not assume the existence of a gold_standard the performance of a nor malization method can be characterized by a group of parameters of the system which are referred to as the performance parameters and these performance parameters can be consistently estimated different normalization_methods can thus be compared by comparing their corresponding estimated performance parameters we applied the proposed approach to compare five existing rna_seq normaliza tion methods using the gene_expression data of two rna samples from the microarray quality_control and sequencing quality_control projects and gained much insight about the pros_and of these methods rna_seq is a recently_developed platform for transcriptome study using the next_generation it offers the possibility to generate quality measurements of transcript gene_expression levels with a whole genome_coverage and single_nucleotide compared with the other widely used technology microarray rna_seq is believed to have a lower level background signal and a wider dynamic range of detection since its advent rna_seq has been used in many transcriptome_studies although rna_seq is promising it is known that many factors could introduce variation and bias to rna_seq including the random primers mapping method used in an rna_seq experiment as well as the molecular constitution and secondary_structure of the rna sample under study therefore proper normalization_methods are needed to denoise and normalize the rna_seq before they are used in downstream_analysis such as gene expression_level quantification and differential_expression detection proposed to use reads per kilobase of exon model per_million rpkm to normalize rna_seq the rpkm method is by far the most widely used rna_seq normalization method the validity of the rpkm method depends on the assumption that the reads count a gene receives follows a poisson_distribution with a constant intensity rate however the assumption of a constant intensity rate was found to be invalid in rna_seq showed that a poisson_distribution with a constant_rate cannot explain the non uniformity of the reads across the same gene or exon andshowed the existence of overdispersion in rna_seq data a number of methods have been proposed to improve the rpkm method and they can be grouped into three categories the first category consists of methods that use more sophisticated distributions to accommodate overdispersion for example srivastava and chen proposed to use a two parameter generalized poisson_model and developed a method called proposed to use poisson mixture_models and developed a method called pmseq the second category includes methods that adjust the expression_level measurement of a gene by some identified sources of variation or bias for example proposed to use the gc_content of a gene to correct its gene expression_level measurement in the rest of the article we refer to their method as the gcr method methods in the third category assume that the reads count a nucleotide receives not only depends on the expression_level of the transcript but it also depends on the sequencing preference of its neighborhood an example of this type of method is the mseq method proposed by which incorporates local sequencing preferences into the framework of poisson linear_models as new methods continue to appear it is important to systematically compare different rna_seq normalization_methods to evaluate a normalization method two aspects of the method are of particular importance the first aspect is the concordance of the expression_level measurements generated by a normalization method with the true expression levels the second aspect is whether a normalization method would produce consistent measurements when it is applied to rna_seq of same biological condition generated from different experiments in previous rna_seq studies two major criteria are used for assessing a normalization method following the schema proposed by which are referred to as the precision and accuracy criteria the precision of a method is defined to be the correlation between measurements from replicated experimental runs and the accuracy is defined to be the correlation_coefficient of the expression_level measurements generated by the method with a gold_standard the expression measurements from a different platform are usually used as the gold_standard these two criteria are intuitive and popularly used the precision criterion can assess the consistency between repeated experimental runs however the validity of using the accuracy criterion to evaluate the performance of a rna_seq normalization method depends on how accurate the gold_standard is currently in the reported comparison studies of rna_seq normalization_methods polymerase_chain pcr based technology and microarray are two common choices of the gold_standard microarray is known to suffer from various types of bias and variation although many normalization_methods have been proposed for microarray_data variations and biases in microarray_data cannot be completely_eliminated pcr based technology is well acknowledged to be of high_accuracy but it is still subject to errors it has been pointed_out that there exist a number of factors that contribute variations to pcr data including primerdimer accumulation pcr_product reannealing and dna_polymerase binding to primers it is known in statistics that when the gold_standard is subject to measurement errors mes directly using the correlation_coefficient with the gold_standard to evaluate a normalization method can be inadequate unfortunately a gold_standard free of mes may never be available due to the complexity involved in transcriptome study a statistically more appropriate approach to assessing different normalization_methods is to directly estimate the bias and variance of the normalized rna_seq measurements using me models a system of such me models lately was used to calibrate rna_seq and microarray_gene level measurements with real_time reverse_transcription qrtpcr for more accurate transcriptome_profiling z sun et_al unpublished manuscript through the system the biases and variances from qrtpcr microarray_and can be estimated in this article we further utilize the system to facilitate the comparison of different rna_seq normalization_methods we applied the developed approach to compare five existing rna_seq normalization_methods which are rpkm gpseq mseq gcr and pmseq using gene_expression data of two rna samples from the microarray quality_control maqc and sequencing quality_control seqc projects we applied the system of me models to analyze the five combinations of x y and z l for l separately to compare the five rna_seq normalization_methods estimates of the structural_parameters were divided_into two groups denoted by b h l and b x l according to the discussion in section in this section we first report diagnostic results regarding the assumptions imposed on the mes second we examine the coherence of b x l s for different ls third we provide detailed comparison of the five rna_seq normalization_methods based on b h l at the end of this section we show that the comparison between the five normalization_methods based on correlation_coefficients is insensitive and non informative
