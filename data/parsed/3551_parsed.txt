phylojive integrating biodiversity data with the tree of life motivation rich collections of biodiversity information such as spatial_distributions species descriptions and trait data are now synthesized in publicly_available online sources such as gbif also phylogenetic knowledge now provides a sound understanding of the origin of organisms and their place in the tree of life we demonstrate with phylojive that any phylogenetic_tree can be linked to online biodiversity data in the browser this evolutionary view of biodiversity data is demonstrated in a case study that suggests that this approach may be useful to scientists and non experts users the growing catalogue of online biodiversity data_sources has reached a scale where integration with phylogenies can inform comparative biology research in morphology ecology biogeography disease_resistance ecosystem_services food_security and climate_change there are now mature services e g gbif eol and the ala that provide biodiversity data including species profiles morphological distribution images and taxonomic data to researchers and the general public these data_sources provide data in taxon profiles but not through phylogenies the research_community has generated dna based phylogenetic_trees and many are stored in repositories such as treebase ii http www treebase org many data analysis and visualization suites are now available which produce and display phylogenies but none integrate data such as morphological character states derived from web_services on a phylogeny here we demonstrate phylojive phylogeny javascript information visualiser and explorer a web_based application that integrates biodiversity information aggregated from many sources with phylogenetic_trees phylojive complements other initiatives that provide visualizations such as phylowidget onezoom http www onezoom org and jspyhylosvg we do not seek to replicate what they do well rather we provide a convenient means to assemble online data in a phylogenetic context
