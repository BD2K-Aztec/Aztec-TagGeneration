genome_scale prediction of moonlighting proteins using diverse protein association information motivation moonlighting proteins mps show multiple_cellular within a single polypeptide_chain to understand the overall landscape of their functional_diversity it is important to establish a computational_method that can identify mps on a genome_scale previously we have systematically characterized mps using functional and omics scale information in this work we develop a computational_prediction model for automatic identification of mps using a diverse range of protein association information results we incorporated a diverse range of protein association information to extract characteristic_features of mps which range from gene_ontology go proteinprotein_interactions gene_expression phylogenetic profiles genetic_interactions and network based graph properties to protein structural_properties i e intrinsically_disordered in the protein chain then we used machine_learning using the broad feature_space for predicting mps because many known mps lack some proteomic features we developed an imputation technique to fill such missing features results on the control dataset show that mps can be predicted with over accuracy when go terms are available furthermore using only the omics based features the method can still identify mps with over accuracy last we applied the method on three genomes saccharomyces_cerevisiae caenorhabditis_elegans and homo_sapiens and found that about of proteins in the genomes are potential mps availability_and code available at http kiharalab org mppredictionas the last decade has witnessed a momentous expansion in the number of functionally well characterized proteins as well as rapid progress in large_scale proteomics_studies protein multi functionality has become a highly perceived phenomenon these multifunctional moonlighting proteins demonstrate multiple autonomous and usually unrelated functions within a single polypeptide_chain which cannot be individually assigned into separate domains it has become evident that the functional_diversity of these proteins is neither specific to genomes or certain protein_families nor facilitated by common function switching mechanisms many of the known moonlighting proteins mps were originally recognized as enzymes but there are also others that are known as receptors channel_proteins chaperone proteins ribosomal_proteins or scaffold proteins there are speculations that mps evolved to broaden the functional_aspects of a genome without expanding the genome_size as well as roles in important biochemical_pathways despite the potential abundance of mps in various genomes and their important roles in pathways and disease developments the size of existing databases that contain experimentally confirmed mps is still too small to obtain a comprehensive picture of the cellular_mechanisms their functional_diversity this quantitative insufficiency is due in large part to the tendency for the additional function of these proteins to be found serendipitously in the course of unrelated experiments hence a systematic bioinformatics_approach could make substantial contributions in identifying novel mps on a genome_scale and also to an overall understanding of the underlying biology of their multi_functional nature the functional_diversity of mps poses a significant challenge to computational protein_function as current methods do not explicitly consider the possibility of dual functions for a protein conventional sequence_based functional_annotation methods based on the concept of homology or conserved_motifs domains will have problems identifying secondary functions because there are cases where a homolog of a mp does not possess the secondary function or has a different secondary function due to these intrinsic computational challenges systematic studies of mps are still in an early_stage for obtaining a comprehensive picture of proteins moonlighting functions or for developing computational_methods for predicting mps review by existing bioinformatics approaches for detection of mps have two general shortcomings first they rely heavily on the existence of functional_annotation of a protein which is a major_bottleneck of the problem second all the existing_methods address different aspects of mps functional_diversity sequence_similarity motifs domains structural_disorder or protein_protein ppi patterns combined with existing gene_ontology go annotations however the diverse nature of mps functions cellular locations function switching mechanisms and the organisms in which they are found gives compelling_evidence that in order to understand and identify the overall functional_aspects of these proteins one should characterize these proteins in a wider functional proteomic space previously we have identified functional characteristics of mps in different proteomic aspects using a computational framework here we have constructed an automated prediction model to identify mps based on features we characterized in our previous study to address the diverse nature of mps we have used a wide feature_space ranging from go gene_ontology and several omics scale data namely ppi gene_expression ge phylogenetic profiles phylo genetic_interactions gis and network based graph properties such as node betweenness degree centrality closeness centrality to protein structural_properties such as the number and the length of intrinsically_disordered in the protein chain based on our computed go and the omics based protein feature_space we used machine_learning as the framework for mp prediction and used an existing mp database to cross validate our prediction model because a significant fraction of proteins do not have certain functional network_features in databases we have additionally developed an imputation technique using random_forest rf to predict missing features for proteins cross_validation results on the dataset of known moonlighting and non mps control dataset show that if go information is available mps can be predicted with over accuracy more importantly leveraging just the non go based features our imputation classification_models can predict mps with over accuracy the latter result is very important because it indicates that mps without sufficient function_annotations can be identified by analyzing available omics_data which is the first such development lastly we have run our imputation classification_models with the best performing omics based feature combinations on three genomes saccharomyces_cerevisiae yeast caenorhabditis_elegans and homo_sapiens human and found that about of the proteomes are potential mps in this section we present and discuss the performance of mpfit with different combinations of features mpfit was run and evaluated with the go term feature and all possible combinations of six omics feature domains namely ppi ge phylo gi dor and net there are such combinations we proposed a novel computational_approach mpfit for detecting mps from go annotations or omics based features mpfit can be applied to a large fraction of proteins in a genome due to the use of several omics based features and the implemented imputation protocol for filling missing features as the mechanisms by which mps exhibit multiple functions differ from case by case using various feature_types is reasonable to capture mps of different nature although there is a possibility that some predictions made by mpfit are not correct the overall estimation is probably not too far from the truth and serves as workable hypotheses for future research_projects we believe that our work is an imperative step toward a systematic and integrative approach of studying mps and it will open up new opportunities to investigate the multi_functional nature of proteins at a systems level
