data_and text_mining meets workflow linking u compare with taverna text_mining from the biomedical_literature is of increasing importance yet it is not easy for the bioinformatics community to create and run text_mining workflows due to the lack of accessibility and interoperability of the text_mining resources the u compare system provides a wide_range of bio text_mining resources in a highly interoperable workflow environment where workflows can very easily be created executed evaluated and visualized without coding we have linked u compare to taverna a generic workflow system to expose text_mining functionality to the bioinformatics community owing to the large and rapidly growing_body in the biological_sciences text_mining approaches are increasingly important for the extraction and collation of data the collation of text_mining data with bioinformatics databases is a separate topic which space precludes enlarging on here yet many text_mining are difficult to integrate with other bioinformatics_tools as development tends to focus upon mining performance more than implementing accessible interfaces u compare is an all in one text_mining system based on the uima unstructured information management architecture framework u compare mainly consists of two parts the world largest readyto use uima component repository and an all in one text_mining platform in text_mining data_structures tend to be more complex e g phrase structures than in bioinformatics so interoperability which guarantees data type compatibility as implemented in u compare is required to create text_mining workflows easily with text_mining workflows simplified users would naturally seek integration of text_mining workflows with other bioinformatics resources taverna to whom correspondence should be addressed is a generic workflow construction system widely used in bioinformatics we have developed mechanisms that allow users to embed any u compare workflow in a taverna workflow as u compare is designed to facilitate the construction of text_mining workflows it is far simpler to expose a complete u compare workflow to taverna than to construct the equivalent workflow from individual components within taverna which lacks text_mining specific data_structures it is therefore the easiest way to add text_mining functionality to taverna
