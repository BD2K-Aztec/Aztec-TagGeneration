data_and inferring the human microrna functional_similarity and functional network based on microrna associated diseases motivation it is popular to explore meaningful molecular_targets and infer new functions of genes through gene_functional measuring and gene functional network construction however little work is available in this field for microrna mirna_genes due to limited mirna functional_annotations with the rapid accumulation of mirnas it is increasingly needed to uncover their functional_relationships in a systems level micrornas mirnas are endogenous small_non that can regulate_gene at the posttranscriptional level by binding with untranslated_regions utrs of the target_mrnas through base_pairing this results in the cleavage or translation_inhibition of target_mrnas mirnas are considered to represent one of the most important components of the cell they play_critical to whom correspondence should be addressed many important biological_processes and are therefore associated with various diseases esquela thus far thousands of mirnas have been identified for example among humans more than mirnas have been reported in mirbase in order to better understand mirnas it is increasingly necessary to measure their functional_similarity and to further construct a network based on such for protein_coding measuring gene_functional and the construction and analysis of gene functional_networks have obtained important results for example horvath et_al developed a gene functional network construction method based on gene_expression similarity and identified an important molecular target aspm of glioblastoma after applying their method to glioblastoma gene_expression data one class of widely used methods related to gene_functional and the construction of a gene functional network is by measuring their sequence or expression similarities another class of methods to infer functional_similarity of protein_coding is based on gene_ontology go data for mirnas although sequence or expression similarities can interpret part of the functional_similarity like protein_coding the correlation between gene functional_similarities and gene sequence or gene_expression similarities does not always exist the functional_similarity of two mirnas may be indirectly inferred based on their targets however it is difficult for this method to achieve high_reliability because mirna_targets are mostly obtained by in silico prediction which shows high false_positives furthermore although methods of measuring protein_coding gene_functional based on go can achieve better results these methods are not applicable for mirna_genes because the function of most mirnas remains_unknown and no such function_annotation database is available therefore a new method is required to measure mirna functional_similarity and to further construct a mirna functional network for this purpose it has been reported that genes with similar functions are often implicated in similar diseases and vice_versa this observation also exists in mirnas moreover according to prior_knowledge the relationships of different diseases can be represented in a structure of directed_acyclic dag therefore the functional_similarity of mirnas can be evaluated byquantitatively measuring the similarity of disease dag associated with these mirnas this observation provides a chance to infer mirna functional_similarity through their associated disease dags however this method is only applicable if there are sufficient mirnadisease association data fortunately in recent_years more mirnadisease associations have been reported for example a human mirna disease database hmdd has recently recorded human mirnadisease associations here based on the mirnadisease association data and disease dag we presented a method misim mirna similarity to measure the functional_similarity of mirnas and to further construct mirna functional_networks according to the calculated functional_similarity we validated our method by comparing it with other potential mirna functional_similarity inferring methods such as mirna family mirna cluster and mirna_expression similarity results show that our method is reliable more importantly our method allows the discovery of novel mirna pairs with high functional_similarity and can predict novel function and associated disease by analyzing the mirna functional network in summary we presented a method for measuring mirna functional_similarity and construction of mirna functional_networks results show that our method is reliable and can be used to infer potential function and or associated diseases for mirnas moreover a web accessible program that implements the method of misim is also available at http cmbi bjmu edu cn misim as described above since misim has calculated mirna functional_similarity based on mirnadisease association data and the disease dag misim may generate bias in some cases especially when little disease association data is available for a mirna therefore in the future misim will improve greatly when more mirnadisease association data and more accurate disease relationship are available we believe that with the rapid increase of mirnadisease association data misim will play more important roles in the analysis of mirnas
