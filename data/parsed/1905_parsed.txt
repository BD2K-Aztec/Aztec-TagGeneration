functional microrna targets in protein_coding motivation experimental_evidence has accumulated showing that microrna mirna_binding within protein_coding cdss are functional in controlling gene_expression results here we report a computational_analysis of such mirna_target based on features extracted from existing mammalian high_throughput immunoprecipitation and sequencing_data the analysis is performed independently for the cds and the untranslated_regions utrs and reveals different sets of features and models for the two regions the two models are combined into a novel computational_model for mirna target_genes diana microt cds which achieves higher sensitivity compared with other popular programs and the model that uses only the utr target_sites further analysis indicates that genes with shorter utrs are preferentially targeted in the cds suggesting that evolutionary selection might favor additional sites on the cds in cases where there is restricted space on the utr availability the results of diana microt cds are available atmicrornas mirnas are small endogenous rna_molecules that play_a in development and diseases through posttranscriptional_regulation of gene_expression they are part of the rna_induced risc and guide it to specific mirna recognition elements mres on the mrna_molecules of target_genes this leads either to translational_repression and or messenger_rna mrna_degradation although most of the mres have been found in utrs of protein_coding there are individual reports of mres located in protein_coding cdss of target_genes with evidence for their relation to biological_function in it is shown that mir represses specific splice_variants of dna_methyltransferase b dnmt b by targeting its coding_sequence to whom correspondence should be addressed and that this mechanism might play a role in determining the relative_abundance of different splice_variants demonstrate that four let mirna_target within the cds of the mirna processing enzyme dicer establish a mechanism for a mirna dicer autoregulatory feedback_loop init is shown that the coding_region of transducin repeat containing protein is regulated by mir show that hepatocyte_nuclear hnf is downregulated by mir targeting its cds the expression of mir is regulated by cellular_stress thus affecting metabolism and cellular_biology show that based on mirna targeting in the cds mir represses the translation of the rna_binding hu antigen r hur which in turn reduces hur regulated_gene and cell_division measure the effect of four human mirnas and find that mir tends to target the cds but not the utr finally schnallshow that mir targets the repeat rich cds of the well known tumor_suppressor retinoblastoma_protein rb and rb associated kruppel associated box zinc_finger rbak high_throughput clip data now allow for the direct identification and localization of mres on the target_genes show through immunoprecipitation of the mirna containing ribonucleoprotein_complexes and sequencing of the associated rna_fragments par_clip that mirnas tend to bind in approximately equal_proportions on the utr as well as on the protein_coding cdss of target_mrnas also suggest that mirna targeting in the cds has a measurable effect on mirna mediated mrna_degradation the same observation has been made by two more groups after computational_analysis of previously_published high_throughput studies regarding mirna_targets forman and coller analyze the dataset derived from the measurements of protein and mrna_level changes after the transfection of five mirnas in hela_cells as provided by and detect a functional role of mirna_binding in the cds fang and rajewsky analyze the same dataset and additionally the protein and mrna_level measurements after over and underexpression of five mirnas in mouse neutrophils provided by they find that genes containing target_sites both in the cds and the utr exhibit significantly_stronger regulation than genes targeted in the utr only and that this effect is stronger for conserved cds sites with longer binding_sites schnallof the analysis on the par_clip data mres specified by the par_clip data are divided in two categories according to the genomic_region in which they lie a for these two datasets several features are extracted and the most informative of them are selected by comparing true mres with false mres b the selection is performed through a three fold_cross c for each identified mirna mre the selected_features depending on the gene region it lies in are combined into an mre score through generalized_linear d for each gene the cds score and the utr score is defined by summing the mre scores that lie in cdss and utrs respectively these two scores are linearly combined into a final score e to test for the overall performance of this scoring approach an independent test on the high_throughput proteomics_data of selbach et_al is performed f only on conservation and they validate five of their top seven predictions most mirna_target programs nevertheless limit their search for mres only within the utr here we describe an algorithm for the prediction of mirna_targets in both utrs and cdss that are trained on a positive and a negative set of mres defined by par_clip data of the analysis is performed independently for mres in cdss and utrs which enables the identification of mirna mrna binding features specific for cds or utrs for each of these regions a separate prediction model is built and the models are combined for computing a final mirna gene interaction score this algorithm permits the identification of a large number of protein_coding that are only targeted in their cdss and provides a model of the interaction between the cds and the utr
