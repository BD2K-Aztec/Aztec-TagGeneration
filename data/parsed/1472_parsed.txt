sequence_analysis draw sneakpeek analysis workflow and quality metric management for dna_seq experiments we report our new drawsneakpeek software for dna_seq analysis dna resequencing analysis workflow draw automates the workflow of processing raw sequence_reads including quality_control read_alignment and variant_calling on high_performance facilities such as amazon elastic compute cloud sneakpeek provides an effective interface for reviewing dozens of quality_metrics reported by draw so users can assess the quality of data and diagnose problems in their sequencing procedures bothnext generation sequencing ngs has redefined what big_data means in biomedical_research advances in quality and capacity have led to a declining cost of implementation allowing ngs to be used in a wide_range of experiments at a variety of scales from a few samples in small laboratories to thousands of samples from multi institute collaborations processing terabytes of data requires a certain level of information_technology and bioinformatics expertise which can be daunting to small laboratories with limited resources the programs we developed will enable these groups to process dna_seq data and identify singlenucleotide variants and small insertions_and indels our software_suite consists of dna resequencing analysis workflow draw and sneakpeek two independent interoperable components draw automates the entire workflow of whole_genome whole exome dna_seq data_processing from mapping sequence_reads to calling variants sneakpeek is a quality_metrics management system for reviewing the sequencing quality of multiple samples across different flow cells it displays dozens of quality_metrics per sample collected throughout draw on a dynamic web_interface and is a useful diagnostic_tool for trouble shooting unsatisfactory sequencing results we used drawsneakpeek to process whole_genome whole_exome wes and targeted sequencing_experiments on traditional high_performance clusters as well as on amazon elastic compute cloud ec draw was used to analyze part of the wes data for a multiinstitutional autism study and more than exomes genomes for human and caenorhabditis_elegans in our laboratories supported by the third_party programs jobs will be distributed in parallel_computing environment to expedite the process a complete run of draw produces analysis ready read_alignment bam_files annotated variant call variant_call files and a flat file of quality_metrics ready for sneakpeek section should errors occur the completed steps can be skipped during the re execution this modularity reduces potential waste of time and cost on unnecessary repeated jobs
