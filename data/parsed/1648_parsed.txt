evaluating synteny for improved comparative_studies motivation comparative_genomics aims to understand the structure and function of genomes by translating knowledge gained about some genomes to the object of study early approaches used pairwise_comparisons but today researchers are attempting to leverage the larger potential of multi way comparisons comparative_genomics relies on the structuring of genomes into syntenic blocks blocks of sequence that exhibit conserved_features across the genomes syntenic blocs are required for complex computations to scale to the billions of nucleotides present in many genomes they enable comparisons across broad ranges of genomes because they filter out much of the individual variability they highlight candidate_regions for in depth studies and they facilitate whole_genome comparisons through visualization_tools however the concept of syntenic block remains loosely defined tools for the identification of syntenic blocks yield quite different results thereby preventing a systematic_assessment of the next steps in an analysis current_tools do not include measurable quality objectives and thus cannot be benchmarked against themselves comparisons among tools have also been neglectedwhat few results are given use superficial measures unrelated to quality or consistency results we present a theoretical_model as well as an experimental basis for comparing syntenic blocks and thus also for improving or designing tools for the identification of syntenic blocks we illustrate the application of the model and the measures by applying them to syntenic blocks produced by three different contemporary tools drimm synteny i adhore and cyntenator on a dataset of eight yeast genomes our findings highlight the need for a well founded systematic approach to the decomposition of genomes into syntenic blocks our experiments demonstrate widely divergent results among these tools throwing into question the robustness of the basic approach in comparative_genomics we have taken the first step towards a formal approach to the construction of syntenic blocks by developing a simple quality criterion based on sound evolutionary principles
