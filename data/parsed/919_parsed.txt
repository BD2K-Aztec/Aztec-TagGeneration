genome_analysis cgars cancer genome_analysis by rank sums motivation cancer_genomes are characterized by the accumulation of point_mutations and structural_alterations such as copy_number and genomic_rearrangements among structural changes systematic_analyses of copy_number have provided deeper insight into the architecture of cancer_genomes and had led to new potential treatment opportunities during the course of cancer genome_evolution selection mechanisms are leading to a non random_pattern of mutational_events contributing to fitness benefits of the cancer_cells we therefore developed a new method to dissect random from non random_patterns in copy_number data and thereby to assess significantly_enriched somatic copy_number across a set of tumor_specimens or cell_lines in contrast to existing_approaches the method is invariant to any strictly monotonous transformation of the input_data which results to an insensitivity of differences in tumor_purity array saturation effects and copy_number baseline levels results we applied our approach to recently_published datasets of small_cell and squamous_cell and validated its performance by comparing the results to an orthogonal approach in addition we found a new deletion peak containing the hla a gene in squamous_cell availability the cgars program package is available for download at http www translational genomics uni koeln de scientific resources documentation and examples are available together with the package contactrecently several algorithms to identify significant copy_number from array based high_throughput data e g affymetrix snp_arrays or array_cgh have been proposed all of these methods have in common that the occurrence of different levels of tumor_purity are barely taken into account especially in the case of patient derived tumor_samples the admixture of nonneoplastic cells is an uncontrollable experimental variable often leading to large differences in tumor_purity throughout the dataset an additional feature of cancer_genomes is that some tumors_exhibit diverting levels of genome ploidy triploid tetraploid etc both low tumor_purity and higher genome ploidy lead to a decrease of inferred copy_number amplitudes by using rank sums we propose a novel copy_number analysis method that automatically accounts for these different levels of purity and ploidy we applied this approach to published datasets of small_cell sclc and squamous_cell sq and finally validated detected regions of copy_number by comparing the results with those derived from a gistic analysis
