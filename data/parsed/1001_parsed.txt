clico fs an interactive web_based service of circos we present clico free service an online web_service based on circos which provides a user_friendly interactive web_based interface with configurable features to generate circos circular plots availability_and online web_service is freely_available atcircos is a perl language based tool to represent visual data in a circular form the native circos software is provided through a command_line cli installation and configuration of the software though not difficult for users with command_line experience pose a certain degree of difficulty to those who are not familiar with the cli there are other alternatives to circos that enable plotting of circular images which including circoletto circus and rcircos circoletto and circus have been developed for more specialised functions the former integrates basic_local or blast results and the circos plot via a web_based user_interface ui whereas the latter specializes in plotting structure variants of genomes they are not flexible in generating plots with different data types on the other hand rcircos supports circos data track plotting but it is based on the r package cli some of the applications above require setup configuration and coding skills in order to fully utilize the applications users with little or no experience in the cli environment could encounter a demanding learning_curve to address the issue clico fs open circular layout interactive converter is developed clico fs is a user_friendly web_service which allows users to generate circos plots easily not all functions of circos can be done by clico fs such as chromosome axis breaks to demonstrate the capability of clico fs to generate circos images without cli interaction attempts were made to reproduce relevant published images using clico fs a randomly_selected publication with different data types including links and scatter plots was chosen data was extracted from the published paper and was converted according to the clico fs input format then ensuing reproduced plot is similar to the original circos plot from the paper and supplement data with the pattern and the meaning of the data preserved in addition simulated_data was generated to plot human and mouse genomes with clico fs shows that clico fs is able to generate links histogram line plot scatter_plot heatmap tiles text connector and highlight moreover background color axes and rules were applied on histogram successfully using the advanced text box to test the template based plotting function of clico fs a randomly_selected genbank file of a bacterium genome escherichia_coli o h nc was used information on the genome including genes gc plots and structural rnas was successfully plotted by clico fs
