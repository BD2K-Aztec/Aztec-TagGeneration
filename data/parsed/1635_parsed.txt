estimating the order of mutations during tumorigenesis from tumor genome sequencing_data tumors are thought to develop and evolve through a sequence of genetic and epigenetic somatic alterations to progenitor_cells early_stages of human tumorigenesis are hidden from view here we develop a method for inferring some aspects of the order of mutational_events during tumorigenesis based on genome sequencing_data for a set of tumors this method does not assume that the sequence of driver alterations is the same for each tumor but enables the degree of similarity or difference in the sequence to be evaluated results to evaluate the new method we applied it to colon_cancer tumor sequencing_data and the results are consistent with the multi_step tumorigenesis model previously_developed based on comparing stages of cancer we then applied the new method to dna sequencing_data for a set of lung_cancers the model may be a useful tool for better understanding the process of tumorigenesis availability the software is available at http linus nci nih gov data youna ordermutation zip contact human tumors are thought to arise and evolve through a sequence of somatic alterations to dna but the early_stages of oncogenesis occur years before tumor detection and are rarely directly observable better understanding the temporal_order of mutations is important since the early mutations may represent_important therapeutic_targets and late mutations may play_important in metastasis inferred some information about the sequence of genetic_alterations associated with the stages of colorectal_tumors by examining the genomes of small colonic adenomas intermediate sized adenomas large_adenomas and carcinomas they discovered that most of the early_stage adenomas showed loss_of loh in the apc_gene almost half of intermediate sized adenomas carried an additional mutation in kras the long_arm showed frequent loh in advanced adenomas and carcinomas also frequent loh on the short_arm which later turned out to target tp was observed mainly in carcinomas although the loss of apc_gene to whom correspondence should be addressed function almost always occurs as an initiating event in colorectal_tumors the precise order of subsequent alterations seemed to vary among tumor_samples developing evidence for an ordered sequence of mutations driving tumor_progression was possible for colorectal_tumors due to the accessibility of the colonic_epithelium to colonoscopy for other tumor_types however such evidence is not well developed for this reason there has been interest in indirect computational_methods to provide information about the order of mutations attempted to estimate the order between gains_and on chromosomal_regions by fitting an oncogenic tree model to cgh data used a population_genetics mathematical_model the evolutionary paths of cells from the unmutated state to the fully mutated state in their model the parameters such as rates of mutations amplification or deletion and the number of cells per patient at risk of tumorigenesis are assumed constant for all tumor_samples the methods ofare very complex and the number of trees to be searched or the number of parameters to be fit increases exponentially with the number of investigated genes consequently these models are restricted to investigation of a very small number of driver_genes these models address mutational_events which co occur and cannot explain the negative correlation between some pairs of mutations such as those for genes in the same pathway estimated the order of mutations in areas of copy neutral loh cn loh as well as the order of occurrence of cn loh regions within an individual cancer they used the idea that if a mutation precedes a regional duplication its copy_number is doubled whereas mutations following a duplication event appear with haploid copy_number although this method can provide accurate estimates it is restricted to cn loh regions recent_advances have made it possible to perform large_scale resequencing of tumor_genomes these studies have often identified a large number dozens of driver_genes genes causing clonal expansions when mutated these studies generally define driver_genes as those which are more frequently mutated than expected based on the background_mutation estimated from synonymous mutations since the lists of detected driver_genes do not generally provide_satisfactory insight into the process of oncogenesis methods which can help to elucidate the order of the mutational_events in driver_genes and can handle a large number of driver_genes would be useful in this article we propose a method which can estimate the order of mutations in driver_genes from genome_sequences of a set of tumors the method is not restricted distribution of mutations in driver_genes and estimates of their order a distribution of mutations in four driver_genes for ten patients of the same tumor_type for each patient the colored letter m represents a mutation for the corresponding gene b estimates for p k i the probability that the k th mutational event involving the four driver_genes occurs in gene i the length of the sub bar corresponding to gene i at the k th mutational event is the estimates for p k i to a very small number of driver_genes and does not utilize a complex cell level model by comparing mutation profiles of driver_genes in a large number of tumors of a type the probability_distribution for the order of mutations is estimated this enables the degree of similarity or difference in the order for that set of tumors to be evaluated consider a population of patients at various stages of the same histologic_type of cancer in which four tumor driver_genes have been identified for each patient the colored letter m inrepresents a mutation for the corresponding gene as tumorigenesis progresses tumor_cells accumulate more mutations in tumor driver_genes our statistical_model estimates p k i the probability that the kth mutational event involving the four driver_genes occurs in gene i this becomes feasible if we assume that all samples are governed by the same set of p k i probabilities mutations in gene a b or c occur in samples having one or two mutations therefore the probability for the early mutation occurring in gene a b or c will be high in contrast mutations in gene d always occur with mutations in other genes a b or c since other samples support that probability for the early mutation occurring in gene a b or c will be high it is likely that gene d occurs as the late event shows the estimates of p k i in which the length of the sub bar corresponding to gene i at the k th mutational event is p k i we describe the statistical_model in section and present the result obtained by applying this model to lung_adenocarcinomas and colorectal tumor sequencing_data and simulated_data in section in this article we have proposed a computational_method based on tumor sequencing_data for estimating the probability_distribution of the relative order of mutational_events among tumor driver_genes during tumorigenesis the results obtained from using this method with lung_cancer and colorectal tumor sequencing_data are consistent with the previous evidence obtained from analyzing various stages of cancer this provides a degree of validation of the new method since the early_stages of tumorigenesis are not observable for human tumors we believe that this method will be a useful tool in understanding the process of tumor development application of the new method to the three datasets described here was somewhat limited by the limited number of genes sequenced in those studies this will be much less of a limitation in analysis of the large tumor sequencing studies currently underway these larger datasets may also enable more complex models to be developed our model assumes the number of mutations in driver_genes in a sample is independent of the mutated genes this may not be true in some cases since some genes are known to increase mutation_rates when altered mutator genes if samples having altered mutator genes tend to have many mutations in driver_genes the probability of late_events occurring in mutator genes may be overestimated we examined the correlation between mutational_status of each driver gene and the number of mutated driver_genes in both the lung and colorectal_cancer datasets for the colorectal data there are no driver_genes whose mutational_status was strongly correlated with the number of mutations for lung data there are several genes which showed some correlation but it could have resulted from the gene mutating late and the correlation was not strong enough to suggest that they are mutator genes even for tp the only well known mutator gene in the set of driver_genes the p value for the correlation was our model estimates that tp mutations occur as early events second event for both lung and colorectal data consequently the bias caused by our assumption not being strictly true seems to be small currently no other computational_methods for estimating the order of mutational_events account for the increase of the mutation_rate by mutator genes our method used all non silent mutations occurring in driver_genes in estimating p k i however some of the non silent mutations may be passenger_mutations irrelevant to tumorigenesis since the purpose of our method is to estimate the order of mutations relevant to tumorigenesis we may obtain better estimates by restricting to the mutations occurring in well known functional_domains within genes in this article we estimated the order of mutations in driver_genes however it can be used to estimate the order of any events in general for example it can be applied to estimate the order of copy_number in a defined chromosomal_regions it can also estimate the order of mutations occurring in different functional_domains within a gene if we separate functional_domains in a gene when applying our method if we divide mutations according to different types such as point_mutations insertions_or we can also capture the order of specific types of mutations occurring within a gene if such order matters and if there are enough data to estimate the order accurately as we have indicated previously the method we have developed does not assume that the sequence of mutations is the same for each tumor the probability_distribution estimated provides information about inter tumor variability in the order of mutational_events for a given k the dispersion of p k i values among the genes i indicates the variation among tumors of the k th event for a given gene index i the dispersion of p k i values among the event indices k indicates the degree to which mutations in gene i show an order preference although the sequence of mutations may vary among tumors and late mutations can be clinically_important better understanding the earliest_stages of development of individual tumors may be particularly valuable the earliest mutations are presumably present in all the subsequent sub clones of the tumor and may therefore represent_important therapeutic_targets with the further development of rapid single_molecule deep sequencing_technologies it may become possible to phylogenetically reconstruct the evolution of tumors the current method is a step in using sequencing_data and probabilistic modeling to obtain information about the early_stages of tumorigenesis
