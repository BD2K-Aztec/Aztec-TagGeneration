data_and genclip a web_server for functional clustering of genes and construction of molecular_networks based on free terms identifying biological_functions and molecular_networks in a gene_list and how the genes may relate to various topics is of considerable value to biomedical_researchers here we present a web_based text_mining server genclip which can analyze human genes with enriched keywords and molecular_interactions compared with other similar tools genclip offers two unique features i analysis of gene_functions with free terms i e any terms in the literature generated by literature mining or provided by the user and ii accurate identification and integration of comprehensive molecular_interactions from medline_abstracts to construct molecular_networks and subnetworks related to the free terms availability_and http ci given a set of genes for example from high_throughput experiments it can be helpful to know which biological_functions and molecular_networks may be involved or whether genes from a given list or all human genes are related to certain topics such as various biological and pathological_processes some pre defined annotation databases such as gene_ontology go or pathway_databases such as kegg or proteinprotein_interaction ppi databases such as hprd and intact can be used as a gold_standard description some annotation tools that integrate these manually_curated databases such as david and egan provide convenient and practical_application however owing to structured vocabularies and manual curations pre defined annotations are inevitably limited in scope quantity and flexibility some text_mining tools can compensate for these deficiencies martini and copub adopted a keyword based_approach to annotate gene function however the keywords were still limited in a pre defined thesauri ihop and string generate gene_networks based on genes co occurrence in the literature however even though gene_pairs co occur in the same sentences only of pairs have an actual interaction facta finds hidden associations between concepts and extracts genes related to a topic but it does not search phase or select genes from an input list previously we developed stand alone software called genclip that annotated gene_functions with free terms and generated gene co occurrence networks related to free terms however genclip had three distinct disadvantages i the free terms were limited to single words ii the gene network was constructed based on genes co mentioned in the same abstracts often leading to high false_positives and iii the analysis period generally took weeks and most of the time was spent on literature download thus we have developed genclip a web_server that inherits the advantages of genclip and extends it by incorporating five new features i good performance in gene recognition with f measure rising from to ii expansion of free terms to phrases iii molecular_interaction extraction accuracy of nearly iv search genes related to free terms and v complete analysis in minutes genclip has three modules for text_mining gene_cluster with literature profiles literature mining gene_networks and word related gene search as an example we took upregulated and downregulated genes sample on the main page of keloid to compare with hypertrophic_scar to illustrate the application of our server unlike hypertrophic_scars keloids are disfiguring scars that extend beyond the original wound borders and resist treatment in our analysis enriched keywords were mostly related with cell_growth extracellular_matrix epithelial_mesenchymal emt cell_migration cell_adhesion mesenchymal_stem and wound_healing collagen was manually input as a search_term and found that upregulated genes p e were closely associated with collagen these keywords are mostly concordant with well known characteristics of keloid interestingly keratnocyte and keratinocyte_differentiation were also annotated as keywords and associated genes were all downregulated genes except for one supplementary this reminded us that we should pay more attention to keratnocyte recent study has also shown the important role of keloid keratinocytes in keloid scarring and it was also reported that there were a substantial number of upregulated genes involved in emt in keloid keratinocytes in the word related gene search module we obtained of the input genes that co occurred with epithelial_mesenchymal in sentences we confirmed that upregulated and downregulated genes were related to emt in our experience in general at least of the genes will be related to search_terms resulting gene_networks supplementary showed that upregulated mmp played_an in the network interestingly thbs cst and glb as activators of mmp were upregulated whereas three inhibitors il_rn s a and s a were downregulated most of these genes had not been investigated in keloid however keywords and the related gene search provided strong evidence that they were closely associated with extracellular_matrix emt cell_migration and cell_growth consequently we proposed that abnormal expression of these genes can cause upregulation of mmp and may impact keloid progress
