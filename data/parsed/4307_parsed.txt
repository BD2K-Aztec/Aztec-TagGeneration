snp_calling using genotype model_selection on high_throughput a review of the available single_nucleotide snp_calling procedures for illumina high_throughput hts platform data reveals that most rely mainly on base_calling and mapping qualities as sources of error when calling snps thus errors not involved in base_calling or alignment such as those in genomic sample_preparation are not accounted for results a novel method of consensus and snp_calling genotype model_selection gems is given which accounts for the errors that occur during the preparation of the genomic sample simulations and real_data indicate that gems has the best performance balance of sensitivity and positive_predictive among the tested snp callers within the last few years advances in high_throughput hts technologies have garnered much attention these advances have necessitated more efficient and more accurate data analysis tools one area of recent interest and development is that of single_nucleotide snp_detection scientists have acknowledged and continue to research the significant impact of snps in the development of diseases as well as in pharmacogenomics or personalized_medicine among snp detection_tools or snp callers that can be used for single sample illumina hts platform data popular procedures include those from gatk freebayes http bioinformatics bc edu marthlab freebayes samtools atlas snp snvmix varscan soapsnp and maq upon closer examination it becomes clear that the aforementioned procedures rely mainly on base_calling and mapping quality values as sources of error base_calling and mapping errors can occur when converting raw intensity data into short_read and when aligning these short_read to a reference_genome respectively however they failed to account for genomic sample_preparation errors these errors can occur during the acquisition of the genomic sample the random fragmentation of the sample and the amplification of the fragments in particular unaccounted amplification errors may have a significant negative impact on hts analyses in contrast to the above snp callers here we present genotype model_selection gems our novel snp_detection procedure which accounts for errors in the genomic sample_preparation base_calling and alignment at a given site gems maximizes the likelihood for each possible genotype with respect to the parameter associated with the genomic sample_preparation errors the gems consensus genotype is the one whose likelihood is the largest among all genotype likelihoods the dixon outlier test is then used to determine if a snp should be called at the sites where the consensus genotype differs from the reference genotype this article is organized as follows section reviews a selection of current snp callers that can be used for single sample illumina hts platform data section_describes the gems procedure in detail section compares gems with its competitors through a simulation_study and real_data section gives some concluding_remarks
