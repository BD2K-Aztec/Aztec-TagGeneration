sequence_analysis cdc the missing recj ortholog in eukaryotes dna_replication is one of the most ancient of cellular_processes and functional_similarities among its molecular_machinery are apparent across all cellular life cdc is one of the essential components of the eukaryotic replication_fork and is required for the initiation and elongation of dna_replication but its molecular_function is currently unknown in order to trace its evolutionary_history and to identify functional_domains we embarked on a computational sequence_analysis of the cdc protein_family our findings reveal eukaryotic cdc and prokaryotic recj to possess a common_ancestry and cdc to contain a catalytic_site within a predicted exonuclease domain the likely orthology between cdc and recj reveals new lines of enquiry into dna_replication mechanisms in eukaryotes archaea and eukarya possess dna_replication machineries that are evolutionarily_related indicative of a common_ancestry prior to the divergence of these two ancient lineages in particular progression at eukaryotic replication_forks requires a large multimolecular complex the replisome progression complex consisting of cdc the gins go ichi ni san complex sld psf and mcm archaea possess homologs of only gins subunits and mcm the macromolecular machine presumed to unwind dna during replication in eukaryotes the third component of this complex cdc is essential ubiquitous and critical for the initiation and elongation of dna_replication despite this fundamental contribution to eukaryotic_dna orthologues of cdc are not apparent among either archaea or bacteria is cdc therefore an innovation of early eukaryotic life one that has since become essential in eukaryotic_species from across this diverse kingdom such innovations are very common there is for example no known dna_repair possessing the same arrangement of protein_domains across bacteria archaea and eukaryotes and only one repair protein the exonuclease recj to whom correspondence should be addressed which is conserved in most bacteria and archaea but that is absent from eukarya for most prokaryotic species recj is the only exonuclease that is specific for single_stranded ssdna it is known to be involved in homologous_recombination base_excision mismatch_repair and of particular importance here in the rescue of stalled_replication in order to better understand the molecular_function of cdc which remains far from clear and to trace its evolutionary ancestry we embarked on an extensive analysis of cdc sequences we have identified a statistically_significant sequence_similarity between the n_terminal conserved dhh domains of cdc and recj families we postulate that cdc possesses a divalent_cation mg or mn dependent exonuclease_activity important for dna_replication experimental_approaches are now required to investigate these evolutionary molecular and cellular hypotheses
