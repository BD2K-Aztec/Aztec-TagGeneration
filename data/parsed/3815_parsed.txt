sequence_analysis pyrohmmvar a sensitive and accurate method to call short indels and snps for ion_torrent and data motivation the identification of short insertions_and indels and single_nucleotide snps from ion_torrent and reads is a challenging_problem essentially because these techniques are prone to sequence erroneously at homopolymers and can therefore raise indels in reads most of the existing mapping programs do not model homopolymer errors when aligning_reads against the reference the resulting alignments will then contain various kinds of mismatches and indels that confound the accurate determination of variant loci and alleles results to address these challenges we realign reads against the reference using our previously_proposed hidden_markov that models homopolymer errors and then merges these pairwise_alignments into a weighted alignment graph based on our weighted alignment graph and hidden_markov we develop a method called pyrohmmvar which can simultaneously detect short indels and snps as demonstrated in human resequencing data specifically by applying our methods to simulated diploid datasets we demonstrate that pyrohmmvar produces more accurate results than state of the art methods such as samtools and gatk and is less sensitive to mapping parameter_settings than the other methods we also apply pyrohmmvar to analyze one human whole_genome resequencing dataset and the results confirm that pyrohmmvar predicts snps and indels accurately availability_and source_code freely_available at the followingthe most prevalent variants on the human_genome are single_nucleotide snps the second most prevalent variants are insertions_and indels that occur every k bp among them are short indels bp at present the next_generation facilitates the direct detection of snps and short indels by resequencing a personal genome after sequencing reads are mapped against the reference_genome by read_mapping programs and variants are called by hypothesis_testing methods on the piled up reads however accurate variant detection depends on the ability to discriminate true variants from sequencing_errors particularly for ion_torrent and data indels are the most common sequencing_errors causing incorrect alignments and thus posing a major roadblock to the accurate detection of variants ion_torrent and can uniquely sequence homopolymers by quantifying the number of released by products in the process of dna_synthesis at the same time however these techniques are prone to homopolymer sequencing_errors either overcalling or undercalling the number of homopolymer bases moreover the carry forward and incomplete extension effects which happen as a few template copies may grow in desynchronization with the population also raise insertions in reads however existing mapping methods do not include models to tackle homopolymer errors therefore alignments around homopolymers can be incorrect resulting in calling false variants therefore a comprehensive method is necessary to improve the accuracy of variant_calling for ion_torrent and data most of the existing_methods detect snps and indels independently the general_strategy is to establish an accurate error_model for the specific sequencing_platform for example atlassnp developed a logistical regression_model relying on sequence_context to discriminate true snps from sequencing_errors realignment has been proven as an efficient method to improve accuracy by adjusting raw mappings in response samtools for example deploys a concept termed base alignment_quality which is calculated by realigning a read against a reference to decrease false snps caused by nearby indels meanwhile gatk adjusts the alignments of reads spanning over indels by performing local multiple_sequence however as noted above most of these methods are not designed to engage the problem of homopolymer errors and incorrect alignments around homopolymers we previously_proposed a method termed pyrohmmsnp for ion_torrent and this method implements a hidden_markov hmm to formulate homopolymer errors and trains the hmm by an expectation_maximization em_algorithm using resequencing data then the trained hmm is used to realign reads against the reference_sequence around homopolymers to improve the performance of snp_calling to whom correspondence should be addressed identification of indels in the reference is a more challenging_problem in short_read one of the major_obstacles is to identify potential genome positions where indels are located strategies for identifying indels are different specifically long insertions can only be found through sequence_assembly either local_assembly or global assembly whereas deletions can be found through either sequence_assembly or sequence_alignments strategies for identifying short and long indels are also quite different in principle short indels sometimes even long deletions can be found by aligning one read against the reference as long as a reliable read_mapping program is used however because the read_length is short such mapping generally produces many false alignments with various kinds of indels and mismatches to confirm the existence of an indel we would have to examine multiple pieces of evidence such as multiple aligned_reads read_coverage and constraints of paired_end to the best of our knowledge robust indel detection remains unsettled in this article we propose a method termed pyrohmmvar to call snps and short indels for both ion_torrent and resequencing data two distinct_features are highlighted in pyrohmmvar first we introduce an hmm to formulate homopolymer errors the hmm can accurately distinguish real signals from sequencing_errors and thus improve the alignment of reads against the reference the parameters of hmm are trained directly from raw mapping results through an iterative em_algorithm second we propose a graph data_structure that merges multiple aligned_reads at a given locus into a weighted alignment graph from which we reconstruct the consensus_sequence s the use of the weighted alignment graph provides the following advantages first it enables the straightforward construction of the haplotype s which may contain both snps and indels in comparison dindel infers indels separately from snps second we propose an efficient traversal algorithm over the weighted alignment graph to avoid the exhaustive and computationally complex enumeration of candidate haplotypes we simulate snps and short indels in the diploid_genome and use them to test the performance of pyrohmmvar compared with two state of the art methods samtools and gatk pyrohmmvar gives more accurate results we also test the effect of the raw alignments produced by mapping programs to indel snp_calling accuracy by varying the scoring_function of bwa_sw to produce different mappings the test results show that pyrohmmvar is less sensitive to the variation of the scoring_function than the other programs finally we apply pyrohmmvar to analyze one human whole_genome resequencing dataset and the results confirm that pyrohmmvar predicts snps and indels accurately
