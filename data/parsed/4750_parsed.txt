genetics_and trox a new method to learn about the genesis of aneuploidy from trisomic products of conception motivation an estimated of clinically recognized conceptions are aneuploid leading to spontaneous miscarriages in vitro_fertilization failures and when viable severe developmental_disabilities with the ongoing reduction in the cost of genotyping and dna_sequencing the use of high_density snp markers for clinical_diagnosis of aneuploidy and biomedical_research into its causes is becoming common practice a reliable flexible and computationally feasible_method for inferring the sources of aneuploidy is thus crucial results we propose a new method trox for analyzing human tri somy data using high_density markers from a trisomic individual or product of conception and one parent using a hidden_markov we infer the stage of the meiotic error i or ii and the individual in which non disjunction event occurred as well as the crossover locations on the trisomic chromosome a novel and important feature of the method is its reliance on data from the proband and only one parent reducing the experimental cost by a third and enabling a larger set of data to be used we evaluate our method by applying it to simulated trio data as well as to genotype data for trios that include a child trisomic for chromosome the analyses show the method to be highly_reliable even when data from only one parent are available with the increasing availability of dna samples from mother and fetus application of approaches such as ours should yield unprecedented insights into the genetic risk_factors for aneuploidy availability_and an r package implementing trox is available for download ata fundamental step in meiosis is the segregation of chromosomes to create haploid egg and sperm_cells in humans this process is highly error_prone of clinically recognized pregnancies are thought to be aneuploid i e to carry an abnormal number of chromosomes the vast_majority of aneuploid pregnancies result in spontaneous miscarriages or lead to severe developmental_disabilities in the child when not embryonic_lethal conversely aneuploidy underlies more than a third of spontaneous miscarriages aneuploidy results from the improper segregation of chromosomes to daughter_cells termed non disjunction and can in principle occur in either male or female and in mitosis or meiosis in practice in humans the vast_majority of non disjunction events are of maternal origin meiotic non disjunction can further originate in meiosis i mi if homologous_chromosomes fail to disjoin or in meiosis ii mii if sister_chromatids do not segregate properly errors in mi are thought to be more common though the proportions vary across chromosomes e g mii is more common for chromosome among known risk_factors for aneuploidy are maternal_age with rates of trisomies increasing exponentially after the age of approximately and errors in recombination in humans as in most sexually reproducing organisms there is an obligate crossover per chromosome to ensure_proper disjunction see and references therein if no crossover occurs and in the absence of a backup mechanism for achiasmatic segregation chromatids are distributed randomly into daughter_cells and thus are expected to result in aneuploidy in half the cases accordingly the genetic_map of chromosomes that experience non disjunction in mi is shorter than seen in proper disjunctions in addition to too few crossovers an abnormal placement of crossovers e g events unusually close to the centromere has been associated with chromosome and trisomies hassold and hunt and references therein beyond these features little is known about the risk_factors for non disjunction in particular it remains_unclear how much the locations of crossovers overlap between transmissions with proper disjunction and transmissions that lead to aneuploidy the analysis of genetic data from trisomic children or trisomic products of conceptions poc henceforth referred to as probands and their parents allows one to identify the stage mi or mii in which the non disjunction occurred and the origin maternal or paternal in a subset of cases it also allows one to infer the locations of a subset of crossover events that occurred on the tetrad of the chromosome that did not disjoin properly thus as genotyping and sequencing methods become much more accessible and as non_invasive methods to sample fetal dna from maternal_blood become widespread there is an to whom correspondence should be addressed unprecedented opportunity to gain a better understanding of genetic risk_factors for non disjunction there exist a number of methods to infer the stage of meiosis at which non disjunction occurred and to identify crossovers all are based on the same basic idea to look for chromosome segments in which the trisomic chromosome has retained the paternal or maternal heterozygosity whether this segment surrounds the centromere is indicative of the stage of meiosis in which non disjunction occurred and the switches between retained heterozygosity and homozygosity point to the location of crossovers existing_methods suffer from important_limitations however some rely on few highly polymorphic_markers such as microsatellites and are not computationally_feasible for highdensity markers so do not allow recombination_events to be precisely localized others can handle single_nucleotide snp_genotype but require data from both parents as well as complete triploid genotype_calls for the proband requiring that for example att be distinguished from aat instead of simply read as heterozygous none of the existing_methods have an explicit error_model instead they rely on post_hoc filtering to identify crossovers potentially leading to errors and inconsistencies among studies finally and perhaps most importantly from a practical standpoint none of the computationally_feasible methods can accommodate missing_data from the male when collecting samples from both male_and is often prohibitive motivated by these considerations we developed a new method trox trisomy crossover and made the software available online as an r package it uses a hidden_markov hmm to identify the parent and stage of meiosis in which non disjunction occurred and calls crossover locations on the chromosome involved in non disjunction from dense snp data the method can be used on trio data or data from only the proband and one parent and takes_into genotyping_errors and missing_data moreover our method can be applied to diploid genotype data from the trisomic chromosome i e where att and aat are both simply considered heterozygous we assessed the performance of our method using simulated trisomic sequences based on individuals from the genomes_project and to evaluate how well the method performed when the father is masked we applied the method to trios with trisomy previously analyzed by oliver et_al existing_methods for analyzing human trisomies using dense snp data rely on the availability of dna samples from both the mother and the father however it is often impractical to obtain a sample from the father which in turn causes in a drastic_reduction of full trios for study for example in a prospective_study of recurrent_miscarriages paternal dna was not available in of the cases z williams personal communication by requiring only the sequence from the mother and the proband our method overcomes this limitation importantly our results suggest that even with diploid data missing_data from the male do not affect our estimates of the number of crossovers and stage of the error unless the father is the ndjp in this case estimates of crossover locations become less reliable however this scenario should constitutes of all cases assuming that in of the cases the data from the father are not available and a chance that the father is the ndjp thus for most practical purposes a sample from the father is unnecessary for these inferences and therefore our method allows one to reduce experimental costs by a third a further advantage of our method is that by incorporating an explicit error_model it bypasses the need to filter markers somewhat arbitrarily in ways that could introduce differences among studies in addition the method allows for missing parental data at a given site increasing the number of markers that can be used our simulations further indicate that without paternal data the method performs better in estimating the number of crossovers when applied to afr populations as compared with ceu populations supplementary figures s one explanation is that in our model we ignore linkage_disequilibrium ld among sites and because ld levels are higher in eur population this assumption may be more problematic we examined this hypothesis by applying the method on simulated sequences with no ld and indeed the method performs better in this case data notshown if precise resolution of crossovers is not important to the specific study one solution might then be to thin the markers so to minimize ld among them or alternatively to thin the markers to call crossovers and then localize them using all the data one limitation of our method is that it relies on accurate_knowledge about the ancestry of the parent whose data are missing to assess the effect of using incorrect ancestry information we switched population labels between ceu and afr in the trisomy samples and reanalyzed the data our results suggest that the reliability of inference about the parent of origin remains the same and in of the cases estimates of the meiotic stage of the error are unaffected in contrast estimates of the number of crossovers become less reliable with of cases showing a different number than with the correct ancestry after application of our filters a related problem is what would happen if the parent whose data are missing is admixed both problems could be overcome either by extending this approach to consider the ancestries as additional parameters to be inferred by the method or by using methods such as principal_component e g to infer the ancestry of the missing parent from the proband and maternal genotype data in conclusion the rapid decrease in genotyping and sequencing_costs in combination with the advent of non_invasive approaches to sample fetal dna from a maternal blood_sample allow the genomes of mother and fetus to be readily surveyed among these will be a substantial fraction of cases in which the fetus is trisomic application of our method and related approaches to such data should yield unprecedented insight into recombination profiles that underlie non disjunction and ultimately help to identify risk_factors of aneuploidy in humans an open_source r package implementing our approach is available at http przeworski uchicago edu users can choose one of our error models or specify their own
