genome_analysis whopgenome high_speed access to whole genome_variation and sequence_data in r the statistical programming_language r has become a de facto standard for the analysis of many types of biological data and is well suited for the rapid development of new algorithms however variant call data from population scale resequencing projects are typically too large to be read and processed efficiently with rs built in i o capabilities whopgenome can efficiently read whole genome_variation data stored in the widely used variant_call vcf file_format into several r data types vcf files can be accessed either on local hard drives or on remote servers whopgenome can associate variants with annotations such as those available from the ucsc_genome and can accelerate the reading process by filtering loci according to user defined_criteria whopgenome can also read other tabix indexed files and create indices to allow fast selective access to fasta formatted sequence files availability_and the whopgenome r package is available on cran at http cran r project org_web whopgenome a bioconductor_package has been submitted contact population scale whole_genome sequencing_projects produce information on single_nucleotide snps indels and structural_variations across thousands of individuals these projects commonly use the variant_call vcf genomes_project analysis text_files for data storage the resulting files often contain millions of variant sites and may fill tens of gigabytes the environment for statistical computing r r core has established itself as a de facto standard for general statistics and for the analysis of different types of sequencing_data and has efficient functions to process large vectorized data however routinely reading gigabyte sized vcf files into r is not realistic with rs built in i o capabilities vcf files are typically compressed and then indexed with tabix tabix produces an index file for appropriately formatted data_files the index can be used to quickly locate decompress and extract selected portions of the data although several r packages are capable of reading vcf files seqminer http cran r project org_web seqminer rplinkseq https atgu mgh harvard edu plinkseq these lack the desirable speed ease of use or completeness of support for tabix files further these implementations post process the text returned by tabix in r which incurs a sizeable overhead especially for repeated and large_scale processing here we present whopgenome an r package for fast straightforward and flexible processing of genomic_variation data in vcf format whopgenome is also capable of compressing files with bgzf and indexing any suitably formatted file with tabix allowing efficient selective access indexing is possible on any data organized and sorted into entries uniquely identifiable by index pairs a group name e g a chromosome and a number e g a chromosomal position with whopgenomes generic tabix interface users can process for example gff or bed files to access them efficiently from within r the same selective access functionality exists also for fasta files through whopgenomes interface to faidx the indexing solution included in samtools genome_project data_processing using this interface to preprocess fasta files facilitates quick selective retrieval of dna or amino_acid sequence_regions whopgenome can thus efficiently integrate_information from associated sequence genome_annotation and population scale variation files for a given chromosomal_region for joint processing
