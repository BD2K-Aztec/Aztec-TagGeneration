data_and overlap and diversity in antimicrobial_peptide databases compiling a non redundant set of sequences downloaded from motivation the large variety of antimicrobial_peptide amp databases developed to date are characterized by a substantial overlap of data and similarity of sequences our goals are to analyze the levels of redundancy for all available amp databases and use this information to build a new non redundant sequence database for this purpose a new software_tool is introduced results a comparative_study of amp databases reveals the overlap and diversity among them and the internal diversity within each database the overlap analysis shows that only one database peptaibol contains exclusive data not present in any other whereas all sequences in the lamp patent database are included in camp patent however the majority of databases have their own set of unique_sequences as well as some overlap with other databases the complete set of non duplicate sequences comprises cases which is almost half of the total number of reported peptides on the other hand the diversity analysis_identifies the most and least diverse databases and proves that all databases exhibit some level of redundancy finally we present a new parallel free software named dover analyzer developed to compute the overlap and diversity between any number of databases and compile a set of non redundant sequences these results are useful for selecting or building a suitable representative set of amps according to specific needs availability_and the regularly updated non redundant sequence_databases and the dover analyzer software to perform custom analysis are available at http mobiosd hub com doveranalyzer antimicrobial_peptides amps have emerged as an alternative_solution against multi_drug infections these compounds are part of the innate_host system in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms and exhibit a broad_spectrum against a variety of pathogens including bacteria and fungi additionally antitumor antiviral and antiparasitic activities have been described for some of these peptides this provides a valuable ground for the discovery of new drugs that mimic the antimicrobial_activity or that possess in some cases anticancer antiviral or antiparasitic functions a growing number of naturally_occurring amps are being discovered thanks to huge research_efforts additionally synthetic new peptides are being designed to understand imitate or improve the natural ones for example although one of the first published amp databases comprised peptides mainly from natural sources a recent one holds natural and synthetic cases today there are many amp databases available which depending on the origin of peptides can be classified as general or specific the general databases comprise entries from a large variety of sources whereas the specific ones are dedicated to store amps that come from a particular type of organism like bacteria fungi or plants or belong to a particular family like defensins or penaeidin it is clear that the general databases must share some identical_sequences at least with the specialized ones similarly there can be overlap between databases designed for different purposes due to the multiple functions of amps non identical but similar sequences may likewise be found in biological_databases tolerating some redundancy of content can be useful to derive a set of sequence_based physicochemical_properties which would be essential for molecular_functions however duplication and redundancy in a large collection of biological data can also introduce distortions in the analysis of sequencestructure or sequenceproperty relationships or affect the efficiency in a similarity_search to avoid these problems the duplicate entries can be merged and closely_similar sequences can be clustered thus yielding a representative set that covers the sequence_space in this article we aim to analyze the levels of overlap and diversity for the case of well known amp databases and to compile a new non redundant sequence database to fulfill this purpose we have developed a software_tool which is also presented here
