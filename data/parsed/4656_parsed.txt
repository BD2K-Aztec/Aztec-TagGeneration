the virtual fly brain browser and query interface motivation sources of neuroscience data in drosophila are diverse and disparate making integrated search and retrieval difficult a major_obstacle to this is the lack of a comprehensive and logically structured anatomical framework and an intuitive_interface results we present an online resource that provides a convenient way to study and query fly brain anatomy expression and genetic data we extended the newly_developed brainname nomenclature for the adult fly brain into a logically structured ontology that relates a comprehensive set of published neuron classes to the brain_regions they innervate the virtual fly brain interface allows users to explore the structure of the drosophila brain by browsing d images of a brain with subregions displayed as coloured overlays an integrated query mechanism allows complex searches of underlying anatomy cells expression and other data from community databases availability virtual fly brain is freely_available online at www virtualflybrain org contact with its relatively simple architecture and unparalleled level of genetic tractability the brain of drosophila is an ideal model for fundamental neuroscience_research however in practice navigating the drosophila neurobiology literature and the various community databases is a real challenge the literatures long history and diversity have resulted in a variety of often conflicting terminologies information about useful research reagents is scattered across a number of databases that are not interoperable and rarely even cross_referenced consequently finding for example data about the connectivity between two brain_regions or where genes are expressed or what resources exist is an arduous and difficult_task to realize the value of the scientific investment in drosophila neuroscience the community requires a robust anatomical framework with the supporting data_structures and computational_tools to exploit it the first challenge is to agree on a common framework for gross_anatomy this has been addressed for the first time by the brainname consortium who proposed a revised nomenclature for the insect_brain k submitted for to whom correspondence should be addressed publication with each term defined both textually and as a volume in a reference drosophila brain next we need to be able to construct and solve useful searches and integrate data from disparate sources using the web_ontology owl http www w org tr owl primer it is possible to store complex relationships between terms and with the help of reasoning software to use those relationships to automate classification and drive queries for example the relationship between a class of neurons and a structure that it innervates can provide both a substrate for useful queries what neurons innervate region x and a criterion for classification all neurons in class a innervate some region x an ontology also provides a mechanism for common annotation of neuroanatomical data allowing easy integration of data from disparate resources aligned serial images such as those from confocal_microscopy are a key tool for visualizing anatomical_structures or regions of gene_expression in the drosophila nervous_system e g demarcation or painting of known neuropil domains on top of such image_stacks provides a powerful_tool for research and study of the brain structure processing and viewing such data locally can be done using graphics software such as amira or imagej fiji there are also powerful specialist desktop based systems for interactively exploring the drosophila nervous_system in d however such datasets are also large and viewing them requires high specification workstation hardware and a lot of storage rather than commodity computing another characteristic of such image data is that it is expensive to produce and therefore its sharing and distribution is of paramount_importance obviously sharing such bulky data imposes serious requirements on data storage and data transfer bandwidth the ideal way of distributing and sharing image data is via web interfaces most existing projects in the community use ad_hoc solutions such as downsized pre compiled quicktime movies or representative reconstructions e g flytrap braintrap some of the more recent solutions also provide interactive d browsing functions such as volume rotationalthough the reduction of resolution from raw dataset to that observed on the browser still remains an issue to more fully_exploit these d images mechanisms are required to display the boundaries and extent of defined structures such
