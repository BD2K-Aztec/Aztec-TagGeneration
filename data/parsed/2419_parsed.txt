gene_expression incromap integrated analysis of cross_platform microarray and pathway data microarrays are commonly used to detect changes in gene_expression between different biological_samples for this purpose many analysis tools have been developed that offer visualization statistical_analysis and more sophisticated analysis methods most of these tools are designed specifically for messenger_rna microarrays however today more and more different microarray_platforms are available changes in dna_methylation microrna expression or even protein_phosphorylation states can be detected with specialized arrays for these microarray_technologies the number of available tools is small compared with mrna analysis tools especially a joint analysis of different microarray_platforms that have been used on the same set of biological_samples is hardly supported by most microarray_analysis tools here we present incromap a tool for the analysis and visualization of high_level microarray_data from individual or multiple different platforms currently incromap supports mrna microrna dna_methylation and protein_modification datasets several methods are offered that allow for an integrated analysis of data from those platforms the available features of incromap range from visualization of dna_methylation data over annotation of microrna targets and integrated gene_set to a joint visualization of data from all platforms in the context of metabolic or signalling_pathways typical workflows for the analysis of microarray_data involve several steps namely the preparation of samples and arrays their hybridization to arrays scanning the array and processing the image to read out the raw probe intensities depending on the array type several quality_control and low_level data analysis steps are then performed in silico these steps mostly include normalization annotation of gene identifiers and the calculation of diverse measures of differential probe level intensities such as p values fold changes or log ratios mostly these tasks are performed in r a statistical programming_language www r project org or by using derived applications with a graphicalto integrate data from multiple_platforms a common_denominator must be established the vast_majority of all data are somehow associated with genes hence integration of multiple data types is performed by mapping each probe to a gene this procedure is straightforward for protein or mrna datasets dna_methylation datasets are region based and can be mapped onto genes by defining a window upstream and downstream of each genes transcription_start incromap proposes a window of and bp as default region but users may change these values integration of microrna data is performed by annotating the genes of the mrna_targets to each microrna for this task the user can choose between three microrna target databases that contain experimentally_verified targets and three databases with predicted targets listed in databases reviewed in a first approach to integratively investigate data from any two platforms is the data pairing procedure this procedure shows two datasets next to each other thus simplifying common lookup task such as investigating the effect of a differentially to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work methylated promoter on mrna_level further this view is especially suitable to inspect the effect of microrna expression on target_mrnas an arbitrary amount of data from different platforms can be inspected using the integrate heterogenous data procedure to keep the clarity only the most relevant_information that is the expression values as fold changes or p values are shown therefore one row is created for each gene and one column for each platform a hierarchical representation of the table allows for expanding nodes to get more information such as all micrornas targeting this genes mrna a popular method for a generic analysis of expression data is performing a gene_set we have extended this procedure to an integrated gene_set that is able to perform enrichments across multiple_platforms the user can choose the datasets and thresholds for each dataset to calculate a p value using a hypergeometric_test for each predefined gene_set incromap supports gene_sets from the kegg_pathway gene_ontology and any gene_set from the molecular_signatures www broadinstitute org gsea msigdb furthermore biopax level and level pathways can be imported for visualization in incromap the results of a pathway enrichment can further be visualized in metapathways e g the metabolic_pathways map together with mrna_expression data and enriched sub pathways all pathways are visualized using keggtranslator and incromap extends these pathways by visualizing expression data from each single_platform therein therefore node colour is changed according to mrna_expression and small boxes are added and coloured according to each protein_modifications expression value micrornas are added as small coloured triangles to the graph and are connected to their targets with edges dna_methylation data are indicated with a black bar that shows the maximum differential peak in each genes promoter stretching from the middle to the left to indicate hypomethylation and to the right for hypermethylation this is an interactive graph therefore allowing users to modify the layout and selecting nodes to get more detailed information and plots of the associated expression data besides those integrated analysis methods incromap allows plotting region based dna_methylation data in a genome plot with boxes for gene_bodies which in turn can be coloured according to mrna_expression further all enrichments can also be performed on any single dataset which is straightforward for mrna or protein datasets but implementations that can also handle dna_methylation or microrna data are less common
