bioimage_informatics automated prior_knowledge based quantification of neuronal patterns in the spinal_cord of zebrafish motivation to reliably assess the effects of unknown chemicals on the development of fluorescently_labeled sensory moto and inter neuron populations in the spinal_cord of zebrafish automated data analysis is essential results for the evaluation of a high_throughput screen of a large chemical library we developed a new method for the automated extraction of quantitative information from green_fluorescent egfp and red_fluorescent rfp labeled spinal_cord neurons in double transgenic zebrafish_embryos the methodology comprises region of interest detection intensity profiling with reference comparison and neuron distribution histograms all methods were validated on a manually evaluated pilot_study using a notch inhibitor dose response experiment the automated evaluation showed superior_performance to manual investigation regarding time consumption information detail and reproducibility availability_and being part of gnu general public licence gnu gpl licensed open_source matlab toolbox gait cad an implementation of the presented methods is publicly_available for download at http sourceforge net_projects zebrafishimage research in the life_sciences is producing an ever increasing amount of experimental_data in basically all areas particularly the fields of toxicology chemical genetics and classical genetics where possibly tens_of of treatments of embryos have to be analyzed benefit from lately established high_throughput acquisition techniques that enable large_scale experiments which have been inconceivable in the past in recent_years zebrafish_embryos have emerged as attractive models for the screening of small_molecules with the aim to identify new entities with a specific effect on cellular and developmental_processes the zebrafish provides a complex cellular_environment that cannot be mimicked in conventional pharmacological screens with in vitro systems furthermore a multitude of properties such as fast reproduction and ex utero development easy husbandry and handling availability of many stable transgenic_lines and the transparency in early_developmental make the zebrafish an ideal model_organism for high_throughput in many cases however the facilitated and highly automated possibilities on the experimentalists side unravel a variety of new challenges and problems in subsequent data analysis steps as meaningful_information contained in the large amount of obtained data can hardly be extracted manually anymore specialized software is needed to support or optimally take over the whole data analysis in an automated pipeline besides various articles_describing manually semiautomatically evaluated experiments multiple approaches for the automated evaluation of zebrafishbased screens have already been proposed in the literature a comprehensive survey can be found in methods for the automated analysis of gene_expression based on image co localization and morphing of regional intensity information to a reference embryo were described by various publications tackled the problem of automated phenotype recognition by means of multi resolution segmentation randomized sub window and descriptor based classification respectively moreover to detect and quantify nuclei in images several blob detection methods exist e g based on circular hough_transform diffused gradient_vector and laplacian of gaussian log blob detection as described by approaches for the automated region of interest roi detection via template_matching were presented byor the approaches described by are most closely_related to our analysis however it is not yet possible to quantify the diverse neuron distributions of the spinal_cord in zebrafish the aim of this work was to derive an automated analysis_pipeline that could be used to analyze the effect of chemicals on position number and fluorescence_intensity of the three different neuronal cell_types in the spinal_cord of zebrafish namely to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two and last two authors should be regarded_as rohonbeard sensory_neurons interneurons and motoneurons supplementary therefore we performed a pilot_study using a double transgenic zebrafish with rohonbeard cells and motoneurons expressing rfp and interneurons expressing egfp in the spinal_cord the developed algorithms should reliably extract both quantitative and qualitative information and should be applicable for high_throughput in section we briefly present the experimental_design of the pilot_study used for algorithmic development and introduce the newly_developed image analysis_pipeline which is comprised of roi extraction intensity profile analysis of different neuron types as well as quantification of sensory and motoneurons the validation of the methods and biological conclusions can be found in section finally in section we discuss the benefits and limitations of our methods although diverse zebrafish related implementations already exist up to the best of our knowledge none of the available methods and software_packages was directly applicable to the challenges observed in our experiment to analyze the doubletransgenic zebrafish line information fusion of content found in different fluorescent channels was required to attain profound insights into treatment effects on neural_development the most similar methodology to ours with a focus on automated overlay of intensity profiles for the gfp channel curves are colored according to the classification a significant reduction of the interneuron intensity can be observed a slight effect can be seen for a concentration m and a strong effect for higher concentrations of ly the norm corridor is foreshadowed by the gray surface the embryo alignment_method described by chen et_al however was only applicable if the spinal_cord exhibited a clear linear shape we overcame the linear shape restriction by use of third order polynomial_regression to extract a linearized and rotation corrected crop image of the spinal_cord region in contrast to the blob detection described by liu et_al which had a high_error for sensory_neuron detection our method uses a log scale_space based blob detection method to identify approximate centroids of stained nuclei in different fluorescence channels additionally we present a method to quantify intensity profiles that reflect distributions of different neuron types present in the spinal_cord region this method_proved to be highly_robust against misdetections and provided an instant impression of phenotype alterations for sensory_neurons interneurons and motoneurons on chemical_exposure we exploited the potential of spatial distribution methods to analyze and compare these intensity profiles between different embryos and treatments the proposed methods were validated on a manually assembled ground_truth from a doseresponse experiment with a notch_receptor inhibitor the spinal_cord detection robustly identified regression curves in of the images that could successfully be used as a reference for further processing the erroneous regressions however were still usable as the spinal_cord was matched for the most part and only subtle deviations in border regions of the images occurred the problems were mostly caused by undesired imaging effects such as dirt dust or overexposed regions in some of these cases the binarization of the images had difficulties in extracting the correct spinal_cord region this issue might be solved by an explicit shape model that describes the silhouette of the desired region although the described method reliably extracted sensory_neurons from the given images it should be noted that it performed sub optimally for quantification of motoneurons in the cy channel despite the inaccurate counts however the method could still be useful to estimate qualitative tendencies of the motoneuron distributions to attain reliable information about motoneuron appearance the intensity profile information described in section is recommended the limited capabilities of the algorithm to differentiate between individual motoneurons were mainly caused by insufficient image_resolution and could vanish as soon as the magnification level is increased additionally more sophisticated nucleus detection methods such as described byor even a fusion of nuclei detected by different algorithms could be performed assuming a perfectly linearized crop image intensity profilebased methods and values were both informative and robust against misdetections using the norm corridor of control embryo intensity profiles a deviation of treated_embryos from the norm could be easily detected either by intensity profile visualizations as depicted in figures and or quantitatively by using measures such as the norm deviation described in equation the classification results showed that the features were well suited to distinguish between different treatment effects observed in the considered experiment owing to the high versatility of the extracted_features investigated embryos or rather the possible treatment effects could be
