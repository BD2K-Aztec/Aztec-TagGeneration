databases_and darned a database of rna_editing in humans motivation rna_editing is a phenomenon which is responsible for the alteration of particular nucleotides in rna_sequences relative to their genomic templates recently a large number of rna_editing instances in humans have been identified using bioinformatic screens and high_throughput experimental_investigations utilizing next_generation however the available data on rna_editing are not uniform and difficult to access results here we describe a new database darned database of rna_editing that provides centralized access to available published_data related to rna_editing rna_editing locations are mapped on the reference human_genome the current release of the database contains information on approximately human_genome coordinates corresponding to rna locations that undergo rna_editing mostly involving adenosine to inosine a to i substitutions the data can be queried using a range of genomic_coordinates their corresponding functional localization in rna_molecules exons introns coding_sequence cds and untranslated_regions utrs and information regarding tissue organ cell sources where rna_editing has been observed it is also possible to obtain rna_editing information for a specific gene or an rna_molecule using corresponding accession_numbers search results provide information on the number of expressed_sequence ests supporting edited and genomic bases functional localization of rna_editing and existence of known single_nucleotide snps editing data can be explored in ucsc and ensembl genome_browsers in conjunction with additional data provided by these popular genome_browsers darned has been designed for researchers seeking_information on rna_editing and for the developers of novel algorithms for its prediction availability darned is accessible at http rna_editing is a biological_phenomenon of changing rna_sequence relative to its corresponding dna_template by inserting deleting or substituting one or a few nucleotides it is distinct from other nucleotide modifications in which nucleotides retain their identities during decoding or sequencing for instance a change of adenosine toinosine a to i is considered as rna_editing since inosines are recognized as guanosines by polymerases and the translationary to whom correspondence should be addressed machinery while methylation of adenosines is not considered an editing event since the identity of the nucleotide remains the same rna_editing has been found across all kingdoms of life including viruses there are several molecular_mechanisms responsible for rna_editing it can occur co transcriptionally for example due to slippage of a growing nascent rna chain relative to its template resulting in insertion or deletion of nucleotides alternatively it can be a result of enzymatic modification e g deamination of cytidines and adenosines that leads to the formation of uridines and inosines respectively earlier rna_editing was known to be particularly abundant in plant organelles and was also identified in a few human genes where it contributes to diversification of corresponding protein products such as those encoding the apob protein and the glutamate and serotonin receptors the abundance of rna_editing in humans however has only recently come to light most rna_editing instances found so_far in humans involve a to i conversions that are carried_out by adars adenosine_deaminase that acts on rnas adars bind to double_stranded regions of rna_molecules and catalyze deamination of adenosines converting them to inosine residues therefore the majority of rna_editing instances occur in regions where long rna stemloop structures can be formed and are particularly abundant among alu repeats rna_editing plays a variety of functional_roles in gene_expression rna_editing of a nucleotide within the coding_sequence cds may change the identity of a particular encoded amino_acid or could generate significantly altered protein_sequences if editing leads to the formation of a stop_codon e g the apob case mentioned earlier editing occurring within introns can affect splicing effectively resulting in the generation of alternatively_spliced products hyper editing of untranslated_regions utrs leads to retention of mrna inside the nucleus consequently down regulating synthesis of the encoded_protein by preventing transport of its mrna to the cytoplasm an interesting role of rna_editing is in diversification of mirna sequences that consequently change their target repertoire abnormal rna_editing has also been associated with a number of diseases including several neurological_disorders and cancers a large number of recently_discovered rna_editing instances have been found by means of bioinformatic screens of discrepancies between genomic_sequences and corresponding rna products and by applying statistical filters to distinguish rna_editing frompage
