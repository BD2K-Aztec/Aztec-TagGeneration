flaimapper computational annotation of small ncrna derived fragments using rna_seq high_throughput data motivation recent_discoveries show that most types of small_non sncrnas such as mirnas snornas and trnas get further processed into putatively active smaller rna species their roles genetic profiles and underlying processing mechanisms are only partially understood to find their quantities and characteristics a proper annotation is essential here we present flaimapper a method that extracts and annotates the locations of sncrna derived rnas sncdrnas these sncdrnas are often detected in sequencing_data and observed as fragments of their precursor sncrna using small rna_seq read_alignments flaimapper is able to annotate fragments primarily by peak_detection on the start and end position densities followed by filtering and a reconstruction_process results to assess performance of flaimapper we used independent publicly_available small rna_seq we were able to detect fragments representing putative sncdrnas from nearly all types of sncrna including of the annotated mirnas in mirbase that have supporting reads comparison of flaimapper predicted boundaries of mirnas with mirbase entries demonstrated that of the start and of the end positions are identical additional benchmarking showed that flaimapper is superior in performance compared with existing software further analysis indicated a variety of characteristics in the fragments including sequence_motifs and relations with rna interacting_factors these characteristics set a good basis for further research on sncdrnas availability_and the platform independent gpl licensed python code is available at https github com yhoogstrate flaimapper corresponding linux specific scripts and annotations can be found in the same repository sequencing of small_non sncrnas aiming at the quantification and discovery of micrornas mirnas small_nucleolar snornas transfer rnas trnas and vault rnas vtrnas has revealed that most types of sncrnas get processed into smaller rnas initially it was suggested that these smaller rnas are degradation_products of the turnover of their precursors nevertheless evidence accumulating over the last years demonstrates that some rna_fragments are such fragments find their origin in trnas vtrnas and snornas and are assumed to have a variety of functions most importantly deregulation and involvement of different types of fragments have been demonstrated in different types of cancer a description of commonly_detected fragments and their precursors is given below bullet a pre mirna is an approximately nt_long rna_molecule produced from its primary precursor transcript pri mirna by drosha pre mirnas adopt a hairpin_structure recognized by dicer that cleaves the terminal loop to release an approximately nt_long double_stranded mirna duplex one of the strands mirna is loaded into ago to generate the functional mirisc complex lin he fabian and the remaining strand mirna is usually degraded often both strands are found as fragments in small rna_seq bullet fragments originating from mature trnas are commonly classified into two subgroups trna halves and trna derived_rna trfs bullet trna halves are most probably produced by angiogenin that cleaves the trna near its anticodon resulting into halve trnas nt it is believed that some trna halves contribute to translational_repression and cell stress_response bullet the smaller nt trfs are derived from the trnas and end and from the pre trnas end it is not completely_understood which proteins are involved in the production of trfs although evidence for associations with both dicer and rnasez are reported although the putative functions of the majority of trfs are unclear evidence suggests that some are involved in rna_interference with effects on cell_proliferation and gene_regulation bullet snorna are nt small_rnas found in the nucleolus they comprise the subtypes h aca box c d box and small cajal body specific rnas scarnas putative functions such as regulation of alternative_splicing post_transcriptional and associations with cancer have been proposed for their fragments currently studies on fragments other than mirna and mirna are restricted to often visual interpretation of alignments consequently the data are inspected only at a global ncrna level not making use of the annotation of exact fragment coordinates is a shortcoming since it restricts analysis at the level of individual fragments additional benefit of such analysis is the gained statistical_power here we describe fragment location annotation mapper flaimapper that predicts the locations of sncrna fragments in small rna_seq alignments prediction is based on the densities of start and end positions of aligned_reads it is important to state that the goal is not to predict any particular subtype of fragment but to annotate data for subsequent quantitative analysis by making use of sequencing_data only therefore flaimapper does not use d structure_prediction or classification based on heuristics of previous discoveries as often is used for the prediction of pre mirnas we set out a method able to extract and annotate ncrna fragments because such annotations can be helpful in further high_throughput relation between sequencing_depth and offset in predicted mirbase annotations for dataset srp the horizontal axis represents the offset for the start left and end right positions between a mirna annotation and a predicted fragment predictions with exact_matches are located at offsets are predicted upstream the mirnas boundaries and offsets downstream the vertical_axis represents the number of reads corresponding to a start left or end right position the figure indicates that the higher the number of corresponding reads the lower the offset overall the predicted start positions have a lower offset than the end positions for the same sequencing_depth research we designed flaimapper a computer program to predict ncrna fragments using small rna_seq alignments benchmarking indicated that flaimapper is able to predict of the mirnas with corresponding reads of the mirnas end and of the end predictions were concordant with mirbase annotations for this analysis data from the illumina genome analyser ii was used a similar accuracy was observed for sequencing_data derived from the ion_torrent pgm and illumina_hiseq supplementary_information indicating flaimapper can perform well on data from different platforms we demonstrated that flaimapper performs better than existing similar software flaimapper predicts fragments by looking at the most common start and end positions in alignments it can be argued whether the most common start and end positions should indeed provide the evidence for the prediction of a fragment since the most common read could be used instead however the most common start and end positions should usually be covered by a higher number of reads this corresponds to a higher_resolution which is especially advantageous for the prediction of fragments with a low read_coverage and should therefore also be more robust towards noise together with the demonstrated high performance this implies that predictions based on start and end position densities provide a more appropriate solution for fragment annotation the weights used in the filtering step are based on a normal distribution with an arbitrary chosen r these parameters probably find their optimum in relation with sequencing protocols end specific processing factors or different families of fragments therefore once there is a better understanding of the processing of summary of predicted fragments on datasets srp srp srp srp and srp fragments it is recommended to spend effort in optimizing these parameters additional analysis indicated that flaimappers performance in mirna annotation is positively correlated to sequencing_depth predicted ends of mirnas have a larger offset compared with mirbase annotations than the ends even for the same sequencing_depth the higher variability of the mirnas ends has earlier been reported in addition research on the classification of sncrnas indicated that metrics corresponding to the variability in the alignment are indeed higher for the end in mirnas they were able to indicate that different levels of variability correspond to specific types of sncrnas possible explanations could be rna postprocessing or rna_editing this means that alignments over the entire fragment can be asymmetrical because of a larger variation observed at mirnas ends since blockbuster assumes reads to be symmetrically distributed over a fragment this might explain why i its accuracy is lower ii its predictions are longer and iii shifted with respect to mirbase although it seems counter intuitive that an ncrna can produce different fragments that originate from an overlapping region there are situations where overlapping fragments can be expected this can be stressed by recalling the not fully understood trna processing mechanism s where trna halves and trfs spanning similar regions have been reported therefore flaimapper has no restriction to the prediction of overlapping fragments similar to the method of sequence_logos indicated that the aca box as part of the the
