sequence_analysis phylogenetics likelihood evolution and complexity phylogenetics likelihood evolution and complexity plex is a flexible and fast bayesian_markov software_program for large_scale analysis of nucleotide_and data using complex evolutionary_models in a phylogenetic framework the program gains large speed improvements over standard_approaches by implementing partial sampling of substitution histories a data augmentation approach that can reduce data analysis times from months to minutes on large comparative datasets a variety of nucleotide_and substitution models are currently implemented including non reversible and site heterogeneous mixture_models due to efficient algorithms that scale well with data size and model_complexity plex can be used to make inferences from hundreds to thousands of taxa in only minutes on a desktop computer it also performs probabilistic ancestral sequence reconstruction future versions will support detection of co evolutionary interactions between sites prob abilistic tests of convergent_evolution and rigorous testing of evolutionary hypotheses in a bayesian_framework availability_and plex v is licensed under gpl source_code will be available for download at www evolutionarygenomics com programsdata plex plex is implemented in c and supported on linux mac os x and other platforms supporting standard c compilers comparative_genomic and phylogenetic datasets are growing dramatically in size thanks to rapid and inexpensive next_generation technologies the wealth of information present in large_datasets however is difficult to exploit due to the non linearly increasing computational_burden imposed by increasing data size and model_complexity for example it is not uncommon for phylogenetic_analysis of large_datasets to now incur compute times on the order of months even with models that are fairly simple from a mechanistic biochemical perspective e g to help overcome these challenges we developed phylogenetics likelihood evolution and complexity plex which implements rapid data augmentation methods using partial sampling of substitution histories and derivative methods plex is an active research platform and will support the future development of new models and algorithms the capabilities of plex will therefore expand over time for example the current version now incorporates more models than previously as well as implementations of conjugate gibbs_sampling and slice sampling phylogenetic_analysis task furthermore the approach was designed to substantially reduce the scaling of time complexity with model_complexity supplementary so that model realism can be more effectively explored without the need to greatly oversimplify models for computational convenience for example the times to achieve an average of effectively independent posterior samples on a large dataset are shown for a variety of amino_acid models remarkably the most parameter rich site homogeneous model in this set is also the easiest to sample from and therefore the fastest because conjugate gibbs_sampling mechanisms are possible for all parameters in this case general non reversible thus not only do these approaches reduce the need to simplify models for computational convenience but also in some cases they facilitate an inversion of incentives making complex models more computationally convenient than simpler ones it should be noted that similar contrasts can be constructed when exact substitution timings are augmented for performance_comparisons between plex and several popular phylogenetics programs see supplementary results when gibbs update mechanisms are unavailable for a given model plex uses slice sampling or metropolishastings updates the simple form of plexs likelihood_function often makes likelihood evaluations for these mechanisms extremely rapid and sometimes even o the plex code is written in c c and has no dependencies on external libraries it should therefore compile on any platform that supports standard c c
