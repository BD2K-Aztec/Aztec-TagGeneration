bfc correcting illumina sequencing_errors bfc is a free fast and easy to use sequencing_error corrector designed for illumina short_reads it uses a non greedy_algorithm but still maintains a speed comparable to implementations based on greedy methods in evaluations on real_data bfc appears to correct more errors with fewer overcorrections in comparison to existing_tools it particularly does well in suppressing systematic sequencing_errors which helps to improve the base accuracy of de_novo assemblies availability_and https github com error_correction is a process to fix sequencing_errors on a sequence_read by using other overlapping reads that do not contain the errors many de_novo assemblers in particular short_read assemblers for large_genomes use error_correction to reduce the complexity of the assembly_graph such that the graph can be fitted to limited ram error_correction was first expressed as the spectral alignment problem whereby we take a set of trusted k_mers and attempt to find a sequence with minimal corrections such that each kmer on the corrected sequence is trusted the majority of error correctors are based on this idea and take a greedy approach to solving this problem approximately they make a correction based on the local sequence_context and do not revert the decision we worried that the greedy strategy might affect the accuracy given reads from a repeatrich diploid_genome so derived a new non greedy_algorithm that explores larger search_space in attempt to achieve_higher
