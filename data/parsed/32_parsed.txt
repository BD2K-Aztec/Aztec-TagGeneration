genome_analysis absynte a web_tool to analyze the evolution of orthologous archaeal and bacterial gene_clusters absynte archaeal and bacterial synteny explorer is a web_based service designed to display local syntenies in completely_sequenced prokaryotic chromosomes the genomic contexts are determined with a multiple center star clustering topology on the basis of a user provided protein_sequence and all or a set of chromosomes from the publicly_available archaeal and bacterial_genomes the results consist in a dynamic web_page where a consistent color coding permits a rapid visual_evaluation of the relative positioning of genes with similar sequences within the synteny each gene composing the synteny can be further queried interactively using either local or remote databases absynte results can be exported in csv or high_resolution pdf formats for printing archival further editing or publication purposes performance real_time computation user_friendliness and daily database updates constitute the principal advantages of absynte over similar web_services availability the availability of more than completely_sequenced archaeal and bacterial_genomes at the national_center ncbi repository provides a wealth of information to researchers involved in prokaryotic genetics in particular the comparison of the relative genetic positioning on microbial chromosomes is of special interest not only to measure evolutionary_relationships between different species but also to deduce the function of uncharacterized_proteins this conservation of orthologous gene_order is commonly referred as synteny even if in its original definition the term had a different meaning the extraction of syntenic information from sequenced_genomes involves the impractical manipulation of large data_files and the complexity of the task increases with the number of genomes that need to be compared the comparative_analysis of genome segments from prokaryotic organisms has been addressed by web_services such as gecont psat and gcview unfortunately these web_applications suffer from one or more restrictions as discussed below in response to these limitations we have developed absynte archaeal and bacterial synteny explorer to whom correspondence should be addressed a web_tool which only requires a user provided protein_sequence to display the corresponding synteny from a daily updated list of archaeal and bacterial_genomes this interactive web_application is executed in real_time and is designed to extract compare and predict orthologous gene_clusters originating from any combination of sequenced prokaryotic organisms
