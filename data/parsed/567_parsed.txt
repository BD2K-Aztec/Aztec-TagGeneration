data_and athena the analysis tool for heritable and environmental network associations motivation advancements in high_throughput technology have allowed researchers to examine the genetic_etiology of complex human traits in a robust fashion although genome_wide many novel variants associated with hundreds of traits a large proportion of the estimated trait heritability remains_unexplained one hypothesis is that the commonly used statistical_techniques and study_designs are not robust to the complex etiology that may underlie these human traits this etiology could include non linear gene gene or gene_environment additionally other levels of biological regulation may play a large role in trait variability results to address the need for computational_tools that can explore enormous datasets to detect complex susceptibility models we have developed a software_package called the analysis tool for heritable and environmental network associations athena athena combines various variable filtering_methods with machine_learning to analyze high_throughput categorical i e single_nucleotide and quantitative i e gene_expression levels predictor_variables to generate multivariable_models that predict either a categorical i e disease status or quantitative i e cholesterol_levels outcomes the goal of this article is to demonstrate the utility of athena using simulated and biological_datasets that consist of both single_nucleotide and gene_expression variables to identify complex prediction_models importantly this method is flexible and can be expanded to include other types of high through put data i e rna_seq and biomarker measurements availability athena is freely_available for download the software user_manual and tutorial can be downloaded from http ritchielab psu edu ritchielab software the sequencing of the human_genome and significant advancements in high_throughput technology allow for exploratory_analyses which have the goal of interrogating variation at different levels of biological regulation these technologies generate a massive amount of various types of data and are steadily becoming less expensive and more efficient one major_bottleneck in making full use of these data is the analysis strategy first because of the massive amount of data being generated analysts must have access to computers with adequate resources second computational_techniques must be used that can analyze datasets with hundreds of thousands to millions of predictor_variables in a feasible amount of time finally to incorporate the potential complexity of these predictor_variables statistical_methods must be used that can detect non linear interactions and handle various types of data appropriately thus far the most commonly used analytical_techniques have focused on the first two requirements for example genome_wide gwas calculate the association of each individual single_nucleotide snp from a high_throughput platform with the trait of interest the p value is then corrected for all of the statistical_tests that were done inherently this type of analysis is only going to find associations with strong enough main effects to pass the significance threshold therefore gwas will not find snps with phenotypic_effects that rely on variation at another predictor variable gene gene or gene_environment this could be a factor in one of the major criticisms of gwasmuch of the trait variability estimated to be due to genetic_factors remains_unexplained by the thousands of novel variants identified by these studies to address this criticism various statistical_methods have been developed that allow for the discovery of genegene and gene_environment for example multifactor_dimensionality performs an exhaustive analysis of all n wise interacting loci to generate multilocus predictor models here we assess several methods that have capacity to perform a meta dimensional analysis a metadimensional study is defined as one that integrates different types of data that represent different levels of biological regulation to predict a given outcome the analysis tool for heritable and environmental network associations or athena is a software_package that combines various statistical_methods as a filtering modeling pipeline to identify complex prediction_models to whom correspondence should be addressed the overall goal of athena is to provide the user with a platform to flexibly apply the statistical_techniques to identify models that may be missed by other methods or any single method alone the statistical_methods in athena are selected based on a number of criteria including robustness to non linear interactions which will allow us to assess the role of these types of genetic effects on phenotypic_variation in complex human traits shows a schematic of the athena methodology athena includes filtering and modeling components to generate the complex prediction_models in this analysis we assess the modeling_methods abilities to identify complex genetic_models using simulated_data owing to the substantial increase in noise that is inherent to highthroughput data we apply the athena filtering method random jungle rj to the biological dataset before generating the prediction_models the filtering and modeling_methods have been previously_tested with various inputs including snps and expression data future work will assess other components of athena such as the inclusion of environmental_factors and the impact of certain characteristics of genetic data such as sample_size missing data_points and minor_allele
