fast and accurate inference of local_ancestry in latino populations motivation it is becoming increasingly evident that the analysis of genotype data from recently admixed_populations is providing important insights into medical_genetics and population history such analyses have been used to identify novel disease_loci to understand recombination_rate variation and to detect recent selection events the utility of such studies crucially depends on accurate and unbiased estimation of the ancestry at every genomic locus in recently admixed_populations although various methods have been proposed and shown to be extremely accurate in two way admixtures e g african_americans only a few approaches have been proposed and thoroughly benchmarked on multi way admixtures e g latino populations of the americas results to address these challenges we introduce here methods for local_ancestry which leverage the structure of linkage_disequilibrium in the ancestral population lamp ld and incorporate the constraint of mendelian segregation when inferring local_ancestry in nuclear family trios lamp hap our algorithms uniquely combine hidden_markov hmms of haplotype diversity within a novel window based framework to achieve superior accuracy as compared with published_methods further unlike previous methods the structure of our hmm does not depend on the number of reference haplotypes but on a fixed constant and it is thereby capable of utilizing large_datasets while remaining highly_efficient and robust to over fitting through simulations and analysis of real_data from nuclear trio families from the mainland us puerto_rico and mexico we demonstrate that our methodsadmixed populations such as latinos and african_americans emerged from the encounter of a few genetically diverged ancestral_populations which have since been mixing for a relatively small number of generations due to recombination_events each chromosome of an admixed individual is a mosaic of chromosomal_regions originating from the different ancestral_populations the problem of local_ancestry is to determine for each genomic_position the ancestral origin of each of the two chromosomes highresolution local_ancestry from genomewide genotype data forms an essential analysis step in medical_genetics in identification of disease genes through admixture_mapping as well as in increasing power in association studies in admixed_populations local_ancestry is also useful in the study of population_genetic processes such as recombination selection and migration thus providing important insights into human history and demographics in addition ancestry_inference has been recently shown to be of critical value in pharmacogenomics a recent study associated the native_american ancestry with the risklatino populations of the americas such as mexicans or puerto_ricans arose by the influx of europeans into existing native_american populations subsequently african individuals were introduced into the population thus most of the genomes of current latino populations can be modeled as an admixture of chromosomes from three ancestral_populations with various global proportions of european native_american and west_african ancestries e g for mexicans and for puerto_ricans correspondingly we simulated latino admixed haplotypes as mosaics of segments taken from three of the hapmap phase haplotype panels unless otherwise noted we used the phased haplotypes from the ceu haplotypes chb chd and yri panels in our simulations of admixed haplotypes and phased haplotypes from the tsi jpt and lwk panels as proxy reference data in local_ancestry the haplotype sets used for generating the simulations data and reference data are therefore disjoint our use of east_asian haplotypes to represent the native_american haplotypes was motivated by the small_sample of existing native_american panels and by the presence of european gene_flow into some of these populations it is likely however that the use of east_asian haplotypes will overestimate the accuracy of local_ancestry we performed the analyses on chromosome restricted to the snps present on the illumina human m snp_array so as to obtain a realistic snp density and a typical genomic ld pattern following standard_approaches we simulated admixed chromosomes by performing a random_walk over the hapmap haplotypes distance to the next crossover was sampled from the exponential distribution with parameter g where is the average recombination probability along the genome per base per generation and g is the approximate number of generations in admixture for latinos at a crossover event the new ancestry is chosen given the mixture specific proportions and a specific haplotype is drawn uniformly from the corresponding reference_set this procedure was used to generate haplotypes which were then joined in pairs to form diplotypes several metrics have been proposed to measure the performance of local_ancestry methods here wewe introduced novel methods for accurate local_ancestry in multi way mixtures of populations such as latinos through simulations and analysis of real latino family data we demonstrated that our methods attain superior accuracy and scalability compared with current state of the art methods for local_ancestry our methods are implemented as an open_source software_package for the genetics community as future work we mention the incorporation of varying recombination_rates into the parameter_estimation step of our approach as well as an adaptive selection of the window length as a function of the genetic_distance among ancestral_populations at any locus in the genome in our simulations we have assumed non population specific recombination_rates however it is straightforward to incorporate population specific recombination_rates into our model by using appropriate recombination maps in the training of the ancestral hmms finally we note that methods for local_ancestry in multi way admixed_populations are an active area of research a systematic_comparison of the performance of these methods on latinos as well as admixtures of ancestral_populations merits further study
