genome_analysis an effective statistical_evaluation of chipseq dataset similarity motivation chipseq is rapidly becoming a common technique for investigating proteindna_interactions however results from individual experiments provide a limited understanding of chromatin_structure as various chromatin factors cooperate in complex ways to orchestrate transcription in order to quantify chromtain interactions it is thus necessary to devise a robust similarity_metric applicable to chipseq data unfortunately moving past simple overlap calculations to give statistically_rigorous comparisons of chipseq datasets often involves arbitrary choices of distance metrics with significance being estimated by computationally_intensive permutation_tests whose statistical_power may be sensitive to non biological experimental and post_processing variation results we show that it is in fact possible to compare chipseq datasets through the efficient computation of exact p values for proximity our method is insensitive to non biological_variation in datasets such as peak width and can rigorously model peak location biases by evaluating similarity conditioned on a restricted set of genomic_regions such as mappable genome or promoter_regions applying our method to the well studied dataset of chen et_al we elucidate novel interactions which conform well with our biological understanding by comparing chipseq data in an asymmetric way we are able to observe clear interaction differences between cofactors such as p and factors that bind_dna directly availability source_code is available for download atwith the advent of genome_sequencing a central_question of genome biology concerns how genetic instructions in the genome translate into biochemical states of a cell and how completely different cellular_phenotypes can arise from the same genetic_background in particular how do the various histone_modifications transcription_factors and other chromatin proteins orchestrate a particular transcriptional_profile sequencing_technology now makes it possible to map the location of the various chromatin proteins with great precision chipseq to whom correspondence should be addressed studies can thoroughly characterize the binding_sites of transcription_factors giving a global view of the genes they regulate making the identification of specific binding_motifs much easier and uncovering previously_uncharacterized variation chipseq has also been used to profile histone_modifications increasing our understanding of the role of such modifications in transcription and differentiation as well as allowing for the discovery of novel genes not detected by other methods ultimately a complete understanding of chromatin_organization must involve not only actual characterization of the locations of individual chromatin proteins but also an understanding of how they interact with each other to regulate_transcription gene regulations in metazoan organisms can be quite complex with transcription_factors interacting combinatorially with each other as well as with histone_modifications and the various chromatin modifiers although chipseq experiments hold the promise of investigating these effects on a system wide level suitable methods of analysis are still being developed e g an initial step in building genome_wide understanding of chromatin_organization is developing methods that infer biologically_meaningful co occurrence of chromatin components from a series of chipseq experiments the simplest approach to this problem used in is to compute the total overlap of peakenrichment regions from different experiments while this method has a strong intuitive basis it has several limitations one problem simply concerns the variability in size of enrichment regions transcription_factors appear as distinct punctate peaks for example while chromatin_modifications produce broad enrichment regions moreover general variations in peak distribution such as peak length peak number etc can arise anywhere in the experimental pipeline as well as in subsequent data_processing making direct comparisons between datasets especially those produced by different protocols difficult more recently statistical_methods to assess co occurrence have been proposed these methods involve the computation of some metric of similarity between datasets such as correlation number of clustered transcription_factors distance based measures etc and then the estimation of the probability the observed metric would occur by chance either by simulation or analytically using bounds from parametric_models by using the threshold based summary_statistic we can visualize an all against all comparison of thedata while our method is similar in principle to overlap based statistics the results differ significantly from overlap supplementary the general similarity structure produced by our analysis agrees well with previous_studies two main clusters emerge one composed of c_myc n myc e f zfx and klf and the second composed of nanog sox p oct and smad however there are some notable differences from the previous_studies for example since our method performs an asymmetric comparison we observe some one sided interactions in particular all interactions involving p are highly_asymmetric implying that while p co occurs with many other factors the reverse associations are much weaker the natural interpretation of such asymmetric interactions is that one factor p binds to a subset of genomic_locations of another oct sox etc in the case of p the pattern of asymmetric interactions with many other factors is indicative of its co factor function as p does not bind_dna on its own but is recruited by other dna_binding another result particular to our analysis is that while nanog is tightly associated with the sox oct p cluster by far its strongest association is with smad while nanog has been shown to co occur in proteins complexes with oct smad is the only factor in this dataset that has been shown_experimentally to interact directly with nanog the interaction serves to block bone_morphogenetic bmp induced_differentiation that is meditated by smad the smad nanog interaction is also highly_asymmetric so that smad co occurs with nanog more often than nanog co occurs with smad this pattern indicates that the nanogsmad interaction_occurs at a subset of nanogs genomic_locations and is consistent with nanog having diverse roles in stem_cell that page involves both activation and repression of target_genes overall the complete interaction pattern presents a hierarchical_structure depicted as a directional interaction graph in in particular the second cluster nanog sox p oct interacts more strongly with the first c_myc n myc e f zfx klf than vice_versa indicating a subset relationship this global hierarchical pattern is consistent with the first cluster being more broadly_distributed and having a more general role as several of the proteins in this cluster are involved in proliferation and have important roles outside embryonic_stem on the other hand the factors in cluster nanog sox oct have a more restricted distribution and are considered to be specific markers of pluripotency we have developed a method for chipseq comparisons that is statistically_rigorous yet fully transparent and thus intuitive to biology researchers in particular our method makes simple assumptions and does not rely on any numerical optimizations or permutation_tests our ability to observe uniform p value distributions in simulated and non interacting real_datasets lends confidence to our predictions for real_data our method naturally extends to the concept of conditional similarity making it easy to investigate how general biases in genomic_locations of chromatin factors_affect the perceived clustering among them the transparency of our method should aid in its adoption in the general biology community as the output is very easy to interpret for every query interval our method_produces the closest reference_interval the distance between them and the corresponding numerator denominator and p value making it easy to trace the results back to the proximity events in the original data
