computational_approaches to define a human_milk metaglycome motivation the goal of deciphering the human glycome has been hindered by the lack of high_throughput methods for glycans although mass_spectrometry ms is a key_technology in glycan sequencing ms alone provides limited information about the identification of monosaccharide constituents their anomericity and their linkages these features of individual purified glycans can be partly identified using well defined glycan binding_proteins such as lectins and antibodies that recognize_specific determinants within glycan_structures results we present a novel computational_approach to automate the sequencing of glycans using metadata assisted glycan sequencing which combines ms analyses with glycan structural_information from glycan microarray_technology success in this approach was aided by the generation of a virtual glycome to represent all potential glycan_structures that might exist within a metagly comes based on a set of biosynthetic assumptions using known structural_information we exploited this approach to deduce the structures of soluble glycans within the human_milk glycome by matching predicted structures based on experimental_data against the virtual glycome this represents the first meta glycome to be defined using this method and we provide a publically available web_based application to aid in sequencing milk glycans availability_and http glycomeseq glycans play integral roles in many essential biological_functions including cell_signaling molecular_recognition immunity and inflammation generally via their specific interactions with proteins unlike the template driven process for synthesizing linear nucleic_acids and proteins glycans are enzymatically synthesized and are thus products of many genes forming linear and branched sequences of stereospecific monosaccharides that provide unique surfaces for protein interactions understanding the specificity of glycan binding_proteins gbps provides clues to their functions and defining specificity is accomplished by comparing the structures of glycans bound by a gbp with related structures that are unbound this requires that the glycan ligands be completely defined which is not a trivial task in addition while the human glycome is estimated to be at least times larger than the proteome to date no glycome or meta glycome partial or sub glycome related to a tissue organ or cell_type has been defined furthermore no method is currently available with the requisite precision or speed to be incorporated into an automated sequencing_platform historically methods for glycan sequencing were developed to address different aspects of glycan_structure and included purification of glycans and application of a variety of chemistries to deduce structure the predominant mass_spectrometric ms approaches to glycan_structure are limited in their ability to fully identify glycan_structure that includes sequence linkage and anomericity however a large amount of information is generated from mixtures of glycans one example of high_throughput automated annotation of ms peaks was described in the cartoonist algorithm the algorithm initially selects annotations from a list of biologically_plausible glycans based on a set of archetype cartoons manually derived from a priori_knowledge of the biosynthetic_pathways known to express certain n glycans it then assigns a confidence_score to the set of glycan annotations for the most abundant signals the annotations represent the composition and topology of the structure though portions of the structure contain specific monosaccharides and glycosidic bonds based on constraints imposed by the biosynthetic_pathway a de_novo approach termed stat predicts glycan_structures by generating all possible topologies of a glycan_structure based on the precursor ion mass charge_carrier and product ion mass from the ms n data a review von der of automated interpretation of ms spectra for glycan_structures provides an overview of various approaches however all of the existing_approaches fall short of fully characterizing glycan_structures including the linkage and anomericity in spite of its limitations ms techniques especially those that include more laborious multistage ms have proven extremely useful in doing the deep_sequencing required to fully define a glycan_structure however a method for high_throughput deep_sequencing of glycan_structure will likely require a combination of techniques defined glycan microarrays provide a highthroughput approach for identifying epitopes on individual glycans when interrogated with gbps that bind known glycan determinants although the determinant or epitope alone cannot provide the information needed to fully characterize the glycan_structure it does provide metadata that can be applied to reveal the structure we developed metadata assisted glycan sequencing or mags as a structural approach that combines ms data with glycan microarray_data and recently demonstrated its utility in defining over novel structures among the human_milk glycans hmgs the glycan microarray_data used in this approach is acquired from libraries of relatively pure glycans analogous to a shotgun glycan microarray sgm where glycans representing a selected glycome are fluorescently derivatized and separated by multidimensional chromatography to resolve isomeric structures and obtain relatively pure components in a tagged glycan library the separated glycans are then printed as a sgm comprising the selected glycome we reasoned that mags could be used as a general approach to define any glycome that could be presented as a sgm however manual_analysis of the data generated from hundreds of glycans in a microarray would be a tedious process we therefore developed a software_package termed glycomeseq to sequence hmgs through automated meta_analysis of experimental_data based on our mags approach we reasoned that a key to more automatable sequencing is to create a virtual glycome comprising all theoretical structures and then test the predicted structures from the obtained metadata against this virtual glycome we also used a novel algorithm to filter candidate glycan_structures through this knowledge_base to arrive at a single structure consistent with all available information for this study we selected the free glycans of human_milk since the glycans are easily_accessible and a large literature is available about them in addition to the nutritional disaccharide lactose g l human_milk contains a complex_mixture of larger free oligosaccharides or glycans g l that are not efficiently metabolized in the stomach of the neonate and reach the intestines where they are thought to have probiotic activity as well as to provide protection against pathogens by interfering with adhesion of pathogens to intestinal_epithelial as decoy receptors milk glycans have also been implicated in having beneficial innate_immune and immunomodulatory_effects decreasing colon contractility and promoting gut epithelial_cell maturation recent_studies on the biological_functions of human_milk have indicated that breast_fed have soluble milk glycans circulating in blood at detectable_levels suggesting potential systemic effects of such glycans the structures and quantities of the free glycans in human_milk vary_widely among individual mothers based on their genetics which controls the expression of the human lewis blood groups and time of lactation a variety of factors influence the repertoire of the human glycome including genetics environment and time or conditions of synthesis and like the human_genome the glycome of the human_milk free glycans is an average set of structures that represents all of the possible structures that could exist at any one time or in any one individual thus there is great interest in defining the human_milk metaglycome and its components since they may differ in many ways between different sources and the overall repertoire of glycans in a milk_sample is subject to many variables the computational_approach developed here was successful in identifying glycan_structures within the human_milk metaglycome and the approach should be applicable to other cellular and tissue metaglycomes we use our virtual glycome generator to store the virtual human_milk soluble glycan glycome into a database shows the theoretical number of glycans that can exist for each composition basedcomputational approaches to define a human_milk metaglycomeon the biosynthetic rules of hmgs supplementary_material a up to a dodecaose core_structure h n although core_structures without fucose or sialic_acid as large as h n have been reported the amounts of glycans with core_structures greater than h n are vanishingly small nevertheless the virtual glycome of human_milk soluble glycans is certainly different possible structures the web_based software_tool glycomeseq provides the number of isomers within each composition and will display the structures of all isomers within each composition https glycomeseq emory edu in an effort to further our understanding of the functional and structural roles of hmgs we registered accession_numbers in glytoucan for the predicted structures that were verified by independent structural methods we also shared our virtual hmg database with unicarbkb which can be found at http unicarbkb org milk the unicarbkb platform is a knowledgebase that allows public access to a curated database of glycan_structures and associated metadata including publications and glycan structural_classification by taxonomy tissue protein etc in addition to sharing the glycan_structures glycomeseq also provides link outs to the unicarbkb website for each of the predicted structures where the user can view any associated metadata for the glycan_structure we describe herein an approach to define a virtual meta glycome and use it as a knowledge_base to predict fully characterized glycan_structures using data from ms and glycan microarray binding_experiments this approach to computational sequencing of the unknown glycans requires i determination of the glycan composition using maldi_tof analysis ii interrogation of the glycans with lectins and antibodies that bind known determinants iii determination of the set of predicted structures based on automated metaanalysis of the experimental_data from the virtual glycome database given the constraints of the rules for the biosynthetic_pathway of the glycans although several methods have been aimed at glycan annotation of mass_spectrometric to our knowledge no other method has been developed that attempts to solve the glycan_structure to the level of glycomeseq this approach has the potential to be a significant breakthrough in glycomics analysis that has thus far been hindered by the complexity and ambiguity of ms analysis we seek to make improvements and have planned future work for our approach including i automate the analysis of the ms spectra to identify the ms reporter ion determinants ii develop a library of xpath queries for the determinants so the user does not have to manually specify them in the spreadsheet iii include exo and endoglycosidases to yield finer specificity and iv apply this method on hmgs with sialic_acid to further validate this approach before moving onto a much larger meta glycome
