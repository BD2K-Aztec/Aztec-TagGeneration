genome_analysis sylarray a web_server for automated_detection of mirna effects from expression data a useful step for understanding the function of micrornas mirna or sirnas is the detection of their effects on genome_wide expression_profiles typically approaches look for enrichment of words in the utr sequences of the most deregulated genes a number of tools are available for this purpose but they require either in depth computational knowledge filtered utr sequences for the genome of interest or a set of genes acquired through an arbitrary expression cutoff to this end we have developed sylarray a web_based resource designed for the analysis of large_scale expression datasets it simply requires the user to submit a sorted list of genes from an expression experiment sylarray utilizes curated sets of utrs to attach sequences to these genes and then applies the sylamer algorithm for detection of mirna or sirna signatures in those sequences an intuitive system for visualization and interpretation of the small_rna signatures is included availability sylarray is written in perl cgi perl and java and also uses the r statistical package the source_code database and web_resource are freely_available under gnu public license gpl the web_server is freely_accessible atnon coding rnas can have a profound influence on global mrna_expression small_rnas such as small_interfering and micrornas bind to utrs of mrnas as a part of the rna_induced this binding event stimulates cleavage or degradation of the target_molecule efficiency of silencing is determined by various factors the most important one being complementarity to the target_mrna utr in a conserved_region of nt also called the seed analysis of the overrepresentation of particular seeds in utrs across an experimental gene_set can be used to detect the influence of specific_mirnas and sirnas on an expression_profile recently the sylamer algorithm was devised to assess significantly over or under represented words in utr sequences according to a sorted gene_list van the original algorithm required the user to provide both an ordered to whom correspondence should be addressed gene_list of sufficient size and a matching set of utr sequences in order to make this approach accessible to non expert users we have developed sylarray sylarray combines a curated database of utrs with a userfriendly interface to visualize and detect the influence of mirnas or sirnas on gene_expression several other tools have been published with similar aims such as diana mirextra and geneset mirna sylarray allows for analysis of larger number of species containing a premade database of both filtered utrs and coding_sequences for seven model_organisms we will continue to update and maintain the sylarray database with new arrays and platforms as they become available
