phybase an r package for species_tree analysis motivation phybase is an r package for phylogenetic_analysis using species_trees it provides functions to read write manipulate simulate estimate summarize and plot species_trees which contain not only the topology and branch_lengths but also population_sizes availability the phybase package is available at the r repository the manual and supporting materials including source_code sample r code and sample data_files for the species_tree analysis are available atspecies trees are the fundamental tools in studying biodiversity and evolutionary_history it has been appreciated that phylogenies of genes gene_trees are distinct from phylogenies of species species_trees however most phylogenetic programs are designed for estimation of gene_trees and lack functions to perform species_tree analysis as an example when species_trees are recorded as modified newick files the population_size parameter in the species_tree is not readable by most phylogenetic programs including paup phylip and mrbayes making_it to summarize species_trees in these phylogenetic programs it is desirable to have a phylogenetic program that can provide functions necessary for the analysis of species_trees phybase is an r package designed specifically for species_tree analysis although it is also capable of analyzing gene_trees it provides functions to read write manipulate simulate estimate and summarize species_trees the input_output functions in the package can read and write dna_sequences and phylogenetic_trees gene_trees and species_trees in the newick format phylogenetic_trees are read in as a string and then transformed to a matrix which describes the ancestral relationships of nodes and branch_lengths the nodes matrix provides an easy access for developers to further manipulate the tree while the tree string provides a useful interface to other phylogenetic packages in r such as the package ape basic_functions are available in the package to manipulate phylogenetic_trees including deleting and swapping nodes rooting and unrooting trees phybase includes functions to summarize collections of species_trees such as those that arise from bootstrap analysis or the posterior_distribution to whom correspondence should be addressed in bayesian_analysis of species_trees phybase is able to simulate dna_sequences from a prespecified species_tree gene_trees can be generated from a species_tree under the coalescent model which assumes a molecular_clock for gene_trees and the species_tree alternatively gene_trees can be generated from a non clock like species_tree which allows variable mutation_rates along the branches populations in the species_tree the variable mutation_rate is most likely due to changes in generation time as well as changes to the overall rate of mutation along the branches populations in the species_tree phybase has functions to generate dna_sequences from gene_trees under a variety of substitution models the species_tree can be simulated from another phylogenetic package physim in r phybase is available under the gnu_general gpl as an r package phybase inherits the open_source nature of r we invite others to continue to contribute phylogenetics inference packages in the r framework
