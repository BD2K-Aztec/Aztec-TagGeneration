sequence_analysis anatomy of a hash based long_read sequence mapping algorithm for next_generation motivation recently a number of programs have been proposed for mapping short_reads to a reference_genome many of them are heavily optimized for short_read and hence are very efficient for shorter queries but that makes them inefficient or not applicable for reads longer than bp however many sequencers are already generating longer_reads and more are expected to follow for long_read sequence mapping there are limited options blat ssaha fangs and bwa_sw are among the popular ones however resequencing and personalized_medicine need much faster software to map these long sequencing_reads to a reference_genome to identify snps or rare transcripts results we present agile aligning long_reads a hash_table based high_throughput sequence mapping algorithm for longer_reads that uses diagonal multiple seed match criteria customized q gram filtering and a dynamic incremental search approach among other heuristics to optimize every step of the mapping_process in our experiments we observe that agile is more accurate than blat and comparable to bwa_sw and ssaha for practical error_rates and read_lengths bp agile is significantly_faster than blat ssaha and bwa_sw even for the other cases agile is comparable to bwa_sw and several times_faster than blat and ssaha recent_advances ngs_technology have led to affordable desktop sized sequencers with low running costs and high_throughput these sequencers produce small_fragments of the genome being sequenced as a result of the sequencing_process by mapping these small_fragments reads to a reference_genome we can sequence the dna of a new individual the ngss are making it possible for these studies to be conducted at a mass scale these advances will usher an era of personal_genomics when each individual can have his her dna sequenced and studied to whom correspondence should be addressed to develop more personalized ways of anticipating diagnosing and treating_diseases studies of this nature have already begun scientists have found the genetic causes of diseases like charcotmarietooth and miller syndrome by sequencing the genomes of patients these studies have been made possible by plunging costs and increasing speeds of high_throughput next generation sequencers ngss sequence the dna by generating small substrings of the dna called reads with rapid improvements in sequencing_technologies the lengths of the reads are constantly increasing the rate of throughput as well as read_lengths of these ngss are increasing at a pace that puts even the moores law to shame hence there is a growing need for tools that can work for longer_reads and can still match the pace of the ngss a number of tools have been developed for shorter illumina queries these include maq eland soap bowtie mosaik pass and shrimp however most of these tools work only for read_lengths also they allow very few number of mismatches usually and many of them do not allow any gaps however as the lengths of reads are rapidly increasing we need tools that can work for longer read_lengths moreover these new tools for longer_reads should be able to handle a larger number of gaps and mismatches to the best of our knowledge the only other tools specifically_designed to work for longer_reads are bwa_sw and fangs bwa_sw is a package based on burrows_wheeler transform bwt it supports gapped global_alignment with respect to queries and is one of the fastest long_read alignment_algorithms while also finding suboptimal matches hash tables have been used extensively for short_read and many other related problems hence it may appear that we have exhausted all possible uses of hash tables for sequence mapping however we will find that with proper heuristics hash tables can give excellent speedups for sequence mapping of longer_reads as well the general structure of any hash_table based sequence mapping algorithm is as follows i create a hash_table index of the genome ii use the index to find regions in the genome that can potentially be homologous iii examine each region in more detail and output regions that areadvances in sequencing_techniques necessitate the development of high performance scalable algorithms to extract biologically relevant_information from these datasets research on developing sequence mapping algorithms has been largely focused on mapping short_reads and little work has been done for longer_reads agile is a hash based sequence mapping algorithm that rapidly maps long_reads using efficient heuristics to optimize different steps of the mapping_process agile can handle very large genome_sizes and read_lengths it is flexible in that it allows a large number of mismatches and insertions_deletions in mapping and provides command_line parameters to control every step of the mapping_process the best sensitivity_and of agile is achieved when the reads are longer and the error_rate is small considering that with the improvement in sequencing_technology the read_lengths will increase further and the error_rates will decrease agile should be even more useful in the future
