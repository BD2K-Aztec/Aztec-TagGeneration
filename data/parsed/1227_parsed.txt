systems_biology cyneo j connecting neo j and cytoscape we developed cyneo j a cytoscape app to link cytoscape and neo j databases to utilize the performance and storage capacities neo j offers we implemented a neo j networkanalyzer forceatlas layout and cypher component to demonstrate the possibilities a distributed setup of cytoscape and neo j have availability_and the app is available from the cytoscape app store at http apps cytoscape org apps cyneo j the neo j plugins at www github com gsummer cyneo j parent and the community and commercial editions of neo j can be found at http www neo j com network biology facilitates the understanding of complex_biological by organizing analyzing and visualizing knowledge and experimental_data in networks built upon the field of graph_theory network biology provides researchers decades worth of research in the form of sophisticated graph algorithms software applications like cytoscape and gephi are developed to provide visualization and analysis methods to data scientists with cytoscape being widely used in life_sciences as networks are becoming larger and more complex the computational performance necessary to analyze them increases drastically moving the computation from desktop environments like cytoscape and gephi to powerful servers is a common method used to cope with the increasing demand for computation we present cyneo j a cytoscape app to link cytoscape on the desktop to a server environment using a neo j database neo j www neo j com is a java_based database designed to store and query graphs neo j falls in the category of nosql databases as it departs from the relational model used in traditional databases neo j ensures transaction reliability through acid compliance provides a sqlinspired query_language called cypher and its community edition is free to use and open_source additionally neo j servers can be extended using plugins to add more complex algorithms than the ones built in cyneo j supports two such plugins which showcase the performance increase that can be achieved using a neo j and powerful computational backend as of version cyneo j supports a plugin that provides a set of network layout algorithms and a plugin that implements the cytoscape networkanalyzer we will briefly explain how cytoscape users can enrich their workflows with cyneo j and how app and algorithm developers can benefit from it we developed cyneo j to connect cytoscape and neo j allowing us to speed up the performance of network_analysis algorithms and use the cypher query_language to navigate and explore networks too large for typical desktop computers
