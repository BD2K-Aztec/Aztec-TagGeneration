cghnormaliter a bioconductor_package for normalization of array_cgh data with many cnas cghnormaliter is a package for normalization of array_comparative acgh data it uses an iterative procedure that effectively eliminates the influence of imbalanced copy_numbers this leads to a more reliable assessment of copy_number cnas cghnormaliter is integrated in the bioconductor environment allowing a smooth link to visualization_tools and further data analysis array_comparative acgh is a popular experimental technique for detection of copy_number cnas at high_resolution its principal application areas are cancer research and clinical_genetics recently in britain the first baby was born with the help of acgh to screen eggs for a normal number of chromosomes after the mother had undergone failed attempts at ivf and three miscarriages bbc news http news bbc co uk hi health stm since resolutions of oligonucleotide acgh chips increase constantly and already reach up to m probes experiments yield massive_amounts of data normalization is an important first step in the analysis of these data and aims at minimizing the effect of the experimental bias e g dye bias in the measurements usually standard methods originating from the gene_expression data area such as global median and lowess normalization are employed for this purpose however ashave convincingly shown application of these standard techniques to acgh data with many cnas lead to an improper centralization and hence to inaccurate downstream_analyses in the recent_past a few acgh normalization_methods for twodye acgh data have been designed that deal with this issue their common approach is filtering of cnas from the data to calculate a more appropriate median value or lowess regression curve for the whole dataset as a result after normalization the log intensity ratios of the non cnas normals will generally be closer to zero and hence better reflect the biological reality s lowesswe have developed a bioconductor_package cghnormaliter to accurately normalize acgh data the algorithm effectively eliminates the overnormalizing effect of cnas as well as largescale copy_number lcvs by temporarily excluding them additionally results are enhanced by iterative refinement and by employing a state of the art calling method to identify these cnas the calling results are provided to the user as a bonus cghnormaliter can easily be combined with other bioconductor or r packages to form a workflow moreover the standard format of the results allows for straightforward downstream_analysis of the normalized data
