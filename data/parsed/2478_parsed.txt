inheritance_mode specific pathogenicity prioritization ispp for human protein_coding downloaded from motivation exome_sequencing have facilitated the detection of causal genetic_variants in yet unsolved mendelian_diseases however the identification of disease causal_genes among a list of candidates in an exome_sequencing study is still not fully settled and it is often difficult to prioritize_candidate for follow_up studies the inheritance_mode provides crucial information for understanding mendelian_diseases but none of the existing gene prioritization_tools fully utilize this information results we examined the characteristics of mendelian disease genes under different inheritance modes the results suggest that mendelian disease genes with autosomal_dominant ad inheritance_mode are more haploinsufficiency and de_novo mutation sensitive whereas those autosomal_recessive ar genes have significantly more non synonymous variants and regulatory transcript_isoforms in addition the x linked xl mendelian disease genes have fewer non synonymous and synonymous variants as a result we derived a new scoring system for prioritizing candidate_genes for mendelian_diseases according to the inheritance_mode our scoring system assigned to each annotated protein_coding n three pathogenic scores according to the inheritance_mode ad ar and xl this inheritance_mode specific framework achieved higher accuracy area_under in xl mode conclusion the inheritance_mode specific pathogenicity prioritization ispp outperformed other well known methods including haploinsufficiency recessive network centrality genic intolerance gene damage index and gene constraint scores this systematic study suggests that genes manifesting disease inheritance modes tend to have unique characteristics availability_and ispp is included in kggseq v whole_exome has been widely used for the identification of disease associated genetic_variants for severe and rare mendelian_diseases it has been proven to be an effective approach exome_sequencing may also contribute to the understanding of the etiology of complex_diseases e g schizophrenia and type_diabetes however the functional_annotation of the protein_coding is still far from complete by protein_coding had been registered in the hugo gene nomenclature_committee database which includes most of the relevant dna regions responsible for severe mendelian_diseases and some complex_diseases on the other hand the data from the genomes_project indicate that an apparently_healthy person could carry approximately loss of function lof single_nucleotide snvs on average genomes therefore the accurate estimation of both gene and variant pathogenicity and corresponding etiologic architecture pose a considerable challenge to human genetic community a number of bioinformatics_tools based on predicted deleteriousness and distinct biological_features have been developed to prioritize protein changing i e non synonymous variants in the human protein_coding the tools fathmm gerp lrt mutationassessor sift siphy and provean mainly consider sequence_similarities and conservation patterns across various species whereas cadd mutationtaster and polyphen consider the functional information of the genetic_variations from multiple different information_sources in their algorithms moreover the mutation significance cutoff uses gene level dynamic thresholds generated by cadd polyphen or sift to reduce false_negative these tools are particularly useful in clinical sequencing studies of mendelian_diseases as to exclude a large number of neutral variants however inconsistencies in prediction results among all these different variant based prediction_tools have been demonstrated and results from variant based functional prediction are hard to be generalized into the gene level a few gene scoring_systems have been proposed to estimate the effect of genetic_variations at the gene level first haploinsufficiency hi score combines a list of biological_properties by inspecting the copy_number cnv among thousands of healthy_individuals in this system genes with a higher hi score may imply their potential of causing dominant traits second recessive rec score uses known lof tolerant genes and known recessive disease genes to build up a linear discriminant model to estimate the probability that a gene can cause a recessive disease third genic intolerance rvis score assesses functional genetic_variation tolerance ability from profiles of snvs with allele_frequency information fourth network indispensability net score calculates the gene centrality and indispensability in various proteinprotein_interactions and regulatory_networks to dissect the gene importance fifth gene constraint cons score compares the genomic background mutation_profile with the observed mutation_profile of a gene for interpreting de_novo mutations lastly human gene damage index gdi also utilizes the mutation_profile in both monogenic disease patients and the general_population to prioritize exome variants however each of these popular gene scoring_systems can only explain part of the genetic_architecture from different perspectives for example i hi estimation does not include the profiles of non cnv genetic_variants ii the rec score does not consider the dominant disease predisposing genes iii the rvis score does not deal with variations of allele_frequencies in different populations iv the systematic_comparison for different known disease associated genes is missing in net score study and the sample_size of lof tolerant and essential genes are moderated v the cons score is only applicable for the interpretation of de_novo mutations and vi the gdi score only considers mutation profiles therefore more sophisticated analysis and comprehensive prioritization schemes on genes causing human disease are needed one of the most important characteristics of a mendelian disease is that its mode of inheritance can be inferred from the pedigree however only a few studies have partially examined the unique biological_features of genes causing the different inheritance modes of mendelian_diseases therefore we developed a new gene level scoring system inheritance_mode specific pathogenicity prioritization ispp for the prediction of inheritance specific pathogenicity in addition to the consideration of the different inheritance modes ispp also combines six existing gene level prioritization systems with many gene features the performance of the proposed approach was evaluated systematically by multiple curated disease associated gene_sets in this study we first collected known disease associated gene_lists from independent studies or public_databases as the benchmark_dataset for building and testing the inheritance specific disease gene prediction_models while various these disease associated gene_lists are not necessarily mutually_exclusive we included nine gene groups of different inheritance modes and eight gene groups for disease with different ages of onset besides we collected gene features as well as six widely used gene_prioritization scores as predictors in our prediction_models see section for details the data_collection and analysis framework are summarized in supplementary table s and
