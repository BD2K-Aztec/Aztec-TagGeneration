efficient privacy preserving string search and an application in genomics motivation personal genomes carry inherent privacy risks and protecting privacy poses major social and technological challenges we consider the case where a user searches for genetic_information e g an allele on a server that stores a large_genomic database and aims to receive allele associated information the user would like to keep the query and result private and the server the database approach we propose a novel approach that combines efficient string data_structures such as the burrowswheeler_transform with cryptographic techniques based on additive homomorphic en cryption we assume that the sequence_data is searchable in efficient iterative query operations over a large indexed dictionary for instance from large genome collections and employing the positional burrowswheeler_transform we use a technique called oblivious transfer that is based on additive homomorphic encryption to conceal the sequence query and the genomic_region of interest in positional queries results we designed and implemented an efficient algorithm for searching sequences of snps in large genome_databases during search the user can only identify the longest match while the ser ver does not learn which sequence of snps the user queried in an experiment based on aligned haploid genomes from the genomes_project our algorithm was able to perform typical queries within s and s for client and server side respectively on laptop computers the presented algorithm is at least one order of magnitude faster than an exhaustive baseline algorithm availability_and https github com iskana pbwt sec and https string search is a fundamental task in the field of genome informatics for which a large variety of techniques have been developed see for instance traditionally those techniques have been optimized for accuracy and computational_efficiency however a recent boom of personal genome_sequencing and analyses has spotlighted a new criteria namely privacy_protection as reported in many studies a genome is considered v c the author published_by in this paper we have proposed a novel approach for searching genomic_sequences in a privacy preserving manner our approach_combines an efficient data_structure that can be used for recursive search and a novel approach for recursive oblivious transfer it achieves high utility and has strong security features and requires acceptable compute and communication resources the developed novel algorithm can find the longest match between a query and a large set of aligned genomic_sequences indexed by pbwt we implemented our algorithm and tested on the dataset created from the genomes_project data the compared to an exhaustive baseline approach our algorithm named pbwt sec was orders_of more efficient both in run time and data transfer overhead for practical query sizes when the prototype program was run on laptop machines the total run time including communication time over the network was s for searching on genomes without concealing the query position searches with a concealed query position using a compute node took between and s depending on the level of privacy as the original data_structure supports many useful search options such as wild card search and set maximal search pbwt sec could also support those options by using the same techniques used in the original structures in combination with cryptographic techniques including ot moreover the approach could be easily applied for bwt and has a potential to be applied for other recursively searchable data_structures to the best of our knowledge the proposed algorithm is the first that allows set maximal search of genomic_sequences in a privacypreserving manner for user and database we note that the implementation can still be improved and the overall run time can likely be reduced to not more than a few seconds per query this would make it practical to use our approach in a genomic beacon see ga ghs beacon project that would allow the privacy preserving search for combinations of variants it also appears practical to use our approach to enable search by a user that has access to his her genomic_sequence and would like to query the database for instance for information related to disease risk without sharing this information with anybody finally the algorithm can also be used to facilitate sharing of genetic_information across institutions and countries in order to identify large enough cohorts with a similar genetic_backgrounds this is in spirit of the mission of the global alliance for genome and health wall time includes server and user time d is the number of positions queried simultaneously to conceal the query position if required
