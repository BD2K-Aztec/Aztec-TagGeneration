probonto ontology and knowledge_base of probability_distributions motivation probability_distributions play_a in mathematical and statistical modelling the encoding annotation and exchange of such models could be greatly_simplified by a resource providing a common reference for the definition of probability_distributions although some resources exist no suitably detailed and complex ontology exists nor any database allowing pro grammatic access results probonto is an ontology_based knowledge_base of probability_distributions featuring more than uni and multivariate distributions with their defining functions characteristics relationships and re parameterization formulas it can be used for model annotation and facilitates the encoding of distribution based models related functions and quantities availability_and when encoding probabilistic uncertainties using a given parametric distribution its name and parameters are usually sufficient to specify the intended distribution unambiguously as in many cases such parameter set is unique however in multiple cases two or more parameterizations exist and it becomes essential to specify correctly the parameters for the distribution in order to obtain the correct model a well structured independent standard reference would greatly_facilitate the specification of a distribution and its declaration in a programming_language or exchange format as is shown by interoperability issues between tools with distributions differing in their parameterizations many resources are available online as tools and in printed format but a comprehensive ontology which formalizes the theory of kinds and relations of probability_distributions does not yet exist some bioportal ontologies provide a simple classification and little information in most cases parameters defining functions or quantities are not defined and information about the relationships between distributions is not available such ontologies because of their simplicity are insufficient for our purposes and it is the same with existing databases of distributions
