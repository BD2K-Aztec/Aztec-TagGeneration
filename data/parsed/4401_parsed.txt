genome_analysis stamp statistical_analysis of taxonomic and functional profiles stamp is a graphical software_package that provides statistical hypothesis_tests and exploratory plots for analysing taxo nomic and functional profiles it supports tests for comparing pairs of samples or samples organized into two or more treatment groups effect_sizes and confidence_intervals are provided to allow critical assessment of the biological relevancy of test results a user_friendly graphical_interface permits easy exploration of statistical results and generation of publication quality plots availability_and stamp is licensed under the gnu gpl python source_code are available from our website attaxonomic and functional profiles arise in many areas of the biological_sciences statistical hypothesis_tests can be used to identify features e g taxa or metabolic_pathways that differ significantly between pairs of profiles or between sets of profiles organized into two or more groups e g sick versus healthy here we introduce stamp v a tool that provides extensive hypothesis_testing exploratory plots effect_size measures and confidence_intervals for aiding in the identification of biologically_relevant differences we illustrate the use of stamp on two microbial datasets i taxonomic profiles from coalbed methane cbm communities and ii functional profiles from photosynthetic and non photosynthetic cyanobacteria
