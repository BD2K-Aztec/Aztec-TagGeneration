synlinker an integrated system for designing linkers and synthetic fusion_proteins synthetic fusion_proteins have_shown in various biotechnological and bio pharmaceutical applications they usually contain more than two protein_domains joined by a linker peptide_sequence which is often selected intuitively or in ad_hoc manner thus we developed an integrated web_based system synlinker to provide appropriate linker candidates for constructing fusion_proteins we compiled a total of linker sequences comprising of natural linkers extracted from a set of non redundant multi_domain in protein_data and artifi cial empirical linkers collected from literature and patents multiple query interface allows users to search for the desired linker candidates based on selection_criteria and their preferences in addition a selected linker can be combined with two domain structures which are uploaded and appended at its n and c terminals thereby predicting a de_novo structure of the fusion_protein hence synlinker can serve as a systematic tool for researchers who are interested in designing synthetic fusion_proteins availability_and synlinker is freely_available bioinfo bti a star edu sg synlinker a synthetic fusion_protein is constructed to improve properties or new functionality by synergistically connecting multiple proteins into one single complex via a peptide linker sequence however it is not straightforward to identify a suitable linker since its length or amino_acid may affect the fusion_proteins to be misfolded expressed_at and reduce bioactivity the linker selection is done mostly ad_hoc and still based on random test in experiments thus two interesting bioinformatics_tools have been developed for helping rational_design of fusion_proteins and selection of their linkers the first one is linker program which was an online server for automatically generating linker sequences for fusion_proteins unfortunately this server website is not accessible any more the second tool is linkerdb a database of linkers extracted from natural multi_domain this database provides linker candidates via user_defined query interface with respect to their protein_data pdb code sequence length and secondary_structure however no further update or improvement has been made ever since it was created although pdb database has expanded tremendously during the last decade hence in order to provide most updated linker candidates we built synlinker for synthetic fusion_protein design for the comparison of linker design_tools including synlinker refer to the supplementary_information
