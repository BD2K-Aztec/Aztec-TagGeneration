sequence_analysis a penalized bayesian_approach to predicting sparse protein dna_binding landscapes motivation cellular_processes are controlled directly_or by the binding of hundreds of different dna_binding factors dbfs to the genome one key to deeper_understanding of the cell is discovering where when and how strongly these dbfs bind to the dna_sequence direct measurement of dbf binding_sites bss e g through chip_chip or chip_seq is expensive noisy and not available for every dbf in every cell_type naive and most existing computational_approaches to detecting which dbfs bind in a set of genomic_regions of interest often perform poorly due to the high false_discovery and restrictive requirements for prior_knowledge results we develop sparscape a penalized bayesian_method for identifying dbfs active in the considered regions and predicting a joint probabilistic binding landscape using a sparsity inducing penaliza tion sparscape is able to select a small subset of dbfs with enriched bss in a set of dna_sequences from a much larger candidate set this substantially reduces the false_positives in prediction of bss analysis of chip_seq in mouse_embryonic and simulated_data show that sparscape dramatically outperforms the naive motif scanning method and the comparable computational_approaches in terms of dbf identification and bs prediction availability_and sparscape is implemented in c with openmp optional at compilation and is freely_available at www stat ucla edu zhou software html for academic use many complex processes in the cell particularly gene_regulation are controlled by the binding of various factors to the dna_sequence a key to understanding these processes is determining where each of these dna_binding factors dbfs including transcription_factors tfs nucleosomes rna and other proteins and protein_complexes binds in the genome in a certain cell_type and set of conditions this collection of binding_sites bss for all dbfs over regions of interest is sometimes called a binding landscape more formally we define a binding landscape as the base pairspecific probability of binding for each of a library of dbfs over a set of genomic_regions considering dbfs one at a time leads to many false_positives both in determining which dbfs have significantly_enriched bss in a set of genomic_regions and in predicting the exact locations of bss and results in a limited view of the processes controlled by these dbfs this has motivated recent work on jointly predicting binding landscapes for a set of dbfs currently joint landscapes at single_base for all dbfs have only been predicted in lower eukaryotes such as yeast with fewer dbfs and much smaller genomes in higher_eukaryotes predictions have been limited to a usually small pre selected set of dbfs known to bind the regions of interest of these methods only that ofdoes not require the dbf concentrations as prior_knowledge something made possible by considering at most two dbfs at a time and onlyused chip_seq as a source of direct information see teif and rippe andfor recent_examples of alternate approaches to answering related_questions owing to computational limits it is impossible to predict a joint base pairspecific binding landscape for all dbfs with unknown concentrations over the entire_genome in higher_eukaryotes with large_genomes and many dbfs we are thus limited to exploring a subset of the genome one motivating type of genomic subset is a set of regions known to be co bound by a small group of dbfs based on chip_seq in such a genomic subset we do not expect most dbfs to have a significant number of bss thus the false_positive bss in a predicted binding landscape can be substantially_reduced if only the dbfs with significantly_enriched binding in the regions of interest are considered however it is limiting to require the complete set of dbfs enriched in the considered regions to be known a priori as is done in existing work on similar questions in higher_eukaryotes in this article we develop a method that offers a principled way to select an often small subset of dbfs active in the regions of interest and to reduce the false_positive signal in the predicted probabilistic binding landscape eliminating the need for prior_knowledge of the set of enriched dbfs or dbf concentrations in the motivating genomic subset our method allows for the discovery of unknown cofactors that commonly bind near the dbfs with chip data chip dbfs the predicted joint binding landscape provides a global and quantitative view of the binding pattern among the dbfs this is an initial step to the study of combinatorial regulatory logic among multiple dbfs to whom correspondence should be addressed generating a base pairspecific binding landscape for all known dbfs over the entire_genome of higher organisms with large_genomes without prior_knowledge of dbf concentrations is currently prohibitively computationally_expensive when one then considers only certain genomic_regions it is expected that a large proportion of dbfs will not have true bss and performance suffers if all dbfs are considered requiring prior_knowledge of the set of dbfs active in the regions of interest and their concentrations introduces the need for often ad_hoc userdependent prior or iterative analysis or a need for additional experimental_data we contribute a new method sparscape that eliminates the need for this prior information and takes_advantage of binding data where available while outperforming alternate_methods one of the key features of our method is thenote non nuc is all considered dbfs except for the nucleosome chip is the set of dbfs for which chip data were available no chip is the set of dbfs for which chip data were not available in the cmyc group simulation there were small_datasets combined results are reported here but the predictions were made separately in each set pp stands for posterior_probability cutoff inclusion of penalization in bayesian_inference based on the expected false_positive site counts this significantly_reduces false_positive both in dbf selection and in bs prediction a similar idea has been used in the contrast motif finder the unsatisfactory performance of compete for the problems we investigate suggests that tuning prior dbf concentrations when they are not given is difficult in practice and using an improper vector of concentrations can be risky for joint prediction of landscapes moreover both sparscape and the raw score method select dbfs by comparing against some control regions but compete does not have this critical component we want to stress that our comparison against compete is mostly for demonstration purpose as the method is not targeted at dbf selection or predicting sparse binding landscapes as demonstrated by the results in this article with the default method for choosing the level of penalization a standard usage of sparscape usually works well but in fact sparscape is highly_flexible a user could independently choose less stringent dbf selection by setting a smaller penalty value and perform a single selection run instead of fold_cross this option is particularly useful when the goal is to predict sites for all dbfs that could at all plausibly have bss in the considered regions the default choice in the final post selection landscape prediction is to predict with the same penalty chosen in the selection stage and with fixed pwms a user may choose to make the predicted landscape less sparse by running the final prediction with no penalty reestimated pwms or both our modeling framework can easily be extended to include other types of information some measure of absolute binding_affinity as opposed to the relative binding_affinity information in a normalized pwm is available from protein binding microarrays and could be included as energy models further work integrating chip peak strength in the scoring of binding in chip windows could be fruitful especially for nucleosomes other location specific information on dbf binding to the sequence could also be used we plan further work using sparscapes joint binding landscape to predict gene_expression and offer insights into the underlying regulatory_network
