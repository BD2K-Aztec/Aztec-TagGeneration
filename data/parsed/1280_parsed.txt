debga read_alignment with de_bruijn graph_based seed and extension motivation as high_throughput hts technology becomes ubiquitous and the volume of data continues to rise hts read_alignment is becoming increasingly rate_limiting which keeps pressing the development of novel read_alignment approaches moreover promising novel applications of hts technology require aligning_reads to multiple_genomes instead of a single reference however it is still not viable for the state of the art aligners to align large_numbers of reads to multiple_genomes results we propose de_bruijn graph_based aligner debga an innovative graph_based seed and extension algorithm to align hts reads to a reference_genome that is organized and indexed using a de_bruijn with its well handling of repeats debga is substantially faster than state of the art approaches while maintaining similar or higher sensitivity and accuracy this makes it particularly well suited to handle the rapidly_growing volumes of sequencing_data furthermore it provides a promising solution for aligning_reads to multiple_genomes and graph_based references in hts applications a fundamental challenge of high_throughput hts technology is the quick and accurate alignment of sequencing_reads to one or more reference_genomes read_alignment is one of the most compute intensive steps of hts analysis and is becoming increasingly ratelimiting as hts technology becomes ubiquitous and the volume of data from each sequencing run continues to rise moreover as more genomes are available promising new applications of hts technology require aligning_reads to multiple_genomes instead of a single reference for example the genomes of the typical strains of a species are used as gold_standard reference_points and species or pathogens can be precisely identified and characterized by simultaneously aligning_reads from isolated or metagenomic_samples to these reference_genomes which has enormous potentials similarly reads from mouse xenograft_models typically need to be aligned to both the human and the mouse_genome however it is still not viable to align large_numbers of hts reads to multiple divergent genomes of various strains or species simultaneously primarily due to two limitations firstly most state of the art aligners are optimized for a single_genome reference although they can support almost any reference_sequence appending genomes together to make a longer reference typically degrades performance and decreases accuracy as many reads have multiple equally good matches secondly efforts have been made to support pan_genome indexing however most of the proposed methods organize genomes through collinear multiple_sequence msa these approaches are useful for highly_similar genomes such as multiple human_genomes genomes but not the genomes of more distant strains or species such distant homologues often have significant structural_variants svs such as inversions translocations and duplications and collinear msa could be not suitable for representing these non collinear events in this situation these approaches may not be applicable to align_reads against multiple divergent genomes e g a reference composed by a set of microbial_genomes moreover proposed pan_genome indexing methods also have additional limitations genomemapper and bwbble can only integrate relatively small variants such as snps and small_indels the size of generalized compressed suffix_array index could exponentially increase which could not be suited to handle the variants in repetitive_regions proposed an augmented msa based graph named as population reference graph prg to better support diverse kinds of variants in this approach the de_bruijn of the reads is aligned with prg to infer the donor genome this approach falls between de_novo and the alignment of genome_sequences it is suited to the inference of the complex genomic_regions such as the mhc region however it is mainly designed for local_regions and due to the lack of effective approach to index the prg of whole_genome it is still non trivial to extend this approach to the read_alignment against whole_genome besides the aforementioned limitations msa based aligners also have lower speed e g times slower than state of the art aligners meanwhile the msa itself may also affect the result of read_alignment as there is still not a standard method to implement the msa of genomes most of the state of the art generic aligners are based on seedand extend approach they are superior to backtracking suffix tries utilized e g bwa for the increasing read_length of hts technologies which requires large edit_distance generally seed and extend aligners consist of two steps i seeding the inference of putative read positions prps from the matches hits of tokens seeds between the read and reference_genome and ii extension alignment of the read to the region_surrounding each prp to determine the most likely read position s one of the major bottlenecks faced by this approach is how to handle repetitive genomic_regions even in the context of a single_genome for example over of the human_genome comprised repeats because of repeats many seeds have numerous hits and the cost of extending all of them is prohibitively high this problem is even more serious for a reference consisting of multiple_genomes as it will be even more repetitive due to the homologous_sequences various strategies have been developed to handle hits more effectively including heuristically filtering the hits limiting the number of hits per seed or merging hits before extension however as all of these strategies process each hit independently it could be also expensive to evaluate sort and prioritize the numerous hits after these steps however there could be still a number of candidates left for extension due to the repeats and the cost of separate alignment of the read to each of them could still be prohibitive to improve the alignment of reads to multiple references as well as the handling of repeats within a single_genome we propose the de_bruijn graph_based aligner debga which uses a graph_based seedand extension algorithm to align_reads to one or more genomes that have been organized and indexed by a reference de_bruijn rdbg de_bruijn and a bruijn_graph were used for the alignment of genomes however they have not been fully utilized for hts read_alignment debga takes the advantage of the non branched paths of rdbg i e unipaths to recognize similar seeds and identical local sequences which enables it to simultaneously evaluate multiple prps located in the same unipath regardless of the repetitiveness of the corresponding seeds this greatly_reduces the computational_burden caused by repeats due to its handling of repeats debga is substantially faster than other stateof the art aligners furthermore to our knowledge debga is the first viable solution which can align_reads to multiple_genomes with high_throughput and without restriction on the types of variants we benchmarked debga with two categories of tasks i e read_alignment against multiple_genomes and a single_genome to evaluate its ability on various applications in each of the tasks a series of simulated_and were employed to assess its speed sensitivity and accuracy six state of the art aligners bowtie bwa bwa mem star seqalto and gem were compared all the aligners were run with a variety of configurations supplementary notes the benchmarks were conducted on a server with an intel_xeon e cpu at ghz and tb ram running linux ubuntu results on various datasets demonstrated that debga can align_reads to one or more genomes quickly and sensitively making it particularly well suited to handle the rapidly_growing volumes of genomics and metagenomics_data this advantage originates from its de_bruijn graph_based organization of references and specifically_designed seed and extension process which enables to well handle the repeats debga is suited to be integrated into many re sequencing pipelines moreover this method could be further extended to solve other important problems which are also future works for us one of the potential works is to extend the approach to better align_reads spanning the breakpoints of large or non co linear events such as the dna_seq reads spanning svs or rna_seq which usually have splicing_events the alignment of such reads is difficult and critical to many downstream_analyses graph based_approach may have its own advantage to this task as the non colinear events could be better modeled under the de_bruijn framework comparing to the linear representation of the reference however the alignment_method still needs to be well designed to fully take the advantages of the graph_representation another potential extension is to use the debga method to align_reads against other data_structures which can also be split into k_mers such as msa based graphs this will make debga an important step toward rapidly aligning_reads to variation aware references representing a population of genomes such as the genomes_project
