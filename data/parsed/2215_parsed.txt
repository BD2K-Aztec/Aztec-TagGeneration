hiv classification using the coalescent_theory motivation existing coalescent models and phylogenetic tools based on them are not designed for studying the genealogy of sequences like those of hiv since in hiv recombinants with multiple cross over points between the parental strains frequently arise hence ambiguous cases in the classification of hiv sequences into subtypes and circulating_recombinant crfs have been treated with ad_hoc methods in lack of tools based on a comprehensive coalescent model accounting for complex recombination patterns results we developed the program argus that scores classifications of sequences into subtypes and recombinant forms it reconstructs ancestral recombination graphs args that reflect the genealogy of the input_sequences given a classification hypothesis an arg with maximal probability is approximated using a markov_chain approach argus was able to distinguish the correct classification with a low_error from plausible alternative classifications in simulation_studies with realistic parameters we applied our algorithm to decide between two recently debated alternatives in the classification of crf of hiv and find that crf is indeed a recombinant of subtypes a and g availability argus is implemented in c and the source_code is available ata coalescent model incorporating recombination was first introduced by in the presence of recombination the genealogy of a set of sequences can be represented as a so_called ancestral recombination graph arg rather than a tree in human_immunodeficiency hiv recombination is frequent and recombinant forms of the virus that spread are called circulating_recombinant crfs in current nomenclature sequences of the epidemiologically most to whom correspondence should be addressed relevant clade hiv group m are classified into subtypes and crfs see los alamos national lab lanl database http www hiv lanl gov the crfs have usually multiple recombination breakpoints between unrecombined segments of the pure parental subtypes algorithms for subtype classification and breakpoint detection of hiv sequences are based on the classification system of hiv hence their quality highly depend on this system but due to the evolution of hiv nomenclature developed in real_time in conjunction with emerging knowledge of the global diversity of the virus the current nomenclature has anomalies e g the phylogenetic distance between subtypes b and d is relatively small compared to that of other pairs of subtypes in fact it is more like the distance of a pair of subsubtypes furthermore several questions about the current_classification system of sequences are unanswered or debated there are complete and over partial hiv group m genomes in the lanl database which are undefined i e belong neither to a subtype nor to a crf this is due to many reasons e g parental sequences have not been identified yet additionally in the nomenclature system crf is considered to be a recombinant of subtype a and g but recently some evidence has been presented in the literature suggesting that crf would actually be better described as a subtype and subtype g as a recombinant a few years_ago it was also debated whether crf is in fact a pure subtype moreover assignments in the database are reflected on diverse classification strategies employed by different investigators in the primary literature therefore it is desirable to have tools for classifying the hiv sequence set systematically based on a comprehensive coalescent model accounting for complex recombination patterns while the problem of recombination has been well documented in hiv recombination also occurs in the other lentiviruses moreover intra segmental recombination has been reported from a large variety of other viruses e g coronaviruses flaviviruses alphaviruses rotaviruses influenzaviruses hantaviruses arenaviruses and avian oncoviruses furthermore recombination plays also a role in other species such as bacteria thus it is possible that many virus systems would benefit from a systematic classification that explicitly includes recombination page test settings to test argus three different settings are tested t a representative selection of hiv group m sequences from subtypes a to k presented in supplementary section t a classification involving all features offered by argus except unknown subtypes t two classifications corresponding to the situations that bullet crf is a crf and g a subtype or bullet crf is a subtype and g a crf the first test setting is intended to show the ability of argus to construct a phylogenetic_tree without recombination this is a subproblem also arising when reconstructing an arg and hence must be accomplishable by argus the second setting demonstrates the ability of argus to differentiate between similar classifications of real_world complexity we refrain from incorporating unknown subtypes since this would prohibit performing the test fully automatically finally the last setting shows the applicability of argus to the task of further analyzing subtype g and crf to determine_whether they are more likely to be recombinants or ancestral subtypes this question was raised by earlier analysis inparameter estimation the model uses two different mutation_rates since increasing their number does not improve the results whereas a constant mutation_rate performs considerably worse data not shown the per site recombination_rate c is set to the parameter is estimated by applying lamarc to randomly_chosen hiv group m sequences classified as pure subtypes in the lanl hiv sequence database disabling recombination and growth lamarc yields the gamma_distribution parameter of the general time reversible gtr model is estimated to be by findmodel the length of the simulated sequences is bp which is approximately the length of the hiv group m sequences used in the application in section after removal of gap affected positions we presented argus a classification_tool for recombining viruses particularly hiv up to now researchers intending to classify sequences of strongly recombining viruses had to analyze the sequences separately by segmenting their genome in recombinationfree parts and applying traditional phylogenetic tools to them the information stemming from different parts of the genome had to be assembled by ad_hoc methods if even possible at all here argus offers an alternative by applying sophisticated coalescent_theory and mcmc based_methods and incorporating much larger parts of the available information in an integrated and model based way the recently_developed version of visrd does not perform well on the datasets analyzed in this article nevertheless one has to keep in mind that the approach used by visrd is in principle not adequate for a small number of sequence groups in fact our test setting is the smallest possible for which the taxon ranking of visrd can be applied since applying argus on a very large number of sequence groups is prohibitive with respect to running time at least in the current_implementation we can conclude that the scopes of visrd and argus are roughly exclusive moreover the application range of argus is limited in two directions first argus is not designed to rank different classifications not containing any recombinants this is due to the fact that the two classifications assigning the same subtype to all sequences and assigning a different subtype to each sequence respectively achieve the highest likelihood among all crf free classifications by definition second when applying argus one has to keep in mind that there might be very plausible classifications that do not fit into the framework of argus i e classifications incorporating intra subtype recombination and recombination_events in the early history of the arg in this study we first verified in different test settings that argus possesses the ability to reliably identify the most appropriate classification in most investigated cases due to the character of the test method we can conclude that for input_sequences stemming from sub species well separated by founder effectssuch as hiv argus classifies correctly with very high_probability afterwards we applied argus to real_world hiv group m data in order to address the intensively debated question whether crf is truly a crf or rather the alleged subtype g is one our results show that the former classification explains the data better the fact that we had to run the mcmc_algorithm with up to initial args to achieve satisfying_results shows that the mcmc_algorithm is not often able to find the global maximum directly very probably due to getting trapped in a local maximum we plan to overcome this problem by applying metropolis coupled mcmc mc methods a standard task after sequencing a new hiv_genome is subtyping as performed by jphmm and other tools the genome is segmented into regions that are each related to one known pure subtype of hiv a future_application of argus will be to vote between the results of several subtyping tools in case they disagree on the correct classification of the query_sequence easily carried_out by replacing the recombination prediction of jphmm by the ones of the other subtyping tools this application is a special_case for the model in which two or more classifications are compared that differ only in the recombination pattern of one sequence the other sequences all being pure subtypes while argus does not search for a recombination pattern itself its comprehensive model is well suited to compare such patterns in the near future we plan to incorporate additional rules such as intra subtype recombination and recombination near to the root into argus and allow for growth of the population and temporally page
