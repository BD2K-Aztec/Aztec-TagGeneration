minimum curvilinearity to enhance topological prediction of protein interactions by network embedding motivation most functions within the cell emerge thanks to proteinprotein_interactions ppis yet experimental determination of ppis is both expensive_and ppi_networks present significant levels of noise and incompleteness predicting interactions using only ppi network_topology topological prediction is difficult but essential when prior_biological is absent or unreliable methods network embedding emphasizes the relations between network proteins embedded in a low dimensional_space in which protein pairs that are closer to each other represent good candidate interactions to achieve network denoising which boosts prediction_performance we first applied minimum curvilinear embedding mce and then adopted shortest_path sp in the reduced space to assign likelihood scores to candidate interactions furthermore we introduce i a new valid variation of mce named non centred mce ncmce ii two automatic strategies for selecting the appropriate embedding dimension and iii two new randomized procedures for evaluating predictions results we compared our method against several unsupervised and supervisedly tuned embedding approaches and node neighbourhood techniques despite its computational simplicity ncmce sp was the overall leader outperforming the current methods in topological link prediction conclusion minimum curvilinearity is a valuable non linear framework that we successfully_applied to the embedding of protein networks for the unsupervised prediction of novel ppis the rationale for our approach is that biological and evolutionary_information is imprinted in the non linear patterns hidden behind the protein network_topology and can be exploited for predicting new protein links the predicted ppis represent good candidates for testing in high_throughput experiments or for exploitation in systems_biology tools such as those used for network_based and prediction of disease related functional_modules detection of new interactions between proteins is central to modern biology its application in protein_function drug_delivery control and disease diagnosis has developed alongside a deeper_understanding of the processes that occur within the cell one key task in systems_biology is the experimental detection of new proteinprotein_interactions ppis however such experiments are time consuming and expensive because of this researchers have developed computational_approaches for predicting novel interactions intended also to guide wet_lab the topological prediction of new interactions is a novel and useful option based exclusively on the structural_information provided by the ppi_network ppin topology this option for prediction is particularly convenient when the available biological_information on the proteins being tested for interaction seed proteins is incomplete or unreliable one of the most efficient approaches is the functional_similarity weight fsw such method belongs to the large and well established family of predictors that are referred to as node neighbourhood techniques because to assign a likelihood_score to any candidate interaction i e a pair of non connected proteins in the observed ppin they rely on the topological_properties of the seed proteins neighbours the set of candidate interactions is then ranked the main_problem with these techniques is that their performance is poor when applied to sparse and noisy networks proposed a method for geometric denoising of ppins the algorithm is based on the use of multidimensional_scaling mds to preserve the shortest_paths sp between nodes in a low dimensional_space the predicted interactions are scored according to their euclidean_distance ed in the low dimensional_space following the principle that the closer two proteins are the higher the likelihood that they interact although it is not explicitly mentioned in the article the embedding method adopted byis equivalent to isomap in an independent study proposed a hybrid strategy based on network embedding to assign prediction scores to candidate interactions they exploited the notion that a ppinor theoretically any networklies on a low_dimensional manifold shaped in a high dimensional_space the shape of the manifold and the associated topology are determined by the constraints imposed on the protein interactions through biological evolution you et_al used a renowned manifold embedding algorithm isomap to to whom correspondence should be addressed
