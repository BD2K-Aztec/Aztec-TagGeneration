hybrid spatial gillespie and particle_tracking simulation motivation cellular_signal involves spatialtemporal dynamics and often stochastic effects due to the low particle abundance of some molecular_species others can however be of high abundances such a system can be simulated either with the spatial gillespie stochastic_simulation ssa or brownian smoluchowski dynamics if space and stochasticity are important to combine the accuracy of particle based_methods with the superior_performance of the ssa we suggest a hybrid simulation results the proposed simulation allows an interactive or automated switching for regions or species of interest in the cell especially we see an application if for instance receptor_clustering at the membrane is modeled in detail and the transport through the cytoplasm is included as well the results show the increase in performance of the overall simulation and the limits of the approach if crowding is included future work will include the development of a gui to improve control of the simulation availability of implementation www bison ethz ch research spatial simulations existing_methods to model the spatialtemporal dynamics in signal_transduction can be grouped into i partial_differential pde methods ii spatially_resolved markovian population models often simulated with the ssa gillespie method or other lattice based_methods and iii particle based_methods such as smoldyn greens function reaction dynamics gfrd van zon and ten and others naturally more detailed methods are computationally much more demanding which requires careful_selection of the right method for the biological problem in focus note that particle numbers and parameters are very heterogeneous in biological_systems molecule abundances range from gene to several thousands of proteins of each class similarly the size of the molecules and structures ranges from atoms ions nm to molecular complexes nm and further to cellular sub compartments and cytoskeleton structures nm whereas chemical interaction rate_constants cover several orders_of hybrid methods can be employed to optimize the use of the computational_resources in such a multi_scale environment to whom correspondence should be addressed the present article aims at coupling a brownian_dynamics particle_tracking method with the spatial gillespie method to preserve the stochastic_nature of the underlying signaling_processes low_abundance species should for instance be always tracked as individual particles and high_abundance species on the gillespie level similarly subvolumes in focus of the simulation e g receptor_clustering on the plasma_membrane should be on the particle level these two switches both on the species and the simulation volume level have to be accommodated in one simulation accordingly
