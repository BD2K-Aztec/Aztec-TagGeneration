the role of mirnas in complex formation and control microribonucleic acid mirnas are small regulatory_molecules that act by mrna_degradation or via translational_repression although many mirnas are ubiquitously_expressed a small subset have differential expression_patterns that may give rise to tissue_specific complexes motivation this work studies gene_targeting patterns amongst mirnas with differential expression_profiles and links this to control and regulation of protein_complexes results we find that when a pair of mirnas are not expressed in the same tissues there is a higher_tendency for them to target the direct partners of the same hub proteins at the same time they also avoid targeting the same set of hub spokes moreover the complexes corresponding to these hub spokes tend to be specific and nonoverlapping this suggests that the effect of mirnas on the formation of complexes is specific microribonucleic acid mirnas are small non coding regulatory_molecules that act by downregulating gene_expression at the posttranscriptional and pre translational stage they have an extensive array of functions and are implicated in diverse processes such as growth development and differentiation they also play_important in diseases such as cancer and heart_disease van mirnas are known to play roles in regulating the protein_interaction showed that mirnas tend to target hubs in a network moreover this regulation is more important for intermodular hubs than intramodular ones further built upon this and discovered that while proteins directly regulated by mirnas might not form a network module themselves the mirna target_genes and their interacting neighbors jointly showed significantly_higher modularity this is an early indication that mirnas target select components of complexes however it is not until recently whenconfirmed that individual mirnas or co expressed mirnas frequently target several components of protein_complexes indicating a coordinate post_transcriptional of protein_complexes by mirnas in the human protein_interaction several large hubs are often observed usually corresponding to critical gene or biological_process regulators the partners hub spokes are functional_units controlled by the hub and can be considered as part of a functional_unit such as a complex given that different tissues utilize their gene_repertoire differently it is inconceivable that interactions between hubs and all adjoining hub spokes exist simultaneously since there are limitations in physical binding area and so on one possible mode of control is via expressional suppression thereby giving rise to different or subforms of complexes sinceshowed that coexpressing mirnas have a propensity to target complexes we extend this by suggesting that anti coexpressing mirnas can effect the formation of different protein_complexes by suppressing gene_expression that is mirnas with widely different expression_profiles can control mutually_exclusive or tissue_specific biological_processes by impacting on the formation of different complexes we have shown how mirna expression_patterns could impact the formation of complexes first anti coexpressed mirnas tend to regulate hub spokes significantly second anti coexpressed mirnas affect different spokes corresponding to different complexes the activity of anti coexpressed mirnas is also specific in that targeted complexes tend not to have components common to other complexes thereby limiting collateral or non specific effects mirs b and p are ubiquitously_expressed but not in heart_tissue and are anti coexpressed to mir p furthermore the targets of mirs b and p are enriched for heart related functions this reinforces the notion that anti coexpressed mirnas are involved in the acquisition of tissue_specific functions in vpa treated_mice it appears that mirnas play a role in the complex formation the increase in precursor baf complexes due to mirnas targeting specific components of the mature form may have a significant effect in the psychoactive effects of vpa e g by allowing reversion to a higher_level of brain_plasticity
