the intrinsic combinatorial organization and information_theoretic content of a sequence are correlated to the dna_encoded nucleosome_organization of eukaryotic_genomes motivation thanks to research spanning nearly years two major models have emerged that account for nucleosome_organization in chromatin statistical and sequence specific the first is based on elegant easy to compute closed form mathematical formulas that make no assumptions of the physical_and of the underlying dna_sequence moreover they need no training on the data for their computation the latter is based on some sequence regularities but as opposed to the statistical_model it lacks the same type of closed form formulas that in this case should be based on the dna_sequence only results we contribute to close this important methodological gap between the two models by providing three very simple formulas for the sequence specific one they are all based on well known formulas in computer science and bioinformatics and they give different quantifications of how complex a sequence is in view of how remarkably well they perform it is very surprising that measures of sequence complexity have not even been considered as candidates to close the mentioned gap we provide experimental_evidence that the intrinsic level of combinatorial organization and information_theoretic content of subsequences within a genome are strongly correlated to the level of dna_encoded nucleosome_organization discovered by kaplan et_al our results establish an important connection between the intrinsic complexity of subsequences in a genome and the intrinsic i e dna_encoded nucleosome_organization of eukaryotic_genomes it is a first step towards a mathematical characterization of this latter encoding kornberg in a very influential article posed the problem of establishing whether nucleosome_positioning obeys statistical laws or is dictated by sequence specific rules such a problem is at the heart of studies concerned with the understanding as well as the prediction of nucleosome_organization and positioning in genomic_dna and it has been the object of investigation in many disciplines e g biology physics bioinformatics an account on the state of theart for nucleosome_organization as well as novel results can be found in two recent_articles among the many outstanding results the two discussed next are in our view both milestones and the most relevant in order to place the contribution given in this article in the proper light proposed a statistical_model referred to as the barrier model and recently generalized by m bius and gerland that would account for nucleosome_organization in genomes genome_wide experiments have shown its validity it has the great virtue of being formalized by very elegant mathematical formulas which can be computed with no training on dna_sequences moreover it had no predecessor of its kind nor has it been the object of controversies after its proposal consequent remarkable findings byandestablished that nucleosome_organization is dna_encoded the authors went also one step further and showed that via machine_learning a computer program could learn those sequence rules and later be used as a predictor of nucleosome_positioning that study had been preceded by results that pointed to specific sequence_features as being associated to nucleosome depletion or enrichment in genomic_regions see for summary and relevant references however it was the first study that provided an answer to the sequence_specificity question in general terms and on a genomic_scale as opposed to the specifics of preceding results e g regular patterns occurring in dna or base_composition unfortunately although what is meant by dna_encoded in that context is semantically clear mathematically it is void of meaning since no code was exhibited moreover large_scale investigations that have tried to identify universal sequence dictated rules a requirement less stringent than a code for nucleosome_positioning tended to exclude their existence simple intrinsic sequence rules are emerging but they are very specific and very few and there is no evidence that they are exhaustive on the contrary recent results indicate that the role of k_mers involved in nucleosome enrichment or depletion may be more complex than what expected in summary although the lab experiments show the existence of such an encoding in terms of rules and properties of the associated alphanumeric sequences not much progress has been made when compared with the barrier model the dnaencoded one lacks a rigorous set of mathematical formulas easy to compute and requiring no training on the dna_sequences that could even in part be used to explain the mathematical nature of that encoding finding such an object would be important methodologically in order not to transform sequence specific nucleosome_positioning into a potentially endless list of specific rules prediction of nucleosome_positions based on it it is perceived as a minor point here we address such a shortcoming by providing three formulas with the required characteristics they are either well known or variants of well known formulas in computer science and bioinformatics they both quantify the intrinsic complexity of a sequence in particular we consider i empirical entropy which measures information_theoretic content of a sequence ii two linguistic complexity measures that measure the combinatorial richness of a sequence as quantified by the number of distinct subsequences composing it following the same experimental set up as in we find a quite elegant correspondence between fundamental notions in mathematics and computer science and biology there is indeed a relationship between the intrinsic complexity of subsequences in a genome and the intrinsic i e dna_encoded nucleosome_organization of eukaryotic_genomes this is new and unique as far as the role of sequence_specificity in nucleosome_positioning is concerned
