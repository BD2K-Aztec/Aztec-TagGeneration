systems_biology ondex web web_based visualization and exploration of heterogeneous biological_networks ondex web is a new web_based implementation of the network_visualization and exploration tools from the ondex data_integration platform new features such as context sensitive menus and annotation tools provide users with intuitive ways to explore and manipulate the appearance of heterogeneous biological_networks ondex web is open_source written in java and can be easily embedded into web_sites as an applet ondex web supports loading data from a variety of network formats such as xgmml nwb pajek and oxl availability_and the integrative approach to systems_biology studies the interactions between molecular or cellular_components to understand how a behavior or phenotype might emerge from the properties or structure of the interactions this approach generally requires data from diverse sources to be integrated and analyzed together it is common in systems_biology to adopt network formalisms to represent visualize and explore interaction information and a number of web_based applications are available for the visualization of biological_networks a wellknown example is cytoscape_web version of which is implemented using flex actionscript and a javascript api cytoscape_web can visualize small_to networks i e a few hundred nodes and edges the visual styles e g color size and opacity of nodes and edges can be dynamically changed by the client however loading of data and customization of its appearance in cytoscape_web require extensive javascript programming_skills we have previously_developed the ondex software_suite www ondex org to provide a general framework for the integration of heterogeneous_biological data we describe here a new implementation of the visualization software from the ondex suite that enables integrated networks and associated quantitative data to be presented in a web_browser this enables delivery of results from pre integrated datasets to end_users as featured in the qtlnetminer system http ondex rothamsted ac uk qtlnetminer and overcomes the significant_obstacle encountered by many biologists of installing and learning complex data_integration software system ondex web has been built as a java_applet reusing proven functions and plugins from the ondex desktop_application this results in a richer repertoire of functions for exploring and manipulating heterogeneous information networks than currently available in cytoscape_web ondex web provides new features not described before including easy to use search functions for loaded data and across web_services e g chembl uniprotkb the network appearance can be changed using dedicated plugins and another new feature is the extensive context sensitive menus on nodes and edges ondex web has direct support for loading data in common network formats such as cytoscapes xgmml nwb nwb pajek the ondex desktop_application can be used to prepare datasets integrated from a large range of input_formats see http ondex org formats html and exported in oxl format for use in ondex web example data_sets are available for download http ondex org doc html heterogeneous biological_networks require good exploration and visualization_tools ondex web is free open_source and can easily be embedded on web_sites to visualize networks it comes with a rich and intuitive set of functions to explore and manipulate biological_networks for an example application of ondex web visit qtlnetminer http ondex rothamsted ac uk qtlnetminer where it is used to visualize evidence networks supporting candidate_gene selections funding rothamsted research receives grant in aid from the biotechnology and biological_sciences research council bbsrc bbsrc sabr award bb f and tsb project tp conflict of interest none declared
