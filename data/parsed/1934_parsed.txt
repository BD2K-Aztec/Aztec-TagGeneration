gene_expression gathering insights on disease_etiology from gene_expression of healthy_tissues motivation gene_expression have been widely used to study disease_states it may be possible however to gather insights into human_diseases by comparing gene_expression of healthy organs with different disease_incidence or severity we tested this hypothesis and developed an approach to identify candidate_genes associated with disease development by focusing on cancer_incidence since it varies_greatly across human organs results we normalized organ specific cancer_incidence by organ_weight and found that reproductive_organs tend to have a higher mass normalized cancer_incidence which could be due to evolutionary trade_offs next we performed a genome_wide scan to identify genes whose expression across healthy organs correlates with organ specific cancer_incidence we identified a large_number including genes previously associated with tumorigenesis and new candidate_genes most genes_exhibiting a positive correlation with cancer_incidence were related to ribosomal and transcriptional_activity translation and protein_synthesis organs with enhanced transcriptional and translational activation may have higher cell_proliferation and therefore be more likely to develop cancer furthermore we found that organs with lower cancer_incidence tend to express lower levels of known cancer associated genes overall these results demonstrate how genes and processes that predispose organs to specific diseases can be identified using gene_expression from healthy_tissues our approach can be applied to other diseases and serve as foundation for further oncogenomic analyses pathological_conditions to identify disease_biomarkers and gain insights into pathophysiological_processes few studies however have compared data between healthy_tissues to identify normal tissue_specific pathways that predispose or contribute to disease one study focused on the expression of disease associated genes in healthy_tissues and found that they tend to be overexpressed in tissues where their disruption causes pathology but this remains a largely_unexplored area herein we wanted to develop a method that takes_advantage of gene_expression from healthy organs to determine new candidate_genes and processes associated with complex_diseases although many diseases are tissue_specific for others disease_incidence and severity varies_widely across organs it is plausible that variation in particular organ features affects their predisposition to pathophysiological_mechanisms and therefore identifying such features will provide_clues on disease_etiology given that largescale gene_expression data is available for the major human organs the basic premise behind this work is that it may be possible to gather insights into human disease by comparing gene_expression of healthy organs with differences in disease_incidence or severity our aim in this work was to test this hypothesis and develop a method for identifying genes and processes associated with organ specific disease_incidence using gene_expression data from healthy_tissues because cancer can originate in multiple_organs we focused our proof_of analysis on cancer_incidence cancer is caused primarily by alterations in the genome of the affected cells yet organ characteristics may predispose or protect from tumorigenesis in fact there is a great variation in the incidence of cancer across organs differences in cell_proliferation and turnover have been put forward as an explanation though the topic remains_controversial a previous study found that while gain of function cancer_genes i e oncogenes are overexpressed in tissues more associated with cancer loss of function cancer_genes i e tumor_suppressor and caretaker genes are underexpressed in such tissues in order to study the differences in cancer_incidence between different human organs we conducted a genome_wide correlation study between cancer_incidence normalized for organ_weight and gene_expression using microarray_data from healthy_tissues our results reveal a large_number and processes whose expression is associated with cancer_incidence and show it is possible to employ gene_expression across healthy organs toin this study we sought to determine_whether it is possible to gain insights into disease development processes by comparing gene_expression of healthy organs with organ specific disease_incidence and if so develop a method that performs such analyses organ specific disease_incidence can be obtained from epidemiological_studies but because larger organs will have more cells we think it is crucial to normalize disease_incidence by organ_weight organ specific gene_expression are publicly_available in databases such as the gnf dataset genes can then be scanned for those whose expression correlates with mass normalized disease_incidence and common pathways detected by functional_enrichment methods known disease associated genes can also be analyzed for statistically_significant patterns across organs of varying disease_incidence to test our approach we focused on the large observed differences in cancer_incidence between human organs data on cancer incidence_rates by site was obtained from the usa united_states department of health and human since our focus was on intrinsic biological_features of each organ and its cells we tried to minimize effects of environmental_factors and as such used lung cancer_incidence data from never smokers to account for the differing numbers of cells between organs tissue_specific cancer incidence_rates were normalized by organ_weight see section nonetheless it is interesting to note that cancer_incidence did not correlate with organ_weight supplementary yet because our focus is on cellular properties that may predispose to cancer theuse of mass normalized cancer_incidence will only accentuate those properties after normalizing we obtained mass normalized organ specific cancer incidences for multiple_organs the prostate had the highest cancer_incidence rate whereas skeletal_muscle had the lowest rate there was a large variance in mass normalized cancer_incidence spanning six orders_of from prostate to skeletal_muscle interestingly five of the eight tissues with the highest massnormalized cancer_incidence are related to reproduction to identify genes and processes associated with cancer_incidence we mapped mass normalized cancer_incidence with organs in the microarray gnf tissue_specific gene_expression dataset see section we then correlated the gene_expression signal of each microarray probe across organs with the mass normalized organ cancer_incidence overall we found significant probes benjaminihochberg test see section the genes corresponding to the top probes are displayed inand include several ribosomal genes as well as proteins that are part of the transcriptionalmachinery in addition there were some poorly_studied genes like c orf c orf and tacc two other significant genes of note were taurine upregulated tug and wd repeat and socs box containing wsb both of which positively correlated with cancer_incidence p and respectively the vast_majority of top probes out of correlated_positively with cancer_incidence in the top only c orf showed a negative correlation with cancer_incidence our full results are available as supplementary_material and on our website_http genomics senescence info cancer tissues html the significant probes were matched with their gene symbols and were then analyzed in david to identify common functions and processes probes with positive_and correlations with cancer_incidence were analyzed_separately among genes with a positive correlation with cancer_incidence we identified four significant clusters using david all of which containing categories with a significant_enrichment even after benjaminihochberg correction by far the most significant cluster from david included ribosomal genes genes involved in transcription and protein_synthesis among genes that correlated negatively with cancer_incidence only categories related to muscle were significant and thus assumed to be a bias caused by the low cancer_incidence of skeletal_muscle and heart data not shown given the above potential_bias due to skeletal_muscle and because muscle has been reported to have unique ribosomal_biogenesis the analysis described above was repeated after eliminating skeletal_muscle and heart however ribosomal activity still appeared in david analyses as the top highly_significant cluster enrichment score of with ribosome benjamini translational elongation and protein_biosynthesis having highly_significant enrichments similarly we repeated our analysis using cancer_incidence data from an arab population see section in order to validate our results in a population under different environment and in particular one in which alcohol_consumption is low and results were largely confirmatory with the top cluster enrichment score of encompassing highly_significant categories involving transcription translation and ribosomes data not shown we then investigated whether the expression of genes in which mutations have been associated with cancer may be related to organ specific cancer_incidence several genes in which mutations have been associated with cancer were among our significant genes including rpl p and sfpq although there were slightly more probes with a positive correlation with organ specific cancer_incidence than a negative correlation and respectively among probes n targeting genes in which mutations have been associated with cancer about three fourth had a positive correlation with organ specific cancer_incidence while one fourth had a negative correlation this difference_was p lastly for each tissue we counted the number of genes expressed in a tissue specific_fashion see section and determined whether this in turn could also be related to mass normalized cancer_incidence but found no significant correlation data not shown gene_expression of pathological_conditions have been widely used yet few studies have focused on comparisons across healthy_tissues to identify normal tissue_specific pathways that contribute to disease one can consider human organs as different experimental samples with varying disease incidences and understanding these differences could provide new biological_insights into disease_etiology as a proof_of we focused on cancer_incidence and developed a simple method to determine genes and processes associated with organ specific cancer_incidence elucidating the biological reasons for differences in cancer_incidence among organs could help our understanding diagnosis and treatment of cancer although to our knowledge no systematic studies have been conducted to date it is expected that the number of cells within a tissue is proportional to cancer risk we were hence surprised to find that organ cancer_incidence does not correlate with organ_weight supplementary on the other hand the two heaviest organs in our analysis muscle and bone have relatively low cancer_incidence whereas the organ with the highest incidence prostate is a relatively small organ our results provide no evidence then that organ_size determinants like progenitor_cell number and p mediated stress and apoptosis contribute to cancer since no doubt a lower number of cells will make it less likely to develop cancer however there must be strong features in cells from tissues with high cancer_incidence that predispose them to cancer development to find these features we used mass normalized cancer_incidence to control for number of cells in organs and emphasize cellular properties that may predispose to cancer to our knowledge our work is the first to calculate cancer_incidence across organs controlling for the organs weight this normalization provides a measure of organ specific cancer_incidence that can serve as basis for further studies in particular since a large variation in mass normalized cancer_incidence was observed for healthy human organs strikingly we observed that reproductive_organs were overrepresented among those with the higher rates of cancer_incidence this may reflect evolutionary trade_offs involving selective_pressures related to reproduction reproductive_organs may be under stronger evolutionary selection because reproduction is more important than late_life survival and thus alleles that favor reproduction early in life will be selected for even if they are deleterious later in life as predicted by evolutionary theory indeed although cancer is an agerelated disease it is interesting to note that testicular_cancer is
