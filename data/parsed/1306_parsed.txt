gene_expression defining an informativeness metric for clustering gene_expression data motivation unsupervised cluster_analysis is an invaluable tool for exploratory microarray_data analysis as it organizes the data into groups of genes or samples in which the elements share_common patterns once the data are clustered finding the optimal number of informative subgroups within a dataset is a problem that while important for understanding the underlying phenotypes is one for which there is no robust widely_accepted solution results to address this problem we developed an informativeness metric based on a simple analysis_of statistic that identifies the number of clusters which best separate phenotypic groups the performance of the informativeness metric has been tested on both experimental and simulated_datasets and we contrast these results with those obtained using alternative_methods such as the gap statistic availability the method has been implemented in the bioconductor r package attract it is also freely_available from http compbio dfci harvard edu pubs attract zip contact clustering_methods were among the first methods to be applied to dna microarray_data and they remain one of the most commonly used techniques in the analysis of high_dimensional genomic_data the assumption is that samples sharing similar patterns of expression across large_numbers of genes are members of a particular molecular class or that genes grouped in clusters are co regulated across samples because they belong to a common functional_group or pathway while these assumptions have proven useful determining where a cluster begins and ends or equivalently how many gene or sample clusters are present in a dataset is often arbitrary or treated as a post clustering analysis problem in either case the lack of a robust and reliable method can lead to potentially incorrect conclusions underestimating the number of clusters can artificially to whom correspondence should be addressed group unrelated elements while overestimating can split related groups into subgroups that confound further analysis here we focus on the problem of identifying informative gene_expression clusters in experimental_datasets resulting from comparison of multiple biological classes such as treatment and control or different cell_types the question we are trying to address is very specific given a number of distinct phenotypic groups what is the optimal cluster number and membership such that the clusters are maximally informative in their ability to distinguish the sample classes given the history of using clustering_approaches in gene_expression analysis and for other applications it is surprising that this problem has not been more effectively addressed statistical_methods that evaluate the optimal_number within a dataset exist but are rarely used in a systematic manner and may reflect the fact that there are an array of experimental applications in which clustering is used as a discovery tool model based cluster_analysis methods assume that the collection of gene_expression can be decomposed into subgroups in which the genes display coordinated patterns of expression modelbased approaches use statistical_methods to search for the number of subgroups for which the consensus profiles best fit the available data for model based_methods metrics such as the akaike_information and the bayesian_information are both based on likelihood values and can be used to evaluate how well one model fits the data relative to another model while these have been applied in other domains in the analysis of microarray_data model_selection can become difficult since there is often no a priori way of knowing what the structure of the underlying true model might be these approaches also may require the estimation of a large number of parameters and in some cases the number of samples may not be sufficient to accurately complete this task finally most model_based algorithms assume a gaussian_distribution for variation that may not generally be appropriate for genomic_profiling data for the analysis of microarray_data a number of methods have been developed for estimating optimal cluster number based on an assessment of two properties of good gene_clusters compactness and stability a compact cluster is defined such that the intra cluster variability is small relative to the average inter cluster variability metrics assessing compactness that have been applied to array data include the gap statistic the silhouette width the dunn index and thewe provide an alternative way to validate the results of a cluster_analysis that explicitly takes_into the experimental_design which produced the dataset this validation method is independent of the method used to generate the clusters given the additional insights into data_structure provided by our approach we hope that the simplicity of our method will make the integration of cluster validation approaches a more mainstream part of the cluster_analysis procedure
