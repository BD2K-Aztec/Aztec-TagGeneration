gene_expression cross_species queries of large gene_expression databases motivation expression databases including the gene_expression and arrayexpress have experienced significant growth over the past_decade and now hold hundreds of thousands of arrays from multiple species since most drugs are initially tested on model_organisms the ability to compare expression experiments across species may help identify pathways that are activated in a similar way in humans and other organisms however while several methods exist for finding co expressed genes in the same species as a query gene looking at co expression of homologs or arbitrary genes in other species is challenging unlike sequence which is static expression is dynamic and changes between tissues conditions and time thus to carry out cross_species analysis using these databases we need methods that can match experiments in one species with experiments in another species results to facilitate queries in large_databases we developed a new method for comparing expression experiments from different species we define a distance_metric between the ranking of orthologous_genes in the two species we show how to solve an optimization_problem for learning the parameters of this function using a training_dataset of known similar expression experiments pairs the function we learn outperforms previous methods and simpler rank comparison methods that have been used in the past for single species analysis we used our method to compare millions of array pairs from mouse and human expression experiments the resulting matches can be used to find functionally_related to hypothesize about biological response mechanisms and to highlight conditions and diseases that are activating similar pathways in both species availability supporting methods results and a matlab_implementation are available fromadvances in sequencing_technology have led to a remarkable growth in the size of sequence_databases over the past_two this has allowed researchers to study newly_sequenced genes by utilizing knowledge about their homologs in other species alignment and search_methods most notably blast have become standard_tools and are extensively used by molecular_biologists cross_species analysis of sequence_data to whom correspondence should be addressed is now a standard practice however similar usage of expression databases has not materialized expression databases including gene_expression geo www ncbi nih gov geo and arrayexpress www ebi ac uk databases microarray html hold hundreds of thousands of arrays from multiple species co expression is a powerful method for assigning new function to genes within a single species if we are able to identify a large set of matched expression experiments across species this method can be extended and used in a cross_species analysis setting as well consider a human gene with unknown function that is co expressed across many different conditions with a mouse gene with known function this information can provide useful clues about the function of the human gene this information is also useful for identifying orthologs if a gene has multiple homologs in another species then the homolog with the highest co expression similarity in several conditions is likely its orthologs since they are involved in the same processes in both species while promising querying expression datasets to identify coexpressed genes in other species is challenging unlike sequence which is static expression is dynamic and changes between tissues conditions and time thus a key challenge is to match experiments in one species with experiments in another species almost all studies that have analyzed expression datasets in multiple species relied on one of the two methods they have either carried_out experiments under the same condition in multiple species or have looked at coexpression within a species and tested whether these relationships are retained across species examples of the former set of methods include comparison of cell_cycle experiments across species comparing response programs and comparing tissue expression between human and mouse examples of the latter strategy include the metagene
