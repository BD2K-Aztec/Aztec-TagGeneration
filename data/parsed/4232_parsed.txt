gene_expression siber systematic identification of bimodally expressed genes using rnaseq_data motivation identification of bimodally expressed genes is an important task as genes with bimodal expression play_important in cell_differentiation signalling and disease_progression several useful algorithms have been developed to identify bimodal genes from microarray_data currently no method can deal with data from next_generation which is emerging as a replacement technology for microarrays results we present siber systematic identification of bimodally expressed genes using rnaseq_data for effectively identifying bimodally expressed genes from next generation rnaseq_data we evaluate several candidate methods for modelling rnaseq count_data and compare their performance in identifying bimodal genes through both simulation and real_data analysis we show that the lognormal mixture_model performs best in terms of power and robustness under various scenarios we also compare our method with alternative_approaches including profile analysis using clustering and kurtosis pack and cancer outlier profile analysis copa our method is robust powerful invariant to shifting and scaling has no blind spots and has a sample_size free interpretation availability the r package siber is available at the websitegene expression at the messenger_rna level frequently operates in two modes baseline and underexpression or overexpression although the underlying_mechanisms driving these two modes of expression bimodal expression hereafter may be different e g cis_trans regulation dna_copy change microrna regulation dna_methylation transcription_factor activity and so on the impact of bimodal expression is critical to cell functioning for instance tissue_specific expression for certain genes is needed for cell_differentiation the maintenance and regulation of bimodal expression is essential to cell_signalling the change of expression mode especially for oncogenes and tumour suppressors can lead to uncontrolled cell_proliferation and malignant cancer because of its importance systematic identification of bimodally expressed genes has received great attention especially in cancer research various methods have been proposed during the past_decade current methods can be put into two categories non parametric and normal mixture_models for example cancer outlier profile analysis copa is a nonparametric method to search explicitly for genes with outlier expression_patterns specifically the expression of each gene is standardized by its median and scaled with its median absolute deviation and then ranked by a pre specified quantile i e or of the transformed_data they applied copa to datasets studying a variety of cancers and discovered that the fusion of erg and etv was overexpressed in of prostate_cancer patients methods in the second category postulate a mixture of normal_distributions for gene_expression levels for example the profile analysis using clustering and kurtosis pack proposed byfirst filters unimodal genes with bic and then ranks bimodal genes using negative kurtosis ranking with positive kurtosis is also possible but could be dominated by outliers this method was later applied to identify bimodally expressed genes with expression status linked to breast cancer_prognosis another method proposed by is based on the likelihood_ratio lrt and uses a distribution with six degrees_of as the null_distribution to obtain p values of lrt statistics this method was applied to identify bimodal genes from diverse tissue_types in mouse more recently proposed a new definition of a bimodality index bi this method calculates the bi for each gene from the estimated parameters of a two component normal mixture_model and then ranks the genes by bi one attractive feature of this method is that bi has an intuitive interpretation as it is derived from a sample_size the bi method was later applied to show that melanoma antigen family a defined a subset of triple_negative that might benefit from immune augmentation despite their success all of these methods with the exception of copa are designed for microarray_data under the assumption of normal_distributions with next_generation ngs emerging as a replacement technology for microarrays to whom correspondence should be addressed it is important to develop valid methods for identifying bimodally expressed genes from ngs_data rnaseq_data unlike microarray_data consists of read_counts mapped to each gene in practice some investigators may treat the rnaseq_data the same as microarray_data after some transformation e g log or boxcox but the validity of such an approach has never been investigated special_attention may be required because of the discrete nature of rnaseq_data current methods for analysing rnaseq_data for differential_expression rely on generalized poisson or negative_binomial distributions rather than normal_distributions in this article we propose a class of generalized bimodality indices in the framework of mixture_models including mixtures of negative_binomial generalized poisson or log normal_distributions we also formally investigate the performance of navenave methods using copa and pack which treat rnaseq_data as equivalent to microarray_data after some transformation the remainder of this article is organized as follows in section we describe several discrete models for dealing with rnaseq_data and define the generalized bi that can be used for various mixture modelling we also discuss rnaseq library normalization in the context of mixture modelling we present simulation_results in section where three different models are evaluated and compared with alternative_approaches including copa and pack in section we analyse data from the cancer_genome tcga that further confirms the effectiveness of the generalized bi in identifying bimodal genes from rnaseq_data in this article we have proposed and compared three mixture_models for systematic identification of bimodally expressed genes all models are designed to deal explicitly with the discrete nature of rnaseq_data our method follows the ideas inby first modelling the data through a twocomponent mixture coupled with computing the bi from the mixture fit that prioritizes bimodally expressed genes which have a large distance between the two modes and sufficient samples in each mode we extended the previous definition of bi so that it can be applied to a mixture of unequal variance and mixture of discrete distributions our definition of bi was motivated by sample_size the resulting formula is intuitive and easily_interpretable bi rewards balanced allocation of the samples into two components as it is largest when and large distance between the two modes as defined by the derivation through sample_size paved the road for computing bi under other mixture distributions or a mixture with unequal variance here we proved that the generalized bi applies to mixture of discrete distributions such as negative_binomial and generalized poisson in such cases the bi formula is an approximation to the exact formula which does not have a closed form our simulation shows there is only minimum power_loss in this approximation for other mixtures such as a mixture of t distributions the bi formula still applies it is also possible to derive a nonparametric version of bi as done in in all cases the resulting bi formula is invariant under shifting and scaling which is an appealing feature among the three models proposed the ln model performs best in both simulation and real_data analysis under the correctly specified model all three models perform similarly however both the nb and gp models are highly_sensitive to model_misspecification in comparison the ln model is robust our analysis of brca rnaseq_data further demonstrated the superior_performance of the ln model applying the method of boxcox showed that a log transformation is optimal for the majority of genes for manually_curated unimodal genes the optimal transformation was always log transformation in terms of recovering unimodal and bimodal genes that had been manually selected based on available microarray_data the ln model provided much better performance auc versus and at first it may be a little surprising that such a simple transformation performs so well in practice however all microarray_data are already log_transformed before any formal analysis inherently this might be because of the nature of mrna_abundance level in the cell it remains_an whether the lognormal model also performs well in other tasks such as differential_expression for rnaseq_data comparisons with date of methods for differential_expression in rnaseq have focused on the negative_binomial and generalized poisson_models the nature of the two tasks
