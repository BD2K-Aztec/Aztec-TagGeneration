metaquery a web_server for rapid annotation and quantitative analysis of specific genes in the human_gut microbiome researchers frequently want to know how abundant a particular microbial gene or pathway is across different human_hosts including its association with disease and its co occurrence with other genes or microbial_taxa with thousands of publicly_available metagenomes these questions should be easy to answer however computational barriers prevent most researchers from conducting such analyses we address this problem with metaquery a web_application for rapid and quantitative analysis of specific genes in the human_gut the user inputs one or more query genes and our software returns the estimated abundance of these genes across publicly_available fecal metagenomes from american european and chinese_individuals in addition our application performs downstream statistical_analyses to identify features that are associated with gene variation including other query genes i e gene co variation taxa clinical_variables e g inflammatory_bowel and diabetes and average genome_size the speed and accessibility of metaquery are a step toward democratizing metagenomics research which should allow many researchers to query the abundance and variation of specific genes in the human_gut availability_and http metaquery a number of large_scale shotgun metagenomics projects have been made publicly_available enabling researchers to investigate the functional composition of microbial_communities from the human_body and how microbial functions correlate with disease or other traits a common_goal of many microbiome_studies is to quantify the abundance of specific genes across these publicly_available datasets in most cases this task involves downloading metagenomes from public_repositories mapping reads to a reference_database and estimating gene abundances for example this was the approach used byto estimate the abundance of biosynthetic_gene in the human_microbiome however this approach is timeconsuming and computationally demandingrequiring large_amounts of storage space and processing powerand is therefore not practical for many research groups in an attempt to address_this several microbiome_studies have made their functional_annotations publicly_available for example the human_microbiome
