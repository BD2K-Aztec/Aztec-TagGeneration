rapid membrane_protein topology prediction state of the art methods for topology of helical membrane_proteins are based on the use of time consuming multiple_sequence obtained from psi_blast or other sources here we examine if it is possible to use the consensus of topology prediction_methods that are based on single sequences to obtain a similar accuracy as the more accurate multiple sequence_based here we show that topcons single performs better than any of the other topology prediction_methods tested here but worse than the best method that is utilizing multiple_sequence availability_and topcons single is available as a web_server from http single topcons net and is also included for local installation from the web_site in addition consensus based topology predictions for the entire international protein index ipi is available from the web_server and will be updated at regular intervals today only unique helical membrane protein_structures are known according to the orientation of proteins in membranes database opm http opm phar umich edu the topology of such proteins has proven to be a convenient concept in essence the topology specifies the number of transmembrane_helices of the protein together with the location of the n_terminal end of the chain i e whether it is in the cytosol in or in the endoplamsatic reticulum er lumen or extramembrane space out the topcons algorithm computes consensus predictions of membrane_protein topology using a hidden_markov hmm and input from several topology predictors the original method is available as a web_server http topcons net and is based on five state of the art topology prediction_methods and typically takes a couple of minutes to run the bulk of that time is spent running a psi blast_search against a sequence database to obtain evolutionary_information that is then used by the underlying predictors this approach is quite accurate but woefully inappropriate when running predictions for many sequences e g in studies of whole genomes homology reduced to sequence_identity the numbers in parenthesis denote the number of protein_sequences in the set time is the time it takes to process the set of protein_sequences page we have implemented a reliability score for topcons single as previously described and also a reliability score for each individual method as previously described definitions and descriptions of all reliability scores are listed in the supplementary_material we investigated the reliability scores by ranking the predictions by descending reliability score and plotting the fraction of correct predictions against the coverage in the all benchmark_dataset
