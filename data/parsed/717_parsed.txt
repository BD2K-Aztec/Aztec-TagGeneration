bioinformatics message from the iscb beyond the proteome mass_spectrometry special interest group ms sig at ismb eccb ms sig organizers downloaded from mass_spectrometry special interest group ms sig aims to bring together experts from the global research_community to discuss highlights and challenges in the field of mass spectrom etry ms based proteomics and computational_biology the rapid technological_developments in ms based proteomics have enabled the generation of a large amount of meaningful_information on hundreds to thousands of proteins simultaneously from a biological_sample however the complexity of the ms data require sophisticated computational algorithms and software for data analysis and interpretation this years ms sig meeting theme was beyond the proteome with major focuses on improving protein identification quantification and using proteomics_data to solve interesting problems in systems_biology and clinical research improving protein identification quantification we as the proteomics community need to effectively convey the confidence_levels in the ms measurements of protein_abundance and the subsequent presentation of protein_quantitation the lack of correlation often found between studies of the proteome and transcriptome can create a perception challenge that prote omics_data might not be accurate and thus it is important to develop and apply rigorous computational_methods for protein_quantitation besides identifying all proteins in a biological complex is an ongoing challenge the first session was dedicated to the current_developments in these areas at the session avinash shanmugam described a strategy to use rnaseq abundance values and gpmdb protein observation frequencies to adjust the confidence_level of protein identification and to improve protein identification christoph schaab addressed the issues of controlling false_positive identification when combining multiple ms datasets in terms of protein quan tification mikhail savitski introduced quantification quality_scores based on the local slope of the aligned retention_times for label_free approach for tandem mass tag tmt labeled data he presented methods to identify signal to interfering peak ratios and suggested filtering the quantification results based on these quality_scores to improve the quantification accuracy working with data independent spectral acquisition olga vitek proposed linear_models with an optimal subset of fragments to improve quantification accuracy in this emerging data type so young ryu developed stochastic censored regression considering informative missing peptide intensities and unbalanced total number of quantified peptides across experiments proteomics in systems_biology and medicine a critical facet of proteomics is the experimental hypotheses being explored the second session of the workshop focused on translating computational improvements to wet bench biological_research many biological_problems require measuring multiple types of molecules and currently a major_challenge is how to effectively integrate proteomics_data with other omics_data such as transcriptomics and metabolomics_data moreover there is an unmet need in systems_biology and medicine to expand proteomics beyond protein_quantitation and begin to systematically assay post_translational of protein e g phosphorylation in combining protein and mrna measurements to study cir cadian pattern of mouse_liver jurgenjurgen cox showed that only one third of cycling proteins are not accompanied by significant cycling of mrna thus relying on post_translational david gibbs explored methods for integrating transcriptome and proteome data for use with biological_networks tieliu shi expanded the human_proteome by mining large collections of ms and sequencing_data using chemicalcross linking ms lars malmstrommalmstrom characterized proteins from the human pathogen streptococcus_pyogenes which play_a in the infection process with top_down proteomics julia chamot rooke characterized novel post_translational that regulate infection by neisseria meningitides software and data standard availability the computational ms community is beginning to invest in community tools and standards this will facilitate an explosion of ideas that are interoperable and comparable frameworks for creating workflows and format standards will make this an exciting place for computational exploration throughout the workshop were talks about software data standards and data_repositories to demonstrate how increased compatibility benefits the community oliver kohlbacher presented the openms topp
