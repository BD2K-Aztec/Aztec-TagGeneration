efficient identification of identical by descent status in pedigrees with many untyped individuals motivation inference of identical by descent ibd probabilities is the key in family based linkage_analysis using high_density snp markers one can almost always infer haplotype configurations of each member in a family given all individuals being typed consequently the ibd status can be obtained directly from haplotype configurations however in reality many family_members are not typed due to practical reasons the problem of ibd haplotype inference is much harder when treating untyped individuals as missing results we present a novel hidden_markov hmm approach to infer the ibd status in a pedigree with many untyped members using high_density markers we introduce the concept of inheritance generating function defined for any pair of alleles in a descent graph_based on a pedigree structure we derive a recursive formula for efficient calculation of the inheritance generating function by aggregating all possible inheritance patterns via an explicit representation of the number and lengths of all possible paths between two alleles the inheritance generating function provides a convenient way to theoretically derive the transition_probabilities of the hmm we further extend the basic hmm to incorporate population linkage_disequilibrium ld pedigree wise ibd_sharing can be constructed based on pair_wise ibd relationships compared with traditional approaches for linkage_analysis our new model can efficiently infer ibd status without enumerating all possible genotypes and transmission_patterns of untyped members in a family our approach can be reliably applied on large_pedigrees with many untyped members and the inferred ibd status can be used for non parametric genome_wide as one important type of gene mapping_approach family based linkage_analysis has shown tremendous success in identifying genes underlying mendelian_diseases with the development of new genotyping technologies there have been two distinct_features arising in new datasets both the number of genetic_markers mostly single_nucleotide snps and the number of untyped individuals within a pedigree have increased drastically traditional linkage methods are exponential either in terms of the number of markers or in terms of the size of a pedigree landergreen therefore cannot efficiently deal with new data the problem is much harder for families with many untyped individuals even later approaches relying on heuristic_search or using various search_space reduction techniques cannot solve the problem furthermore for tightly_linked markers the original assumption of linkage equilibrium between markers does not hold anymore address this problem by partitioning a chromosome into small segments and assume that there is no recombination within each segment and snps in different segments are in linkage equilibrium however by uniformly partitioning chromosomes into segments with a fixed segment length their approach cannot handle segments with recombinations in addition they basically implement the lander green algorithm which enumerates all inheritance patterns therefore their approach cannot handle large_pedigrees also address linkage_disequilibrium ld for tightly liked markers by modeling founder haplotypes as a markov_chain however their method is mainly for nuclear family data with two offsprings recently we have demonstrated that with high_density data i we can infer recombination breakpoints with high_precision ii our algorithm can efficiently infer haplotypes and inheritance patterns for large_pedigrees and iii in most cases inheritance can be uniquely determined for large_pedigrees with large number of snps experimental_results show that our approach is highly_efficient and can also tolerate high missing rates however if there are individuals in the pedigree that are completely untyped our approach still needs to enumerate all transmission_patterns and genotypes involving these untyped individuals which may end up searching an exponentially large solution_space in this article we address the key problem in linkage_analysis using high_density snps and large_pedigrees with many untyped members ibd inference between any pair of typed members within a pedigree by proposing a novel hidden_markov hmm based_approach our approach is fundamentally different from the landergreen algorithm although both are based on hmms landergreen algorithm only models the parentchild relationship and it has to take into account every possible transmission pattern between a parentchild pair instead our approach can directly model relationships between any pair of relatives in our model the hidden_states are the ibd number between the pair at each locus and the observable data are the numbers of alleles that are identical bystate ibs between the pair unlike the landergreen algorithm the probability of identical by discent ibd change between two markers for a given pair not only depends on the marker interval distance but also depends on the type of relationship of the pair more precisely the transition_probabilities depend on all possible cases that how recombination_events might occur between the two markers when the pair inherits their genes from their common_ancestors within the pedigree to derive the transition_probabilities between any types of relationships we introduce the inheritancegenerating function which can conveniently aggregate all possible inheritance patterns between their common_ancestors and this pair of individuals actually our definition of the inheritance generating function can explicitly list the number of all possible inheritance paths and their lengths between a pair of alleles we also propose an efficient recursive approach to calculate the function the transition_probabilities can then be theoretically derived based on the number and lengths of all inheritance paths emission probabilities can be derived based on their definitions they only depend on population allele_frequencies and genotyping error_rates but do not depend on the type of relationship between a pair we first define our hmm for a pair of alleles based on this basic model we build the model for a pair of individuals we further extend the model to incorporate population ld or background sharing beyond a pedigree finally pedigree wise ibd_sharing can be constructed based on pairwise_ibd relationships compared with traditional approaches for linkage_analysis i e elstonstewart and landergreen algorithms our algorithm is essentially quadratic in terms of the number of typed individuals and linear in terms of the number of markers more importantly our new model can efficiently infer ibd status without enumerating all possible genotypes and transmission_patterns of untyped members in a family given the fact that most existing family data using high_density snp_chips consist of many untyped individuals our approach provides an efficient alternative to perform genome_wide we evaluate our approach using small_nuclear families large multi generation pedigrees as well as simulated_data experimental_results show that for siblings with untyped parents which corresponds to a saving of of total genotyping costs our approach has successfully recovered of ibd changing points i e recombination breakpoints with false_positives we also construct the ibd_sharing map of seven typed members in a pedigree of size simulation using this pedigree structure shows that for different types of pairwise relationships our approach can recover ibd changing points with high_precision while at the same time keeping the false_positive low in experiments on two other big pedigrees size and our method maintains a locus by locus ibd inference error_rate comparisons with merlin show that our algorithm is both more accurate and more efficient in identifying ibd_sharing traditional linkage_analysis models the transition of inheritance vectors from one locus to another as a complex multiple state markov_chain and derive the probability of ibd_sharing given the current_density of snp markers the inheritance pattern of a pedigree can usually be fixed by applying the mendelian law of inheritance which basically means that one can almost observe ibd_sharing states however the use of mendelian law requires that all or most members of a family should be genotyped which is not practical for studies involving large_pedigrees to avoid enumerating the genotypes of the untyped members we extract the inheritance information between two individuals by tracing all possible inheritance paths between them by doing so we can directly model the ibd_sharing status between any pair of individuals without considering the actual transmission across their ancestors from the pairwise_ibd relationship we can build the global ibd_sharing map of the whole pedigree for genotyped members we use our method to infer the recombination positions in nuclear families with two siblings our method detects of the recombination positions and has false_positive reports experiments on large_pedigrees show that the method is accurate in identifying ibd and non ibd boundaries in both closely and distantly_related individuals we further incorporate the bg ibd state into our hmm_model to deal with background ld between markers by adjusting the background ibd level we can tune the sensitivity_and of the method accordingly regardless long segments of pedigree ibd_sharing are always safely recovered in most cases we also compare our algorithm with merlin and it shows that our method has both better accuracy and efficiency by partitioning the chromosome into regions of different inheritance patterns we can generate statistics for assessing the linkage of a chromosomal_region with the disease based on the inferred ibd we will further incorporate linkage_analysis into our model
