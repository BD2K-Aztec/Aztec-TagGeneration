automated workflows for accurate_mass based putative metabolite_identification in lc_ms derived metabolomic datasets motivation the study of metabolites metabolomics is increasingly_being to investigate microbial plant environmental and mammalian_systems one of the limiting_factors is that of chemically identifying metabolites from mass_spectrometric signals present in complex datasets results three workflows have been developed to allow for the rapid automated and high_throughput annotation and putative metabolite_identification of electrospray lc_ms derived metabolomic datasets the collection of workflows are defined as putmedid lcms and perform feature annotation matching of accurate m z to the accurate_mass of neutral molecules and associated molecular_formula and matching of the molecular formulae to a reference file of metabolites the software is independent of the instrument and data pre_processing applied the number_of is reduced by eliminating the inaccurate matching of many artifact isotope multiply charged and complex adduct peaks through complex interrogation of experimental_data availability the workflows standard_operating and further information are publicly_available at http www mcisb org resources putmedid html contact systems_biology is applied to study the components of and more importantly their complex interactions in biological_systems one set of components which are studied in systems_biology investigations are metabolites either by targeted or holistic profiling experimental strategies low_molecular inorganic and organic metabolites play_important in the to whom correspondence should be addressed operation and maintenance of biological_systems the study of metabolites metabolomics is increasingly_being to investigate microbial plant environmental and mammalian_systems many studies follow a hypothesis generating or inductive strategy and start from a small and known subset of biological_knowledge valid experiments are designed to acquire robust and reproducible data on a wide_range of different metabolites and metabolite classes from carefully_selected samples subsequent data analysis procedures define the metabolic differences associated with a biological change related to genotype biological perturbation or environmental intervention for example drug_therapy these studies employ a metabolic_profiling strategy to detect a wide_range of but not all metabolites from numerous biochemical classes to obtain maximum metabolic information rapidly this strategy provides the detection of hundreds_or of metabolites however due to the diverse range of chemical_and and the wide concentration range of metabolites within the metabolome no single analytical technology can provide the non biased quantitative detection of all metabolites in a biological system metabolic_profiling provides semi_quantitative data typically as chromatographic peak_areas rather than absolute quantitation where metabolite_concentrations would be reported mass_spectrometry ms and nuclear_magnetic nmr have been widely_employed and provide complementary roles chromatography ms techniques provide advantages for these highly complex biological_samples and include gas_chromatography gc_ms liquid_chromatography lc_ms and lc derivatives including ultra_performance uplc ms capillary_electrophoresis ms and lc_ms apply electrospray_ionization direct_infusion mass_spectrometry dims can also be applied though lacks the chromatographic_separation of
