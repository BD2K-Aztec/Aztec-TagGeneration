robust unmixing of tumor states in array_comparative data motivation tumorigenesis is an evolutionary_process by which tumor_cells acquire sequences of mutations leading to increased growth invasiveness and eventually metastasis it is hoped that by identifying the common patterns of mutations underlying major cancer sub types we can better understand the molecular basis of tumor development and identify new diagnostics and therapeutic_targets this goal has motivated several attempts to apply evolutionary tree reconstruction methods to assays of tumor state inference of tumor evolution is in principle aided by the fact that tumors are heterogeneous retaining remnant populations of different stages along their development along with contaminating healthy cell_populations in practice though this heterogeneity complicates interpretation of tumor data because distinct cell_types are conflated by common methods for assaying the tumor state we previously_proposed a method to computationally infer cell_populations from measures of tumor wide gene_expression through a geometric interpretation of mixture type separation but this approach deals poorly with noisy and outlier data results in the present work we propose a new method to perform tumor mixture separation efficiently and robustly to an experimental_error the method builds on the prior geometric approach but uses a novel objective_function allowing for robust fits that greatly_reduces the sensitivity to noise and outliers we further develop an efficient gradient optimization method to optimize this soft geometric unmixing objective for measurements of tumor dna_copy assessed by array_comparative acgh data we show on a combination of semi_synthetic and real_data that the method yields fast and accurate separation of tumor states conclusions we have shown a novel objective_function and optimization method for the robust separation of tumor sub types from acgh data and have shown that the method provides fast accurate reconstruction of tumor states from mixed_samples better solutions to this problem can be expected to improve our ability to accurately identify genetic_abnormalities in primary tumor_samples and to infer patterns of tumor evolution contact genomic studies have dramatically improved our understanding of the biology of tumor_formation and treatment in part this has been accomplished by harnessing tools that profile the genes and proteins in tumor_cells revealing previously indistinguishable tumor_subtypes that are likely to exhibit distinct sensitivities to treatment methods as these tumor sub types are uncovered it becomes possible to develop novel therapeutics more specifically targeted to the particular genetic_defects that cause each cancer while recent_advances have had a profound impact on our understanding of the tumor_biology the limits of our understanding of the molecular nature of cancer obstruct the burgeoning efforts in targeted_therapeutics development these limitations are apparent in the high failure_rate of the discovery pipeline for novel cancer_therapeutics as well as in the continuing difficulty of predicting which patients will respond to a given therapeutic a striking example is the fact that traztuzumab the targeted therapeutic developed to treat her amplified breast_cancers is ineffective in many patients who have her overexpressing tumors and yet effective in some who do not furthermore sub types typically remain poorly definede g the basal like breast_cancer sub type for which different studies have inferred very distinct_genetic signatures and yet many patients do not fall into any known sub type our belief then is that clinical treatment of cancer will reap considerable benefit from the identification of new cancer sub types and genetic signatures one promising approach for better elucidating the common mutational patterns by which tumors develop is to recognize that tumor development is an evolutionary_process and apply phylogenetic_methods to tumor data to reveal these evolutionary_relationships much of the work on tumor evolution models flows from the seminal efforts ofon inferring oncogenetic trees from array_comparative acgh profiles of tumor_cells the strength of this model stems from the extraction of ancestral structure from many probe sites per tumor potentially utilizing measurements of the expression or copy_number changes across the entire_genome however this comes at the cost of overlooking the diversity of cell_populations within tumors which can provide_important to tumor_progression but are conflated with one another in tissue wide assays such as acgh page i i i we have developed a novel method for unmixing acgh data to infer copy_number profiles of distinct cell states from tumor_samples the method uses soft geometric unmixing to provide superior tolerance to experimental_noise and outliers compared to the prior work we have further developed an efficient gradient based optimization_algorithm for this objective_function we have shown through tests on simulated_data that the soft unmixing approach dramatically i
