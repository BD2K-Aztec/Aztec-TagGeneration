fast and accurate approximate inference of transcript_expression from rna_seq motivation assigning rna_seq to their transcript of origin is a fundamental task in transcript_expression estimation where ambiguities in assignments exist due to transcripts sharing sequence e g alternative isoforms or alleles the problem can be solved through probabilistic_inference bayesian_methods have been shown to provide accurate transcript_abundance estimates compared with competing_methods however exact bayesian_inference is intractable and approximate_methods such as markov_chain and variational bayes vb are typically used while providing a high degree of accuracy and modelling flexibility standard implementations can be prohibitively slow for large_datasets and complex transcriptome annotations results we propose a novel approximate inference scheme based on vb and apply it to an existing model of transcript_expression inference from rna_seq recent_advances in vb algorith mics are used to improve the convergence of the algorithm beyond the standard variational bayes expectation_maximization we apply our algorithm to simulated and biological_datasets demonstrating a significant increase in speed with only very small loss in accuracy of expression_level estimation we carry out a comparative_study against seven popular alternative_methods and demonstrate that our new algorithm provides excellent accuracy and inter replicate consistency while remaining competitive in computation time availability_and the methods were implemented in r and c and are available as part of the bitseq project at github com bitseq the method is also available through the bitseq bioconductor_package the source_code to reproduce all simulation_results can be accessed via github com bitseq bitseqvb benchmarking rna_seq is a technology with the potential to identify and quantify all mrna_transcripts in a biological_sample some of these transcripts come from different isoforms or alleles of the same genes or from closely_related homologous_genes and consequently they may share much of their primary sequence currently popular rna_seq technologies generate short_reads that must be aligned to the genome or transcriptome to quantify v c the author published_by
