genetics_and disease_gene by integration of d gene_expression and transcription_factor binding_affinities motivation the computational evaluation of candidate_genes for hereditary disorders is a non trivial task several excellent methods for disease gene prediction have been developed in the past_decades exploiting widely differing data_sources to infer disease_relevant functional_relationships between candidate_genes and disorders we have shown recently that spatially mapped i e d gene_expression data from the mouse_brain can be successfully used to prioritize_candidate for human mendelian_disorders of the central_nervous results we improved our previous work fold i we demonstrate that condition independent transcription_factor binding_affinities of the candidate_genes promoters are relevant for disease gene prediction and can be integrated with our previous approach to significantly enhance its predictive_power and ii we define a novel similarity meas uretermed relative_intensity overlapfor both d gene_expression and binding_affinity profiles that better exploits their disease relevant_information content finally we present novel disease gene predictions for eight loci associated with different syndromes of unknown molecular basis that are characterized by mental_retardation contact r piro dkfz de oralthough experimental methodologies for the identification of disease_causing have significantly improvedin particular by the recently_introduced next_generation techniquescomputational approaches to an in silico evaluation of candidate_genes remain an important aid for the identification of genes involved in human hereditary disorders a large variety of computational_methods have been developed for this purpose exploiting various data_sources ranging from medline_abstracts functional gene_annotation proteinprotein_interactions and high_throughput to intrinsic gene or protein properties such as coding sequence_length number of introns conservation and so forth for more information on available disease gene prediction_tools and methods we refer to some recent_reviews to a large extent cellular_homeostasis depends on coordinated gene_expression both in space and time gene_expression determines where and when the molecular_function of a gene_product is exerted for this reason gene_expression have been successfully exploited by several computational disease gene prediction_methods in our previous work we have shown that the high_resolution d gene_expression provided by the allen institutes mouse_brain atlas mba can be used to successfully prioritize not only candidate_genes for mouse phenotypes but also for human mendelian_disorders of the central_nervous cns briefly we prioritized the candidate_genes from a mapped orphan locus of a disease phenotype with unknown molecular basis by comparing their d gene_expression to those of a set of reference genes known to be involved in similar disease_phenotypes the condition and sample dependency of gene_expression constitutes a desired feature for the prediction of functional_relationships between genes a complementary view and hence additional clues to gene_functions may instead be provided by condition independent regulatory information obtained from promoter analysis classically position frequency matrices pfms or their associated position_weight pwms that describe transcription_factor tf_binding are used to scan promoters for short often degenerate regulatory_elements in many cases genome_wide pwm scans require stringent_criteria to limit the false_discovery and to yield an acceptable specificity this can lead to reduced sensitivity and likely misses low_affinity binding_sites which have been shown to be abundant and functional in vivo an alternative approach builds on the notion of an overall likelihood that a promoter is bound by a given tf without requiring the identification of one or more well defined regulatory_elements thus better reflecting the thermodynamic nature of tf_binding for this purpose a total binding_affinity tba for the tfs pfm can be calculated over the entire promoter taking_into the collective contribution of potential high and low_affinity binding_sites without strictly drawing a line between binding and non binding_sites in a recent study we showed tba to be predictive of tfbinding events as revealed by chip_chip and chip_seq here we introduce the notion of tf_binding co affinity of a pair of genes that we compute from the genes tba profiles composed of their binding_affinities for a core_set of tfs we show that these co affinities can decipher the disease relevance of candidate_genes for human hereditary disorders and further improve the predictive_power by developing a new similarity measure termed relative_intensity overlap rio we combine this approach with the prioritization based on spatially mapped i e d gene_expression applying it to several disorders of unknown molecular basis characterized by mental_retardation mr regulatory information from pwm scans has previously been used as an additional information_source in a number of candidate_gene methods however because of the stringent_criteria that are often necessary to decide whether a specific dna_segment is a binding_site leading to reduced sensitivity and a likely disregard of possibly functional low_affinity binding_sites it is unlikely that information from pwm scans alone would be suitable for disease_gene likewise the benefit of more comprehensive tba profiles is not immediately clear and has previously not been explored on a large_scale although gene function can often be inferred from primary coding_sequences deciphering functional properties exclusively from non coding_sequences is much more difficult carroll mutations in coding_exons only the transcription_factor etv but no abnormalities were found interestingly we found etv as the second best candidate however although it is in principle possible that mutations affecting its regulatory_regions may be responsible for the phenotype this seems unlikely on the basis of the available functional information indeed etv loss of function has been shown to affect the maintenance of spermatogonial_stem and kidney_development whereas etv overexpression has been linked to ovarian_cancer the only top candidate that has been linked to an mr related disorder is mccc mutations of which are known to be responsible for methylcrotonyl coa carboxylase deficiency which is characterized by multiple clinical_features one of which can be mr alopecia however is generally not a feature of the disease although a possible association has been reported in a single case however as a particular strength of the predictive method that we present here is an extrapolation of functional_relationships from reference genes to candidate_genes thatrelying on gene_expression and sequence_information alonedo not require any known functional_annotation less obvious candidates could nonetheless be associated with the disorder the first candidate clcn encodes a voltage_gated chloride_channel previously implicated in idiopathic generalized epilepsies dcun d ranking third is another interesting candidate because a polymorphism has been identified as a risk_factor in frontotemporal_lobar also dvl ranking forth is of particular interest because the protein it encodes interacts with shank which is involved in several neuronal disorders including mr best candidates for orphan loci from omim associated with autosomal and x
