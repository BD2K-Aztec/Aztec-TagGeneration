structure based prediction of transcription_factor binding_specificity using an integrative energy function transcription_factors tfs regulate_gene through binding to specific target dna sites accurate annotation of transcription_factor tfbss at genome_scale represents an essential step toward our understanding of gene_regulation networks in this article we present a structure based method for computational_prediction of tfbss using a novel integrative energy ie function the new energy function combines a multibody mb knowledge based potential and two atomic energy_terms hydrogen_bond and p interaction that might not be accurately captured by the knowledge based potential owing to the mean force nature and low count problem we applied the new energy function to the tfbs_prediction using a non redundant dataset that consists of tfs from different families our results show that the new ie function improves the prediction_accuracy over the knowledge based statistical_potentials especially for homeodomain tfs the second largest tf family in mammals transcription_factors tfs regulate_gene by interacting with specific dna_sequences called transcription_factor tfbss identification of tfbss on a genomic_scale a crucial step in genomic annotation and in deciphering transcription regulatory_networks remains_a in post genomic bioinformatics with the rapid increase of available genomic_data effective sequence_based for tfbs predictions have been developed however one issue of sequence_based is the high number of false_positive especially when the binding signal is weak or the tfs dna binding_site is significantly different from the consensus_sequence structure based prediction_methods on the other hand focus on proteindna_interactions rather than sequence_conservation therefore they are not constrained by sequence_information these prediction_methods mimic real binding and recognition_events because specific binding between a tf and its binding_sites in the cell relies on biophysical interactions whereas the sequence_based and experimental_technologies can identify the genome binding_site locations and binding_site sequences structure based_methods can also explain why and how these tfs bind at these locations and sequences moreover understanding the mechanisms and effects of mutations on gene_expression and diseases can guide rational_design of therapeutic_agents although research on protein dna_recognition began in the s structure based_methods for prediction of tfbss were not developed until years_ago when the high_resolution protein_structures became available in the protein_data pdb one of the major_issues in structure based tfbs_prediction is the scoring_function for evaluating binding_affinity or binding_energy between proteins and dna there are two major types of energy_functions for studying proteindna_interactions the physics based molecular_mechanics force_fields and the knowledge based statistical_potentials physics based energy_functions consist of physicochemical interactions including electrostatic_interactions van_der vdw forces solvation_energy and others these physics based potentials rely on approximations and often assume fixed charges they have been applied to proteindna_interaction studies with some success besides the general terms such as vdw and electrostatic_interactions that include hydrogen_bonds p cation and pp interactions have also been studied in proteindna recognition it was previously_thought that these interactions have a primary role in establishing the stability of the proteindna complexes but new data suggest that these interactions may have a bigger role in proteindnawe applied the new ie function to the prediction of tfbss using the non redundant dataset of tfdna complex structures and compared the prediction with mb potential and ddna a knowledgebased atomic_level proteindna_interaction potential five examples of the predicted tf_binding and the corresponding jaspar motifs are shown in all predicted motifs are available in supplementary we also applied three different quantitative methods chi_square akl divergence and euclidean_distance to compare the prediction_accuracy as described in section the lower the akl divergence value the more is the similarity between the predicted pwms and jaspar pwms shows the results based on akl divergence to demonstrate the similarity between the predicted pwms and the reference jaspar pwms results from the other two methods areprotein structure and function i consistent with the akl divergence results data not shown as shown in ie outperforms both mb and ddna or at least one of them in the majority of the cases for example am a and puf b there are three cases where ie performs worse than mb and or ddna such as bf a and uzk a in several cases the prediction_accuracies are similar among all three energy_functions for example dsz a to check if the overall improvements are statistically_significant we performed wilcoxon_signed to compare the predictions between ie and mb as well as between ie and ddna based on the predicted similarity to jaspar pwms the null_hypothesis is that prediction_accuracy of the ie method is equal or worse than the mb or ddna method whereas the alternative hypothesis is that the prediction_accuracy of the ie method is better than mb and ddna the p values for the three comparison metrics chisquare akl divergence and euclidian distance are and between ie and mb predictions and and between ie and ddna respectively suggesting that the improvements are statistically_significant zinc_fingers and homeodomains represent the two largest and extensively_studied tf families in our non redundant dataset we found six zinc_finger chains and three homeodomains zinc_fingers usually function as a dimer or multimers a single zinc_finger typically contains three to four conserved recognition bases three of the six zinc_finger cases llm c drp a and f m a show better binding_site using the ie function whereas the other three have no significant differences dsz a hn a and iqr a figs and homeodomains are the second largest tf family each homeodomain recognizes a variation of the typical taat core binding_site there were three homeodomains in the non redundant dataset shows the predicted binding_motifs and significant_improvement in prediction_accuracy when using the ie function over the mb and ddna statistical_potentials the quantitative improvement is shown in in all three cases predictions using the ie consistently outperform both mb and ddna potentials homeodomain is a well studied highly_conserved structural_domain for dna_binding as we have a relatively large number of high_quality homeodomaindna complex structures in the pdb and a large number of experimentally_derived homeodomain binding_motifs we generated a larger dataset of homeodomains by combining the protein_sequence and binding_site similarity asdescribed in section shows the predicted binding_motifs using the ie blue mb red and ddna green energy_functions and their accuracy when compared with the jaspar motifs the data demonstrate that our new ie function can not only accurately_predict the binding_sites of homeodomains with low sequence_identity it can also accurately_predict the binding_sites of homeodomains with high_sequence but with different binding_sites we also used a recently_developed ic weighted pcc method to calculate the correctly_predicted core binding positions pwm columns in the homeodomain dataset persikov and singh suggested that a reference column is correctly_predicted if the ic weighted pcc between the corresponding predicted and reference columns is at least shows that approximately of the core base positions columns are correctly_predicted by the ie function by the mb potential and by the ddna potential the columns predicted by the ie function have a higher correlation to their corresponding jaspar columns than the mb and ddna energy_functions we report here improved accuracy of structure based tf binding_site using an ie function the ie function consists of the mb potential and two atomic terms hydrogen_bond energy and p interaction_energy the mb energy is a residuelevel knowledge based protein_dna potential derived from the mean force theory even though this mb potential implicitly captures biophysical interactions including hydrogen_bonds and p interactions and showed its predictive_power in both tf binding_site and protein dna docking_studies the mean force nature and the typical low count problem limit its ability to accurately capture the key hydrogen_bond and p interactions for example arginine has the ability to form bidentate hydrogen_bonds which allows it to bind specifically to guanine because guanine has two hydrogen acceptors present in the major_groove of dna bidentate hydrogen_bonds are considered key contributors to protein dna binding_specificity in the case of arginine and lysine both can contribute to specific through simple and complex hydrogen_bonding and non specific through electrostatic_interactions interactions however knowledge_based cannot differentiate these two types of interactions therefore adding explicit hydrogen_bond terms can improve the accuracy of tfbs_prediction by distinguishing hydrogen_bonds that contribute to specificity from other interaction_energies we found that adding the explicit hydrogen_bond term to the mb potential improves the tfbs prediction_accuracy of b i b and ic a in the homeodomain dataset as it captures the hydrogen_bonds formed between arginine and lysine respectively and the guanine of the conserved g c base_pair and c protein_structure and function i aromatic_residues can interact with dna through p interactions t shaped p interaction with a base having partial positive_charges in the major_groove can contribute to binding_specificity because of the variations of the electronic landscape of the bases in the major_groove however these interactions are masked owing to the low count problem and the mean force nature in knowledge_based adding an explicit p interaction_term increases the accuracy of tfbs_prediction for example the explicit p interaction_term captures the p interaction formed between tyrosine and the cytosine in the conserved g c pair in rkq a improving the tfbs prediction_accuracy this suggests that the partial positively_charged atoms large blue spheres in of cytosine interact electrostatically with the partial negatively_charged atoms large red spheres in in the aromatic_ring of tyrosine which may contribute to tfdna binding_specificity the ie function shows an overall improvement in tfbs_prediction over other knowledge_based however in several cases in the multi family dataset the ie function does not perform as well as the mb and ddna potentials we investigated the complex structures and performed rigidity tests using first and found that in those cases the amino_acids that interact with the dna were from flexible regions or loops for example in the stat dna complex bf a the residues involved in interacting with dna are on the loops as discussed in the introduction both hydrogen_bonds and p interactions are high_resolution functions that are sensitive to conformational changes for complex structures with highly_flexible regions for dna_contacts there is a large variation of interaction_energies for different conformations of the complex and the structure used for prediction is just a snapshot of multiple possible conformations in addition if a tf structure is not in an ideal docked conformation and the amino_acids do not have favorable torsion_angles to achieve favorable bidentate hydrogen_bonds with the dna then the sensitive physical energies may not help the prediction which is the case in nlw a and uzk a future work will need to incorporate the flexibility information into the prediction process we developed a novel ie function that consists of three components a knowledge based mb potential a hydrogen_bond energy function and an electrostatic_potential for p interaction_energy we applied the new ie function to the prediction of tfbss the results show an overall improvement in binding_site and there is a significant_improvement in predicting binding_sites of homeodomains when compared with the mb and ddna potentials the improved accuracy using the integrative function demonstrates the importance of considering hydrogen_bonds and pinteractions explicitly in structure based tfbs predictions as they are not accurately captured by the knowledge_based
