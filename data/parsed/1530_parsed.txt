gene_expression edgerun an r package for sensitive functionally_relevant differential_expression discovery using an unconditional exact test next_generation for measuring digital expression such as rna_seq are displacing traditional microarray based_methods in biological_experiments the detection of differentially_expressed between groups of biological conditions has led to the development of numerous bioinformatics_tools but so_far few exploit the expanded dynamic range afforded by the new technologies we present edgerun an r package that implements an unconditional exact test that is a more powerful version of the exact test in edger this increase in power is especially pronounced for experiments with as few as two replicates per condition for genes with low total expression and with large biological coefficient of variation in comparison with a panel of other tools edgerun consistently captures functionally_similar differentially_expressed availability_and the package is freely_available under the mit_license from cran http cran r project org_web edgerun next_generation are steadily replacing microarray based_methods for instance transcriptome capture with rna_seq and cage seq capture for the promoterome all of these approaches result in digital expression data where reads or tags are sequenced mapped to the genome and then counted the discrete nature of the data has required the development of new bioinformatics_tools for their analysis that address discrete count_data once the expression has been quantified an important next step is the statistical_significance testing of differential_expression between two or more groups of conditions by the far the simplest and most popular_approach reduces differential_expression to a pairwise_comparison of mean parameters resulting in a fold_change measure of change and a p value to ascertain statistical_significance of the finding to address this problem tools such as edger deseq among many others have been developed and can be applied to any experiment in which digital count_data is produced this vast_array of tool choices can be bewildering for the biologist since it is generally not clear under which conditions a tool is more appropriate than its alternates traditional metrics used when benchmarking methods such as the false_positive and power are useful but limited as they are purely statistical concepts that can only be tested on simulated_data moreover they do not help in determining to what extent methods deliver truly biologically_important genes this is a major_challenge because in the vast_majority of cases we do not know what the true positives_and are in this article we propose a novel metric to determine the number of functionally relevant_genes reported by a differential_expression
