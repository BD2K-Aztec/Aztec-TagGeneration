spectral identification of topological domains motivation topological domains have been proposed as the backbone of interphase chromosome_structure they are regions of high local contact_frequency separated by sharp boundaries genes within a domain often have correlated transcription in this paper we present a computational efficient spectral algorithm to identify topological domains from chromosome conformation data hi c data we consider the genome as a weighted graph with vertices defined by loci on a chromosome and the edge_weights given by interaction frequency between two loci laplacian based graph segmentation is then applied iteratively to obtain the domains at the given compact ness level comparison with algorithms in the literature shows the advantage of the proposed_strategy results an efficient algorithm is presented to identify topological domains from the hi c matrix availability_and the matlab_source and illustrative_examples are available atchromosome conformation capture techniques c c hi c have yielded an unprecedented level of information about genome_organization and many studies are now exploring the relationship between genome_structure and transcription chromosome_conformation studies suggest that eukaryotic_genomes are organized into structures called topological domains or topologically_associating tads topological domains can be defined as linear units of chromatin that fold as discrete three_dimensional d structures tending to favor internal chromatin_interactions a majority of regulatory protein binding_sites localize within topological domains this suggests that sites associated with domain borders represent a functionally different subclass of alleles that delimit regions containing housekeeping_genes and insulator sites detecting the topological domains is thus helpful for studying the relationship between chromosome organization and gene_transcription for additional works on delineating structural_domains see le topological domains can be detected using data from hi c which allows genome_wide identification of chromatin contacts the hi c method probes the d architecture of the whole_genome by coupling proximity based ligation with massively_parallel the hi c data matrix records the contact_frequency between pairs of loci topological domains as regions that have high intra contacts are characterized by diagonal blocks in the hi c matrix to identify topological domains in the authors employed a hidden_markov hmm on the directionally index from a hi c matrix to determine regions initiated by significant downstream chromatin_interactions and terminated by a sequence of significant upstream interactions formulated the identification problem by maximizing the domaintotal reads and introduced a dynamic_programming to solve the problem with a given scale parameter these methods perform analysis on a d read index or on a d image_segmentation subblock and they suffer from sensitivity to initialization e g hmm_model parameter adjustment and high_computational e g dynamic_programming for combinatorial_optimization however these methods do account for the fact that hi c matrices depend on interactions of loci on the genome specifically the largest entries in a hi c matrix define a graph whose vertices are loci in the genome and whose edge_weights are the contact frequencies between loci loci with high contact_frequency are associated with small euclidean_distance in d space identifying fine domain resolution structures such as tads can directly be translated to the problem of segmenting the graph into components with weak interconnections such graph partitioning approaches have been well developed in spectral graph_theory representation of hic data as a graph and the usage of graph_theoretic approaches have also been investigated by while the former uses networks to present its experiment results and the later use graph_theory to discover hubs in chromatin_interaction data neither of them discusses from the point_of of the graph segmentation for chromatin data based on a graph_theoretic interpretation of hi c matrices we propose a simple and mathematically sound algorithm for topological domain discovery based on spectral graph cuts domains at different scales are identified by running the spectral graph cuts algorithm recursively until the connectivity of the graph associated with the domain reaches the level of desired compactness compared with previous_algorithms inand the proposed spectral method has several advantages first the method leads to topological domains that are highly_correlated with gene_transcription second the proposed method admits a unique_solution and does not suffer from the severe initialization sensitivity of the hmm method which is due to the fact that hmm involves an iterative expectationmaximization em_algorithm note that stability with respect to initialization affects the robustness of a method third using the proposed graph connectivity stopping criterion leads to domains with sizes more closely_related to the inherent structure of the region finally the proposed method relates the hi c matrix to the spatial coincidence of loci via a graph and has moderate computational_complexity in the results section the advantages of the algorithm are confirmed on hi c data collected from human fibroblast in this section we illustrate the proposed algorithm and compare it with previously_proposed algorithms the algorithms were first applied to hi c data obtained from human_foreskin from a normal karyotyped male individual fragment contacts were binned to generate hi c matrices at kb resolution the hi c library rna_seq library data_collection and raw_data processingin this paper we presented a method for identifying topological domains based on the spectral decomposition of the graph laplacian of the hi c matrix the proposed algorithm has clear mathematical interpretation and is more computationally_efficient than previous methods allowing it to be applied to higher_resolution hi c data its favorable comparison with other algorithms and its higher correlation with gene_transcription dataillustrate the advantages of the proposed spectral method future work may include investigating fast iterative algorithms or parallel computation algorithms for improving the efficiency at higher resolutions
