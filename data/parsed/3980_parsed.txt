representation and inference of cellular architecture for metabolic reconstruction and modeling motivation metabolic modeling depends on accurately representing the cellular locations of enzyme catalyzed and transport reactions we sought to develop a representation of cellular compart mentation that would accurately capture cellular_location information we further sought a representation that would support automated inference of the cellular_compartments present in newly_sequenced organisms to speed model development and that would enable representing the cellular_compartments present in multiple cell_types within a multicellular_organism results we define the cellular architecture of a unicellular organism or of a cell_type from a multi_cellular organism as the collection of cellular_components it contains plus the topological relationships among those components we developed a tool for inferring cellular architectures across many domains of life and extended our cell component ontology to enable representation of the inferred architectures we provide software for visualizing cellular architectures to verify their cor rectness and software for editing cellular architectures to modify or correct them we also developed a representation that records the cellular compartment assignments of reactions with minimal duplication of information availability_and the cell component ontology is freely_available the pathway tools software is freely_available for academic_research and is available for a fee for commercial use accurate representation of the compartmentation of the cell is an important issue in metabolic modeling in our quest to streamline the processes of developing metabolic_models and of exchanging models between different research groups a number of issues related to cellular compartmentation arise what is the essential information about cellular compartmentation that should be captured and how can it be effectively represented how can we automatically infer the cellular_compartments of an organism when creating a new metabolic model when that automatic inference fails how can we facilitate manual adjustment of compartmentation by a user a cell component ontology cco should be able to represent the universal set of cellular_components from which all known cells are built as well as the particular cellular_components from which a specific type of cell is built for multicellular_organisms the cco should be able to represent within one database the cellular_components of the multiple cell_types present in that organism cell_types in multicellular_organisms sometimes have different cellular architectures e g red_blood lack nuclei cco should capture the information needed to support the inference of the cellular architecture of different organisms such as by describing the typical organization of cellular_components in different types of organisms e g the cellulararchitecture of a typical plant versus a typical bacterium in a way that can be instantiated in a particular organism finally cco should enable inferences about the spatial_organization of cellular_compartments e g if a transporter is assigned to a given membrane within a cell a program should be able to infer that the transporter transports metabolites from the cellular space surrounding that membrane to the cellular space surrounded by that membrane accurate metabolic_models must define the different sets of reactions that occur within different cellular_compartments of a given cell_type and the exchange reactions that translocate metabolites across cellular_membranes consider the problem of modeling a large community of interacting organisms by combining metabolic_models created by different research groups for individual_organisms for example imagine that we wanted to combine a human intestinal_epithelial metabolic model derived from recon with models of bacteria from the gut_microbiota shoaie and nielsen if the individual models do not identify their common extracellular_space using a single shared identifier it will not be possible for the metabolites secreted by one organism to be taken up by another organism furthermore for consistency and understandability it is desirable for different models to use the same controlled_vocabulary terms to refer to the same cellular_components such as the bacterial inner membrane standardization of the cellular_compartments used in individual metabolic_models would clearly facilitate our ability to combine organism models created by different research groups in a plug and play fashion currently the models produced by different research groups use a wide_array of ad_hoc and incompatible compartment identifiers e g golgi_apparatus versus golgi extra_cellular space recon versus extracellular yeast versus extra organism an overview of our approach to these problems is as follows we have updated our ccohttp bioinformatics ai sri com cco to enable the concurrent description of multiple cell_types within a single database and to permit development of metabolic reconstructions that span_multiple e g human cell_types the cco describes surrounds relationships among compartments e g the cytosol surrounds the mitochondrion proteins metabolites and reactions within a pathway genome_database pgdb can be annotated with one or more cco terms to define their cellular_location s further each cco cellular_component is labeled with the national_center ncbi taxonomy identifiers of the taxonomic_groups in which that component is expected to appear this information enables inferring the cellular_components present in an organism given its ncbi taxonomy identifier by the metabolic reconstruction module pathologic of our pathway tools overview summary of recent enhancements software we refer to the set of cellular_components present in a unicellular organism or in a type of cell from a multicellular_organism plus the topological relationships among those cellular_components as the cellular architecture when a user finds the cellular architecture of an organism to be in error they can use the new cellular architecture editor within pathway tools to revise the cellular architecture the metafluxmetabolic modeling module within pathway tools uses the cco terms attached to metabolic and transport reactions to assign those reactions to appropriate cellular_compartments within a metabolic model we have defined a mapping between cco terms and gene_ontology go gene_ontology consortium terms to maximize the standardization of cco while enabling it to be extended independently of go when necessary the representations described herein are used to describe cellular architectures in all of the organisms listed in
