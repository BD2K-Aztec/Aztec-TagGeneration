systems_biology fixed_point characterization of biological_networks with complex graph topology motivation feedback circuits are important motifs in biological_networks and part of virtually all regulation processes that are needed for a reliable functioning of the cell mathematically feedback is connected to complex behavior of the systems which is often related to bifurcations of fixed points therefore several approaches for the investigation of fixed points in biological_networks have been developed in recent_years many of them assume the fixed_point coordinates to be known and an efficient way to calculate the entire set of fixed points for interrelated feedback structures is highly_desirable results in this article we consider regulatory_network models which are differential_equations with an underlying directed graph that illustrates independencies among variables we introduce the circuit breaking algorithm cba a method that constructs one dimensional characteristics for these network models which inherit important information about the system in particular fixed points are related to the zeros of these characteristics the cba operates on the graph topology and results from graph_theory are used in order to make calculations efficient our framework provides a general_scheme for analyzing network models in terms of interrelated feedback circuits the efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a model for calcium oscillations based on experiments in hepatocytes which consists of several interrelated feedback circuits ordinary_differential are used in essentially all scientific fields to describe dynamic behaviors of physical biological or technical systems an analysis of these systems usually starts with an investigation of their limit sets in particular the fixed points and their local phase portraits in order to calculate the fixed points of a system x f x with x r n algorithms such as newtons method and related approaches are commonly used besides the well known problems of those methods concerning convergence they require the calculation of the jacobian matrix in each step which can in most cases only be done via numeric approximations consequently these methods are often computationally_expensive especially if n is large it is thus difficult to investigate for example the dependence of fixed_point coordinates on model_parameters which requires calculating the fixed points for multiple parameter_values in many applications the differential_equation system describes the dynamics of interacting components and a component is usually not influenced by all other components but by a subset of these these dependencies can be illustrated by a directed graph if x i is influenced by x j we indicate this with a directed edge from vertex v j to vertex v i in the graph and the dynamics in particular the fixed_point coordinates of x i depend on x j thus all fixed_point coordinates of components in a circuit are dependent and the idea of our approach is to exploit these dependencies in order to reduce the dimension of the fixed_point equations f x the concept of our approach will be explained in the context of biological_networks more precisely we consider intracellular regulation processes with underlying directed graph_structure such as gene_regulatory rns these systems are commonly based on chemical reaction_kinetics resulting in nonlinear models that cannot be solved analytically fixed points play_an in those models since the emergence of complex behavior is often related to local bifurcations of those points bi or multistability which comes along with phenomena such as switching behavior decision_processes or memory effects are generically caused by saddle node bifurcations biological examples for these phenomena are numerous switching mechanisms in multisite protein_phosphorylation which play a role in eukaryotic signaling_cascades lysis or lysogenic pathway selection by phage infected escherichia_coli cells and references therein cellular differentiation_processes or epigenetic differences caused by transient signals such as the state of the lactose operon in escherichia_coli oscillations are generically created by hopf bifurcations of fixed points and all those behaviors have been related to circuits in the underlying interaction graphs i graphs besides a calculation of fixed points for constructing bifurcation diagrams investigating the fixed points of intracellular networks is also facilitated by experimental_data since in many settings only fixed_point measurements under different perturbations are available while kinetic_data are missing along these lines analysis methods which operate on the fixed points of these networks have been developed in recent_years examples are robustness analysis with respect to kinetic perturbations that is page this article_considers rn models which are described as systems of ordinary_differential with an underlying directed graph_structure the i graph we have introduced the cba for the characterization of fixed points of these models the cba exploits the dependencies of the fixed_point coordinates in a connected graph in order to find a minimal characterization based on this idea we constructed a one dimensional circuit characteristic by breaking all circuits in the graph and iteratively closing them again these circuit closing steps correspond to solving implicit equations whose dimensions are related to the circuit structure of the graph we demonstrated that this dimension is bounded from below by the cardinality of a minimal subset of vertices that covers the elementary circuits and explained how to construct the fixed point_set of the system from the zeros of this circuit characteristic our approach has several advantages over purely numerical_methods first in comparison to solving an n dimensional equation f x x r n the dimension of the equations in the cba can be much smaller especially for sparse graphs second we have demonstrated on a biological_network model of interlocked feedback circuits that the influence of parameter variations on the fixed points can also be investigated by our algorithm thus the constructed characteristics are for example useful to find bifurcations and parameter regions in which the system has a certain number of fixed points in this article we applied the cba to a network of four components it can also be used to investigate fixed points of larger_networks the efficiency and superiority to newton type methods depend on the graph topology and increase when the cardinality of the minimal circuit covering vertex sets decrease we expect this to correlate with the sparsity of the graph but it is not yet clear how we can further characterize the topology and behavior of such graphs for larger_networks we expect that the computation of the sccs their circuit sets and especially the minimal circuit covering vertex sets is not negligible any more and increases the running time we believe that our approach can especially facilitate the analysis of fixed_point sets of smaller network models and their dependence on parameter_values if the network consists of several interrelated feedback structures it is in practice applicable to models of only few say components finally our approach is based on a very general framework and can be applied to a large class of differential_equations complex dynamic_behavior is related to circuits in the i graphs and the cba provides an analysis method in terms of subnetworks with interrelated circuit structure while in the past methodology has been developed for single feedback circuits only few approaches exist that can handle complex feedback and our method is a contribution in this direction recent_studies indicate that complex network_structures are often related to functional robustness and methods to analyze these networks are thus highly_relevant also from a biological point_of several interesting question will guide our future work most importantly we believe that the circuit characteristics contain information about asymptotic properties of the system such as stability of the fixed points
