databases_and pdb wide collection of binding data current status of the pdbbind database biological_macromolecules proteins and nucleic_acids often execute their functions via molecular_recognition with other biological_macromolecules or organic small_molecules characterization of the interactions between molecular complexes is thus helpful for interpreting the mechanism of various life processes modern x_ray and multidimensional nuclear_magnetic nmr techniques have produced a wealth of structural_information of molecular complexes the worldwide protein_data pdb holds the largest open resource for experimentally_determined biomolecular structures it has been growing rapidly during the past_years or so by june over structures had already been deposited into pdb a number of derivative databases based on pdb have been developed with their own scopes and emphases such as pdbsum relibase het pdb navi and scpdb these databases provide annotated proteinligand complex structures or their special_features such as binding_pockets and ligand_molecules collectively the structural_information provided by these databases allows visual_examination of interactions between a wide_range of molecular complexes on the other hand energetic properties are also indispensable for obtaining an in depth understanding of such events here the major_problem is that energetic data such as binding data are often scattered in the huge pool of literature so that they are difficult to access to tackle this problem some existing databases started to incorporate binding data for example chembl and pubchem are perhaps the two most comprehensive databases in this category they currently provide a large amount of experimental binding data of diverse bioactive_compounds as well as relevant_information on molecular_targets experimental_conditions etc other databases were created with a focus on binding data e g bindingdb and pdsp ki obviously the rich knowledge of the interactions between bioactive_small and their potential targets provided by these databases is widely welcomed by chemical biologists and medicinal chemists nevertheless the link between structural_information and energetic properties is desirable especially for theoretical and computational studies on molecular_recognition this link is missing or at least not the primary_focus of the databases mentioned above with more and more successful applications of computational_methods to modern drug_discovery the requirement for a combined knowledge of structures and binding data has become increasingly urgent to fill the gap between structural_information and energetic properties of biomolecular complexes a practical strategy is to collect experimentally_measured binding data for the biomolecular complexes deposited to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com in the pdb currently pdbbind and binding moad are two outstanding databases created for this purpose both of them are based on a systematic sampling of the entire pdb a few early databases also belong to this category including lpdb pld and affidb but they are much smaller in size and have undergone virtually no updates since original release a summary of current databases collecting structural_information and or binding data of proteinligand complexes in all three categories is given in the supplementary the pdbbind database was originally developed by prof shaomeng wangs group at the university of michigan and was first released to the public on may since this database has been maintained and further developed by our group at the shanghai institute of organic_chemistry in china under a mutual agreement with the university of michigan since then the database has been released through the pdbbind cn web_server at http www pdbbind cn org and http www pdbbind org cn over the years we have regularly updated the pdbbind database to keep pace with the growth of pdb itself the methods for compiling the database have also been improved along the way the latest release of pdbbind i e version provides binding data for molecular complexes in the pdb making it the largest collection of its kind to date in all registered users from some countries access this database regularly there are also a large number of anonymous users around the world in this article we will describe the current methods used for compiling the pdbbind and its updated status we will also review some typical applications of pdbbind published in the scientific_literature to illustrate the significant value of this database
