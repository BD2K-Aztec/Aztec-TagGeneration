genome_analysis supercomputing for the parallelization of whole genome_analysis motivation the declining cost of generating dna_sequence is promoting an increase in whole_genome especially as applied to the human_genome whole genome_analysis requires the alignment and comparison of raw_sequence and results in a computational bottleneck because of limited ability to analyze multiple_genomes simultaneously results we now adapted a cray xe supercomputer to achieve the parallelization required for concurrent multiple genome_analysis this approach not only markedly speeds computational time but also results in increased usable sequence per genome relying on publically available software the cray xe has the capacity to align and call variants on whole genomes in h multisample variant_calling is also accelerated availability_and the megaseq workflow is designed to harness the size and memory of the cray xe housed at argonne national laboratory for whole genome_analysis in a platform designed to better match current and emerging sequencing volume with the advent of massively_parallel dna_sequencing the rate at which human genome_variation can be determined is limited less by sequence generation but instead by the computational_tools required to analyze these data with current sequencing_technology using short_sequence of bp whole genome_analysis wga requires the cleaning aligning and interpreting of a billion sequence_reads per single_genome with focus on scalability we sought to improve the timeline required to process whole_genome wgs by optimizing extraction alignment processing and variant_calling we reasoned that supercomputing capacity was better suited to parallelize wga and allow for the rapid simultaneous analysis of multiple_genomes beagle is a cray xe supercomputer housed at argonne national laboratory and administered by the computation institute at the university of chicago beagle has compute nodes each with gb of memory each node has cores ghz cores on two amd magny cours processors the xe can work in both extreme scalability mode for scalable applications and cluster compatibility mode for use with programs that are designed for smaller machines or clusters such as the freely_available genomics tools that are now routinely implemented for wga while parallelization is possible on smaller systems both memory and computational core number limit the capacity for simultaneous computation beagle uses a parallel computation environment and a parallel file system lustre based on shared storage having both a parallel computation environment and external disk storage based on a parallel file system ensures that each node and core is able to access all data at any time without waiting for transfer of data across nodes in this system nodes have no local storage and therefore no disk to disk transfer is required on clusters without a shared file system data transfer across nodes during analysis can be a time intensive process here we describe a workflow referred to as megaseq that uses the mapreduce approach to take advantage of supercomputing size and memory
