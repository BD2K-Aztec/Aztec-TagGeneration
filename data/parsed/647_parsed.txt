baking a mass_spectrometry data pie with mcmc and simulated_annealing predicting protein post_translational from integrated top_down and bottom up data motivation post_translational are vital to the function of proteins but are hard to study especially since several modified isoforms of a protein may be present simultaneously mass_spectrometers are a great tool for investigating modified proteins but the data they provide is often incomplete ambiguous and difficult_to combining data from multiple experimental techniquesespecially bottom up and top_down mass spectrometryprovides complementary information when integrated with background_knowledge this allows a human expert to interpret what modifications are present and where on a protein they are located however the process is arduous and for high_throughput applications needs to be automated results this article explores a data_integration methodology based on markov_chain and simulated_annealing our software the protein inference engine the pie applies these algorithms using a modular approach allowing multiple types of data to be considered simultaneously and for new data types to be added as needed even for complicated data representing multiple modifications and several isoforms the pie generates accurate modification predictions including location when applied to experimental_data collected on the l l ribosomal_protein the pie was able to make predictions consistent with manual interpretation for several different l l isoforms using a combination of bottom up data with experimentally_identified intact masses availability software demo projects and source can be downloaded from http pie giddingslab org contact morgan giddingslab org a cell needs to modify proteins with post_translational adducts for the same reason that an automobile needs gears without them the operational range is severely limited if cells relied on fixed proteins biological reaction_times would be on the order of minutes and only a limited set of functional_groups would be available to to whom correspondence should be addressed build an active protein cells use known post_translational ptms to allow dynamic functional shifting providing for rapid and flexible responses to changing local conditions these ptms affect protein functions in many ways including inducing conformation changes modifying proteinprotein_interactions and affecting lifespan when ptm regulation breaks down it is much like a broken transmission in a carproteins become non functional teasing apart where ptms occur when they are used and how they are modulated is of great interest in biological and biomedical_research studying ptms requires examining proteins but without the equivalent of polymerase_chain pcr_amplification techniques proteomics methods are significantly more difficult and indirect than genomic methods mass_spectrometry ms is the star player in the proteomics field and with the advent of new instrumentation such as orbitrap mass analyzers combined with the continued maturation of established techniques such as electrospray_ionization it is an excellent tool for the investigation of ptms current ms methods measure protein or peptide mass with such accuracy that it is possible to differentiate between two distinct modification states isoforms of a protein based only on a mass shift for example methylation adds da to the total mass of the protein if it is possible to measure the intact mass of that protein within da or less then this methylation can be readily detected however in practice ptm analysis is not simple even putting aside sample preparations issues analytical difficulties remain including i achieving sufficient accuracy to determine ptms for large proteins ii working with obstinate insoluble proteins iii decoding isobaric masses when multiple combinations of ptms give the same mass shift e g both one acetylation and three methylations cause a da mass shift and iv determining precise positioning of ptms several approaches have been devised that address these challenges including bottom up top_down and combined methods we briefly describe these here more detailed reviews are available e g bottom up ms uses a divide_and strategy that reduces proteins to constituent short_peptides that are more readilypage to investigate the feasibility of mcmc sa based data_integration we sought answers to questions such as could we avoid being lost in endless sea of equal mass answers particularly given only incomplete_data can the system handle datasets that have dependencies errors or contradictions because mcmc and sa are computationally_intensive can we find answers in a reasonable time can we develop the approach into a practical and modular program that works well now but can readily accommodate additional data types in the future data_integration in proteomics is difficult because data are usually incomplete and the solution_space is ambiguous especially when proteins have multiple modifications given the results obtained above mcmc and sa appear to be a useful way to approach this problem predictions for simply modified proteins are easy to obtain for data representing a single protein isoform with only one or two if not there the second best scoring guess places it on a lysine aligned with a missing peptide see_supplementary for specifics here the effect of the prior data module implementing the aa preference of modifications can be seen as lysine is the most commonly acetylated modification as well as the effect of the peptide data model since peptides provide information that any covered lysine is probably not modified unfortunately no other information is available to distinguish between these three positions so there are three different equally likely predictions made as the second best guess other less likely answers include different positions for the acetyl modification a tetra methyl species and a dimethyl formyl species two rare bad guesses suggest methyl acetyl hydroxyl myristoyl along with a cleavage of n term and c term amino_acids but even these rare guesses are in agreement with the intact mass data they are approximately isobaric to the best guess but score much lower due to multiple conflicts with peptide ms_ms and prior data modules the current version of the pie is only the first step in creating a tool that can integrate ms data and predict ptms but already it shows great promise using sa allows the pie to explore the unfathomably large solution_space of all possible modifications of a protein and find the consistent answers it is surprisingly robust capable of decomposing an intact mass into a likely combination of modifications and with the addition of ms_ms data even a complex_mixture of overlapping and conflicting peptides from several isoforms can be used to obtain specific modifications localizations
