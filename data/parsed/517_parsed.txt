assemblytics a web analytics tool for the detection of variants from an assembly assemblytics is a web app for detecting and analyzing variants from a de_novo gen ome assembly aligned to a reference_genome it incorporates a unique anchor filtering_approach to increase robustness to repetitive_elements and identifies six classes of variants based on their distinct alignment signatures assemblytics can be applied both to comparing aberrant genomes such as human_cancers to a reference or to identify differences between related species multiple interactive_visualizations enable in depth explorations of the genomic distributions of variants availability and implementationde novo genome_assembly is becoming increasingly tractable on large_genomes due to advances in long_read and mapping this is leading to a greater quality and quantity of reference_genomes across the tree of life researchers can now sequence and assemble the genomes of several related strains or species in order to compare them this is a vast improvement over more common resequencing approaches where sequencing_reads are aligned to a single reference_genome often allowing only snps or short indels to be identified now that increasing numbers of high_quality genome_assemblies are available there is a need to detect the large structural_variants that mark important differences between these genomes for example there may be more than structural_variations representing megabases of genetic_diversity present per human_genome see below assemblytics builds on the innovations of the whole_genome alignment suite mummer in order to detect and analyze these variants maximum adjusted to match the size of the unique_sequence anchor this prevents translocations and complex variants from being interpreted as indels variants from multiple alleles are reported independently and tagged with contig of origin illustrates the differences between variant classes tandem and repeat expansions are insertions taking_place within tandem and repeat sequences respectively while tandem and repeat contractions are deletions within these elements insertions_and are characterized by a defined breakpoint less than bp overlap or gap on one side tandem variants occur between overlapping alignments over bp repeat variants occur within unmappable gaps between alignments the individual alignments are also scanned to detect insertions_or spanned by the alignment finally variant classes size distributions and genomic_coordinates of all variants are summarized through plots and tables as well as an interactive dot plot of alignments supplementary note provides more details on the web_interface we first evaluated the accuracy of the variation detection by applying assemblytics to analyze simulated structural_variations within the human_genome supplemental note to do so we created a modified_version of the human_genome with simulated insertions_and embedded at known positions and then aligned both the original unmodified reference_genome and the human_genome assembled by mhap presented byto this modified reference our results show that assemblytics is able to correctly identify the vast_majority of variants present recall and with very low false_positive we next applied assemblytics to all five de_novo assemblies human d melanogaster a thaliana s cerevisiae and e coli presented byto their respective reference_genomes supplementary note in each case the genome was analyzed in less than min and the full interactive results are available on the assemblytics website all assemblies showed a large number of structural_variations proportional to the size of the genome and the sizes of the events approximated a log_normal with a long tail of large events drosophila was a notable_exception with a relatively small number of variants identified with only compared to for a thaliana of similar size this was because the assembly was derived from the same inbred population as the original reference iso in the case of the human analysis assemblytics reported structural_variations spanning over mb this included a noticeable enrichment for bp insertions_and which we characterized as novel alu variants high mapping quality for read_alignment something that was not previously available for genome genome alignments
