structural_bioinformatics sirah tools mapping backmapping and visualization of coarse_grained models coarse_grained cg models reduce the cost of molecular_dynamics simulations keeping the essence of molecular_interactions still the diversity of cg representations sizes connect ivity naming etc hampers the handling and visualization of such models sirah tools comprises a set of utilities to convert all atoms coordinates to arbitrary residue based cg schemes write gromacs topological information at any resolution into psf format and a vmd plugin to visualize analyze and retrieve pseudo atomistic information from cg trajectories performed with the sirah force_field these tools facilitate the use of intricate cg force_fields outside the small devel opers community availability_and different utilities of sirah tools are written in perl tcl or r documentation and source codes are freely distributed at http www sirahff com molecular_dynamics md_simulations constitute a reliable approach for the study of bimolecular structures dynamics and interactions however its computational_cost has prompted the development of coarse_grained cg models aimed to reach ever growing size and timescales in general different mapping schemes are used to provide cg representations from all atoms aa molecular_systems making difficult the creation and editing of molecular topology files moreover arbitrary cg schemes can be challenging for general purposes visualization programs to yield correct rendering molecular connectivity beads size charges etc to overcome such difficulties we created a series of utilities named sirah tools which are distributed within the sirah force_field package for cg and multiscale simulations seeand references therein sirah tools is freely_available along with tutorials for running and analyzing cg simulations at http www sirahff com cg models are considerably expanding yet their visualization and analysis still suffers from limitations that restrict their use to highly skilled users sirah tools aims to bridge this gap by providing easy and flexible mapping utilities processing of topologies and data analysis
