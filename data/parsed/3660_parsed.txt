predicting the lethal phenotype of the knockout_mouse by integrating comprehensive genomic_data motivation the phenotypes of knockout_mice provide_crucial for understanding the biological_functions of mammalian genes among various knockout phenotypes lethality is of great interest because those involved genes play_essential with the availability of large_scale genomic_data we aimed to assess how well the integration of various genomic_features can predict the lethal phenotype of single gene knockout_mice results we first assembled a comprehensive list of candidate genomic_features derived from diverse data_sources using mouse genes with a known phenotype as the training_set we integrated the informative genomic_features to predict the knockout lethality through three machine_learning based on cross_validation our models could achieve a good performance accuracy and recall our results serve as a valuable practical resource in the mouse genetics research_community and also accelerate the translation of the knowledge of mouse genes into better strategies for studying human disease the mouse is the premier model_organism for interpreting the human_genome and plays_a in studying human_diseases importantly the mouse is the only vertebrate_species in which pre selected genes can be deliberately mutated knocked out such that the phenotypic effect associated with a gene can be defined in a precise manner among various phenotypic_effects of disrupting a mouse gene the lethal phenotype is of particular interest for several reasons first the lethal phenotype represents the most severe_defects for an organism the disrupted genes that result in the lethality play_essential from an evolutionary point_of the loss of such a gene reduces the fitness of the organism to zero second computational_analyses on the lethal phenotype of gene_deletion reveal some key_findings in systems_biology such as the centralitylethality rule to whom correspondence should be addressed and functional compensation among duplicated_genes third at the practical level predicting the knockout lethality of mouse genes is highly_valuable for the mouse genetics community since mouse knockout experiments are notoriously time consuming previous_analyses on the knockout lethality of mouse genes have focused on one or a few gene features for example liang andshowed a weak correlation between the knockout lethality and protein connectivity furthermore whether a gene is a singleton has little effect on the predictive_power of knockout lethality implying a complex relationship between gene duplicability and gene_essentiality more recently with the availability of various large_scale mouse genomic_datasets there has been wide interest in employing sophisticated computational_approaches to predicting gene function by considering many gene features simultaneously one pioneering attempt was the mousefunc prediction project in which different bioinformatics teams integrated diverse datasets to predict the biological_functions of mouse genes represented as gene_ontology go terms using advanced machine_learning such as ridge_regression support_vector svm and random_forest these studies made reliable predictions for many go categories and greatly expanded our ability to discover novel biology the primary biological_questions we aim to address are as follows i which genomic_features are most correlated with the lethal phenotype of mouse single gene_knockouts and ii through reasonable computational_approaches to what extent can the knockout lethality be predicted from a wide_range of genomic_features outlines the overall scheme of our study we first assembled a comprehensive list of genomic_features derived from diverse data_sources for each mouse gene and identified subsets of informative features for predicting the lethality of single gene_knockouts then we integrated the selected genomic_features to predict the knockout lethality using three machine_learning and evaluated their predictive_power based on cross_validation finally we examined the bias of genes with a known knockout phenotype the training_set and estimated the bias corrected predictive_power our predictive_models achieved a reasonably good performance demonstrating the feasibility of an integrative approach to predicting knockout lethality in complex organisms in this study we predicted the lethal phenotype for singlegene knockout_mice by integrating gene features inferred from various genomic data_sources and achieved a relatively good performance since mouse knockout experiments are notoriously time consuming and technically_challenging we expect our results to serve as a valuable resource for the mouse genetics research_community greatly helping to optimize experimental_designs and improve biological interpretations because of the close genetic and physiological similarities between mice and humans our results would accelerate the translation of the knowledge of mouse genes into better strategies for studying human disease compared with previous similar studies our study has some advantages first we systematically investigated a wide_range of candidate genomic_features most of which have not been examined for their ability to predict the lethal phenotype importantly all the surveyed features were derived from large_scale independent experimental_data to avoid circular reasoning we did not use go annotations or phenotype information e g disease association from other species by orthology second we explored and compared different classifiers before making final predictions thereby likely maximizing the predictive_power third we explicitly considered the bias in the training_set when assessing the predictive_power for genes without an annotated phenotype our work provides key insights into the genotype to phenotype relationship first the top selected_features for mouse knockout lethality are quite different from those for unicellular eukaryotes i e yeasts some dominant predictors for yeast essential genes such as gc_content were not selected in our models suggesting that the genotype to phenotype relationship strongly depends on the organismal complexity second many of the features that were highly ranked in our study are compatible with those of previous_studies among these selected_features gene evolutionary age was the top feature it was consistently selected across different gene_sets and also showed the highest individual correlation with the knockout phenotype this result suggests that disrupting an evolutionarily ancient gene tends to result in a more severe functional_consequence paralog sequence_identity is the selected feature with the highest negative coefficient indicating that removing a gene with a closely_related gene copy tends to be non lethal which is consistent with the notion of functional compensation among paralogs interestingly this feature alone shows little correlation with the knockout phenotype individually which is due to the confounding_effects of other features as discussed previously protein connectivity was another highly ranked feature with a positive contribution to the knockout lethality consistent_with this result highlights the critical role of hub nodes in a biological system in addition to those previously studied features we also identified some important novel features most of which are related to gene_expression such as the expression_level in utero and in ts the approach we took also has some limitations first like other similar studies our models were unable to distinguish correlations from causations second some parameters in our machine_learning may not be fully explored third we may still miss some important genomic_features and the feature dataset we compiled may contain some noise especially for interaction features indeed comparing among the three types of features the sequence_features and expression features show much higher predictive_power than the interaction features although we did not explicitly_model the noise within the feature data the effect of noise was minimized by considering a comprehensive list of features and employing feature_selection we expect to revisit this topic and to achieve a better performance when more high_quality genomic_datasets such as protein expression data have become available acc is defined as the proportion of genes whose knockout phenotype classification is correctly_predicted ppv positive_predictive also known as precision is defined as the proportion of genes with a positive prediction lethal that are correctly_predicted npv negative_predictive is defined as the proportion of genes with a negative prediction non lethal that are correctly_predicted recall is defined as the proportion of genes with a lethal phenotype that is correctly_predicted
