evaluating bacterial gene_finding hmm structures as probabilistic logic programs motivation probabilistic logic programming offers a powerful way to describe and evaluate structured statistical_models to investigate the practicality of probabilistic logic programming for structure_learning in bioinformatics we undertook a simplified bacterial gene_finding benchmark in prism a probabilistic dialect of prolog results we evaluate hidden_markov structures for bacterial protein_coding potential including a simple null_model structure three structures based on existing bacterial gene_finders and two novel model structures we test standard versions as well as adph length modeling and three state versions of the five model structures the models are all represented as probabilistic logic programs and evaluated using the prism machine_learning system in terms of statistical_information criteria and gene_finding prediction_accuracy in two bacterial_genomes neither of our implementations of the two currently most used model structures are best performing in terms of statistical_information criteria or prediction performances suggesting that better fitting models might be achievable availability the source_code of all prism models data and additional scripts are freely_available for download at http github com somork codonhmm protein_coding potential has long been recognized as the most important signal for automated gene_finding the introduction of hidden_markov hmms for gene_finding bysparked the production of a large number of hmmbased single_sequence gene_finders that capture this signal and other signals to whom correspondence should be addressed restricting our survey to the simplest case of bacterial genefinding the basic codon structure of protein_coding has so_far been modeled using the following structures the ecoparse gene finder introduced byis based on a standard hmm architecture with a silent state governing codon distributions via transitions to separate three state submodels where each state of the codon submodels had fixed emissions of a single character introduced the generalized hidden_markov ghmm a type of hmm with duration offering the possibility of emissions of sequences rather than just characters from each state most single_sequence de_novo gene_finders have since been based on ghmms using either emissions of codons according to a three periodic inhomogeneous markov_chain or using higher ordered emissions typically fifth ordered or variable ordered emissions the single character emitting hmm_based gene finder models has subsequently been elaborated by also using higher ordered emissions as well as using acyclic discrete phase type length modeling in easygene and agene a large number of different hmm architectures have been developed during the recent decades including profile_hmms pair hmms input_output hmms or transducers factorialhmms and mixed memory hmms these models each combine different numbers of emitted sequences hidden state chains delete and insert states and different conditioning schemes for emission probabilities and transition_probabilities employing as efficient model structures as possible for biological sequence_analysis is paramount for coping with the vast_amounts of sequence_data currently being generated the structure space of possible different combinations is large and exploring it for efficient models for biological sequence_analysis is limited by the time consuming development of dedicated machine_learning and benchmarking procedures additionally efforts to directly compare models are clouded by implementation differences and the heuristic fine tunings developed through the decades that optimize the models in terms of the sequence_analysis task at hand to overcome these challenges we use the probabilistic logic programming_language and machine_learning system prism prism offers a generic representation of a large number of diverse model types that subsumes hmms scfgs and bayesian_networks the prism machine_learning system uses a general setpage the performance of the models both in terms of statistical fit ranked as per the variational free_energy value after training on the complete training_set and in terms of prediction_performance evaluated via cross_validation experiments suggests the following general ranking aa eco mm i pmc mc interestingly the model structures that performed the worst were the the two currently most popular model structures the fifth order_markov model mc and the three periodic inhomogeneous markov_chain model i pmc with a single exception mm adph length modeling has an averse effect on the prediction_performance whereas using the three state versions dramatically improved the performance of all models even though the difference infor each of the model versions values are reported for comparisons within class only alternative hypothesis is that row entries are greater than column entries the findings of this study have been based on very architecturally simple models of protein_coding potential only we have used bacterial gene_finding as a test environment favoring a thorough comparative test of the most prominent current single_sequence bacterial gene finder model structures our results are not directly comparable to prediction performances of current state of the art gene_finders in absolute terms since we do not employ the heuristics that have been carefully developed through the last decades however as more and more data amasses we need as powerful models as possible we propose that systematic testing of underlying model structures in a language where the model is foregrounded is a valuable_approach to constructing reliable models for real_world applications we have developed and tested a number of both new and existing gene finder architectures for modeling protein_coding potential inpage for each of the model versions values are reported for comparisons within class only alternative hypothesis is that row entries are greater than column entries a generalized framework that permits direct comparisons of the performance of the underlying model structures our approach demonstrates that there are very efficient model structures hidden in the vast structure space of non standard hmms specifically the novel structures presented here seems promising candidates for advancing gene_finding and additional biological sequence_analysis tasks that rely on protein_coding potential additionally the general approach that we have used for exploring hmm structures for capturing protein_coding potential is a promising route to exploring and discovering efficient models used for more complex biological sequence_analysis tasks such as rna_structure or modeling viral_genomes lastly we have shown thatthe probabilistic logic programming_language prism is a capable framework for the rapid_prototyping and benchmarking of statistical_models in bioinformatics up to datasets the size of small bacterial_genomes
