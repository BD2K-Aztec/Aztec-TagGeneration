cancer_therapy design based on pathway logic motivation cancer encompasses various diseases associated with loss of cell_cycle control leading to uncontrolled cell_proliferation and or reduced apoptosis cancer is usually caused by malfunction s in the cellular_signaling malfunctions occur in different ways and at different locations in a pathway consequently therapy design should first identify the location and type of malfunction to arrive at a suitable drug_combination results we consider the growth_factor gf signaling_pathways widely_studied in the context of cancer interactions between different pathway_components are modeled using boolean logic_gates all possible single malfunctions in the resulting circuit are enumerated and responses of the different malfunctioning circuits to a test input are used to group the malfunctions into classes effects of different drugs targeting different parts of the boolean circuit are taken into account in deciding drug efficacy thereby mapping each malfunction to an appropriate set of drugs contact in eukaryotic multicellular_organisms life is sustained by a systematic coordination between different cells and all extracellular signals each cell has its own functionality and its future is determined by various intrinsic and extrinsic biological_signals for instance a cells proliferation differentiation or induction of apoptosis are determined by a number of different signals from the time of a cells birth by division of its parent cell the cells state is tightly_controlled by different biological regulations cell_signaling is a form of communication between different cells these signals can be chemical or electrical impulses communication via electrical impulses is typically associated with nerve_cells neurons which are attached to each other and the action_potential transmits from neuron to neuron for general somatic_cells proteins are usually the signaling_molecules used for communication the interactions between the different signaling_molecules are multivariate in nature and hence difficult to study as a result historically biologists have focussed on studying the marginal interaction between the signaling_molecules leading to what is called pathway_information although pathway_knowledge cannot provide the complete multivariate picture of the overall cellular_signal it is clear that one has to have a mechanism for incorporating this prior information into any signal_transduction model that one develops a procedure to whom correspondence should be addressed to do precisely that was recently_developed in in that paper tools from digital system design were used to generate boolean_networks consistent with given pathway_information furthermore it was shown using a specific biological example that a network designed using that approach could replicate relevant experimentally_observed behavior from the published_literature in this article our goal is to go a few steps further here we are not content with just producing a boolean_network from given pathway_information instead our objective is to utilize such a model to i enumerate all the possible fault scenarios ii use the response of the model to a test input to determine which fault or class of faults has occurred and iii finally use this information to prescribe an appropriate therapeutic_action to keep the discussion biologically focussed we will consider the specific case of growth_factor gf signaling_pathways the article is organized as follows in section pathways and networks are defined in a formal way in section cancer is modeled as faults in the underlying signaling_network in section drug_therapies are modeled as interventions to alter aberrant network behavior emanating from a fault section gives a biological example showing the power of our methodology specifically fault classification and intervention results for our example are presented finally section contains some concluding_remarks
