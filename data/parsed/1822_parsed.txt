gene_expression finding consistent disease subnetworks using pfsnet motivation microarray_data analysis is often applied to characterize disease populations by identifying individual genes linked to the disease in recent_years efforts have shifted to focus on sets of genes known to perform related biological_functions i e in the same pathways evaluating gene_sets reduces the need to correct for false posi tives in multiple_hypothesis however pathways are often large and genes in the same pathway that do not contribute to the disease can cause a method to miss the pathway in addition large pathways may not give much insight to the cause of the disease moreover when such a method is applied independently to two data_sets of the same disease_phenotypes the two resulting lists of significant pathways often have low agreement results we present a powerful method pfsnet that identifies smaller parts of pathways which we call subnetworks and show that significant subnetworks and the genes therein discovered by pfsnet are up to more consistent across independent datasets of the same disease_phenotypes even for datasets based on different platforms than previously_published we further show that those methods which initially declared some large pathways to be insignificant would declare subnetworks detected by pfsnet in those large pathways to be significant if they were given those sub networks as input instead of the entire large pathways discovering the mechanisms_regulating a disease requires researchers to understand the cascade_of to a particular phenotype these mechanisms are often depicted in biological_pathways in the literature while microarray_technology provides researchers a glimpse of the underlying characteristics that differentiate phenotypese g normal samples versus diseased samplesit has been shown that methods for microarray_analysis often produce results that are inconsistent and unreproducible when applied independently on independent datasets and in some cases are even no better than randomly produced gene_signatures clearly a method that produces a higher agreement between two datasets of the same disease lends more confidence to the real cause of the disease snet is one of the rare exceptions in gene_expression analysis methods that produce pathways and genes that are consistently significant when independently applied to multiple independent datasets of the same disease_phenotypes even when these datasets are not restricted to the same platform the percentage of agreement is higher than other methods compared in this article we identify some shortcomings of snet and present two refinements which we incorporate in the new method pfsnet we have tested pfsnet on six datasets from three disease types our method_produces an improvement of and in gene agreement and pathway agreement respectively when compared to snet and even more when compared to earlier methods like gsea ggea sam and t test we use pathways from pathwayapi a database that unifies popular pathway_databases like kegg wikipathways and ingenuity for each of the three disease types studied hereleukemia childhood_acute all subtype and duchenne_muscular dmd we obtain two independent datasets which are produced using different microarray_platforms for each disease type we run pfsnet fsnet snet gsea ggea sam and t test on the two datasets independently and obtain two corresponding outputs we compare the results from the two datasets using two measures of jaccard like agreement defined below we use the subnetwork generation procedure mentioned in section to generate the subnetworks in dataset we then test these subnetworks for statistical_significance using the procedure mentioned in sections when testing gsea which identifies pathways instead of subnetworks we measure the pathway level agreement which is defined analogously we also measure the agreement between the genes in the output generated by the two independent datasets let the genes in sn and sn be g sn and g sn respectively then the gene level agreement is defined asrecent methods for analyzing microarray_data that focus on identifying biological_processes and pathways are superior tonote for pfsnet and fsnet threshold_values of are used for gsea the leading_edge genes were used for sam and t test we took genes at significance_level and also the top n genes indicated in brackets d subnetworks enriched in phenotype d d subnetworks enriched in phenotype d the traditional method of testing individual genes for two main reasons first gene_sets represented by pathways make discovery more interpretable second the ability to identify gene_sets whose members might have only slight changes in individual gene_expression values however pathways become too generalized when they are large such a pathway may also be missed even when a subnetwork within it is indeed important for the disease breaking down pathways to subnetworks provides even better interpretability moreover we discover that previous methods used in microarray_data analysis produce significant gene_sets or pathways that are not very consistent across datasets of the same disease methods that analyze subnetworks like snet also have their shortcomings that it is hard to decide what thresholds to use because a too relaxed threshold will include some non relevant_genes and a too stringent threshold will exclude some relevant_genes in this article we have introduced two improvements to snet by incorporating the fuzzification technique fsnet and by computing paired t statistic based on the fuzzy score of two phenotypes pfsnet we have found that subnetworks identified by fsnet and pfsnet shows higher consistency across independently obtained datasets than other methods pathways that were missed by gsea
