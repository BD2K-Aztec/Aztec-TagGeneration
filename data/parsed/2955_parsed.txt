gene_expression mgdb crossing the marker_genes of a user microarray with a database of public microarrays marker_genes the microarrays performed by scientific teams grow_exponentially these microarray_data could be useful for researchers around the world but unfortunately they are underused to fully_exploit these data it is necessary i to extract these data from a repository of the high_throughput like gene_expression geo and ii to make the data from different microarrays comparable with tools easy to use for scientists we have developed these two solutions in our server implementing a database of micro array marker_genes marker_genes data base this database contains the marker_genes of all geo microarray_datasets and it is updated monthly with the new microarrays from geo thus researchers can see whether the marker_genes of their microarray are marker_genes in other microarrays in the database expanding the analysis of their microarray to the rest of the public microarrays this solution helps not only to corroborate the conclusions regarding a researchers microarray but also to identify the phenotype of different subsets of individuals under investigation to frame the results with microarray_experiments from other species pathologies or tissues to search for drugs that promote the transition between the studied phenotypes to detect undesirable side_effects of the treatment applied etc thus the researcher can quickly add relevant_information to his her studies from all of the previous_analyses performed in other studies as long as they have been deposited in public_repositories when our application crosses the marker_genes of the users microarray sample clusters with the database of microarray marker_genes two types of lists are provided list of microarrays view the list of matching microarrays is ordered by the number of marker_genes in common between the users microarray specific search and the matching microarrays the list of microarrays can be filtered by the experimental variable like agent dose or time to limit the search to a concrete scope or by keywords like breast_cancer the common marker_genes between the users microarray and each matching microarray can be analyzed in the list of marker_genes view list of marker_genes view the common marker_genes between the two microarrays are listed the cluster distribution along the gene_expression is shown for each marker gene and both microarrays in this way the researcher can quickly establish the correspondence between the clusters of his her own microarray and the public microarray the more microarrays satisfactorily compared the more attributes that can be assigned to the users microarray sample clusters which could have been calculated by statistical_methods and thus their biological_significance be unknown as a result the user can enrich his her microarray_data analysis and sample clusters improve his her future experimental_design and check the hypotheses generated from the data in the ways cited in the section
