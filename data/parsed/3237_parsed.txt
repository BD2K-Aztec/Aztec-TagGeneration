genome_analysis network guided sparse regression modeling for detection of gene by gene interactions motivation genetic_variants identified by genome_wide to date explain only a small fraction of total heritability gene by gene interaction is one important potential source of unexplained total heritability we propose a novel approach to detect such interactions that uses penalized_regression and sparse estimation principles and incorporates outside biological_knowledge through a network based penalty results we tested our new method on simulated_and simulation showed that with reasonable outside biological_knowledge our method performs noticeably better than stage wise strategies i e selecting main effects first and interactions second from those main effects selected in finding true interactions especially when the marginal strength of main effects is weak we applied our method to framingham_heart data on total plasma immunoglobulin e ige concentrations and found a number of interactions among different classes of human_leukocyte genes that may interact to influence the risk of developing ige dysregulation and allergy availability the proposed method is implemented in r and available atunlike mendelian_diseases in which disease_phenotypes are largely driven by mutation in a single gene_locus complex disease and traits are associated with a number of factors both genetic and environmental as well as lifestyle in addition while most mendelian_diseases are rare many complex_diseases are frightfully common from asthma to heart_disease hypertension to alzheimers and parkinsons to various forms of cancer arguably motivated by classical successes with mendelian_diseases and traits the study of complex_diseases in the modern genomics era has focused largely on the identification of individually important genes genome_wide gwas the current state of the art have been central to the discovery of many genes in various diseases e g however unfortunately the vast_majority of genetic_variants associated with complex_traits identified to date explain only a small amount of the overall variance of the trait in the underlying population as a result most gwas findings thus far have had little clinical impact currently most gwas are carried_out one single_nucleotide snp at a time typically for each snp a model is specified relating disease status or disease trait to the snp plus other potentially relevant covariates the statistical_significance of each snp is quantified through the p value of an appropriate test finally a multiple_testing is applied to correct the collection of p values across snps the end result is a list of snps declared to be significantly associated with the status or trait of interest which in turn can be mapped to their closest genes although some associations have been found in gene deserts the single snp approach has the important attribute that it is relatively computationally_efficient however it can be severely under powered because of the small effect_size of most genetic_variants identified to date additionally this approach does not adjust for correlation among snps nor does it extend in a natural manner to search for interactions between markers in contrast multiple_regression i e where multiple_snps are modeled simultaneously is a natural alternative however naive implementation i e incorporating all snps of interest is both infeasible and undesirable this is due to various reasons including the sheer number of snps typically available e g hundreds of thousands to millions the comparatively_small number of snps likely to be associated and small n large p problems recently however computationally_efficient multiple_regression strategies for gwas have begun to emerge that use various methods of high_dimensional variable_selection e g compared with traditional single snp methods penalized regression_methods have been found to yield fewer correlated snps and to be capable of producing substantially more power while having a lower false discovery to whom correspondence should be addressed for our analysis on snps we chose to look for main effects although we allowed the algorithm to terminate after selecting ae main effects resulting in main effects selected in the current analysis the parameter c was set to which based on an average estimated snp variance of for these data corresponds to r nine interactions were found in our approach yielding a model with variables to calibrate our results with those from the stage wise procedure of as implemented in mendel the latter was run to select variables in the first stage i e fitting only main effects and then variables in the second stage i e fitting both main effects and interactions selected from among the snps resulting from the first stage this process produced a final model with nine main effects and six interactions in terms of computing time our analysis ran in min on our cluster linga equipped with two intel_xeon cpus e ghz withthe results from our proposed method and from the stagewise procedure are shown in the left and right respectively of the estimates of effect_size and the ranks are from the linear mixed effect model for the final model after variable_selection procedure for both methods genes previously found in a gwas of these fhs data are indicated with an asterisk in the table in our approach four of the six interaction pairs involved human_leukocyte hla genes which encode antigen_presenting surface proteins that are key_regulators of the immune_response the other two interactions identified were among genes both previously associated with log ige concentrations in contrast mendel did not detect any interactions among genes in the hla regions or among pairs of previously associated genes from a biological_perspective a number of the interactions discovered by our method are of non trivial potential interest the major_histocompatibility mhc_class antigens hla a b and c are involved with cell_mediated targeting cells_expressing proteins produced intracellularly for example by viruses while the mhc class_ii hladp dq and dr play_key with humoral_immunity including the production of ige antibodies_directed environmental allergens hla g is a nonclassical mhc_class antigen that may have immunomodulatory_effects through actions on natural_killer t lymphocytes and antigen_presenting genetic_variants in these different classes of hla geneseach class influencing a different but interconnected aspect of immune functioncould well interact to influence the risk of developing ige dysregulation and allergy the observed interaction between snps in the alpha_chain of the high_affinity receptor for ige fcer a and interleukin il genes may reflect a number of mechanisms for example a genetic_variant causing increased expression of fcri on mast_cells would lead to increased antigen induced activation of these cells which would consequently produce more il leading to more class_switch and ige_production genetic_variation of fcri on classical antigen_presenting may also promote th cell activation with consequent il release thus snps in these two genes in the same pathway leading to increased ige_production could have synergistic_effects overall identification of these interactions may help identify the children at highest_risk for developing allergy possibly helping focus interventions to prevent allergy and may provide new insights into the genetic_basis and mechanisms of allergy there are many potential sources of missing hereditability g g interactions is one such source in turn there are many types of genetic_interactions including multiplicative and non multiplicative in this article we focus on investigating multiplicative interactions in the form of a product between two variables our proposed methodology provides a promising new approach to tapping this source by exploiting the wealth of biological_knowledge accumulated in various pathway_databases the simulations reported here suggest that our approach performs better in finding true interactions with a reasonable prior_biological incorporated compared with the stagewise regression_method that first fits a main effect model and then searches for interactions among selected main effects furthermore the real_data results are promising in suggesting that better performance likely may be realized in real_data as well future work to be done on this topic includes extending the computational algorithm to account for linkage_disequilibrium among snps and producing a software implementation that uses standard formatted files such as genotype files from the plink software_package
