sequence_analysis mireval a web_tool for simple microrna prediction in genome_sequences result we have developed mireval an online tool that can simultaneously search up to sequences for novel micrornas mirnas in multiple_organisms mireval uses multiple published in silico approaches to detect mirnas in sequences of interest this tool can be used to discover mirnas from dna_sequences or to validate candidates from sequencing_data micrornas mirnas are nt non_coding ncrnas that post_transcriptionally regulate the expression of target_mrnas although recent_advances in sequencing_technology allow a comprehensive analysis of expressed small_rnas including mirnas distinguishing mirnas from other rna_molecules within sequencing_data remains difficult moreover sequencing_data will not detect mirnas specific to other tissue_types and may not be available for partially sequenced_genomes mireval detects novel mirnas from input dna or rna_sequences using multiple bioinformatics approaches such as predicted_secondary phylogenetic conservation and shadowing and positional clustering it also allows users to visualize rna_molecules in the sequence of interest that may be mistaken for mirnas mireval also displays transcription_factor tf_binding that may regulate mirnas in the input_sequence and overlapping mrna_transcripts improvements over our previous version of mireval include a bigger genome_database species instead of multiple input_sequences per enquiry improved_performance of the secondary_structure and parallelization to increase the speed of each analysis by over fold results are now displayed in a circle graph to allow for a more compact visualization of long input_sequences new features include phylogenetic_footprinting to discover mirnas that are specific to a given clade the display of rna_molecules from rfam that may be mistaken for mirnas and of tf_binding that may regulate mirnas in the input_sequence mireval offers more features than most current prediction_tools and displays high performance scores supplementary prediction mireval searches bp around the enquiry sequence for mirnas mirbase v that cluster with the enquiry sequence
