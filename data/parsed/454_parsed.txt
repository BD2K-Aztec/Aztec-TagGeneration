a probabilistic_method for the detection and genotyping of small_indels from population scale sequence_data motivation high_throughput have made population scale studies of human genetic_variation possible accurate and comprehensive detection of dna sequence_variants is crucial for the success of these studies small insertions_and represent the second most frequent class of variation in the human_genome after single_nucleotide snps although several alignment tools for the gapped_alignment of sequence_reads to a reference_genome are available computational_methods for discriminating indels from sequencing_errors and genotyping indels directly from sequence_reads are needed results we describe a probabilistic_method for the accurate detection and genotyping of short indels from population scale sequence_data in this approach aligned sequence_reads from a population of individuals are used to automatically account for context specific sequencing_errors associated with indels we applied this approach to population sequence_datasets from the genomes exon pilot_project generated using the roche and illumina sequencing_platforms and were able to detect a significantly_greater number of indels than reported_previously comparison to indels identified in the genomes pilot_project demonstrated the sensitivity of our method the consistency in the number of indels and the fraction of indels whose length is a multiple of three across different human populations and two different sequencing_platforms indicated that our method has a low false_discovery finally the method represents a general approach for the detection and genotyping of small_scale dna sequence_variants for population scale sequencing_projects small insertions_and bp represent the second most frequent class of variation in the human_genome after single_nucleotide snps although indels exhibit_greater potential to disrupt functional_elements than snps indels have to whom correspondence should be addressed been characterized to a significantly lesser extent and are greatly underrepresented in public variation databases there are two main reasons for this i snps are more abundant in the genome and are easier to genotype using arrays and ii indels are more difficult to detect reliably using sequencing_data sequencing of the first individual genome using the sanger method bydemonstrated that short indels are frequent in the human_genome previously performed a populationscale characterization of short indels in the human_genome by resequencing genes in individuals using the sanger method generated a genome_wide map of indels by analyzing sanger resequencing data in recent_years several highthroughput dna_sequencing have emerged that are able to generate gigabases of dna sequence_data in a single instrument run these next_generation ngs methods offer_greater potential to detect indels compared with sanger_sequencing since each allele is sequenced independently multiple times indeed whole_genome of several individuals using high_throughput platforms has demonstrated the presence of several hundred thousands of short indel variants per genome indels can be identified from sequence_reads by performing gapped_alignment of reads to a reference_sequence several alignment tools developed for next_generation data allow gapped alignments seefor a survey of after reads have been aligned the presence of multiple reads that support the same insertion_deletion event can be used to call indels however it can often be challenging to identify moderately long indels from short_sequence since each read is aligned independently to the reference_genome further reads that span an indel event close to the ends of a read are difficult to align with gaps and can potentially be misaligned resulting in false snps the problem of misaligned reads can be alleviated by locally realigning reads using information from reads that are informative about the presence of an indel many tools for doing local realignment of short_reads have recently been developed once reads have been aligned to a reference_sequence as accurately as possible the next challenge is to distinguish true indels from sequencing_errors and alignment artifacts several methods have been developed to detect single_nucleotide using sequence_data generated from individual_genomes and
