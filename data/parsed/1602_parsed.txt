epistasis detection on quantitative phenotypes by exhaustive enumeration using gpus motivation in recent_years numerous genome_wide have been conducted to identify genetic_makeup that explains phenotypic_differences observed in human population analytical tests on single loci are readily available and embedded in common genome_analysis software toolset the search for significant epistasis genegene_interactions still poses as a computational challenge for modern day computing systems due to the large number of hypotheses that have to be tested results in this article we present an approach to epistasis detection by exhaustive testing of all possible snp_pairs the search_strategy based on the hilbertschmidt independence criterion can help delineate various forms of statistical dependence between the genetic_markers and the phenotype the actual implementation of this search is done on the highly parallelized architecture available on graphics_processing rendering the completion of the full search feasible within a day availability the program is available at http www mpipsykl mpg de epigpuhsic the field of bioinformatics matures into a stage of development where the common association search of significant univariate single_nucleotide snp to a particular phenotype reveals few novel insights in the underlying_biological involved new endeavors must be undertaken to address potential higher_order interactions existing among genes in view of revealing underlying common mechanisms in more complex_diseases a brute_force exhaustive approach currently poses as a computational challenge in human studies the number of snp can be in the order of millions resulting in the number of possible snp pair combinations in the order of the number of individuals can likely be in the range of tens_of in large study cohorts both dimensions will continue to grow as technological advancement continues on its steady incline approaches based on search_space pruning and exhaustive_search have been adopted for the study on genegene_interactions in genome_wide filtering by main effects to create a subset of snps on which all possible interactions are tested for fails to capture high significance pairs with low main effects and the more generalized form demonstrated by are based to whom correspondence should be addressed on space search reduction strategy but is limited to homozygous snps and the noted speedup factor has not been substantial for large_sample the most compelling search_space pruning method developed byhas overcome these shortcomings but is limited to tests based on contingency_tables where classes on the phenotype exist as tools involved in collecting data improve the software and computational strategy employed for the analysis should be refined to accommodate for these changes and should not limit the type of investigation that can be undertaken in kam a difference of pearsons correlation_coefficients between binary phenotypes across all possible snp_pairs has been developed this approach of a difference in correlation_coefficients is not only mathematically appealing for its simplicity and from a practical standpoint for the comparative ease with which it can be computed but is also interesting and appealing from a biological standpointit ties up the concepts of epistasis with the evolutionary concept of co selection of unlinked loci this search protocol was implemented on graphics_processing gpus using the available parallel_computing capability to reduce the search time by several orders_of compared to single core cpu based computation however this method is strictly limited to binary phenotypes when the recorded phenotypes are of quantitative nature differences of test measures cannot be performed between classes clusters of datasets as compared to the binary or qualitative phenotype counterparts where classes of subjects preexist this article aims to present the steps that were taken to overcome this severe limitation and extend this method to quantitative phenotypes the proposed search_strategy performs an exhaustive_search for interaction significance across all snp_pairs against a quantitative phenotype the method is derived from the hilbertschmidt independence criterion hsic developed by furthermore the implementation is done on commercially_available gpus to reduce the financial_costs and search time the actual timing measure will depend largely on the marker coverage size and computer resource utilized however the order of speedup factor is consistently observed throughout this article is structured in the following order it will first extend the correlation difference method developed for binary phenotypes in kamto quantitative phenotypes by demonstrating it as an instance of hsic the proposed method is applied on a set of simulated_data and a set of real_data in the results section improved_efficiency is measured between the gpu_implementation and its cpu counterpart validation is determined by a comparison to the significance of the interaction_term using linear_regression fit page i i i
