structural_bioinformatics prediction of protease substrates using sequence and structure features motivation granzyme_b grb and caspases cleave specific protein_substrates to induce_apoptosis in virally infected and neoplastic_cells while substrates for both types of proteases have been determined_experimentally there are many more yet to be discovered in humans and other metazoans here we present a bioinformatics method based on support_vector svm learning that identifies sequence and structural_features important for protease recognition of substrate peptides and then uses these features to predict novel substrates our approach can act as a convenient hypothesis generator guiding future_experiments by high_confidence identification of peptide protein_partners results the method is benchmarked on the known substrates of both protease types including our literature curated grb substrate set grbah on these benchmark sets the method outperforms a number of other methods that consider sequence only predicting at a true_positive tpr and a false_positive fpr for caspase substrates and a tpr and a fpr for grb substrates the method is then applied to proteins in the human_proteome to generate a ranked_list of predicted substrates of each protease type two of these predictions aif and smn were selected for further experimental analysis and each was validated as a grb substrate availability all predictions for both protease types are publically available at http salilab org peptide a web_server is at the same site that allows a user to train new svm models to make predictions for any protein that recognizes specific oligopeptide ligands contact proteinpeptide specificity is an important biological_phenomenon there are many systems in which a protein recognizes a specific to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as amino_acid often falling on a flexible solvent exposed region of another protein such systems include the modular scaffolding pdz_domains which recognize_specific sequences on the c terminal tails of their substrates multifunctional sh_domains which recognize a linear motif of the form pro xaa xaa pro and class i mhc proteins which bind nine residue peptides with specificity varying across different mhc_molecules here we focus on the proteinpeptide specificity of the proapoptotic proteases granzyme_b grb and caspases interacting with their respective protein_substrates grb is a serine_protease delivered by natural_killer into virally infected and tumor_cells the caspases are a family of endogenous cysteine_proteases activated by extracellular death ligands and environmental_stresses both protease types recognize and cleave specific peptide_sequences containing an aspartic_acid on their target substrates activating different pathways that lead to cell_death identifying these substrates has led to a wealth of knowledge about how the proteases contribute to apoptosis how the cleavage events lead to cell_death and which substrates to target for therapeutic purposes substrates of the two protease types have been discovered with a variety of experimental_techniques ranging from low_throughput gel based_methods to proteomic efforts that can identify hundreds of cleaved proteins however different datasets overlap only partially indicating that many substrates remain to be identified for example two proteomics_studies respectively reported and caspase_cleavage sequences although the high_confidence overlap between the two sets was only in to reduce this gap accurate computational_techniques could be used to predict proteinpeptide interactions for guiding further focused experiments a number of approaches have been taken in the systems described for pdz interactions examples of such methods include position_specific and bayesian_inference sh binding_partners have been predicted with neural_networks and mhc_class interactions have been predicted with support_vector svms finally molecular_docking methods have been developed to analyze both systems computational_methods have also been applied to predict substrates recognized by grb and caspases these methods take advantage of both protease types having a near absolute requirement for asp at the p position while allowing degenerate preference for different residue_types in the positions immediately surrounding p these studies rely on fixed sequence searches pssms based on frequencies of residue_types in known cleavage_sites and positional scanning combinatorial substrate libraries ps scls svms using residue composition around the cleavage_site and bayesian neural_networks cleavage sequences for both grb and caspases are generally thought to occur on flexible disordered_regions of substrates however it was previously shown in an analysis of caspase substrate structures that many of these known cleavage_sites are in helices and even occasionally on strands this observation motivates the choice of a machine_learning algorithm that relies on the structure as well as sequence_information here we describe such a protocol incorporating svm learning the method is trained and benchmarked on separate pools consisting of known grb and caspase_cleavage sequences it is then applied to the human_proteome to generate a list of high_confidence predictions for experimental_validation two such candidates are the proteins aif and smn which are experimentally_validated as being cleaved by grb the approach has the potential to provide greater coverage of substrates for both grb and caspases and can be easily adapted to other proteinpeptide systems through our web_server that can learn from any user supplied proteinpeptide training_set
