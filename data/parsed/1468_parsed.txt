structural_bioinformatics do x dna a tool to analyze structural fluctuations of dsdna or dsrna from molecular_dynamics simulations the do x dna package has been developed to analyze the structural fluctuations of dna or rna during molecular_dynamics simulations it extends the capability of the dna package to gromacs md trajectories and includes new methods to calculate the global helical axis of dna and bending fluctuations during simulations the package also includes a python module dnamd to perform and visualize statistical_analyses of complex data obtained from the trajectories availability_and the source_code of the do x dna is available at https github com rjdkmr do x dna under gnu gplv_license a detailed documentation including tutorials and required input_data are freely_available rjdkmr github io do x dna interactions of double_helical nucleic_acids namely dsdna and dsrna with proteins are essential for several biological_processes including dna_replication transcription translocation or packaging to understand the functional mechanism of these processes structural_properties of nucleic_acids have been probed using both experimental and computational studies in particular molecular_dynamics md_simulations have been widely_applied to study the roles of nucleic_acids in biological_process at atomic_resolution in this context several structural_descriptors frequently need to be calculated from the md_simulations gromacs a widely used open_source md_simulation software_package does not offer tools to calculate such structural_descriptors of the dsdna or dsrna presently two software_tools dna and curves are available to calculate these descriptors of nucleic_acids using a pdb input_file these two packages have been extended for use with md trajectory files in either pdb or amber format however these packages cannot be used directly with binary format trajectories trr xtc and topology parameter tpr files generated by gromacs therefore we have developed the do x dna package which directly takes gromacs input_files calculates structural_descriptors frame wise using the dna package and generates output_files in text format these files can be further used for statistical_analyses however these output_files potentially contain large_amounts of data particularly as microseconds simulations are becoming routine consequently analyses of raw_data obtained from do x dna can be challenging to address this problem we additionally developed the python module dnamd which contains several methods to extract and analyze raw_data that were previously calculated using the do x dna the current_implementation was tested with simulation trajectories of a dsdna which was either unbound or bound to the protein channel of phi bacteriophage in md_simulations subsets of these tests are available online as tutorials at above described website the tutorials exemplify the use of dnamd to characterize the impact of protein binding on the dsdna structure the do x dna package extends the efficient and straightforward application of the existing dna package to md_simulations note that the curves package contains a program canal which was specifically developed for analyzing data obtained from md_simulations however this package uses amber trajectory and topology files and generates limited results in text format output_files do x dna can be used directly for gromacs and also for namd or amber trajectories after converting them into trr xtc or pdb format a pdb_file can be used instead of a gromacs tpr file a major advantage of using the do x dna is the availability of the python module dnamd which provides ample flexibility in direct analyses of large and complex raw_data the dnamd module can be used in a python script in combination with other mathematical modules such as numpy or scipy to perform rapid mathematical and statistical calculations the obtained results can be visualized by using the matplotlib module as shown_inand d as described in the tutorials moreover the dnamd module offers an additional feature over other available tools namely analysis of helical axis bending by calculating either its curvature or tangent angles using frenet serret formula overall the do x dna package offers an efficient and flexible implementation to quantify and analyze several structural_descriptors of dsdna or dsrna during md_simulations
