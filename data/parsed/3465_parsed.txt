pattern_recognition methods to relate time profiles of gene_expression with phenotypic_data a comparative_study motivation comparing time courses of gene_expression with time courses of phenotypic_data may provide new insights in cellular_mechanisms in this study we compared the performance of five pattern_recognition methods with respect to their ability to relate genes and phenotypic_data one classical method k means and four methods especially developed for time series short time series expression miner stem linear_mixed mixtures dynamic time warping for omics and linear modeling with r bioconductor limma package the methods were evaluated using data available from toxicological_studies that had the aim to relate gene_expression with phenotypic end_points i e to develop biomarkers for adverse_outcomes additionally technical_aspects influence of noise number of time points and number of replicates were evaluated on simulated_data results none of the methods outperforms the others in terms of biology linear modeling with limma is mostly influenced by noise stem is mostly influenced by the number of biological repli cates in the dataset whereas k means and linear modeling with limma are mostly influenced by the number of time points in most cases the results of the methods complement each other we therefore provide recommendations to integrate the five methods comparing time courses from different types of measurements is an important topic in biological_research because it contributes toward understanding the response of complex cellular_systems to perturbations in particular in toxicogenomics which stands for the application of omics_technologies to toxicology comparing time courses of gene_expression with time courses of phenotypic endpoints i e biomarkers for the adverse_outcomes induced by a chemical compound may help to distinguish gene_expression changes related to toxicity from changes not related to toxicity thepresent study focuses on comparing time courses of gene_expression with time courses of phenotypic_data also called phenotypic anchoring of gene_expression data phenotypic anchoring may provide additional insight in the response to perturbations that cannot be generated by analyzing gene_expression alone various statistical_tools can be used for phenotypic anchoring including pattern_recognition pattern_recognition includes clustering e g k means classification e g support_vector and model reduction e g principal_component biological_entities belonging to the same cluster are assumed to be functionally_related in this study five representative pattern_recognition methods were chosen first we included a clustering method that is able to remove random_patterns called short time series expression miner stem removing random_patterns is important for datasets with a high number of variables compared with the number of time points secondly dynamic time warping for omics dtw omics a method that takes_into time delays in biological_processes is considered in contrast to clustering_methods which treat all variables in the dataset as equivalent entities dtw omics treats the phenotypic_data as predefined profiles and searches for genes matching these profiles using a distance_metric thirdly linear_mixed lmm mixtures a clustering method correcting for variability between replicates is discussed furthermore we applied k means a classical clustering method for static data finally we used a regression_method linear modeling with the r bioconductor_package limma to find relationships between gene_expression and phenotypic endpoints the five methods were compared with respect to their ability to extract functionally_related groups of genes their sensitivity to measurement noise the influence of the number of time points and the influence of the number of biological_replicates the technical_aspects influence of noise number of time points and number of replicates were evaluated on simulated_data mimicking real expression and phenotypic_data the biological outcome was evaluated exploiting two public datasets from toxicogenomics applying pattern_recognition methods to toxicogenomics time series of both microarrays and phenotypic endpoints can provide new hypotheses about interactions of the genome with the adverse_outcome of exposure to a toxicant these new hypotheses will guide wet laboratory experiments e g knock_down experiments that aim to verify such new relationships in this study we evaluated five pattern_recognition methods the main focus is on methods developed for time series methods except k means which we added to the study in order to assess the impact of time dependencies on pattern_recognition another method for static data that has been frequently_applied to time series is weighted correlation network_analysis wgcna which combines correlation_analysis with hierarchical_clustering clusters obtained by applying static based_methods on time series are often less biologically coherent than clusters determined with time series methods however this could not be observed from this study stem lmm mixtures and k means treat all the genes and endpoints as equivalent entities and cluster them all together as a consequence several endpoints may end up in the same cluster and some clusters will have no endpoints in our study having several endpoints within the same cluster was found upon applying stem lmm mixtures and k means having two or more endpoints within the same cluster has the advantage that similarity between the two endpoints is explicitly known a drawback of having two endpoints in the same cluster is that one cannot really assess whether any particular gene in the cluster is more strongly associated with one endpoint than the other another drawback is that one can have only certainty that the gene_expressions really match the profile of the endpoint if the endpoint is at the center of the cluster dtw omics treats the endpoints as profiles and matches each of the genes to these profiles limma uses the endpoints as fixed_effects in a regression_model as a consequence for dtw omics and limma each cluster has only one endpoint and a gene can match more than one endpoint or none clustering_methods that do not correct for random_patterns like lmm mixtures and k means divide the datasets into large_clusters this mostly leads to a large amount of pathways related to a large number of biological_processes correcting for random_patterns like stem results in smaller gene_lists which has the advantage that these lists are mostly easier to interpret a disadvantage is that if two variables are highly_correlated to one of the model profiles by coincidence the two variables would also be in the same cluster which leads to false_positives another drawback is that in cases when the variable is not correlated to one of the model profiles it is not taken into account for further analysis in this way information may be lost while stem lmm mixtures k means and limma find gene_expression modifications that covary simultaneously with the investigated endpoints dtw omics allows time lags and delays because of this property results from applying the dtw omics approach are more influenced by the number of time points than the two other time series methods limma is more sensitive to noise than the other methods lmm mixtures and limma need biological_replicates for modeling the random_effects while stem dtw omics and k means in principle can be applied without having replicates however this is not recommended because it decreases the accuracy of stem and to a lesser extent of dtw omics and limma stem and dtw omics both use a permutation_test for calculating significance permutation_tests assume independence between subsequent time points which can be disadvantageous in case clear trends are observed in the data lmm mixtures clustering and limma take into account variability between replicates the consequence of having a low number of replicates is that variability the random effect in the model can be overestimated or underestimated for lmm mixtures underestimation respectively overestimation of the variability between replicates leads to clustering too strictly respectively not strict enough and as a consequence may generate false_negatives respectively false_positives another disadvantage of lmm mixtures and of model_based in general is that the algorithm is slow compared with other methods for limma underestimation respectively overestimation of the variability between replicates has influence on variance shrinkage and leads to decreased respectively increased sensitivity to detect relationships between genes and phenotypic endpoints which in its turn leads to false_negatives respectively false_positives for all five methods studied pathway and go analysis of these gene_lists provided pathways and go terms that have been previously related with exposure to the particular toxicant or with one of its adverse_outcomes see_supplementary the hallmarks of cancer review biological_processes related to all types of cancer and the signaling_pathways involved in those biological_processes those hallmarks are sustaining proliferative signaling evading growth suppressors avoiding immune destruction enabling replicative immortality tumor_promoting inflammation activating invasion and metastasis inducing angiogenesis genome_instability and mutation resisting cell_death and deregulating cellular energetics because b a p is a carcinogen and menadione causes hepatocellular_carcinoma pathways known to be involved in the hallmarks of cancer provide biologically_relevant hypotheses to test in follow_up experiments for b a p in particular signaling_pathways related to dna_damage are relevant examples are signaling_pathways involving p nfkb and myc for menadione pathways related to oxidative_stress provide relevant hypotheses signaling_pathways influenced by oxidative_stress given in martindale and holbrook include pathways involved in growth_arrest cell_proliferation senescence and apoptosis all five methods provide biologically_relevant pathways and go terms that are related to the exposure to the toxicant or its adverse_outcomes e g cancer oxidative_stress see figs and supplementary_material section therefore in terms of retrieving biologically relevant_information there is no method that outperforms the others if we compare the results of limma the only regression_based model in the study with the results for the other correlation and distance based_methods we observe the following lmm mixtures positively relate the pathway direct p effectors to dna_adducts while limma finds a negative relationship four genes of direct p effectors are in both the genes lists resulting from lmm mixtures and limma analysis pcna tnfrsf b lif and bax which means that these four genes have a positive correlation with dna_adducts but a negative regression_coefficient this can be explained as follows the regression_coefficient of the limma model gives the relationship between gene_expression and dna_adducts when all other variables in the model treatment time are held_constant this means that the positive relationship observed by determining similarities between the time profiles was due to another confounding variable this shows an advantageous property of limma namely correcting for confounding_factors for the menadione dataset dataset limma cannot find any pathways related to oxidative_dna while all other methods generate a pathway list for this dataset applying dtw omics results in detecting some pathways that cannot be found without time warping one of these pathways is related to the hallmarks of cancer this shows the relevance of having a method taking_into time delays applying the methods for phenotypic anchoring described in this article results in poorly overlapping gene_lists this is a general_problem of clustering_algorithms there are several reasons for the lack of consistency between methods first parameters optimal_number thresholds are determined by statistical means and not on biological_properties second differences in output are due to different intrinsic_properties of these methods limma is a regression_method while the other methods are based on similarity_measures correlation distance other differences in intrinsic_properties taking_into time dependencies delays variance correcting for random_patterns are shown in for static based_methods several attempts have already been undertaken to address_these wgcna selects thresholds based on scale_free topology a network property previously observed in biological_networks consensus clustering attempts to combine the different approaches capturing the advantageous properties of each methods however to our knowledge similar attempts have not been undertaken for methods developed for time series taking_into time dependencies and delays in summary we conclude that all five methods are suitable for extracting new hypotheses concerning gene phenotypic endpoint relationships and none of the five methods outperforms the others in terms of biology furthermore all methods have their limitations because these methods provide complementary results we recommend developing a method that integrates the results from the different methods a possible way to do this is to calculate a weighted score for the probability of each geneendpoint relationship based on the accuracy of the methods simulation_experiments can guide the choice of the weight for each method for example because stem was highly influenced by the number of biological_replicates we decrease the weight for stem when having less replicates in a similar way we can adapt the weight of k means and limma according to the number of time points we can then multiply the false_discovery for each pathway with this probability score in order to correct for inaccuracies due to the low number of replicates and or time points
