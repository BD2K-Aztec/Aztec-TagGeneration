systems_biology drug cell_line browser interactive canvas visualization of cancer drug cell_line viability assay datasets recently several high profile studies collected cell_viability data from panels of cancer_cell treated with many drugs applied at different concentrations such drug_sensitivity data for cancer_cell provide suggestive treatments for different types and subtypes of cancer visualization of these datasets can reveal patterns that may not be obvious by examining the data without such efforts here we introduce drug cell_line browser dcb an online interactive html data visualization_tool for interacting with three of the recently_published datasets of cancer_cell drug viability studies dcb uses clustering and canvas visualization of the drugs and the cell_lines as well as a bar graph that summarizes drug effectiveness for the tissue of origin or the cancer_subtypes for single or multiple drugs dcb can help in understanding drug response patterns and prioritizing drug cancer cell_line interactions by tissue of origin or cancer subtype availability_and dcb is an open_source web_based that is freely_available at patient derived cancer_cell have long been used as experimental_models for tumor_biology in cancer research these cell_lines preserve the genomic transcriptomic and proteomic features of tumor_cells and emulate tumor_cells response to stimuli a drug that substantially inhibits the growth of a cancer cell_line would potentially suppress the progression of its tumor of origin cell_viability measure the number of live cells in response to treatment by drugs applied in different concentrations this type of assay is used to test the efficacy of a drug for inhibiting the growth or killing cancer_cell a cancer cell_line is considered sensitive to a drug if it has low viability when the drug is applied at low concentration screening many cancer_cell with many drugs applied in many concentrations can be used to match tumors with the most likely effective drugs these drugs could potentially be used to eventually treat individual patients aberrant tumor_growth through rapid cell_proliferation could be attributed to malfunction of many pathways the regulatory_networks that regulate cell_proliferation and tumor_growth in cancer are wired differently from cell_line to cell_line and such intricacies imply that different drugs targeting different pathways would have different effects on different cell_lines yet until recently efforts to screen drugs against cell_lines in high_throughput were impeded by the amount of cell_viability that could be performed in a reasonable time in recent_years however the technology for high_throughput cell_viability has been developed and several datasets consisting of tens_of cell_viability experiments have been published these datasets include cell_viability of dozens of drugs applied to hundreds of cell_lines analysis and visualization of such data can potentially uncover informative patterns that would have direct therapeutic_potential here we present drug cell_line browser dcb a html web_based application that uses canvas clustering to visualize three recent cell_viability assay datasets from the cancer_cell ccle project from the genomics of drug_sensitivity gds in cancer project and from an anticancer compound study for breast_cancer dcb comprises two canvases one in the middle to visualize cancer_cell and the other on the right to visualize drugs on the cancer cell_line canvas each tile represents a cancer cell_line and the tiles are colored by tissue of origin or by level of clustering where brighter colors mean high neighborhood similarity cell_lines are clustered by tissue type basal gene_expression similarity mutation status and response to drugs vector on the drug canvas each title represents a drug and the tiles are colored by how similar they are based on their sensitivity profile structure shared targets and gene_expression induced by the drugs the tissue bar graph panel on the right lists tissues in lexicographical order the colors of tissues match to the colors of cancer cell_line tiles in the tissue view mouse hovering on a cancer cell_line tile displays its name and highlights its tissue of origin on the tissue panel mouse hovering on a drug tile shows its name scrolling with the mouse wheel on the cancer cell_line canvas enables zooming in and out and dragging the canvases allows panning tiles on the cancer cell_line canvas can be labeled by the label cell_lines selection on the left users may need to zoom in to read the cell_line name labels users can focus on a specific tissue using the filter by cell_type selection if a tissue is selected the cancer cell_line canvas will show only cancer_cell of the selected tissue clicking on a cancer cell_line on the canvas shows the top most associated sensitive drugs on the drug canvas a slider can be used to adjust the percentage of drugs that are shown similarly clicking on a drug on the drug canvas shows the top mostassociated sensitive cancer_cell for the drug on the cancer cell_line canvas a slider can be used to adjust the percentage of cell_lines that are shown additionally the tissue panel shows the significance of sensitivity of each tissue to that drug the black line on the panel delineates significance threshold of p the significance is calculated based on the number of sensitive cancer_cell for a particular tissue for a drug using the fishers_exact besides clicking on the drug canvas drugs can be chosen from a drop down menu dcb visualizes three datasets gds ccle and heiser et_al in the heiser dataset all cell_lines are derived from breast_cancer and are colored by subtypes instead of tissue of origin consequently the tissue panel shows subtypes instead of tissues overall dcb can be used to identify opportunities for cancer drug_discovery and drug_repurposing visualization of cancer_cell from gds and their sensitivity to the drug sb a raf inhibitor only top of the most associated sensitive cell_lines are highlighted on the cell_line canvas with circles the tissue panel shows that the tissue that is most significantly sensitive to sb is skin this is consistent with the known role of b raf is many melanomas
