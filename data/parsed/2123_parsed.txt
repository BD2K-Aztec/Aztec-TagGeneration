graph regularized dual lasso for robust eqtl_mapping motivation as a promising tool for dissecting the genetic_basis of complex_traits expression_quantitative eqtl_mapping has attracted increasing research interest an important issue in eqtl_mapping is how to effectively integrate networks representing interactions among genetic_markers and genes recently several lasso based_methods have been proposed to leverage such network information despite their success existing_methods have three common limitations i a preprocessing_step is usually needed to cluster the networks ii the incompleteness of the networks and the noise in them are not considered iii other available information such as location of genetic_markers and pathway_information are not integrated results to address the limitations of the existing_methods we propose graph regularized dual lasso gdl a robust approach for eqtl_mapping gdl integrates the correlation structures among genetic_markers and traits simultaneously it also takes_into the incompleteness of the networks and is robust to the noise gdl utilizes graph_based regularizers to model the prior networks and does not require an explicit clustering step moreover it enables further refinement of the partial and noisy networks we further generalize gdl to incorporate the location of genetic makers and gene pathway_information we perform extensive experimental_evaluations using both simulated_and experimental_results demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively integrate various available priori_knowledge and significantly_outperform the state of the art eqtl_mapping methods availability software for both c version and matlab version is available atexpression quantitative_trait eqtl_mapping aims at identifying single_nucleotide snps that influence the expression_level of genes it has been widely_applied to dissect genetic_basis of complex_traits several important issues need to be considered in eqtl_mapping first the number of snps is usually much larger than the number of samples second the existence of confounding_factors such as expression heterogeneity may result in spurious_associations third snps and genes usually work together to cause variation in complex_traits the interplay among snps and the interplay among genes can be represented as networks and used as prior_knowledge however such prior_knowledge is far from being complete and may contain a lot of noises developing_effective models to address_these in eqtl studies has recently attracted increasing research_interests in eqtl studies two types of networks can be utilized one is the genetic interaction_network charles modeling genetic_interaction e g epistatic effect between snps is essential to understanding the genetic_basis of common diseases since many diseases are complex_traits another type of network is the network among traits such as the proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network or the gene_co interacting_proteins or genes in a ppi_network are likely to be functionally_related i e part of a protein complex or in the same biological_pathway von effectively utilizing such prior network information can significantly improve the performance of eqtl_mapping shows an example of eqtl_mapping with prior network knowledge the interactions among snps and genes are represented by matrices s and g respectively the goal of eqtl_mapping is to infer associations between snps and genes represented by the coefficient matrix w suppose that snp ffl is strongly associated with gene c using the network prior the moderate association between snp ffi and gene a may be identified since ffi and ffl a and c have interactions to leverage the network prior_knowledge several methods based on lasso have been proposed in the group_lasso penalty is applied to model the genetic interaction_network in and the authors consider groupings of genes and apply a multi task lasso penalty in the authors further extend the model to consider grouping information of both snps and genes these methods apply a hard clustering of snps genes so that a snp gene cannot belong to multiple groups however a snp may affect multiple genes and a gene may function in multiple pathways to address this limitation in the authors develop a model allowing overlap between different groups despite their success there are three common limitations of these group penalty based_approaches first a clustering step is usually needed to obtain the grouping information to address this limitation introduce a network based fusion penalty on the genes however this method does not consider the genetic interaction_network a two graph guided multi task lasso approach is developed in to make use of gene_co and snp correlation network however this method does not to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons

prior_knowledge the second limitation of the existing_methods is that they do not take into consideration the incompleteness of the networks and the noise in them von for example ppi_networks may contain false interactions and miss true interactions von directly using the grouping penalty inferred from the noisy and partial prior networks may introduce new bias and thus impair the performance third in addition to the network information other prior_knowledge such as location of genetic_markers and gene pathway_information are also available the existing_methods cannot incorporate such information to address the limitations of the existing_methods we propose a novel approach graph regularized dual lasso gdl which simultaneously learns the association between snps and genes and refines the prior networks to support soft clustering allowing genes and snps to be members of multiple clusters we adopt the graph regularizer to encode structured penalties from the prior networks the penalties encourage the connected nodes snps genes to have similar coefficients this enables us to find multiple correlated genetic_markers with pleiotropic_effects that affect multiple correlated genes jointly to tackle the problem of noisy and incomplete prior networks we exploit the duality between learning the associations and refining the prior networks to achieve smoother regularization that is learning regression_coefficients can help to refine the prior networks and vice_versa for example in if snps and have strong associations with the same group of genes they are likely to have interaction which is not captured in the prior network an ideal model should allow to update the prior network according to the learned regression_coefficients gdl can also incorporate other available prior_knowledge such as the physical location of snps and biology pathways to which the genes belong the resultant optimization_problem is convex and can be efficiently solved by using an alternating minimization procedure we perform extensive empirical evaluation of the proposed method using both simulated and real eqtl datasets the results demonstrate that gdl is robust to the incomplete and noisy prior_knowledge and can significantly improve the accuracy of eqtl_mapping compared to the state of the art methods as a promising tool for dissecting the genetic_basis of common diseases eqtl study has attracted increasing research interest the traditional eqtl methods focus on testing the associations between individual snps and gene_expression a major_drawback of this approach is that it cannot model the joint_effect of a set of snps on a set of genes which may correspond to biological_pathways recent advancement in high_throughput biology has made a variety of biological interaction networks available effectively integrating such prior_knowledge is essential for accurate and robust eqtl_mapping however the prior networks are often noisy and incomplete in this article we propose novel graphregularized regression_models to take into account the prior networks of snps and genes simultaneously exploiting the duality between the learned coefficients and incomplete prior networks enables more robust model we also generalize our model to integrate other types of information such as snp locations and gene pathways the experimental_results on both simulatedthe most significant go
