data_and subacon a consensus algorithm for unifying the subcellular_localization data of the arabidopsis proteome motivation knowing the subcellular_location of proteins is critical for understanding their function and developing accurate networks representing eukaryotic biological_processes many computational_tools have been developed to predict proteome_wide subcellular_location and abundant experimental_data from green_fluorescent gfp tagging or mass_spectrometry ms are available in the model plant arabidopsis none of these approaches is error_free and thus results are often contradictory results to help unify these multiple data_sources we have developed the subcellular arabidopsis consensus subacon algorithm a naive_bayes classifier that integrates computational_prediction experimental gfp and ms localizations proteinprotein_interaction and co expression data to derive a consensus call and probability subacon classifies protein location in arabidopsis more accurately than single predictors availability subacon is a useful tool for recovering proteome_wide subcellular_locations of arabidopsis proteins and is displayed in the suba database http suba plantenergy uwa edu au the source_code and input_data is available through the suba server http suba plantenergy uwa edu au subacon html and the arabidopsis subproteome reference asure training_set can be ac cessed using the asure web_portal http suba owing to the tight relationship between subcellular_compartments and protein_function proteome_wide protein_localization is an important goal in cell_biology direct identification of proteins in subcellular_compartments via mass_spectrometry ms remains the most popular large_scale approach in crude and compartment enriched samples however despite significant technological_progress experimental_data are not error_free contributing to overlapping or contradicting datasets the green_fluorescent gfp_tagged protein approach is generally more accurate but labor and time intensive resulting in small study sizes with only a few high_throughput studies though the low coverage makes gfp insufficient as a stand alone dataset for proteome_wide localization this methodology remains one of the most widely_accepted by biologists with the help of manual_curation from the literature previously scattered ms and gfp data for arabidopsis can now be found aggregated in locations including suba uniprotkb_swiss and tair these aggregated_data present a valuable resource for accessing large_scale protein_localization datasets association data such as proteinprotein_interaction ppi and transcript co expression analyses help assess the proteome in terms of functional clusters given that proteins in functional pathways tend to more often co locate than not these data contain indirect experimental_evidence for location both co expression and ppi associated protein_sets are enriched for same location protein groups and ppi data have been suggested previously to be resources for predicting subcellular_location of proteins in multiple eukaryotic_species less is known about the value of co expression data for predicting co location despite the widespread use of co expression networks to infer shared function these voluminous expression datasets have remained a relatively untapped data resource for subcellular_location prediction many proteome_wide subcellular_location predictors have been developed based on sequence properties various machine_learning and pattern_recognition approaches have proved popular for this purpose including support_vector svm k nearest_neighbor knn neural_networks and hidden_markov each bears individual advantages and shortcomings in terms of the number of required features the danger of over fitting and the ability to handle multiple optima single machine_learning can be stacked into dual algorithms which have to whom correspondence should be addressed shown some improvements in accuracy the majority of predictors derive subcellular_location using protein sequence_features associated properties and or gene_ontology and curator annotations sequence_based predictors attempt to identify sequence_patterns in the primary protein_sequence that target_proteins to individual organelles distinct machine_learning often yield different results from similar or identical inputs with surprisingly poor overlap the often incongruent results from predictors are probably the main_reason why experimental_data remain_the for most biologists despite the unresolved difficulties associated with the experimental_approaches given the lack of a single best method for inferring subcellular_location concepts that use all available knowledge about proteins are attractive approaches for forming a consensus view integrating varied data_sources has been used in yeast mitochondrial studies where this approach revealed promising new insights into genes involved in mitochondrial_functions in arabidopsis various resources for interrogating aggregate location information exist in general none of these plant databases addresses the challenge of unifying the data for large_scale single location calls including confidence values previously we reported on database extensions within the suba database including the mention of an initial version of the subcellular arabidopsis consensus subacon algorithm that integrates gfp and ms data together with computational predictors here we fully describe the development of the bayesian_classifier subacon that uses aggregated computational predictor outputs direct ms gfp localizations and now also indirect ppi and co expression data to produce consensus calls for subcellular_locations of arabidopsis proteins additionally we then analyze the subacon calls to assess their usability for biologists we found that subacon increased subcellular_localization classification_accuracy and offers localization probability_values that enable the user to interpret conflicting observations and predictions as well as extract consensus location datasets for large_scale protein_sets for further use the subcellular_localization of proteins is a critical step toward understanding protein_function and developing networks representing the biological_processes within eukaryotic_cells several tools have been developed to predict subcellular_locations to help fill gaps in experimental_datasets as experimental_data resources grow and the number of predictors increases new strategies are needed to integrate this multifaceted information subacon integrates published predictors and four experimental_data types to generate a probability_distribution of subcellular_location for each arabidopsis protein this objectively weighs individual predictors and experimental_data to assign proteins to a location or locations more accurately than any of the input predictors or data can alone subacon implements a naive_bayes algorithm which is the simplest form of a bayesian_network and assumes that all inputs are independent input variable independence in real_life is nearly impossible to meet but nevertheless naive_bayes classifiers often perform comparably or superior to other more complex algorithms not relying on this criterion of the predictors used in this study at least half used similar protein properties to generate the location calls however it is the generated location calls that act as the actual naive_bayes input variables and as these did not correlate strongly supplementary and overlap surprisingly poorly supplementary we considered that independence criteria were met based on the naive_bayes theory redundant or weak predictors do not worsen the classification_performance but can provide significant noise_reduction and performance improvement when used integrated benefits of selecting informative predictors but omitting redundant ones have been reported in previously_developed ensemble predictors e g prolocalizer as well as knn single algorithms and voting systems or svm in contrast to the latter studies we did not omit any predictor or data channel this avoids overfitting data to asure by selecting asurespecific non redundancies as well as omitting potential information benefiting classification these strategies have been discussed as the main strength of the naive_bayes over other integration methodologies furthermore naive_bayes networks can handle many dimensions of information and are superior to other classifiers when large_numbers of variables are being considered we integrated four independent experimental_data types into subacon similar large_scale integration of experimental localization data into algorithms as a prediction has not been reported for arabidopsis but a recent report has indicated that experimental_evidence derived by automated mining of annotations abstracts or proteome databases similar to suba has been a valuable improvement on top of sequencebased predictions subacon uses manually_curated gfp as well as ms ppi and co expression data that cannot be accessed using automated text_mining all four data types contributed to improving classification_accuracy assessment of classification improvement for each type of experimental_data showed that despite the overall highest improvement achieved by ms it was the gfp tagging data that contributed most for the proteins where these data are available further we have shown that ppi data despite being a small dataset have informative same location properties while such data have been shown to be effective for location prediction in yeast they have been underused in arabidopsis until now similarly co expression data have been widely used for predicting function but not subcellular_location in arabidopsis the present study has shown that co expression alone is highly informative of location for the plastid and endoplasmic_reticulum in addition it has analytical value for other compartments that rivals some sequence_based predictors within coverage we have built subacon in a modular_structure allowing easy integration of new datasets and predictors subacon will be retrained regularly on updating experimental localization data in suba in light of the strong influence of experimental_data on classification outcome this will be a key aspect of upto date classification in the context of systems_biology approaches knowledge of proteome_wide subcellular_locations is an important component for defining functional neighborhoods and deducing metabolic and signaling_networks within complex eukaryotic_cells we anticipate subacon to be a broadly_applicable and helpful tool for experimentalists and modelers requiring systematic information on arabidopsis proteins or homologs from other plants
