gene_expression correcting for the bias due to expression specificity improves the estimation of constrained evolution of expression between mouse and human motivation comparative_analyses of gene_expression data from different species have become an important component of the study of molecular_evolution thus methods are needed to estimate evolutionary_distances between expression_profiles as well as a neutral reference to estimate selective_pressure divergence between expression_profiles of homologous_genes is often calculated with pearsons or euclidean_distance neutral divergence is usually inferred from randomized data despite being widely used neither of these two steps has been well studied here we analyze these methods formally and on real_data highlight their limitations and propose improvements results it has been demonstrated that pearsons distance in contrast to euclidean_distance leads to underestimation of the expression similarity between homologous_genes with a conserved uniform pattern of expression here we first extend this study to genes with conserved but specific pattern of expression surprisingly we find that both pearsons and euclidean_distances used as a measure of expression similarity between genes depend on the expression specificity of those genes we also show that the euclidean_distance depends strongly on data_normalization next we show that the randomization procedure that is widely used to estimate the rate of neutral evolution is biased when broadly expressed genes are abundant in the data to overcome this problem we propose a novel randomization procedure that is unbiased with respect to expression_profiles present in the datasets applying our method to the mouse and human gene_expression data suggests significant gene_expression conservation between these species changes in gene_expression have been suggested to underlie many differences in gene function or in phenotype more generally expression is an important component of gene function and studying the evolution of gene_expression is a key_step in evolutionary genomics while there has been a great_deal of research concerning the primary treatment of expression data in general see andfor reviews there has been little investigation into the methods used more specifically to quantify expression evolution this can make it difficult to critically_assess contradictory results such as the reports that broadly expressed genes are more conserved or less conserved than specifically expressed genes to assess whether and how much expression has been conserved between two orthologous_genes by selection we need an expectation for expression similarity under neutral evolution thus the estimation of gene_expression conservation requires two components i a measure of gene_expression similarity and ii the expected value of the divergence level under neutrality the two most common measures of similarity between expression_profiles of orthologous_genes are pearsons_correlation and euclidean_distance the results obtained with pearsons and euclidean_distances have been reported to be poorly correlated this poses the question which of these measures provides a better description of expression similarity it has been demonstrated that pearsons_correlation in contrast to euclidean_distance underestimates the expression similarity between orthologous_genes with a conserved uniform pattern of expression in consequence use of the euclidean_distance has been encouraged for neutral evolution one expects that similarity between expression_profiles of orthologous_genes gradually decreases with time for species that have diverged for sufficiently_long time no detectable similarity in expression is expected to remain this has been postulated to be the case between mouse and human million years it has been suggested that such large neutral divergence could be approximated by calculating the distance between expression_profiles of randomly_chosen pairs of genes from the species compared the standard approach used to generate random pairs of genes is to permute the orthology relationship between them here we show formally and empirically that in contrast to previous_reports there exists a relationship between the pearsons_correlation and the euclidean_distance which depends on the data_normalization we also extend the previous study ofby considering more than just the uniform pattern of expression we demonstrate that in fact both distance measures depend on the expression specificity of analyzed genes next we discuss these observations in the context of the assessment of gene_expression conservation we show that the comparison of expression_profiles for randomly permuted gene_pairs is biased when broadly expressed genes are abundant in the data a distribution characteristic of many datasets to overcome this problem we propose a novel procedure to generate random gene_pairs this procedure is not biased by the over or underrepresentation of any expression_profile in the datasets finally we use our approach to provide_clear for constrained evolution of gene_expression between mouse and human
