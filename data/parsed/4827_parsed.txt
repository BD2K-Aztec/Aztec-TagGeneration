genome_analysis using sybil for interactive comparative_genomics of microbes on the web motivation analysis of multiple_genomes requires sophisticated tools that provide search visualization interactivity and data export comparative_genomics datasets tend to be large and complex making development of these tools difficult in addition to scalability comparative_genomics tools must also provide user_friendly interfaces such that the research scientist can explore complex data with minimal technical expertise results we describe a new version of the sybil software_package and its application to the important human pathogen streptococcus_pneumoniae this new software provides a feature rich set of comparative_genomics tools for inspection of multiple genome structures mining of orthologous gene_families and identification of potential vaccine_candidates availability the s pneumoniae resource is online at http strepneumo sybil igs umaryland edu the software database and website are available for download as a portable virtual_machine and from http sourceforge net_projects sybil the increasing throughput and reduced_cost of second and thirdgeneration dna_sequencing has resulted in a deluge of genome sequence_data in the public_domain these require efficient bioinformatics_tools enabling visualization and mining of multigenome comparisons such tools are difficult to develop because of the size and complexity of such large_scale comparisons the challenge is to develop a tool that can be flexible extensible and usable while providing the following four basic_features search visualization interactivity and export as is typical in bioinformatics the biological problem defines the needed software development of sybil has been focused on manual data_mining efforts which give the user the power to navigate countable numbers of genomes in search of potentially important biological_features as datasets become larger and less manageable the comparative_genomics tools of the future will need to adapt to provide meaningful_information without overwhelming the user sybil has addressed this problem by transitioning from a system capable of drawing a handful of genomes to one that is able to handle genomes
