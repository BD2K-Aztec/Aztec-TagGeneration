data_and annotating genes and genomes with dna_sequences extracted from biomedical articles motivation increasing rates of publication and dna_sequencing make the problem of finding relevant_articles for a particular gene or genomic_region more challenging than ever existing text_mining approaches focus on finding gene names or identifiers in english text these are often not unique and do not identify the exact genomic location of a study results here we report the results of a novel text_mining approach that extracts dna_sequences from biomedical articles and automatically maps them to genomic_databases we find that of open_access articles in pubmed central pmc have extractable dna_sequences that can be accurately mapped to the correct gene and genome we illustrate the utility of data extracted by text genome from more than pmc articles for the interpretation of chip_seq and the design of quantitative reverse_transcriptase rt_pcr experiments conclusion our approach links articles to genes and organisms without relying on gene names or identifiers it also produces genome_annotation tracks of the biomedical_literature thereby allowing researchers to use the power of modern genome_browsers to access and analyze publications in the context of genomic_data availability_and source_code is available under a bsd_license from http sourceforge net_projects text genome and results can be browsed and downloaded at http a common challenge encountered by many biomedical_researchers is to obtain a summary of the relevant_literature pertaining to a particular gene or genomic_region with nearly articles added to medline on a daily basis http www nlm nih gov bsd index stats comp html it is increasingly difficult to keep up with the rapid pace of publication outside ones immediate domain of expertise the problem of finding relevant_articles for a particular locus is becoming more acute as researchers increasingly adopt high_throughput microarrays genomewide_association high_throughput etc these to whom correspondence should be addressed genome_wide approaches often generate low_level data on thousands of genes or genomic_regions the interpretation of which becomes much more valuable when integrated with previously published_studies on individual_loci the challenge of linking articles to genes is partially solved for a limited number of model_organisms where dedicated teams of curators scan the literature and link publications to gene records in individual model_organism databases such as flybase or through federated multi organism databases such as entrez_gene however these collections are not comprehensive and for the majority of species including human efforts to curate genearticle associations remain incomplete in principle automatic linking of articles to genes could be achieved by developing text_mining tools that detect gene names or identifiers in abstracts or full_text however gene names are not consistently used and are often not unique and developing accurate methods to resolve and disambiguate gene names in text and link them to database_identifiers remains an active area of research even with curated or automatically generated links between articles and genes the exact genomic_sequences referred to in an article currently can only be determined by human interpretation of the full text furthermore specific_questions such as which transcript was cloned which exon was amplified or where in the genome is a particular mutation found can take considerable time for an individual researcher to answer often requiring laborintensive manual interaction between the literature and genomic_databases for publications where authors report dna_sequences directly these problems could be solved if all published_sequences were systematically sent to primary sequence_databases such as genbank however in the post genomic era fewer articles report primary dna_sequences directly and instead only report primers used for polymerase_chain pcr based techniques that are designed from published genome_sequences furthermore in contrast to longer dna_sequences journals generally do not require deposition of short primer sequences in databases and the minimum sequence_length required for a genbank submission is bp http www ncbi nlm nih gov sitemap samplerecord html as such many dna_sequences that could provide unique tags to link articles to specific genes and genomes remain locked in the biological_literature the possibility that dna and protein_sequences can be extracted from biomedical_text was first demonstrated byand subsequently by several other groups in an age of rapidly increasing amounts of dna sequence_data and published_literature finding peer_reviewed experimental_results for a sequence of interest is more time consuming than ever here we show that dna_sequences in full_text provide a rich source of unique identifiers that can be automatically extracted and mapped to genomic_data in order to link articles to species genes and genomic_regions we confirm recent_findings that a substantial number of oa articles in pmc contain extractable dna_sequences and provide the first quantitative estimate of the proportion of pmc oa articles with dna_sequences the majority of which we show are short_sequences that are not found in genbank our study is also unique in that it presents the first attempt to apply sequence extraction_techniques at a large_scale to all types of both full text and supplementary data_files and in fact may be the first systematic application of text_mining to supplementary files in any domain our observation that the majority of nucleotides in the pmc oa corpus were extracted from supplementary files underscores the increasing reliance of authors to deposit important information contained in these files as well as the importance of using these resources for biological data_mining and requiring ancillary research data to be persistently stored together with the main publication future work will be necessary to determine if the quality of data from full text differs in any way from that obtained in supplementary files we find that of speciesarticle and of genearticle associations predicted using text genome match those based on genbank submissions from articles discussing a single species or gene when compared with a state of the art text_mining method that attempts to associate articles to species or genes by named_entity text genome exhibits much higher performance than gnat for species or gene prediction thus if researchers are looking for genes specifically investigated at the molecular level in an article our results indicate that dna_sequences in text provide a richer source of information than gene names it is important to point out that our evaluation of these systems is benchmarked against genes from associated genbank sequence submissions spanning_a or organisms since many more genes are mentioned in the literature than are actually studied_experimentally and since gnat only recognizes genes for a limited set of species the performance of gnat on our genbank evaluation set may be reduced relative to benchmarks performed on gene names for both text genome and gnat system performance is related to the number of predictions made per paper the effects of multiple predictions are greater for genes relative to species for both systems and influence precision and recall differentially for text genome and gnat the difficulty that both systems have for gene prediction in documents that discuss many genes is consistent with the fact that human annotators do not always agree when asked to curate genes in articles depending on the dataset despite these differences there is a substantial degree of overlap between gnat and text genome genearticle mappings for some species such as human suggesting that future full text_mining systems could fruitfully integrate sequence extraction together with named_entity to predict genearticle associations in addition to providing bidirectional links between articles and genes or species text genome allows accessing the biomedical_literature using the powerful_tools of modern genome_browsers in this manner text genome joins a limited number of other hybrid text_mining genome bioinformatics systems that provide mechanisms to interpret the biomedical_literature via genome_browsers such as posmed and littrack http littrack chop edu cgi bin hgtracks however since posmed and littrack rely on gene name recognition methods and therefore can only map articles to the gene level genomic_coordinates must be inferred indirectly by these systems whether they are appropriate or not by mapping at the dna_sequence level itself text genome can directly identify the exact set of nucleotides in a genome_sequence that is analyzed in a study this distinguishing_feature of our system is critical for researchers studying non genic sequences such as cis regulatory_regions or mirna_binding database curators in these and other areas could use our system to aid in the prioritization and extraction of experimental_data from papers only of all medline articles are available at the moment for full text_mining in the oa section of pmc if we were to mine the full text and supplementary files of all million articles inpage
