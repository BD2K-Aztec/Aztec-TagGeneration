finding differentially_expressed regions of arbitrary length in quantitative genomic_data based on marked point_process model motivation high_throughput nucleotide_sequencing technologies_provide large_amounts of quantitative genomic_data at nucleotide_resolution which are important for the present and future biomedical researches for example differential analysis of base level rna expression data will improve our understanding of transcriptome including both coding and non coding_genes however most studies of these data have relied on existing genome_annotations and thus are limited to the analysis of known transcripts results in this article we propose a novel method based on a marked point_process model to find differentially_expressed genomic_regions of arbitrary length without using genome_annotations the presented method conducts a statistical_test for differential analysis in regions of various lengths at each nucleotide and searches the optimal configuration of the regions by using a monte_carlo we applied the proposed method to both synthetic and real genomic_data and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method next generation nucleotide sequencing_technologies such as illumina abi solid and sequencing_technologies have been revolutionizing biology and medicine by providing massive_amounts of quantitative genomic_data at nucleotide_resolution in a relatively short time and at a relatively low_cost this revolution has been making progress on for instance transcriptome including rna expression rna_seq and rna expression in transcription_start tss sage and cage protein dna_binding chip_seq epigenomics including dna_methylation and nucleosome_organization these vast_amounts of quantitative genomic_data have led to qualitative progress in our biomedical understanding because we now have large_amounts of genome_wide expression data at nucleotide_resolution there is an increasing interest in differential analysis which is a process to compare the expressions between different biological conditions of the quantitative genomic_data however most previous_studies of the differential analysis have depended on existing genome_annotations and were conducted by each gene robinson and smyth to whom correspondence should be addressed the differential_expression by smaller regions is important for a research on transcript_isoforms which are significant for understanding the regulation of gene_transcription thus it is important to develop a reliable method for differential analysis of base level quantitative genomic_data in order to proceed with the research on the regulation of gene_transcription therefore in this article we propose a novel method to find differentially_expressed regions of arbitrary length in the quantitative genomic_data the presented method searches the optimal configuration of non overlapped genomic_regions with differential_expression between distinct biological conditions for this purpose we use a point_process which is a statistical theory of point patterns and can model and analyze spatial data of points in many fields including ecology epidemiology seismology and computer vision in this study we use one dimensional marked point_process which is an extension of a point_process and has marks in each point of a point_process to model the genomic_data in our methodology each point corresponds to each nucleotide and the points have attributes which are called marks representing the genomic_regions of various lengths illustrates the gist of the proposed method and b shows virtual expression data in a certain gene in two biological conditions short red line segments inand d denote particular regions corresponding to a specific nucleotide there are many candidates of the regions and some of them overlap one another in the proposed method removes overlapped regions and regions that are not differentially_expressed it thus finds the optimal configuration of non overlapped regions with differential_expression as shown in note that it can detect the differentially_expressed regions that are shorter in length than this gene which has almost the same expression_level as a whole in the two conditions to search a good configuration of the regions we define a gibbs_energy function consisting of two terms data energy and prior energy the data energy is based on a statistical_test for differential_expression and the prior energy incorporates penalty for overlapping regions the gibbs_energy is minimized by using the reversible_jump rjmcmc or the birth and death dynamics coupled with the traditional simulated_annealing to find the optimal configuration of the marked points we use the birth and death dynamics in this study because the computational_cost is much more effective in the birth anddeath dynamics than rjmcmc and we also present a multiple_birth and death dynamics to deal with the regions of various lengths moreover we apply a novel smoothing method based on the second generation wavelets to find b virtual expression data in a certain gene in two biological conditions c horizontal red line segments denote candidates of differentially_expressed regions the left edge of the segments corresponds to a nucleotide d the proposed method finds differentially_expressed non overlapped regions from the candidates candidates of the boundaries of the genomic_regions prior to conducting the proposed method for finding differentially_expressed regions although this process is not necessary in principle it is useful to reduce the number of the candidates of the regions in advance in order to lower computational_cost the second generation wavelet_based smoothing method is more effective than the classical wavelet_based smoothing methods because it can smooth data and yet preserve sharp_edges which can be regarded as the boundaries of the regions in addition the presented method is versatile because it can be used to detect any kind of regions of interest by incorporating suitable data energy and analyze every type of nucleotide level quantitative genomic_data such as dna_methylation and nucleosome_organization data in this article we have presented a novel method based on a marked point_process model to find differentially_expressed regions of arbitrary length in quantitative genomic_data without depending on genome_annotations the proposed method is effective because it can locate differentially_expressed regions that previous_approaches such as genome segmentation fail to find this is highly important for genome science because we currently have large_amounts of quantitative genomic_data at nucleotide_resolution for instance i and b d differential analysis using the previous methods the y axis represents z_score of each region in c and d z_score between a and
