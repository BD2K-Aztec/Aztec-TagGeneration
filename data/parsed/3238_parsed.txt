systems_biology network_inference using steady_state data and goldbeter koshland kinetics motivation network_inference approaches are widely used to shed light on regulatory interplay between molecular_players such as genes and proteins biochemical_processes underlying networks of interest e g gene regulatory or protein signalling_networks are generally non linear in many settings knowledge is available concerning relevant chemical kinetics however existing network_inference for continuous steady_state data are typically rooted in statistical formulations which do not exploit chemical kinetics to guide inference results herein we present an approach to network_inference for steady_state data that is rooted in non linear descriptions of biochemical_mechanism we use equilibrium analysis of chemical kinetics to obtain functional_forms that are in turn used to infer networks using steady_state data the approach we propose is directly applicable to conventional steady_state gene_expression or proteomic_data and does not require knowledge of either network_topology or any kinetic_parameters we illustrate the approach in the context of protein phos phorylation networks using data simulated from a recent mechanistic_model and proteomic_data from cancer_cell in the former the true network is known and used for assessment whereas in the latter results are compared against known biochemistry we find that the proposed methodology is more effective at estimating network top ology than methods based on linear_models availability mukherjeelab nki nl code gk

biochemical data d and where available prior_knowledge regarding aspects of the topology over the last decade many methods for network_inference have been proposed see e g to date most methods for network_inference have been rooted in discrete or linear formulations as discussed in oates and mukherjee a a wide_range of existing_approaches can be viewed as variants of the statistical linear_model linear refers to linearity in parameters so that nonlinear basis_functions may be used within a linear framework moreover a number of approaches based_on odes are ultimately reducible to linear statistical_models as described in however the biochemical_processes underlying biological_networks are often highly non linear when the data generating process is non linear use of linear_models may produce inefficient or inconsistent estimation attributing causal status to artifacts resulting from model_misspecification indeed such bias can prevent recovery of the correct network even in favourable asymptotic limits of large_sample and low noise on the other hand in many settings non linear dynamical_models of relevant biochemical_processes are available for example gene_regulation may be modelled using michaelis_menten functionals and metabolism may be modelled using mass action chemical kinetics here we describe an approach by which kinetic_models can be used to inform network_inference from steady_state data as we show below such information can be valuable in guiding exploration of network_topologies kinetic formulations have been widely_studied in the systems_biology literature and recently there has been much interest in statistical_inference for such systems e g our work is in a similar vein but focuses on network to whom correspondence should be addressed inference per se and on the steady_state rather than time course setting although biochemical assays have become cheaper it remains the case that experimental_designs must often negotiate a trade_off between more conditions e g perturbations biological_samples and technical_replicates and temporal_resolution methodologies which can exploit knowledge concerning relevant dynamical_systems in the steady_state setting are therefore potentially valuable in brief we proceed as follows we consider a class of non linear biochemical dynamical_systems that are relevant to the biological_process of interest we focus on protein signalling discussed in detail later steady_state analysis leads to a class of functional_relationships between parent and child these functional_relationships are used to formulate a statistical_model for network_inference from steady_state data in this way network_inference is rooted in functional_relationships derived from non linear kinetics importantly we do not assume detailed knowledge of the dynamical system but only the broad class to which dynamics and associated equilibria may belong indeed the approach we describe does not require any kinetic_parameters to be known a priori nor knowledge of the network_topology and is in that sense directly comparable with conventional network_inference its potential_advantage stems from then rich yet constrained nature of the class of functional_relationships that are considered as recently discussed in non linear functional_forms can aid in identification of underlying causal_relationships we develop these ideas in the context of protein signalling mediated by phosphorylation enzyme_kinetics have been extensively_studied and dynamical formulations are widely available in the literature see e g for some proteins and pathways regulation has been studied in considerable causal and mechanistic detail indeed there exist detailed computational_models for canonical protein signalling_pathways which have been validated against experimental_data e g further proteomic_technologies now allow multivariate data_driven study of phosphorylation facilitating biological_validation of network_inference methodologies we take advantage of these factors to examine the performance of our approach using both simulated_and in the phosphorylation setting goldbeterkoshland kinetics form the functional class that underlies our network_inference approach goldbeterkoshland kinetics are well known to be capable of highly non linear behaviour including exquisite sensitivity it has been experimentally demonstrated that this so_called ultrasensitivity is biologically_relevant to signalling network_dynamics facilitating abrupt and precise decision_making e g we carry out statistical_inference in a bayesian_framework using reversible_jump rjmcmc to explore the joint model and parameter_space this yields posterior_probability scores for edges in the network that are analogous to scores obtained in existing statistical network_inference approaches for steady_state data the remainder of this article is organized as follows in section our approach is laid out followed by an exposition of the associated computational statistics in section we present results on data simulated from a recently_developed dynamical_model of the mitogen_activated mapk signalling that has been validated against experimental_data we then show results on real proteomic_data from breast_cancer finally section closes with a discussion of practical_implications and opportunities for network_inference based on functional models along with associated technical_challenges in this section we empirically assess our methodology and compare its performance against network_inference based on the linear_model in section we show results using a recently_published dynamical_model of the mapk signalling_pathway due to where the underlying_network is known exactly in section we apply our approach to a real proteomic dataset in both cases for fair comparison between different methods no informative model priors were used i e
