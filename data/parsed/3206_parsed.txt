data_and ncmine core peripheral based functional module detection using near clique mining motivation the identification of functional_modules from proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks is an important step toward understanding the biological_features of ppi_networks the detection of functional_modules in ppi_networks is often performed by identifying internally densely_connected subnetworks and often produces modules with core and peripheral proteins the core_proteins are the ones having dense connections to each other in a module the difference between core and peripheral proteins is important to understand the functional_roles of proteins in modules but there are few methods to explicitly elucidate the internal_structure of functional_modules at gene level results we propose ncmine which is a novel network clustering method and visualization_tool for the core peripheral structure of functional_modules it extracts near complete subgraphs from networks based on a node weighting_scheme using degree centrality and reports subgroups as functional_modules we implemented this method as a plugin of cytoscape which is widely used to visualize and analyze biological_networks the plugin allows users to extract functional_modules from ppi_networks and interactively filter modules of interest we applied the method to human ppi_networks and found several examples with the core peripheral structure of modules that may be related to cancer development availability_and the cytoscape_plugin and tutorial are available at cytoscape appstore http apps cytoscape org apps ncmine biological_relationships among genes or proteins such as gene coexpression and proteinprotein_interactions ppi are modeled as interaction networks or graphs where a node corresponds to a gene or a protein and an edge represents an interaction between the connected node pair interaction networks sometimes contain several densely_connected subnetworks which are recognized as functional_modules especially hartwell et_al emphasized the importance of understanding of interactions between modules when phenomenological analysis is performed proteins in the same subnetwork are considered to perform a specific biological task and tend to have related functions therefore the detection of functional_modules within a large interaction_network is one of the fundamental steps to understand the biological_functions of genes and proteins the task to find functional_modules in interaction networks is called the network clustering problem and many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose for example newman proposed a measure of modularity called q to quantify how well a network is divided_into a number of subnetworks globally and suggested a method to map the network clustering problem to the problem of maximizing q they tried to identify community_structures from various social and biological_networks in the biological fields developed the mcode method to find protein_complexes in ppi_networks the method first defines a score for each node which reflects the connectivity of the node and searches for groups of nodes with higher scores with a different approach developed cfinder which uses the clique percolation method cpm this method searches for k cliques complete graphs with k nodes and then combines the k cliques it can detect more dense subnetworks compared with other methods like mcode proposed nemo which employs a hierarchy based clustering strategy and uses a log odds score reflecting the degree of sharing neighboring nodes and used machine_learning to detect protein_complexes or functional_modules by a combination of topological of networks given as input_data and features of known protein_complexes graph_clustering problem is one of the most hot topics in the field of computer science and several algorithms are being developed recently all of these methods have distinct characteristics and could produce interesting biological modules but they are unable to handle an important feature of biological_networks that is overlap among modules careful investigations of biological_networks have suggested that some functional_modules in an interaction_network share the same nodes in other words some functional_modules have overlapping regions in the field of graph_theory this problem is called the soft clustering problem the importance of the soft clustering problem in biological_networks may be rephrased as the core peripheral structure of functional_modules when two tightly related protein groups share many proteins which is typical in a signal network cascade the two groups will be identified as a single functional module using the current hard clustering_methods from the viewpoint of a biological_network the core_proteins play_an in the module and peripheral proteins with fewer edges interact with a subset of core_proteins and may be involved in a specific function such as the regulation of the network previously_proposed methods cannot effectively elucidate the relationships between clusters that share proteins and produce many independent clusters when overlaps are permitted there exists few graph clustering_methods that also enables visualization of relationships between clusters to overcome_these of previous methods we developed a method called ncmine which focuses on the identification of modules in biological_networks and the extraction of biologically_meaningful clusters ncmine detects functional_modules from biological interaction networks by constructing local near cliques using a node weighting_scheme based on degree centrality and by iteratively merging local near cliques according to cluster overlap the combination of the local cluster construction phase and the merge phase enables the detection of overlapping proteins between modules and reveals relationships among modules at the same time the near clique is a graph_structure lacking a few edges compared with the complete graph clique or complete graphs are mathematically well studied and easy to enumerate but nearclique searches are quite difficult to implement several previous_studies have used clique detection_algorithms to find functional_modules but the clique is a stringent requirement for biological_phenomena because some elements of functional_modules may interact with only the part of the module i e a subset of its members and because experimental nose will hide some existing edges in the modules wu et_al first tried to find core peripheral structure for biological_networks wu et_al first searched for clusters and extended them to find peripheral nodes while our methods first searched for clusters merged the found clusters and identified core part of the overlapping clusters as described later
