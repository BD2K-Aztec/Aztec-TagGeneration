a non_negative method for detecting modules in heterogeneous omics multi_modal data motivation recent_advances in high_throughput omics_technologies have enabled biomedical_researchers to collect large_scale genomic_data as a consequence there has been growing interest in developing methods to integrate such data to obtain deeper insights regarding the underlying biological system a key challenge for integrative studies is the heterogeneity present in the different omics data_sources which makes_it to discern the coordinated signal of interest from source specific noise or extraneous effects results we introduce a novel method of multi_modal data analysis that is designed for heterogeneous data based on non_negative we provide an algorithm for jointly decomposing the data_matrices involved that also includes a sparsity option for high_dimensional settings the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data and on real dna_methylation gene_expression and mirna_expression data from ovarian_cancer obtained from the cancer_genome the results show the presence of common modules across patient samples linked to cancer related pathways as well as previously_established ovarian cancer_subtypes availability_and the source_code repository is publicly_available at https github com yangzi inmf technological_advances allow biomedical_researchers to collect a wide_variety of omics_data on a common set of samples data_repositories such as the cancer_genome tcga provide multiple types of omics_data thus enabling in depth investigation of molecular_events at different stages of biology and for different tumor_types however the latter task requires developing methods for data_integration a topic that has received increased attention in the literature in genomic studies the integration of multifaceted data is becoming increasingly viable and insightful cellular_signals and processes depend on the coordinated interaction and communication among a wide_variety of biomolecules including genes proteins metabolites and epigenetic_regulators there are multiple_layers in which regulation takes_place and therefore multiple vantage points from which to observe biological_activity a joint analysis of data on the same set of samples from multiple omics sources has potential to achieve more perceptive results over separate analyses as well as provide a more comprehensive global view of the biological system a key challenge for integration methods is dealing with heterogeneous data data from different sources are difficult to compare due to inherent discrepancies different genomic variables are measured and collected in different ways and they are associated with different types of noise and confounding_effects most importantly they represent different aspects of the biological system the discrepancy among data_sources contributes to a useful multifaceted view of the system but it also brings forth a new level of complexity that makes it hard to distinguish the coordinated signal there are many integration techniques that deal with the complexity of multiple sources by relying on prior_knowledge of the relationships that connect them some procedures seek to map different experimental_data types such as gene_expression ge mirna_expression me and copy_number to a common space of known biological_pathways or sets and references therein others select features or assign weights to features based on prior_knowledge possibly using such information in a linear based model or in a framework for identifying modules all these approaches require the consultation of an external resource such as signaling_pathways or gene_interaction while this supervised approach is convenient and sensible in certain respects it relies heavily on the external_information being valid and representative which is not always guaranteed even in the modern_era of data availability in addition relating variables based on previously_established findings can introduce an element of bias and subjectivity that hinders the discovery of new associations in contrast to such supervised approaches our objective is to develop an integration method that directly leverages the advantage of multiple data_sources to deal with heterogeneity in multiple datasets the signal of interest is typically common among all sources homogeneous while extraneous effects tend to differ across sources heterogeneous the main principle of our approach is to separate the homogeneous and heterogeneous effects among the sources to extract the coordinated signal from extraneous noise many existing integration techniques similarly make the distinction between common and distinct effects across sources such as those extending the dirichlet mixture_model and principal_component pca our proposed method extends an integrative non_negative nmf framework via a partitioned factorization structure that captures homogeneous and heterogeneous effects a novel tuning selection procedure allows the model to adapt to the level of heterogeneity among the datasets we apply our approach to an integrated study of ovarian_cancer involving three types of genomic variables and discover multi_dimensional modules exhibiting topological patterns of expression across known cancer related pathways as data_collection technologies improve and data_repositories expand the quality and accessibility of data from multiple biological_sources will continue to grow as a result the combined perspectives from internal signatures e g genes proteins and metabolites as well as external_information e g clinical status patient_history and environmental_factors are contributing to an increasingly rich and complex model of the biological system however the abundance and diversity of data is accompanied by the problem of heterogeneity both in the nature of data_sources and in the data_collection processes it is important for strategies of data_integration to evolve alongside these new challenges we have introduced a novel method of data_integration based on a classical matrix decomposition technique our method was applied to an integrative study of ovarian_cancer in which we discovered multi_dimensional modules consistent with previously_established variable based subtypes as well as observational clusters these modules express notable topological patterns among cancerrelated pathways suggesting a connection with underlying biomarker signatures associated with disease_subtypes the key merits of our approach are as follows as with jnmf inmf is able to detect coordinated signals across multiple datasets however inmf is also equipped to deal with issues arising from heterogeneous data with its more flexible factorization structure inmf is able to adapt to the level of disparity between the datasets to extract the joint signal of interest from heterogeneous confounders tomodules in heterogeneous multi_modal datadistinguish between common patterns spanning multiple sources and distinct patterns unique to individual sources is the first step for developing a proper integration procedure the basic framework of inmf leaves room for further regularization beyond sparsity one possibility is to consider relationships between individual variables from the same data source gene_gene or from different sources mirna gene or dm gene regulations another approach is to induce adherence to known biological_networks or observational relations by means of network statistics the main challenges are adapting the penalties to the nmf framework and finding effective strategies for tuning selection although our analysis examined several types of genomic variables our results capture only a snapshot of cancer_biology for future_investigations it may be fruitful to explore more types of genomic_data such as dna copy_number and mutation status or even clinical information it may also be worthwhile to expand the analysis to multiple types of cancers with the right tools having a wider selection of data_sources will only help in understanding complex disease mechanisms
