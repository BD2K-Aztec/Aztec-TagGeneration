correlations between predicted protein disorder and post_translational in plants motivation protein structural research in plants lags behind that in animal and bacterial_species this lag concerns both the structural analysis of individual proteins and the proteome_wide characterization of structure related properties until now no systematic study concerning the relationships between protein disorder and multiple post_translational ptms in plants has been presented results in this work we calculated the global degree of intrinsic_disorder in the complete proteomes of eight typical monocotyledon ous and dicotyledonous plant_species we further predicted multiple sites for phosphorylation glycosylation acetylation and methylation and examined the correlations of protein disorder with the presence of the predicted ptm_sites it was found that phosphorylation acetyl ation and o glycosylation displayed a clear preference for occurrence in disordered_regions of plant proteins in contrast methylation tended to avoid disordered sequence whereas n glycosylation did not show a universal structural preference in monocotyledonous and dicotyle donous plants in addition the analysis performed revealed significant differences between the integral characteristics of monocot and dicot proteomes they included elevated disorder degree increased rate of o glycosylation and r methylation decreased rate of n glycosylation k acetylation and k methylation in monocotyledonous plant_species as compared with dicotyledonous species altogether our study provides the most compelling_evidence so_far for the connection between protein disorder and multiple ptms in plants proteins with long disordered_regions often referred to as intrinsically_disordered idrs have been extensively investigated over the past several years they represent a broad class of proteins found more abundantly in eukaryotes than in bacteria or archaea it was estimated that more than one third of eukaryotic_proteins contain idrs of residues in length other bioinformatics studies indicated that more than half of eukaryotic_proteins possess idrs and of the proteins are mostly disordered the proteins with idrs are also widespread in plant proteomes with the overall proteome disorder content in different plant_species being typical for other eukaryotes these proteins fulfill important_cellular in plants often serving as the integrators of multiple regulatory and environmental signals they are abundant in the highly_regulated processes such as cellular_signaling and transcription it has been estimated that of all transcription_factors including those from arabidopsis_thaliana contain extended idrs and of signaling proteins have long disordered_regions idrs share some common sequence_features such as low_abundance of order promoting and high_abundance of disorder promoting amino_acids low sequence complexity poor sequence_conservation low mean hydrophobicity high net_charge etc at the structural level they are distinguished by the absence of stable secondary and or tertiary_structure high_flexibility elevated sheet propensity and ability to undergo disorder to order transition when involved in proteinprotein_interactions these interactions are characterized by high_specificity coupled with low_affinity ensuring their transient character selectivity and reversibility the specific sequence_features together with the experimental structure related databases have been used to develop specific predictors of intrinsic_disorder more than tools for protein disorder prediction have been developed up to now disordered protein regions are often involved in post_translational ptms it has been hypothesized based on empirical_evidence that ptm_sites are located predominantly in the easily_accessible and flexible idrs evidently some advantages exist for positioning ptm_sites within disordered_regions this location would facilitate the specific sequence_dependent association with modifying enzymes due to the high surface exposure and accessibility of the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an

disordered_regions in addition ptms would typically cause only small changes on the surface of a structured protein whereas large_scale structural changes such as disorderto order transition can be expected in a disordered region the larger structural changes would generally elicit a deeper impact on protein_function ensuring a stronger regulatory effect of ptms numerous past_studies addressed correlations between intrinsic_disorder and individual ptms in eukaryotic_proteins a wellestablished example includes protein_phosphorylation several papers consistently_reported that protein_phosphorylation on ser thr and tyr occurs predominantly in the disordered_regions of animal proteins recently this correlation has been confirmed in plant_species using a predictive tool for analysis of protein_phosphorylation in plants in addition correlations between intrinsic_disorder and glycosylation have also been investigated dissimilar structural preferences for the o linked and n linked protein_glycosylation have been reported reflecting differences in the catalytic_mechanisms of these ptms also several studies addressed correlations between intrinsic_disorder and the universal lys modifications such as acetylation and methylation it has been reported that acetylation and methylation showed a preference for occurrence in the disordered_regions of animal proteins however these reports were challenged by other researchers in the present study we analyzed proteome_wide correlations of protein disorder with the main types of eukaryotic ptms such as ser_thr tyr phosphorylation pro o glycosylation asn n glycosylation lys acetylation and lys_arg methylation in several typical monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant_species in agreement with the previous_studies we observed that phosphorylation acetylation and o glycosylation displayed a preference for occurrence in the disordered_regions of plant proteins however in contrast to the previous_results using combined datasets of eukaryotic_proteins we found based on the set of tools used in this study that methylation tended to occur in ordered protein regions also we found that n glycosylation did not show a clear preference for either ordered or disordered_regions of plant proteins
