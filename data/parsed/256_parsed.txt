systems_biology a multi_layer inference approach to reconstruct condition specific genes and their regulation an important topic in systems_biology is the reverse_engineering of regulatory_mechanisms through reconstruction of context dependent gene_networks a major_challenge is to identify the genes and the regulations specific to a condition or phenotype given that regulatory_processes are highly_connected such that a specific response is typically accompanied by numerous collateral effects in this study we design a multi_layer approach that is able to reconstruct condition specific genes and their regulation through an integrative_analysis of large_scale information of gene_expression protein interaction and transcriptional_regulation transcription_factor target_gene relationships we establish the accuracy of our methodology against synthetic datasets as well as a yeast dataset we then extend the framework to the application of higher eukaryotic_systems including human breast_cancer and arabidopsis_thaliana cold_acclimation our study identified tacstd trop as a target_gene for human breast_cancer and discovered its regulation by transcription_factors creb as well as nfkb we also predict kif c is a target_gene for er her breast_cancer and is positively regulated by e f the predictions were further confirmed through experimental_studies availability the implementation and detailed protocol of the layer approach is available atthe accumulation of high_throughput transcriptome_data has driven the development and application of computational_approaches to infer networks elucidate gene_regulation and identify targets initial network_inference based on gene_expression data were successful with prokaryotes however higher_eukaryotes systems with their higher number of genes provided many more candidate_genes several hundred and interactions more than a thousand e g this generates numerous hypotheses and with this sheer number most of the candidates cannot be investigated or validated through experiments making_it to assess the utility of the proposed approach on these systems generating too many hypotheses arises in part due to disconnect between the computational and biological assumptions applied in the models the direct applications of learning mining methods aim to infer functional interactions in accordance with certain presumed mathematical definitions which may not be appropriate in a biological_context for example biologically the candidate_genes specific to a phenotype usually refer to genes that assume a major response for a condition or to causal_genes involved in the development of a phenotype in contrast computationally statistical_analyses are applied to identify those that are expressed differentially that help to classify two conditions which does not define causal_genes in a biological_context interactions refer to direct_physical or regulatory_interactions whereas computationally the interactions inferred are statistical correlations between gene_expression that may not necessary indicate direct regulatory_relationships to address this challenge one could develop a model based on the biological_question to be addressed for example a correlation between two genes could suggest regulating being regulated or an indirect relationship in a biological_context the model of arance assumes indirect interactions should have lower correlations and is thereby able to predict transcriptional interaction by removing the indirect interactions alternatively incorporating physical_interactions by integrating proteinprotein_interaction ppi and proteindna p dna data with gene_expression data could help bridge and facilitate the interpretation of the computational results into biological_context in these previous_studies the genes are selected based on differential_expression and correlation_analyses and then superimposed onto a physical interaction_network which helped to interpret the identified genes interactions nevertheless the aforementioned approaches still will provide large_numbers of hypotheses with hundreds of genes and interactions identified in the reconstructed network notably a majority of the candidate_genes interactions are often related to general processes that are not specifically responsive to the condition being investigated with this large number of possible candidates literature_search to manually characterize many of to whom correspondence should be addressed these predicted candidates are typically performed to identify specific targets for further experimental_investigation based on ones expertise alternatively enrichment_analysis such as gene_set gsea and go http www geneontology org annotations have been applied in many reverse_engineering studies to interpret the results which provide understanding of the general processes involved rather than the direct molecular_mechanisms another challenge is that a majority of the reconstruction methods used to identify transcriptional interactions regulations are based on correlation however an absence of a correlation does not preclude a possible regulatory relationship e g posttranscriptionally regulated interactions including rna_processing post_translational e g phosphorylation or co factors of transcription_factors tfs note that analyses of gene_expression cannot distinguish the effect of rna_processing protein_modifications or protein co factors thus all these events are considered as post_transcriptional effects on the tf_activity in this study and throughout this article although more recently methods have been developed to uncover these potential post_transcriptional interactions notably these recent methods are not reconstruction approach in the strict sense and further require expert_knowledge that the user must provide for example the user has to provide the tf and target gene_pair along with a list of potential_regulators to determine the potential post_transcriptional modulators the overall objective here is to provide regulatory hypotheses that are more specific to the condition of interest rather than those related to general responses our approach separates the network_reconstruction into multiple levels each addressing a specific biological_question wherein a particular scenario of biological regulation is modeled there are two major_steps first is to identify the candidate_genes that are specific to the phenotype and have distinct expression pattern under the condition of interest layer i we note that the problem of generating too many hypotheses is because the predictions are not specific enough for example in biological_systems a specific and direct response to a perturbation usually is accompanied by a cascade of collateral effects on many genes and dozens of regulatory_modules in the network for example showed that in an experiment that knocked out the gal_gene in yeast and comparing the transcriptomes before and after the treatment showed that such modulation of a single pathway eventually caused a global effect throughout the whole biomolecular interaction_network the specific response of the knock_out experiment is the activation of the galactose processing_pathways by eliminating gal s repression on the gal transcription_factor nevertheless the repression of this one pathway resulted in hundreds of differentially_expressed and dozens of activated modules making_it to identify the essential trigger i e the specific pathway in response to the perturbation therefore in a typical network_inference or module analysis many of the genes and modules identified would likely be such side_effects or collateral responses rather than direct and specific effects for example in identifying the activity of the p gene in human liver network_analysis clustering and network_reconstruction based on correlation identified differentially_expressed traits spanning many general functional_modules including immune_response cell_cycle lipid_metabolism macromolecule biosynthesis and so forth this provides a rough measurement of the overall influence but it is difficult to identify from this list the specific pathway s that regulates these effects and to guide the experimental_design for further indepth functional studies therefore the specific responses are usually concealed by many less specific effects which are difficult to distinguished based on current network_analysis methods we address this challenge by taking an alternative approach to identify the target_genes that are specific for the condition of interest and which may not necessary be hubs in a network our approach compares the condition of interest with multiple conditions where the multiple conditions are grouped together which is in contrast to current studies that evaluate multiple conditions thus in this first step of our network_reconstruction framework we integrate microarray_data from a diverse set of conditions to provide a common context more and better controls for the expression behaviors of the genes and apply advanced feature_selection technique to identify the target_genes that are most specific to the condition being investigated incorporating these diverse conditions for comparison in the feature_selection of genes and interactions reduces the falsepositive rate and enhances the specificity the second step of our method identifies the tfs of these genes including post transcriptionally_regulated tfs by incorporating interaction data to account for the tf_activity beyond the expression_level of the tf thus from these specific target_genes identified in layer i the network is expanded in layer ii based on known and predicted interactions with these genes obtained from the ppi and proteindna networks which provides conditional gene regulations a filtering_approach based on mutual_information is applied to the physical interaction_network to reconstruct the regulatory_pathway from the candidate_genes in layer iii we infer the conditional tf_activity to identify the major regulators in the gene network accounting for posttranscriptional_regulation the multiple_layers of learning with their distinct biological assumptions at each level capture different biological_features in the regulation to achieve reconstruction of condition specific gene_networks that account for both transcriptional and post_translational molecular_interactions we establish the accuracy of our methodology against synthetic datasets as well as a yeast dataset finally we extend the framework to the application of higher eukaryotic_systems
