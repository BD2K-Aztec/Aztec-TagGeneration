state of the art prediction of hiv_protease cleavage_sites motivation understanding the substrate_specificity of human_immunodeficiency hiv pro tease is important when designing_effective hiv_protease furthermore characterizing and predicting the cleavage profile of hiv_protease is essential to generate and test_hypotheses of how hiv affects proteins of the human_host currently available tools for predicting cleavage by hiv_protease can be improved results the linear support_vector with orthogonal encoding is shown to be the best pre dictor for hiv_protease cleavage it is considerably better than current publicly_available predictor services it is also found that schemes using physicochemical_properties do not improve over the standard orthogonal encoding scheme some issues with the currently available data are discussed availability_and the datasets used which are the most important part are available at the uci machine_learning repository the tools used are all standard and easily available globally an estimated million people were living with human_immunodeficiency hiv_infection at the end of and roughly as many have died of hiv related_illnesses since the beginning of the epidemic hiv_protease also known as hiv retropepsin ec is an aspartyl_protease belonging to the retroviral protease retropepsin family the protease plays_a in the life_cycle of hiv the causative_agent of acquired_immune aids it cleaves the hiv polyproteins in multiple sites to create mature_protein components of the virions the infectious hiv particles because the formal discovery of hiv in the early s and the ensuing characterization of hiv_protease successful attempts have been made to create drugs that inhibit the protease these slow down or even stop the progression of hiv_infection to aids however the effectiveness of the treatment can decrease with time due to mutations in the virus today combinations of drugs with different mechanisms of action are often used to achieve high efficacy against the virus but as low_toxicity as possible to the patient although hiv therapy is one of the most successful pharmacotherapeutical achievements in the history of medicine it is not curative but rather transforms a deadly infection into a chronic one often with a prolonged asymptomatic_phase if properly treated a reliable predictor of cleavage by hiv_protease can be used to aid in the identification of novel hiv_protease substrates in human host_cells cf and aid in the understanding of the specificity and the development of even more tightly fitting and more potent hiv_protease in the future but hopefully with less severe side_effects such as metabolic_syndrome and gastrointestinal_symptoms the work may also be of help in prediction and understanding of other viral proteases in the future the hiv_protease specificity is considered to be both broad and specific it cleaves a variety of sequences but also processes the hiv_gag and gag_pol polyproteins accurately there are two different approaches to predicting cleavage by hiv_protease molecular_modeling and sequence_analysis it has been argued that the hiv_protease recognizes shape rather than a specific amino_acid which supports aiming for the molecular modeling_approach however the method is cumbersome and no large_scale study has been done on the accuracy of molecular modeling_approaches so it is very unclear if the approach is or will be competitive with the sequencebased approach this article demonstrates the current state of theart prediction which uses the sequence based_approach several bioinformatics researchers have attacked this problem during the last years using a diversity of methods for the most recent review see r gnvaldsson et_al it was early on claimed that the problem required non linear methods however years_ago it was demonstrated that the relatively few experimental_data octamers at the time did not support a non linear_model r gnvaldsson and five years later when more experimental_data were available linear methods linear support_vector lsvms still performed better than non linear ones this was when the methods were evaluated through out of sample testing on a large dataset from human proteins it was therefore speculated seefor the discussion that linearity could be a characteristic for the hiv_protease cleavage problem note that linear_and relate to when the standard orthogonal encoding is used a number of papers have been published on the subject over the last years the most common_theme in them is to introduce new features plus a feature_selection scheme and show that this yields slightly better prediction_accuracy when evaluated with cross_validation surprisingly few studies have used the experimental_data from the article by which is more than double the size of any other available dataset og ul used variable context markov_chains to construct a generative_model for the hiv cleavage specificity he reported the highest ever prediction_accuracies with this method evaluated with cross_validation created a number of different features and fused classifiers among others using genetic_programming gp their proposed classifiers performed better than a non optimized lsvm with standard encoding when evaluated using cross_validation their software is available jaeger and chen suggested new biophysical features and fused several classifiers neural_networks support_vector svms and decision_trees they reported that they often achieved better performance than just using a single classifier from this when evaluating with cross_validation suggested a feature_selection method where a multilayer_perceptron was trained and then used to compute the effect of the different inputs so that the best inputs were selected they reported that this gave a much smaller feature_set and better prediction_accuracy they tested this on a small dataset with cross_validation mapped the amino_acid to a local kernel space and reduced the dimensionality together with a lsvm classifier they reported that this was better than other methods when evaluated using cross_validation studied the specificity using cascade detection on two larger datasets and concluded that favorable cooperativity between sites is weak newell used the larger dataset from schilling and overall in his study g k and o zcerit studied several encoding schemes and suggested the oetmap encoding scheme based on amino_acid features together with a linear classifier this encoding improved the prediction_performance significantly compared with standard amino_acid encodings when evaluated on two larger datasets using crossvalidation g k and o zcerit used the larger dataset from schilling and overall their encoding schemes are available on a web_server http yufes yalova edu tr presented a web_server for predicting cleavage by many different proteases using support_vector together with many different features features were encoded with bi profile bayesian feature_extraction and selected using a gini score they used the larger dataset from schilling and overall plus other published_data on cleavage of full proteins their methods are available https prosper erc monash edu au used a correlation based feature subset selection method combined with genetic_algorithms to search for the best subset in a large set of features this gave better performance than the standard methods when evaluated with cross_validation o zt rk et_al used a sequence representation and introduced a feature_selection method that removed features they reported improved_prediction results with this when tested with cross_validation on a small dataset with only cleaved octamers their software is designed to work with the waikato environment for knowledge analysis weka and is available by email in summary many have claimed improvements over the lsvm using standard orthogonal encoding however few have taken the effort to check if their new features feature_selection method or model combination method really does better on out of sample data or if they are better than improvements suggested by others this is a significant weakness since there is a real risk of being overly optimistic about ones own algorithm if one has access to the data that it is tested on there are two motivations for mining hiv_protease cleavage data one is to describe the available experimental_data e g with sequence_motifs or cleavage rules the other is to design a method for predicting new cleavage_sites in the latter case which is by far the most common motivation the test data must be different from the data used to train the algorithm a correct evaluation of methods must be done on test data that have not in any way been involved in the training of the algorithms this is typically not done
