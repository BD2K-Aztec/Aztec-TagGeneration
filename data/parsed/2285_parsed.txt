sequence_analysis identification of context dependent motifs by contrasting chip binding data motivation dna_binding play crucial roles in the regulation of gene_expression transcription_factors tfs activate or repress genes directly while other proteins influence chromatin_structure for transcription binding_sites of a tf exhibit a similar sequence pattern called a motif however a one to one map does not exist between each tf and motif many tfs in a protein_family may recognize the same motif with subtle nucleotide_differences leading to different binding_affinities additionally a particular tf may bind different motifs under certain conditions for example in the presence of different co regulators the availability of genome_wide binding data of multiple collaborative tfs makes it possible to detect such context dependent motifs results we developed a contrast motif finder cmf for the de_novo identification of motifs that are differentially enriched in two sets of sequences applying this method to a number of tf_binding datasets from mouse_embryonic we demonstrate that cmf achieves substantially_higher accuracy than several well known motif_finding methods by contrasting sequences bound by distinct sets of tfs cmf identified two different motifs that may be recognized by oct dependent on the presence of another co regulator and detected subtle motif signals that may be associated with potential competitive_binding between sox and tcf a tf binds the promoter or enhancer region of a gene and in turn regulates the expression of the gene tf_binding tfbss have a similar pattern or a motif usually described by a positionspecific weight_matrix pwm a pwm is a w matrix ij w where each element ij represents the probability of nucleotide j a c g t being at position i w and w is the length of the motif each position is modeled independently and each row of a pwm sums to motif_discovery can be regarded as a missing_data problem in the sense to whom correspondence should be addressed that neither the locations of tfbss nor the motif parameters pwm are known many computational_methods have been developed for motif_discovery with most fitting into two broad categories those based on mixture_models and those based on discrimination mixture_models assume that a set of sequences consists of a mix of tfbss and background nucleotides while there are multiple approaches most methods_employ the em_algorithm or gibbs_sampling to identify tfbss and estimate pwms via iterative updating schemes these iterative approaches tend to rely on two steps first sequences are scanned given an estimated pwm and background model to produce a set of predicted sites secondly the pwm is updated using the predicted sites under the mixture_model the counts of nucleotides from predicted sites can be used to estimate the pwm in a closed form discriminative motif finders discriminators for short on the other hand use two sets of sequences usually a bound set and an unbound control set and attempt to find motifs that best distinguish between the two groups most discriminators aim to maximize a measure of separation between the two sequence_sets for example discriminating matrix enumerator dme uses a measure based on likelihood_ratio lr and fire uses mutual_information again these methods utilize iterative approaches to update a pwm such that their measure of separation improves however even with tfbss predicted there is generally no closed form estimation of the pwm under a discriminative model as such discriminators often discretize the parameter_space of the pwm to render discovery computationally_feasible and thus sacrifice accuracy in estimation recent improvements in genomic coverage by chromatin_immunoprecipitation microarrays chip_chip and the coupling of chip with high_throughput chip_seq have increased the number of bound regions identified while decreasing the width of such regions this increase in accuracy and data size now enables many motif finders to easily_identify the consensus motif of a tf we hypothesize however that a tf may have context dependent binding_patterns and believe that the accuracy of newer chip datasets along with the greater availability of such datasets can be leveraged to discover these patterns we are motivated by two possible context dependent tf_binding scenarios the first is a co regulation scenario where a tf binds dna with a cofactor in some sequences and binds alone or with a different cofactor in other sequences while the cofactor may haveits own motif the motif recognized by the original tf might be different when binding occurs with and without its cofactor the second is a competition scenario where two tfs share similar dna_binding that may compete for the same binding_sites here sequences can be split into two groups based on context i e the two tfs compete for the sequence versus only one tf_binding the sequence differences in the motifs between the two groups might provide insight into how each tf is targeted to its binding_sites here we propose a contrast motif finder cmf that aims to take advantage of multiple high_quality binding datasets to identify subtle regulatory_signals such as context dependent motifs within bound sequences cmf is specifically_designed to discriminate between two sets of bound sequences and provide a non discretized estimation of pwms this method takes_into false_positive sites when updating pwms and other model_parameters in this article we apply cmf to three recently_published genome_wide binding studies of tfs in mouse_embryonic escs each study used chip_chip or chip_seq to investigate tfs thought to play a role in esc pluripotency and self_renewal for details see supplementary_materials
