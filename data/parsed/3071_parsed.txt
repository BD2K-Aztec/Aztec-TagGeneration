data_and molclass a web_portal to interrogate diverse small_molecule screen datasets with different computational_models the molclass toolkit and data portal generate computational_models from user_defined small_molecule datasets based on structural_features identified in hit and non hit molecules in different screens each new model is applied to all datasets in the database to classify compound specificity molclass thus defines a likelihood value for each compound entry and creates an activity fingerprint across diverse sets of screens molclass uses a variety of machine_learning to find molecular patterns and can therefore also assign a priori predictions of bioactivities for previously untested molecules the power of the molclass resource will grow as a function of the number of screens deposited in the database availability_and the molclass webportal software_package and source_code are freely_available use at http tyerslab bio ed ac uk molclass a molclass tutorial and a guide on how to build models from datasets can also be found on the web_site molclass uses the chemistry development kit cdk weka and mysql for its core functionality a rest service is available at http tyerslab bio ed ac uk molclass api based on the opentox api bioactive_molecules can serve as powerful_tools for interrogation of biological_systems and or as precursors in drug_discovery an objective in chemical systems_biology is to model biological_systems in order to understand the effects of small_molecules on cellular_processes and thereby explain the basis for small_molecule action realization of this ambitious goal will require extensive experimental_datasets the generation of chemical datasets from biological screening assays is usually limited by cost and throughput pharmaceutical_companies and academic groups use high_throughput to test large_libraries of small_molecules that elicit a desired biological response typically against a single target or at most a few related targets however chemical_space is estimated to contain on the order of molecular_entities which greatly exceeds even the multi million compound libraries at the disposalthe user can examine the model statistics the likelihood scores for screens of interest and as shown in single_molecule likelihood fingerprints for existing_models finally molclass also enables a substructure search using the jme editor in the event a molecule of interest is not present in the database molclass provides a comprehensive_overview of compound activity in different screens these profiles can reveal promiscuous activities across several screens which may reflect undesirable off target effects for experimental_datasets the user can discover structure_activity because similar structures and activities will lead to specific likelihood patterns as the data_collection is expanded by users to different biological_responses and assay formats the classification power of the portal will increase and thereby facilitate chemical systems_biology
