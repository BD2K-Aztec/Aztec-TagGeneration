phenome driven disease genetics prediction toward drug_discovery motivation discerning genetic_contributions to diseases not only enhances our understanding of disease mechanisms but also leads to translational opportunities for drug_discovery recent computational_approaches incorporate disease phenotypic similarities to improve the prediction power of disease_gene however most current studies used only one data source of human disease phenotype we present an innovative and generic strategy for combining multiple different data_sources of human disease phenotype and predicting disease associated genes from integrated phenotypic and genomic_data results to demonstrate our approach we explored a new phenotype database from biomedical_ontologies and constructed disease_manifestation network dmn we combined dmn with mimminer which was a widely used phenotype database in disease gene prediction studies our approach achieved significantly improved_performance over a baseline method which used only one phenotype data source in the leave_one and de_novo gene prediction analysis our approach achieved the area under the curves of and which are significantly_higher than p e and p e for the baseline approach we further demonstrated that our predicted genes have the translational_potential in drug_discovery we used crohns_disease as an example and ranked the candidate_drugs based on the rank of drug_targets our gene prediction approach prioritized druggable genes that are likely to be associated with crohns disease_pathogenesis and our rank of candidate_drugs successfully prioritized the food_and drugs for crohns_disease we also found literature evidence to support a number of drugs among the top candidates in summary we demonstrated that a novel strategy combining unique disease phenotype data with system approaches can lead to rapid drug_discovery identifying the genetic_basis for human_diseases plays an important role in elucidating disease mechanisms and discovering targets of drug_treatments for computational strategies to predict disease associated genes integrating new data may lead to new discoveries traditional approaches exploited genomic_data and prioritized genes for a disease if the genes are functionally_similar to the known disease genes recent_studies incorporated clinical phenotype data to increase the ability of identifying new diseaseassociated genes assuming that similar disease_phenotypes reflect overlapping genetic causes however most current disease gene prediction_approaches
