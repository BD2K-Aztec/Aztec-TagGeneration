cnma a framework of encounter complex based normal_mode to model conformational changes in protein interactions motivation it remains both a fundamental and practical challenge to understand and anticipate motions and conformational changes of proteins during their associations conventional normal_mode nma based on anisotropic network model anm addresses the challenge by generating normal_modes reflecting intrinsic flexibility of proteins which follows a conformational selection model for proteinprotein_interactions but earlier_studies have also found cases where conformational selection alone could not adequately explain conformational changes and other models have been proposed moreover there is a pressing demand of constructing a much reduced but still relevant subset of protein conformational_space to improve computational_efficiency and accuracy in protein_docking especially for the difficult cases with significant conform ational changes method and results with both conformational selection and induced_fit models considered we extend anm to include concurrent but differentiated intra_and molecular_interactions and develop an encounter complex based nma cnma framework theoretical_analysis and empirical results over a large data_set of significant conformational changes indicate that cnma is capable of generating conformational vectors considerably better at approximating conformational changes with contributions from both intrinsic flexibility and inter molecular_interactions than conventional nma only considering intrinsic flexibility does the empirical results also indicate that a straightforward application of conventional nma to an encounter complex often does not improve upon nma for an individual protein under study and intra_and molecular_interactions need to be differentiated properly moreover in addition to induced motions of a protein under study the induced motions of its binding_partner and the coupling between the two sets of protein_motions present in a near native encounter complex lead to the improved_performance a study to isolate and assess the sole contribution of intermolecular_interactions toward improvements against conventional nma further validates the additional benefit from induced_fit effects taken together these results provide new insights into molecular_mechanisms protein interactions and new tools for dimensionality_reduction for flexible protein_docking availability_and source codes are available upon request proteins participate in many important_cellular through interactions with proteins nucleic_acids small_molecules and so on these interactions often occur with protein_motions and unboundto bound conformational changes which might exist at different space scales but are often found to be directly relevant to protein functions although it remains a fundamental challenge to fully understand and correctly anticipate these conformational changes theoretical_models describing proteinprotein or proteinligand_interactions have been proposed beyond the traditional key and lock model where proteins are treated rigid in particular the theory of conformational selection treats proteinto decipher and anticipate protein conformational changes we extended anm to include concurrent but differentiated intra_and molecular potentials developed a new framework of complexbased nma cnma to analyze protein_flexibility in the environment of encounter complexes and tested two ways of extracting useful normal_modes against a large_scale nonredundant set of protein conformational changes it was found important to differentiate intra_and molecular_interactions in the model in particular parameters defining shorter range d but preferably beyond the first layer interactions or less strength c for intermolecular_interactions improved the performance of approximating conformational changes apparently a straightforward application of conventional b the order of slowest modes after re ranking is given on the y axis from afar to near for each protein on the x axis with the change in ranking order shown on the z axis negative_values indicate a promotion in the order of the eigenvector after re ranking and positive ones indicate a demotion the colors indicated the overlaps between any given mode and the corresponding actual conformational changes warmer colors representing higher overlaps b the relationship between the power of cnma to approximate conformational changes and the quality of encounter complexes as input colors in each block represent the conditional_probability of rmsd reduction y axis given certain range of irmsd x axis of docked encounter complexes compared with bound complexes calculations were performed using the subvector approach with d and c at the first modes these parameters were not particularly optimized subvector approach with re ranking for proteins in geometrically fit encounter complexesaverage improvement against conventional nma on a the whole protein and c the interface and net success_rates against conventional nma on b the whole protein and d the interface i t oliwa and y shen nma to an encounter complex does not necessarily improve upon conventional nma for proteins under study our study provides additional support to both mechanisms of conformational selection and induced_fit for proteinprotein_interactions and calls for more generalized theoretical_models candidates include population shifts with contributions from both intrinsic flexibility and intermolecular_interactions our new modeling and analysis framework cnma produced modes better at approximating significant conformational changes than conventional intrinsic flexibility driven nma did interestingly the subvector approach outperformed the submatrix approach thanks to the incorporation of both induced motions of the protein under study and those of its binding_partner as well as the couplings between the two sets of motions the sole contribution of intermolecular_interactions toward performance improvement was further dissected and validated with a re ranking scheme applied to the subvector approach our study also provides new tools for dimensionality_reduction of conformational_space in flexible protein_docking a successful protein_docking method often involves the following critical_components that affect each other reduced and essential representation of conformational_space accurate energy function capable of discriminating native from non native conformations and effective conformational search or sampling strategy cnma focuses on improving conformational representation thus is assessed in a critical way using optimal_combination of its modes to isolate this component in practice any efficient search_strategy under the guidance of a well discriminatory energy function can be applied in the reduced conformational_space spanned by cnma modes to determine weights or coefficients for individual modes and to improve protein docking_results
