structural_bioinformatics raphael recognition periodicity and insertion assignment of solenoid protein_structures motivation repeat proteins form a distinct class of structures where folding is greatly_simplified several classes have been defined with solenoid repeats of periodicity between ca and being the most challenging to detect such proteins evolve quickly and their period icity may be rapidly hidden at sequence level from a structural point_of finding solenoids may be complicated by the presence of insertions or multiple domains to the best of our knowledge no automated methods are available to characterize solenoid repeats from structure results here we introduce raphael a novel method for the detection of solenoids in protein_structures it reliably solves three problems of increasing difficulty recognition of solenoid domains determination of their periodicity and assignment of insertions raphael uses a geometric approach mimicking manual classification producing several numeric parameters that are optimized for maximum performance the resulting method is very accurate with of solenoid_proteins and of non solenoid_proteins correctly_classified raphael periodicities have a spearman_correlation of against the manually established ones a baseline algorithm for insertion detection in identified solenoids has a q value of suggesting room for further improvement raphael finds highly confident repeat structures not previously annotated as solenoids in the protein_data records protein repeats contain tandem arrays of smaller structural_motifs where unlike most globular_domains folding is reduced to simple coiling and long_range are greatly_reduced repetitive proteins evolve quicker due to the intrinsically error_prone process connected with the formation of repeating sequences fourteen percent of all known protein_sequences are strictly periodic and it was hypothesized that repeating sequences occur more frequently in eukaryotic_proteins repeating sequences were estimated to occur in around one in three human proteins classification of repeating proteins is usually achieved in terms of repeat_unit length the length of the repeating_unit can be as small as one or two residues for different types of crystallites of unlimited size at the other extreme are repeating_units of entire domains beads on a string with a typical repeating_unit of over residues the middle ground comprises solenoid repeats with units of residues these are elongated structures containing helices and or strands with a large distance between the n and c termini there has been increasing interest in solenoid_proteins over the years especially their relevance in health and for protein_engineering applications solenoid_proteins have also been shown to fold sequentially one unit at a time suggesting that the sequence contains all necessary information to determine the local fold understanding solenoid function and evolution passes through their classification from sequence and structural_information which are two different problems solenoid sequences evolve quickly while maintaining their fold thereby hampering detection several sequence_based predicting tandem_repeats from self alignments have been developed over the years including radar trust and hhrepid our previous work repetita uses a fast_fourier to specifically_detect solenoids in all cases there is still room for improvement with the best methods still missing out many solenoids especially with insertions generally_speaking solenoid repeats tend to be easy to spot through visual_inspection in a molecular viewer however the manual_search of hundreds_or of structures to determine if they are solenoid repeats or not is extremely time consuming and inefficient moreover the definition of repeat_length i e repeating blocks containing similar residue numbers and detection of breaks in the periodicity require objective_measures to whom correspondence should be addressed
