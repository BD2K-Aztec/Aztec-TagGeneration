abcd arbitrary coverage design for sequencing based genetic_studies recent_advances have revolutionized genetic_studies although high_coverage can uncover most variants present in the sequenced sample low_coverage is appealing for its cost_effectiveness here we present abcd arbitrary coverage design to aid the design of sequencing based studies abcd is a user_friendly interface providing pre estimated effective sample_sizes specific to each minor_allele category for designs with arbitrary coverage and sample_size and for four major_ethnic europeans africans asians and african_americans in addition we also present two software_tools shotgun and designplanner which were used to generate the estimates behind abcd shotgun is a flexible short_read simulator for arbitrary user specified read_length and average depth allowing cycle specific sequencing_error and realistic read_depth distributions designplanner is a full pipeline that uses shotgun to generate sequence_data and performs initial snp discovery uses our previously presented linkage_disequilibrium aware method to call genotypes and finally provides minor_allele specific effective sample_sizes shotgun plus designplanner can accommodate effective_sample estimate for any combination of high depth and low depth data for example whole_genome low depth plus exonic high depth or combination of sequence and genotype data for example whole_exome plus genotyping from existing genomewide association study gwas availability_and abcd including its downloadable terminal interface and web_based interface and the associated tools shotgun and designplanner including documentation examples and executables are available atmassively parallel sequencing mps technologies have transformed the field of genomic studies high_coverage which is able to detect essentially every variant present in the sequenced individuals has been successful for the identification of genetic_variants causing mendelian_diseases but it remains cost prohibitive for large samples required for the study of complex_traits recent_studies have proposed low_coverage as a powerful alternative however there are no resources or software_tools that directly evaluate the statistical_power of an arbitrary coverage sequencing based design to quantitatively guide the design decisions here we present abcd arbitrary coverage design a user_friendly interface with pre estimated minor_allele maf and ethnicity specific effective sample sizeswhich is directly associated with power of subsequent association studies for a wide_range of sequencing based designs with average sequencing_depth ranging from to and sample_size ranging from to in addition we present shotgun and designplanner two software_tools that generate the effective_sample estimates behind abcd we anticipate abcd and the two associated tools will greatly_facilitate the design of sequencing based studies
