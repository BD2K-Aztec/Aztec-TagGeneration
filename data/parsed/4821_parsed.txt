using neighborhood cohesiveness to infer interactions between protein_domains motivation in recent_years large_scale studies have been undertaken to describe at least partially protein_protein maps or interactomes for a number of relevant organisms including human however current interactomes provide a somehow limited picture of the molecular_details involving protein interactions mostly because essential experimental information especially structural data is lacking indeed the gap between structural and interactomics information is enlarging and thus for most interactions key experimental information is missing we elaborate on the observation that many interactions between proteins involve a pair of their constituent domains and thus the knowledge of how protein_domains interact adds very significant information to any inter actomic analysis results in this work we describe a novel use of the neighborhood cohesiveness property to infer interactions between protein_domains given a protein_interaction we have shown that some clustering coefficients can be extended to measure a degree of cohesiveness between two sets of nodes within a network specifically we used the meet min coefficient to measure the proportion of interacting nodes between two sets of nodes and the fraction of common neighbors this approach extends previous_works where homolog coefficients were first defined around network nodes and later around edges the proposed approach substantially increases both the number of predicted domain domain interactions as well as its accuracy as compared with current methods availability_and http cellular_processes are regulated by an intricate network of proteinprotein_interactions ppis that form both transient as well as more permanent complexes different experimental_techniques are used to determine ppis however the molecular_details behind the interaction itself are usually not detected and require other types of assays to be determined in this context it is well known that protein_function is supported by the underlying_structure and thus solving the structure of protein_complexes is essential for a detailed understanding of theirfunction still the amount of interactomics data and the speed at which they are produced is substantially_higher than the pace at which protein_structures can be experimentally_obtained consequently the development of computational_methods to predict some of the details behind sets of proposed ppis is a must lacking experimental structural_information about a certain complex but having that information for its unbound constituent proteins probably the best approaches fall in the area of protein binding_site or protein_docking nonetheless most of these methods are only suitable when the structure of proteins have been solved at least partially this fact has motivated us to focus on the prediction of some characteristics of sets of ppis based on non structural_information in this way we have focused on the important observation that most proteins are composed of one or more domains connected by inter domain regions moreover many protein interactions involve a pair of their constituent domains and thus how a particular pair of proteins interacts is strongly driven by their domains the important case of intrinsically_disordered will be discussed in section consequently the knowledge of domain domain interactions ddis is of great value during the analysis of ppis helping for instance in the identification of potential_binding moya garcia and ranea the question whether ppis are mediated via a limited set of domain pairs has been approached in different works several studies found that some domain pairs were overrepresented in large_datasets of experimentally_determined ppis therefore the inferred domain pairs were shared by multiple interactions using a different type of analysis studied the relation between structurally derived ddis and ppi_networks of different organisms their statistical_analysis proved that the number of ppis attributed to ddis was significantly_larger than expected by random this result supports the conjecture that ppis may be driven by a limited catalogue of ddis however the fraction of ppis to which experimentally_determined ddis could be mapped back in ranged from to in different organisms indeed in this study we have observed that the gap between ppis and experimentally solved ddis nowadays remains in a similar proportion so that current experimental_data on ddis can be mapped to of the ppis for most organisms section most previous methods to infer ddis rely on the assumption that an interaction between a pair of proteins involves at least a pair of their constituent domains one from each interacting_protein one of the first methods was proposed by sprinzak and margalit in their work the authors analyzed a particular set of ppis looking for domain pairs that co occurred more frequently in interactions than expected by chance later used an expectation_maximization to maximize a certain likelihood_function over an observed interactome protein interactions were described in terms of ddi probabilities and the expectation_maximization searched for the ddi probabilities that maximized the likelihood_function this work was extended byin their domain pair excluding analysis approach riley et_al method calculates different likelihood scores negating interactions coming from particular domain pairs in this way the authors improved the performance of previous methods predicting interaction between domains based on the differences of the likelihood values when a particular domain pair was excluded other approaches used a parsimony model to find the minimum set of ddis that could explain the interactions present in a given ppi map finally several methods introduced other types of data such as correlated mutation at protein interfaces gene_ontology go terms or co evolutionary data in this work we describe a new strategy to infer ddis based on the topology of a protein_interaction this approach exploits the neighborhood cohesiveness nc property of small_world networks analyzing the interactions between two sets of nodes that contain proteins with a particular domain in this way we have extended previous definitions of nc first calculated on a network node later on a network edge and in this work defined over two sets of nodes within the network particularly we used the meet min coefficient to measure the proportion of interacting nodes between two sets of nodes and the fraction of common neighbors although more sophisticated clustering coefficients could be used we will prove that this simple cohesiveness measure already has enough discriminative_power to differentiate between interacting and non interacting domains the performance has been tested using a novel ddi benchmark compiled using did and negatome data we have compared our methodology against the correlated sequence signature css method and domine predicted data showing that the proposed approach is competitive with previous methods finally the approach and the ppi data used during the present development have been integrated together into a web platform termed dimero data_integration for molecuar structure modelling dimero allows both the evaluation of interactions between domains as well as a direct access to source data in the form of the ppis used for the evaluation in this way browsing these ppi data offers the possibility to find additional information about known interactions involving the domains of interest including experimental_data information from prediction_methods and scientific_literature
