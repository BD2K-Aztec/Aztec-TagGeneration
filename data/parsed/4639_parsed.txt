systems_biology the simmune modeler visual interface for creating signaling_networks based on bi molecular_interactions motivation biochemical modeling efforts now frequently take advantage of the possibility to automatically create reaction_networks based on the specification of pairwise molecular_interactions even though a variety of tools exist to visualize the resulting networks defining the rules for the molecular_interactions typically requires writing scripts which impacts the non specialist accessibility of those approaches we introduce the simmune modeler that allows users to specify molecular complexes and their interactions as well as the reaction induced modifications of the molecules through a flexible visual interface it can take into account the positions of the components of trans membrane complexes relative to the embedding membranes as well as symmetry aspects affecting the reactions of multimeric molecular_structures models created with this tool can be simulated using the simmune simulator or be exported as sbml code or as files describing the reaction_networks as systems of odes for import into matlab availability the simmune modeler and the associated simulators as well as extensive additional documentation and tutorials are freely_available for linux mac and windows http go usa gov qeh note shortened case sensitive url contact zhangfen niaid nih gov or mms niaid nih gov supplementary_information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online many cellular biochemical signaling_processes involve interactions among molecules with multiple binding_sites and various biochemical states such as the phosphorylation states or structural conformations of molecular domains for example scaffold proteins with multiple potential binding_partners can give rise to very large reaction_networks owing to the combinatorial possibilities of multi molecular complexes containing those proteins conventional modeling_approaches rely on creating computational representations of such reaction_networks manually by explicitly listing all multi molecular complexes and all reactions they can participate in see supplementary text for a comparison of simmune with other approaches this can be tedious or impossible depending on the complexity of the network to address this problem a variety of approaches has been developed that can automatically_determine all reactions and the resulting complexes based on the user specified pairwise interactions among molecular binding_sites although several tools permit users to simulate or analyze such rule_based networks and models creating them typically requires writing scripts which may render the model definition process non intuitive for researchers with an experimental biological background a visual interface capturing all relevant aspects of molecular_interaction rules using iconographic symbols can considerably_lower the threshold for non theorists to start working with computational_models moreover it can offer important_advantages over script based_approaches in particular when aspects such as the position of molecular_components relative to membranes or symmetry properties of multimeric complexes come into play conditions under which a certain biochemical_reaction can take place and what the consequences state modifications for the interacting molecular complexes are in most use cases the mapping from the molecules before a reaction to the result molecules is uniquely specified through the molecule types of the reaction participants however for molecular transformations with multiple instances of a particular molecule type e g the autophosphorylation of a multimeric complex consisting of identical subunits this mapping cannot be inferred automatically to permit a unique definition of such reactions the user of the software can specify the mapping explicitly see supplementary text for details the simmune modeler was designed to support models that include interactions between receptors located on the mebranes of adjacent cells molecules such as the important cadherin family adhesion_receptors can form homophilic bonds whose characteristics depend on whether the molecules are located in the same membrane cis interaction or in distinct adjacent membranes trans interaction to take this into account the simmune modeler permits the specification of the binding_mode cis_or for interactions between pairs of membrane_bound molecules supplementary to facilitate model development model properties can be inspected with the help of a flexible query interface the models created with the software can be simulated with the simmune toolset and can be exported as sbml files or mass action ordinary_differential ode descriptions that can be imported into matlab tm or other ode solver tools see discussion in supplementary text moreover the modeler will support the emerging sbml standard for encoding multi component multi state molecular complexes to allow for exchange of models with other rule based_approaches such as bngl and kappa of the extracellular_domain of the receptor the association leads to the activation of the cytoplasmic_domain of the receptor as indicated by the red square tag switching from an empty shape with a dotted outline encoding any state or dont care to a filled shape encoding on note that the engagement of the two binding_sites at receptor and ligand alters their display mode from empty circles indicating unbound to filled circles indicating bound center panel the active receptor induces a gdpgtp exchange at the associated g proteins this switch is indicated as the transformation of the empty green square off on the ga subunit into a filled green square on the full complex diagram shows the state before this transformation the partial diagram in the upper right corner the result state note that the transformation requires the receptor to be active filled red tag but does not require the ligand to be still bound dotted outline of the extracellular binding_site right panel interaction between a receptor_kinase green circle and the cytoplasmic_domain of the receptor this interaction uses a site on the receptor that is different from the site labeled recruiting the g proteins however the interaction rule requires that the g proteins not be bound to the receptor this is indicated by the empty circle representing a free g protein recruitment binding_site in this figure emphasized by a red circle around the binding_site the interaction moreover requires the receptor to be active red filled tag and the blue tag representing the receptors phosphorylation_state to be in the off state after association with the receptor the receptor_kinase can phosphorylate the receptor switching the blue tag from empty to full not shown the full complex diagram shows the state before ligation the partial diagram in the upper right corner the result state the model is provided as supplementary_material
