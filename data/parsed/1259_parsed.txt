data_and database bio a web_application for interpreting human variations rapid advances of next_generation have led to the integration of genetic_information with clinical care genetic_basis of diseases and response to drugs provide new ways of disease diagnosis and safer drug_usage this integration reveals the urgent need for effective and accurate tools to analyze genetic_variants due to the number and diversity of sources for annotation automating variant analysis is a challenging_task here we present database bio a web_application that combines variant annotation prioritization and visualization so as to support insight into the individual genetic_characteristics it enhances annotation speed by preprocessing data on a supercomputer and reduces database space via a unified database representation with compressed fields the decreasing cost of sequencing_technologies and growing_knowledge in the clinical_relevance of genomic_data have led to rapid adoption of genetic_tests in healthcare while huge amount of data is generated through these tests the management and analysis of these data present many challenges as discussed here after variant annotations come from diverse sources which may not use the same coordinate system and naming convention once annotations have been integrated these database files consume large storage space and queries to the databases can be very slow without proper indexing and preprocessing existing_tools have solved some of the stated issues but are lacking in other features for example some software can visualize records from different databases across the genome such as the ucsc_genome and alamut visual interactive biosoftware last accessed august however it is hard to display all relevant annotations such as relationships between genes and pathways by only using a genome_browser moreover the scale of genome_browsers is usually small as they are designed to show information of small genomic_regions it is also not possible for users to sort or filter variants in the browser in contrast tables can better summarize variant information and help users prioritize their findings qiagens ingenuity variant analysis software iva www qiagen com ingenuity is a popular table based tool and allows users to configure a filter cascade for data prioritization however without an embedded genome_browser it is inconvenient for users to picture genomic characteristics of variants and study related data from databases integrated in iva a similar tool to display sample details but does not provide detailed disease annotations here we present database bio a web_application that integrates five key_elements variants genes diseases drugs and pathways and assigns severity levels to variants using customizable categorization rules variant information is presented in html pages that contain annotation details with a powerful embedded genome_browser allowing clinicians and researchers to carry out analysis of genomic sequencing_data in a highly configurable manner twenty nine public_databases are used to generate variant annotations including variant functional prediction variant conservation splicing prediction regulatory feature prediction pharmacogenomics information with disease and drug real_sample data such as g tcga icgc and lovd as well as clinical_trial details when developing a web_tool for variant interpretation it is important to ensure that patient data are retrieved and managed over the web in a secure manner database bio is built strictly adhering to health_insurance hipaa which is a stringent standard for privacy and security database bio empowered by a space efficient integration of diverse sources of annotations provides an efficient way for interpreting human genomic_variations and supports interactive_visualization as database bio is a web_based application the way users retrieve and manage data have been specially_designed to ensure a security level up to the standard of hipaa
