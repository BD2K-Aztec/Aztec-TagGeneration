gene_expression allele_specific analysis methods for high_density microarray_data motivation in the past_decade a number of technologies to quantify allele_specific ase in a genome_wide have become available to researchers we investigate the application of single_nucleotide snp microarrays to this task exploring data obtained from both cell_lines and primary tissue for which both rna and dna profiles are available results we analyze data from two experiments that make use of high_density illumina_infinium ii genotyping_arrays to measure ase we first preprocess each data_set which involves removal of outlier samples careful normalization and a two step filtering procedure to remove snps that show no evidence of expression in the samples being analyzed and calls that are clear genotyping_errors we then compare three different tests for detecting ase one of which has been previously_published and two novel approaches these tests vary at the level at which they operate per snp per individual or per snp and in the input_data they require using snps from imprinted_genes as true_positives for ase we observe varying sensitivity for the different testing procedures that improves with increasing sample_size methods that rely on rna signal alone were found to perform best across a range of metrics the top_ranked snps recovered by all methods appear to be reasonable candidates for ase availability_and analysis was carried_out in r http www r project org using existing functions understanding the genetic_basis of variation in gene_expression is of considerable interest in biomedical_research the preferential expression of one of the two alleles of a gene known as allelespecific expression ase is one important class of such variation allelic expression imbalances have been widely_studied in the to whom correspondence should be addressed context of development where key epigenetic_mechanisms such as x inactivation and genomic_imprinting lead to the silencing of one allele recent_studies have also linked ase to the susceptibility of a number of human_diseases genome_wide assessment of ase has recently become feasible with the availability of high_density snp_chips and second generation sequencing a number of microarray_based studies which quantify ase in a highthroughput way have been published in the past_decade with microarrays oligonucleotide_probes that distinguish between the signal from allele a and allele b for snps in genomic_dna can measure the relative expression from each allele when mrna converted to cdna is hybridized to the chip for individuals who are heterozygous ab at a particular snp distortions in the expected ratio of allele a to allele b in the rna signal can be an indication of ase both dna and rna hybridizations are necessary for each sample in order that genotype_calls aa ab bb and allelic expression ratios are available for each snp on the array illuminas two color infinium technology has been used to measure ase in lymphoblastoid_cell infinium chemistry differentially labels allele a and allele b with red and green dye respectively the fluorescence of each probe is quantified by illuminas scanning software and summarized values for each snp are output by the genomestudio software to process the raw signal from the dna hybridizations into genotype_calls illuminas proprietary gencall algorithm implemented in the genomestudio software is typically used a number of ase detection methods have been proposed these include locus specific approaches that search for ase on a snpby snp basis and tests that combine data from neighboring snps in the genome irrespective of the testing method careful preprocessing to remove non informative snps and dye bias has been shown to be important in array based ase data_sets that make use of the illumina genotyping platform we have shown that careful preprocessing of data from illumina array based ase studies is important for improving signal consistency between different samples and for avoiding potential false_positives the normalization and filtering approaches we have described ensure that the input_data for a given ase testing method is appropriately standardized and error_free as far as practicable a similar strategy is likely to be useful when other microarray_platforms such as affymetrixs two color axiom technology are used to measure ase a summary of the findings of our methods comparison is given in the new heuristic approach we describe cluster outperforms the other methods at recovering snps from known imprinted_genes across a range of sample_sizes making it ideal in small studies the variance method was demonstrated to perform well on larger_sample and was particularly good at detecting rare cases of ase driven by one or two individuals with extreme allelic expression imbalances both methods are appealing on account of their simplicity and the absence of any tuning parameters that the user must pre set to obtain a result tans method was found to perform worst initially however we observed that the performance could be improved considerably by relaxing the threshold for ase less conservative values of recovered more true_positive imprinted snps than the default value used in previous_studies which indicates that true_positive candidates for ase will have been missed in previous_analyses tans method is also less powerful and less consistent than both the cluster and variance methods in the gene_set analyses carried_out and was less likely to detect multiple independent ase hits in genes represented by several snps on the array together these results indicate that the newer simpler methods proposed in this article cluster and variance offer a good alternative to tans methods for detecting ase in snp microarray_data future work will be to compare the results obtained from snp microarrays with other high_throughput such as rnasequencing to assess the relative advantages_and of
