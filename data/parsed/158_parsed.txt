gene_expression a general method for accurate estimation of false_discovery in identification_of the omic_data such as genomic_data transcriptomic_data proteomic_data and single_nucleotide data have been rapidly_growing the omic_data are large_scale and high through put data such data challenge traditional statistical methodologies and require_multiple tests several multiple testing procedures such as bonferroni procedure benjaminihochberg bh procedure and westfallyoung procedure have been developed among which some control family_wise and the others control false_discovery fdr these procedures are valid in some cases and cannot be applied to all types of large_scale data to address this statistically challenging_problem in the analysis of the omic_data we propose a general method for generating a set of multiple testing procedures this method is based on the bh theorems by choosing a c value one can realize a specific multiple testing procedure for example by setting c our method_produces the bh procedure with c our method generates procedures of weakly controlling fdr and with c the procedures strongly control fdr those with c g number of genes or tests and c are respectively the bonferroni procedure and the single testing procedure these are the two extreme procedures in this family to let one choose an appropriate multiple testing procedure in practice we develop an algorithm by which fdr can be correctly and reliably estimated simulated results show that our method works well for an accurate estimation of fdr in various scenarios and we illustrate the applications of our method with three real_datasets the advance of omic technologies has led to a great development of large_scale data such as microarray_data transcriptomic_data metabolomic_data and proteomic_data these omic_data enable us to take a global insight into complex biological procedures the interaction between genetic_and and pathological_mechanisms of complex_diseases such as diabetes heart_disease hypertension and various cancers via identification of genes_differentially and cluster or classification of functional_genes pathway or network such large_scale data or high_throughput data challenge traditional statistical_tests because the traditional statistical_tests are single tests in a single hypothesis_test the threshold is meaningful for determining whether a test is significant because is a probabilistic threshold for the occurrence of an event in a population however threshold does not remain valid for multiple statistical_analyses of omic_data because for example in identification of genes at least findings are expected by chance at the significance_level of therefore threshold is required to be adjusted for multiple tests currently several statistical_procedures have been developed for adjusting threshold or adjusting p values in the multiple tests among them the bonferroni procedure the holm procedure the hochberg procedure the westfall and young procedure the sidak procedure the benjaminihochberg bh procedure and the benjaminiliu procedure are typical multiple testing approaches among these procedures the bh procedure has been most broadly applied in practice but we found that the true false_discovery fdr does not always remain consistent with the estimated fdr of the bh procedure and all existing multiple testing procedures are actually special cases of the multiple testing procedure family that ranges from the single testing procedure to the bonferroni procedure in other words these procedures give different rejection space in practice our simulation also shows that true fdr is often significantly overestimated or underestimated by the bh procedure to accurately estimate fdr in a largescale statistical_analysis here we propose a method that is based on the bh theorems to generate a set of multiple testing procedures in a range of the single testing procedures to the bonferroni procedure and a simulation algorithm to choose a desirable procedure the first example for application of the multiple procedure approach ismicroarray data as seen above the data consist of genes tried to find genes_differentially between four human_lymphoblastoid samples treated by ionizing_radiation and four samples without ionizing_radiation we set c values from to to create multiple testing procedures because c value did not produce meaningful_results no findings we obtained a set of real ratios of findings from the real_data using classical two condition t test method after adjusting we found a b and and repeated our algorithm process for times and generated a set of estimated ratios of findings and a set of estimated fdrs we plotted real and estimated ratios of findings in applications of our method to the real_data the real ratio set of findings was obtained by using a set of procedures for multiple t tests of gene differential expressions between two conditions from a real_dataset the estimated ratio set of findings was obtained by using our method from simulated_datasets each similar to real_data the estimated ratio of findings is compelled to be identical to its real value across all given procedures so that the true fdr generated by each of procedures would be reliably estimated column plots of estimated versus real ratios of findings solid line is a regression_line dash line is observed line column plots of estimated fdrs versus c values procedures row a the ionizing_irradiation microarray_data provided by genes of being expressed in human_lymphoblastoid samples treated by ionizing_radiation and in samples without ionizing_radiation were detected on human_cdna arrays row b the data are acute_leukemia microarray_data that were downloaded from broad institute cancer program data_set this dataset consists of genes whose expression values in acute_lymphoblastic all cell_lines and in acute_myelogenous aml cell_lines were measured by oligonucleotide_arrays row c arabidopsis microarray_data this dataset contains genes that were detected for differentially expression between the c infected and control stalks each with replicates on plant arabidopsis gene_chip plots of true versus bh estimated fdr in existing statistical_methods estimated curve was made by plotting estimated fdr against true fdr along cutoff of to and theoretical line is a diagonal line made by plotting true fdr against true fdr along the same cutoff the true fdr was calculated by counting false_positives in findings of a statistical_method at an fdr cutoff_point in a simulated dataset and the estimated fdr was predicted by a statistical_method the true and estimated fdrs were averaged over three simulated_datasets a exact tests b generalized_linear c empirical_bayesian d beta t tests almost a diagonal line with intersection and regression_coefficient hence the estimated ratio of findings is proximately identical to its real ratio at each of c values thus the simulated fdr given incan be used to estimate the true fdr across the c values shows that the smallest fdr is at c value which is much larger than cutoff of therefore at fdr cutoff of no gene in this dataset was found to be differentially_expressed between human lymphoblastoid_cell treated with ionizing_radiation and control cell_lines this result is consistent with the report of tusher et_al the plot dots of the estimated versus real ratios of findings almost fall on a diagonal line with intersection and regression_coefficient suggesting that the estimated ratio of findings was constrained to be almost identical to the real one at each c level thus the true fdr set can be given by the estimated fdr set shows that at c fdr is close to at which genes were identified to be differentially_expressed between all and aml cell_lines the third example is arabidopsis microarray_data to explore whether arabidopsis genes respond to oncogenes encoded by the transfer dna t dna or to bacterial effector_proteins codelivered by agrobacteria into the plant cells lee et_al conducted microarray_experiments at h and d after inoculating wounded young arabidopsis_plants with strains c and gv a cognate of strain c which only lacks transferdna but possesses proteinaceous virulence vir factors such as vird vire vire and virf wounded but uninfected stalks were served as control as an example we just downloaded d postinoculation data from geo geo accession gse website_http www ncbi nlm nih gov geo the data consisting of genes were obtained from the c infected and control stalks each with three replicates we performed the classical two condition t test approach on this dataset and applied our multiple procedure approach to do multiple tests we set c values from to to create procedures and obtained real ratios of findings from two condition t tests after adjusting we found a b and using these parameters we obtained estimated ratios of findings and fdrs by procedures for repeats shows that the observed plot line of estimated versus real ratios of findings completely overlapped with the predicted line because intersection and regression_coefficient the observed line of estimated and real ratios of findings is a diagonal line so that the estimated ratio of findings is one to one identical to the real one at each cvalue thus the true fdr set can be given by the estimated fdr set shows that genes were identified to be differentially_expressed between the young tumor and control stalks at c with fdr however using the fold_change method just identified_differentially at p both have a big difference to verify our findings we displayed heatmap of the raw_data of the de genes selected in shows that in the downregulation all the genes clearly had much lower expression values in young crown gall tumors than in heatmap rows are genes found to be differentially_expressed between young tumor d postinoculation and control stalk and columns are three control reference stalk replicates right side and three young tumor replicates left side among which genes were downregulated in c strain relative to control stalk and were upregulated in c strain relative to control stalks yellow is the lowest expression values and deep red is the highest expression valuesthe probabilistic threshold is adjusted as where is called rate for controlling false_discoveries the single testing procedure and the bonferroni procedure are two extreme procedures as shown in the single testing procedure is a top horizontal line with for all g tests whereas the bonferroni procedure is a bottom horizontal line with g for all g tests the bh procedure has the rate of controlling false_discoveries i g where i g which is a diagonal line they all are special cases of our method interestingly if equation is changed asour multiple procedures can then switch the step up procedures given in equation to the step down procedures given in equation for r we have g whereas for r g we have g like step up procedures by changing c value a set of r k values is also altered so that a set of new multiple testing procedures is created if c then r k and k for all hypotheses which is the single testing procedure if c then r k and k g for all hypotheses which is just bonferroni procedure if c x so that g ri i i g then i g i is just the holm procedure if c y so that i g g ri ai g we get a proximate bh procedure these indicate that in our multiple procedure approach the step down procedures are equivalent to the step up procedures as seen in our method is somewhat similar to sam and ram because a set of c values procedures is equivalent to a set of thresholds s given for declaring significant tests in comparison between the observed ranked statistics and the estimated ranked null statistics in sam and ram however as seen inand in supplementary table s our method ensures that estimated fdr is close to its true value by constraining that the estimated ratio of findings is identical or approximate to its real ratio at each of the given c values whereas the sam and ram do not have any constraint to ensure that estimation of fdr is reliable
