geo enrichr browser extension and server app to extract gene_sets from geo and analyze them for biological_functions mount sinai knowledge_management center for illuminating the druggable genome and airport sector motivation identification_of is an important step in extracting knowledge from gene_expression studies the raw expression data from microarray and other high_throughput is deposited into the gene_expression geo and served as simple omnibus format in text soft files however to extract and analyze differentially_expressed from geo requires significant computational skills results here we introduce geo enrichr a browser extension for extracting differentially_expressed gene_sets from geo and analyzing those sets with enrichr an independent gene_set tool containing over annotated gene_sets organized into gene_set libraries geo enrichr adds javascript code to geo web_pages this code scrapes user selected accession_numbers and metadata and then with one click users can submit this information to a web_server application that downloads the soft files parses cleans and normalizes the data identifies the differentially_expressed and then pipes the resulting gene_lists to enrichr for downstream functional analysis geo enrichr opens a new avenue for adding functionality to major bioinformatics resources such geo by integrating tools and resources without the need for a plug in architecture importantly geo enrichr helps researchers to quickly explore hypotheses with little technical overhead lowering the barrier of entry for biologists by automating data processing_steps needed for knowledge extraction from the major repository geo availability_and geo enrichr is an open_source tool freely_available for installation as browser extensions at the chrome web store and firefox add ons documentation and a browser independent web_application can be found atgene expression_profiling data are widely and openly available with many computational and statistical_techniques developed in the past_decade to process and analyze this type of data the identification_of and their analysis through gene_set are two important_steps in extracting knowledge from expression data however there is still a need for creating interoperable tools to improve the reuse of the collective rapidly a public database maintained by the national_center ncbi for depositing and serving functional_genomics data mostly from gene_expression studies geo contains a search_engine and each dataset is provided with metadata that includes the publication associated with each dataset the assay platform and a description of the experiment and conditions for each sample geo stores data in tab_delimited ascii text_files called simple omnibus format in text soft files geo organizes data into four primary types geo sample gsm geo series gse geo dataset gds and geo platform gpl which are accessioned with unique and constant identifiers gsms contain expression measurements from a single experiment where each sample_consists of pairs of probe ids and their expression values gses organize samples into sets which make up a complete study gdss contain more curated and annotated sets of samples from related gses gpls contain the lists of probe ids along with mappings of probes to genes for the various expression platforms that are supported while the interface that provides access to gdss has functionality to_identify it is difficult for a user to obtain a coherent view of the results or to have the ability to analyze the differentially_expressed with prior_biological for functional characterization and link to external tools gses provide the data for processing with r using the geo r format and this creates a barrier to entry for biologists without computational expertise in r here we present geo enrichr a browser extension and a web_based client server application that adds functionality to the geo site for easier extraction of differentially_expressed and for piping such differentially_expressed to the external gene_set tool enrichr geo enrichrs front end adds buttons and a modal dialog box to geos gds and gse pages via the extension whereas the back end of geo enrichr handles the downloading processing and analyzing of the expression data from geo specified by the user input
