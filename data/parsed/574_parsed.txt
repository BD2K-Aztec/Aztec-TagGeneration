a two part mixed_effects for analyzing longitudinal microbiome compositional data motivation the human microbial_communities are associated with many human_diseases such as obesity diabetes and inflammatory_bowel high_throughput has been widely used to quantify the microbial_composition in order to understand its impacts on human_health longitudinal measurements of microbial_communities are commonly obtained in many microbiome_studies a key_question in such microbiome_studies is to identify the microbes that are associated with clinical_outcomes or environmental_factors however microbiome com positional data are highly_skewed bounded in and often sparse with many zeros in addition the observations from repeated_measures in longitudinal_studies are correlated a method that takes_into these features is needed for association analysis in longitudinal microbiome data results in this paper we propose a two part zero inflated beta regression_model with random_effects zibr for testing the association between microbial abundance and clinical_covariates for longitudinal microbiome data the model includes a logistic_regression component to model pres ence absence of a microbe in the samples and a beta regression component to model non zero microbial abundance where each component includes a random effect to account for the correlations among the repeated_measurements on the same subject both simulation_studies and the application to real microbiome data have shown that zibr model outperformed the previously used methods the method provides a useful tool for identifying the relevant taxa based on longitudinal or repeated_measures in microbiome research availability_and https github com chvlyl zibrthe human microbial_communities are associated with many human_diseases such as obesity diabetes and inflammatory_bowel ibd in order to decipher the function and impact of the microbes on the human well being two high_throughput based_approaches have been widely used in microbiome_studies one is the s ribosomal_rna rrna sequencing approach which profiles bacterial_community by sequencing the s rrna marker gene another approach is the shotgun_sequencing which sequences all the microbial_genomes presented in the sample rather than just one marker gene both s rrna and shotgun sequencing_approaches are quite useful and have been widely_applied in human microbiome_studies such as the human_microbiome hmp and the metagenomics of the human intestinal_tract metahit project to quantify the microbial abundances the sequencing_reads usually are aligned to some known reference_sequences due to the uneven total sequence counts of samples the microbial abundances measured in read_counts are not comparable across samples therefore it is common that the read_counts are normalized to the relative_abundances by dividing total sequence count in the sample so that the relative_abundances of all microbes in one sample sum to one resulting in compositional data with lots of zeros it is of great interest to study how microbial abundance changes across time and its association with treatments clinical_outcomes or other covariates to address_this many microbiome_studies employed the longitudinal study_design for reviews see for example studied the gut_microbiome from pediatric ibd patients during an week treatment one interesting question in this study is to identify the bacterial_taxa that change their abundances under different treatments across time in another longitudinal microbiome study b ackhed et_al studied the microbiome changes during the first years of newborn_babies with different delivery methods and feeding activities modeling such sparse longitudinal compositional data is challenging for several reasons first the microbiome compositional data is non normally distributed and bounded in methods with normal distributional assumption are not expected to perform well second the microbiome data is often observed with many zeros which leads to great heterogeneity in the data third in microbiome_studies it is important to adjust for the other covariates confounders such as patients age or antibiotic use therefore a multivariate regression_based method is more preferred than univariate tests such as the t test or wilcoxon_rank fourth the repeated_measurements in longitudinal data are correlated i e observations from the same subject across different time points are not independent this renders the methods with independence_assumption not directly applicable ignoring the correlations among the repeated_measures can lead to incorrect inferences therefore taking_into the correlations among repeated_measurements is necessary several methods have been used to analyze longitudinal microbiome data in order to identify the covariate associated taxa but each has its own limitations to overcome the issue of non independence of the data across time points most of the longitudinal microbiome_studies analyze data at individual time point or compare two time points but ignore the other time points to take into account the excessive zeros in the data a two part test combining a z test for testing the proportion of zeros and a wilcoxon_rank for testing the non zero values was developed for identifying differential abundant microbes between two groups such tests cannot be applied to longitudinal correlated data and are limited to only two group comparison developed a zero inflated poisson_regression with random_effects to account for the correlations in the longitudinal data but the model can only be applied to count_data a linear mixed_effects with arcsine square_root transformation on the microbiome compositional data was used however this method does not explicitly handle the excessive zeros in the data this motivates us to develop a flexible method that identifies the covariate associated taxa while handling the features of the microbiome compositional data and jointly modeling data from all time points the focus of this paper is to develop a statistical_model for identifying the bacterial_taxa that are associated with covariates while addressing the above limitations we propose a two part mixedeffects beta regression_model which is a mixture of a logistic_regression component and a beta regression component with the random_effects being included in the model to allow the correlations among the repeated_measures this model takes_into the nature of the microbiome compositional data and allows for multiple covariates in the regression setting in addition the model can jointly analyze data from all the time points simulation_results show that our method outperforms previously used methods in terms of increased power in detecting covariate associated taxa we apply zibr to a real microbiome study and identify several bacterial_taxa that are associated with different treatments of inflammatory_bowel zibr model was implemented in r package zibr and is freely_available at https github com chvlyl zibr we have proposed a two part mixed_effects to identify the taxa that are associated with clinical_covariates in the longitudinal microbiome_studies our model takes_into the compositional and sparse nature of the microbiome data as well as the correlations among the repeated_measures in the longitudinal_studies we have demonstrated that our proposed model outperformed the commonly used linear_mixed in identifying the covariates associated taxa we applied our method to a real human_microbiome study of ibd treatment and identified a number of bacterial_genera that showed different abundances between two commonly used treatments during the week_treatment the model we proposed in this paper can be applied to proportion data obtained from either s rrna sequencing or shotgun metagenomic_sequencing for shotgun metagenomic_data it is not clear how to summarize the sequencing_reads into bacterial_counts since many reads can be aligned to multiple bacterial_genomes therefore most commonly used methods such as metaphlan only output the relative_abundances or proportions of the bacteria in the sample for s count_data methods developed for testing bacterial_genera that showed different abundances between anti_tnf and een treatments identified by zibr and lmm after adjusting for the initial abundance lmm identified seven genera which were also identified by zibr zibr identified four additional genera four genera identified by zibr but not by lmm left panel shows the percentage of samples
