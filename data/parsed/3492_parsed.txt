penalized_regression elucidates aberration hotspots mediating subtype specific transcriptional_responses in breast_cancer motivation copy_number cnas associated with cancer are known to contribute to genomic_instability and gene deregulation integrating cnas with gene_expression helps to elucidate the mechanisms by which cnas act and to identify the transcriptional downstream_targets of cnas such analyses can help to sort functional driver events from the many accompanying passenger alterations however the way cnas affect_gene can vary in different cellular contexts for example between different subtypes of the same cancer thus it is important to develop computational_approaches capable of inferring differential connectivity of regulatory_networks in different cellular contexts results we propose a statistical deregulation model that integrates copy_number and expression data of different disease_subtypes to jointly_model common and differential regulatory_relationships our model not only identifies cnas driving gene_expression changes but at the same time also predicts differences in regulation that distinguish one cancer subtype from the other we implement our model in a penalized regression_framework and demonstrate in a simulation_study the feasibility and accuracy of our approach subsequently we show that this model can identify both known and novel aspects of cross_talk between the er and notch pathways in er negative specific deregulations when compared with er_positive this flexible model can be applied on other modalities such as methylation or microrna and expression to disentangle cancer signaling_pathways availability the bioconductor compliant r package dance is available from www markowetzlab org software contact somatic copy_number cnas are known to be associated with cancer they are particularly important for tumourigenesis contributing to genomic_instability and gene deregulation array_comparative acgh has been used extensively to assess genome_wide copy_number states in cancer to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address department of preventive_medicine keck school of medicine university of southern_california los_angeles ca usa and statistical_methods can be used to identify recurrent alterations in a particular disease_state or subtype however while some cnas are driver_mutations that are functionally_important and impact tumour_progression they are often accompanied by numerous passenger events that confer no selective growth_advantage one of the challenges in cancer_genomics is to identify functional driver events amidst many passenger alterations to better understand the mechanisms by which cnas influence disease_progression it is necessary to integrate copy_number data with an intermediate phenotype like gene_expression integrating cna data and rna expression data can help discover the primary aberrations that lead to downstream changes however this is a challenging_task for several reasons first cnas can influence the expression of the proximal genes within a several mega base window cis_acting and can also exert_effects elsewhere throughout the genome trans_acting second cnas can span several mega base and thus make it difficult to distinguish between driver_genes and passenger genes in this region thus there is a need for new efficient computational_approaches to refine the location of drivers while describing the regulatory_role of cnas for gene_expression is already a difficult_task it is only the first step needed in understanding how tumours differ from normal_tissue and how regulatory_relationships vary between different disease_subtypes cancer is triggered by collaborating factors and deregulated genes acting through signaling_pathways are relevant for tumour_growth and survival several known examples of pathway deregulation result in aberrant signaling the inhibition of apoptosis and increased cell_proliferation components in the deregulation network of signaling_pathways represent attractive targets for therapeutic purpose a better understanding of the impact of cnas on pathway activity and its variation in different cancer_subtypes would be a major step_forward in molecular_medicine many experimental and computational_approaches have been proposed to identify the deregulation of cellular_components such as tumour_suppressor silencing or oncogene_activation that contribute to tumour_development based on gene_expression all these works are important_steps in this field however many different regulatory_events are reflected in gene_expression including the activity of transcription_factors small_non as well as gene_dosage from microarray_expression alone it is very hard to decide which of these resulted in the observed expression change investigating changes in regulatory_relationships between cnas and gene_expression in different cancer_subtypes has seldom been explored while there is an increasing number of methods that integrate dna_copy data and rna expression data the cancer_genome research most methods that compare cancer_subtypes are geared toward supervised_classification of tumor_samples only few integration methods address the topic of differential regulation one example is a bivariate approach byto search for abnormalities jointly at the dna rna level the abnormalities represent strong deviations from the reference e g the amplification of a genomic_region and overexpression of the proximal gene another example that we compare against on real_data is dri which can discover joint aberrations between two sample classes in paired copy_number and expression data both methods are computationally_efficient but are restricted to paired expression and cna profiles on individual genes in other words these two methods can only infer cis effects here we present dance deregulation analysis in networks of copy_number driven expressions a systematic approach to decipher both common and differential regulatory_mechanisms between disease_subtypes we propose a statistical deregulation model that integrates copy_number and expression data to jointly_model common and differential regulatory_relationships our model not only identifies cnas driving gene_expression changes but at the same time also predicts differences in regulation that distinguish one cancer subtype from the other using one subtype as a reference we summarize the differential regulatory_relationships of the other subtype in a deregulation network to our knowledge it is the first model to integrate both copy_number and expression data to discover changes in the regulatory architecture between cancer_subtypes the next section introduces our model which in a simulation_study over a range of different experimental_settings outperforms alternative_models and competing_methods following we use dance to study the deregulation between estrogen_receptor er positive_and breast_cancer which represent relatively good and poor_outcome groups respectively while dance is able to tackle high_dimensional problems to add interpretability we focus our analysis on signaling_pathways in particular we are interested in the cross_talk between notch and er pathways which may guide decisions about patients likely to benefit from notch inhibitors the results show that dance uncovers and extends known aspects of differential ernotch crosstalk in er positive_versus disease thus it can be a useful approach to infer critical aspects of pathway deregulation among cancer_subtypes
