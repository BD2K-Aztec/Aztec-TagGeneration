databases_and relating genes to function identifying enriched transcription_factors using the encode chip_seq significance tool motivation biological analysis has shifted from identifying genes and transcripts to mapping these genes and transcripts to biological_functions the encode_project has generated hundreds of chip_seq spanning multiple transcription_factors and cell_lines for public use but tools for a biomedical scientist to analyze these data are either non existent or tailored to narrow biological_questions we present the encode chip_seq significance tool a flexible web_application leveraging public encode data to identify enriched transcription_factors in a gene or transcript list for comparative_analyses implementation the encode chip_seq significance tool is written in javascript on the client side and has been tested on google chrome apple safari and mozilla firefox browsers server side scripts are written in php and leverage r and a mysql_database identifying gene or transcript signatures associated with development disease and drug efficacy has been a focal_point of biology and medicine since the release of the human_genome however focus has only recently shifted to relating these signatures to function on a genome_wide scale thanks to next_generation assays such as chip_seq that query an entire_genome transcription_factor that may explain the underlying biochemical function behind these signatures can be identified the encode consortium in particular has spent over us million producing and analyzing functional_assays for public use as part of this effort encode has generated chip_seq including histone_modifications and control experiments across cell_lines from various tissues treatments and conditions encode_project although encode chip_seq represent an invariable treasure trove of data to intersect against gene_transcript signatures and identify enriched transcription_factors tfs the consortium does not provide a simple tool for this purpose short of downloading and parsing each results file individually other tools such as cscan have tried to fill this void but their configuration options focus only on transcription_start additionally cscan uses the set of all genes from the entire_human as a background set rendering it impractical for signatures derived from expression microarrays or from array capturebased sequencing_experiments we present the encode chip_seq significance tool a simple flexible single page web_application that addresses these gaps in existing_tools leverages public chip_seq from the encode production phase and provides biomedical_researchers the ability to conduct comparative_analyses with their list of gene_transcript signatures also kept separate e g untreated cells versus cells stimulated with interferon
