localized motif_discovery in gene regulatory_sequences motivation discovery of nucleotide motifs that are localized with respect to a certain biological landmark is important in several applications such as in regulatory_sequences flanking the transcription_start in the neighborhood of known transcription_factor and in transcription_factor binding regions discovered by massively_parallel chip_seq results we report an algorithm called localmotif to discover such localized motifs the algorithm is based on a novel scoring_function called spatial_confinement score which can determine the exact interval of localization of a motif this score is combined with other existing scoring measures including over representation and relative entropy to determine the overall prominence of the motif the approach successfully discovers biologically_relevant motifs and their intervals of localization in scenarios where the motifs cannot be discovered by general motif_finding tools it is especially useful for discovering multiple co localized motifs in a set of regulatory_sequences such as those identified by chip_seq regulation of gene_expression primarily occurs at the stage of transcription of the gene a key event in the regulation of transcription is the binding of trans_acting proteins called transcription_factors tfs to cis_acting dna_sequences in the vicinity of the gene the tfs bind to short bp segments of dna called transcription_factor tfbss the tfbss are not easily recognized in dna_sequences as they are of short_length and frequently have mutations in their pattern however they can be discovered computationally within a set of sequences that are enriched with their occurrences the computational algorithm looks for a short conserved and often repeated pattern called the motif in these sequences the motif is likely to be the tfbs a number of computational algorithms for motif_discovery have been developed over more than a decade to whom correspondence should be addressed motif_finding algorithms can usually discover the real motif i e which truly represents the tfbss when the tfbss are significantly over represented compared to random or background patterns in the given set of sequences however when analyzing long_sequences or a set of sequences in which the tfbss are not significantly_enriched random_patterns can appear equally or more conserved than the real motif and thus the real motif cannot be discovered in such datasets additional information about the real motif can aid its discovery a useful piece of information that has not been adequately exploited in the existing motif_finding algorithms is the positional localization of tfbss tfbss usually occur in specific positions relative to a biological landmark within gene regulatory_sequences for instance many tfbss are located in specific position intervals relative to the transcription_start tss tfbss of cooperating tfs also occur at specific distances from each other similarly in a set of tf_binding sequences obtained by high_throughput techniques such as chip_chip or massively_parallel the tfbss are localized around the positions of maximum signal_intensity such as a peak in chip_seq such information of positional localization of tfbss can be utilized to distinguish the real motif from random_patterns localization information has been used previously to improve the performance of motif_discovery for example analyzed motifs in drosophila regulatory_sequences of length_bp each aligned relative to the tss the analysis of complete bp sequences did not reveal many of the core_promoter motifs however in a separate analysis of the local region most core_promoter motifs were discovered similarly analyzed the and regions of arabidopsis_thaliana promoters separately in order to discover the core_promoter motifs considered both positional localization around the tss and pairwise_distances among the motifs to identify novel tfbss in human promoters imposed a positional prior on the motif in tfbss identified by chip_chip to improve motif_discovery the prior was proportional to the chip signal_intensity at a given position which was estimated by combining the intensities of all neighboring probes recently some generic motif_finding algorithms have incorporated the facility to define positional priors during motif search for example the amadeus algorithm incorporates the facility to score motifs accordingin the localized motif_finding problem the instances of a motif m occur confined within an unknown position interval p p of the input_sequences relative to an anchor point the objective is to discover the motif m and the interval p p b localmotif studies the positional distribution of the motif occurrences relative to the anchor point c different motifs could be localized within different intervals around the anchor point d a localized motif is prominently over represented in a certain interval with respect to the entire sequence_length e whereas a random_pattern may be over represented in certain intervals but not with respect to the entire_sequence to their distribution around the tss incorporated positional preference in their motif_finding algorithm glam by performing gapless local_alignment over windowed subsequences of the original sequence set aligned relative to the tss instead of the complete length these applications use a positional prior on the motif i e the localization interval of the motif is defined a priori however in most practical scenarios both the position and the length of the localization interval are unknown none of the existing algorithms has addressed this problem a solution could be to subdivide the sequences aligned relative to the biological landmark into short intervals and analyze each interval separately with the existing algorithms however this is impractical due to several reasons first it is difficult to decide the interval_length if the interval is too short or too long compared to the actual region of localization the motif will not be discovered furthermore discovering multiple motifs spread over different intervals would require selection of different interval lengths secondly this approach would report a number of random_patterns that are over represented in a short sequence interval by chance but which are not truly localized motifs there is a difference between a localized motif and a motif that is overrepresented in a short sequence interval as shown_inand e a localized motif has a distinct confinement of tfbss in a certain interval in the context of the entire sequence_length while a motif that is over represented in a certain short_interval may not have such confinement in the global context therefore local analysis without considering the global context of the motif may be misleading this is illustrated in the study of where scoring_functions with a positional bias resulted in a large number of false motifs thirdly the task of fragmenting the sequences and combining together results for several intervals is laborious and time consuming thus it would be useful to have an automated efficient algorithm to accurately discover localized motifs this article_presents a computational algorithm called localmotif for the discovery of localized motifs in sequences that have been aligned relative to a biological landmark henceforth referred to as the anchor point a new scoring measure called spatial_confinement score is introduced that assesses whether or not a motif has localized occurrence within the sequences and allows accurate demarcation of the localization interval the spatial_confinement score is combined with the existing scoring measures of motif over representation and relative entropy to evaluate the overall prominence of the motif the existing scoring measures are reformulated using information_theory so that all scores can be easily combined into a single score a time and memory_efficient greedy search algorithm utilizes this scoring_function for localized motif_discovery experiments on simulated_datasets show that localmotif has consistently better performance than existing_tools in detecting motifs in cases where they are localized in a certain sequence interval the interval_length predictions made by localmotif are also highly_accurate experiments on real_datasets show that localmotif can discover localized motifs around the tss co regulatory_motifs around known motifs and motifs in chip_seq where the existing motif_finding tools fail furthermore the interval predictions made by localmotif provide biologically useful information about tftf interactions page the advantage of localmotif scoring_function is first demonstrated in this section through a simulation experiment then the performance of motif_discovery is evaluated over both synthetic and real_datasets comparison is made with four other freely_available motif_finding tools meme weeder trawler and amadeus the localmotif algorithm has been developed for discovering motifs localized relative to a biological landmark in long regulatory_sequences a localized motif differs from a locally over represented pattern by the virtue of its spatial_confinement within the local interval a new scoring_function called scs has been developed to measure the spatial_confinement scs is found to accurately identify the interval of localization in a sequence set where the motif appears subtle to a usual motif_finding algorithm localization property allows the motif to still be discovered with high_accuracy using the localmotif scoring_function information_theoretic framework has been found useful for formulating the scoring_function to be consistent for motifs of different lengths and mutations this allows selection of best motifs while removing their redundant forms the new formulation gives a clear quantitative as well as qualitative picture of the motifs relevance considering its over representation relative entropy and spatial_confinement the three individual scoring measures can be combined in various ways to rank motifs according to their performance in one of more of the three characteristics three specific examples where positional localization of motifs is found useful were reported these include regulatory_sequences surrounding the tss sequences flanking a known tfbs and sequences flanking the peaks in a chip_seq dataset localmotif could detect motifs in longer_sequences as compared to other tools which are sensitive to sequence_length and could amplify weak motifs in case they were localized for similar reasons localmotif also detected a number of co regulatory_motifs flanking a main motif with the emergence of chip_seq co motif_discovery using positional localization is extremely relevant the interval predictions reported by localmotif provide_additional the range of tftf interactions localmotif is presently based on the l d motif model there are emerging opinions in the literature to give a more accurate description of the motif such as gapped motifs or motifs based on iupac character set it will be interesting to study which motif representations lead to more accurate results on biological data the localmotif algorithm could also be improved from a heuristic_search to exact search in the future using efficient data_structures such as suffix_tree and fm_index
