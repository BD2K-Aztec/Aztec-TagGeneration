gene_expression a stochastic expectation and maximization algorithm for detecting quantitative_trait associated genes motivation most biological_traits may be correlated with the underlying gene_expression that are partially determined by dna sequence_variation the correlations between gene_expressions and quantitative_traits are essential for understanding the functions of genes and dissecting gene_regulatory results in the present study we adopted a novel statistical_method called the stochastic expectation and maximization sem algorithm to analyze the associations between gene_expression levels and quantitative trait_values and identify genetic_loci controlling the gene_expression variations in the first step gene_expression levels measured from microarray_experiments were assigned to two different clusters based on the strengths of their association with the phenotypes of a quantitative_trait under investigation in the second step genes associated with the trait were mapped to genetic_loci of the genome because gene_expressions are quantitative the genetic_loci controlling the expression traits are called expression_quantitative we applied the same sem algorithm to a real_dataset collected from a barley genetic experiment with both quantitative_traits and gene_expression for the first time we identified genes associated with eight agronomy traits of barley these genes were then mapped to seven chromosomes of the barley genome the sem algorithm and the result of the barley data analysis are useful to scientists in the areas of bioinformatics and plant breeding availability_and the r program for the sem algorithm can be downloaded from our website http www statgen differential_expression often applies to discrete phenotypes primarily dichotomous phenotypes the phenotype is often defined as normal or affected if a phenotype is measured_quantitatively it is often converted into two or a few discrete ordered phenotype so that a differential_expression or an analysis of variances anova method can be applied it is obvious that such to whom correspondence should be addressed discretization is subject to information_loss the current microarray_data analysis technique has not been able to efficiently analyze the association of gene_expression with a continuous phenotype pearson_correlation between gene_expression and a quantitative_trait has been proposed ranked genes according to the correlation_coefficients of gene_expression with mmse a quantitative measurement of the severity of alzheimers_disease ad and detected many genes that are associated with ad used a within family correlation_analysis to remove the effect of family stratification pearson_correlation is intuitive and easy to calculate however it may not be optimal because i the correlation_coefficient may not be the best indicator of the association ii higher_order association cannot be detected iii data are analyzed individually with one gene at a time and iv the method cannot be extended to association of gene_expression with multiple continuous phenotypes investigated the association of gene_expression with six malting quality phenotypes quantitative_traits of barley cultivars they compared the distance_matrix of each gene_expression among the cultivars with the distance_matrix calculated from the phenotypes of all six traits using the g test_statistic the g test_statistic was designed to measure the similarity between two matrices for each gene there is a distance_matrix based on the expression levels for the phenotypes of six traits there is another distance_matrix the two matrices are compared for the similarity if the similarity is high the gene is associated with all the six phenotypes eventually the associations of the phenotypes with all the genes are evaluated the distance_matrix comparison approach may have the same flaws as the correlation_analysis recently we proposed to use the regression_coefficient of the expression on a continuous phenotype as the indicator of the strength of association instead of analyzing one gene at a time we took a model_based approach to studying all genes simultaneously extended the model_based algorithm to capture genes having higher_order association with the phenotype the model_based analysis classifies genes into several clusters and all clusters share the same variancecovariance structure the analysis is implemented via the expectationmaximization em_algorithm several problems have been encountered for this method one is the identifiability problem where the cluster labels can be exchanged among different clusters the other problem occurs when two or more clusters often have the same cluster mean these two problems can be avoided by introducingpage we adopted a new statistical_method sem for quantitative_trait associated microarray_data analysis we used the method to analyze microarrayed genes associated with eight quantitative_traits in barley many genes have been identified to be associated with these traits the actual functions of these genes in barley are not known prior to this study these genes are provided in supplementary table s sheet sheet and supplementary for example among the genes are related to grain protein_content this dataset provides much information for barley biologists to further study these genes the functions of some genes are known in rice for example according to blastx results transcript rbah f s at is the code for the cyclopropane fatty_acyl phospholipid synthase in rice this gene is strongly associated to the grain protein in barley with an f test_statistic of and a p value of zero the same sem algorithm for phenotype associated microarray_data analysis has been applied to eqtl_mapping with virtually no modification the eqtl_mapping conducted was still an interval mapping_approach where one marker is analyzed at a time however all the transcripts were analyzed simultaneously this is already a significant_improvement over the traditional interval mapping for qtl where one transcript was analyzed at a time results of the eqtl_analysis are provided in supplementary table s sheet sheet and supplementary sheet sheet this dataset will help barley biologists to infer gene_networks for these quantitative_traits transcripts simultaneously associated with one marker belong to the same network or pathway because they are all controlled by the segregation of the same locus for example marker abc d cm on chromosome controls the expression of about of the transcripts associated with the grain protein these transcripts are allegedly to be in the same pathway for the development of grain protein theoretically the method can analyze all markers simultaneously using a single model this is the all transcript and all marker model practically however it is difficult to handle the large matrix with a dimensionality repeatedly in the sem algorithm the theory is identical to the joint analysis of all the eight traits a matrix further study on this simultaneous analysis is needed for the sem algorithm the mcmc implemented bayesian eqtl_mapping can be adopted here but it is a sampling based method and is time consuming in terms of computing time this study focused on the sem algorithm for phenotype associated microarray_analysis with the eqtl_mapping as an example of extension to other problems finally the data were analyzed using an r program which can be downloaded from our laboratory website www statgen ucr edu under the phenotype associated microarray section a sample dataset subset of the barley data is also provided in the website for interested users to test the method users may customize the code to analyze their own data using the sem algorithm
