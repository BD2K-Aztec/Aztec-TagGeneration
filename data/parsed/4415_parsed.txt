sequence_analysis statistical challenges associated with detecting copy_number with next_generation motivation analysing next_generation ngs_data for copy_number cnvs detection is a relatively new and challenging field with no accepted standard protocols or quality_control measures so_far there are by now several algorithms developed for each of the four broad methods for cnv_detection using ngs namely the depth of coverage doc read_pair split_read and assembly based_methods however because of the complexity of the genome and the short_read from ngs_technology there are still many challenges associated with the analysis of ngs_data for cnvs no matter which method or algorithm is used results in this review we describe and discuss areas of potential_biases in cnv_detection for each of the four methods in particular we focus on issues_pertaining to i mappability ii gc_content bias iii quality_control measures of reads and iv difficulty in identifying duplications to gain insights to some of the issues_discussed we also download real_data from the genomes_project and analyse its doc data we show examples of how reads in repeated regions can affect cnv_detection demonstrate current gc correction algorithms investigate sensitivity of doc algorithm before and after quality_control of reads and discuss reasons for which duplications are harder to detect than deletions copy_number cnvs are an important and abundant source of variation in the human_genome encompassing a greater proportion of the genome as compared with singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps an estimated of a single_genome differs from the reference human_genome when considering cnvs as compared with by in the past several years snp_arrays and array comparative hybridization acgh are commonly used for detection of cnvs albeit with relatively low_resolution especially in terms of breakpoint determination sanger_sequencing of paired_reads often seen as the gold_standard for cnv_detection is able to detect_cnvs with higher accuracy and resolution to detect balanced rearrangements such as inversions and translocations and to detect_cnvs in regions where probe density of other platforms such as snp_arrays is low however the technique is not feasible for a large number of genomes because of time and budget constraints next_generation ngs or also known as high_throughput attempts to combine the benefits of array technology and sequencing the biggest advantage of ngs over traditional_sanger is the ability to sequence millions of reads in a single run at a comparatively inexpensive cost however because of the complexity of the genome and the short_read usually bp from ngs_technology there are still many challenges associated with the analysis of ngs_data for cnvs no matter which method or algorithm is used the growing popularity and success of ngs are evident from large_scale projects such as the genomes_project http www genomes org which aims to sequence at least individuals from different populations around the world to construct a detailed map of genetic_variations in the human_genome thus far in its pilot_phase the project has identified million snps million short indels and structural_variations svs most of which were previously_unreported of deletions and of duplications are novel the average sv size detected by the study was kb approximately four times smaller than a recent sv_detection study using tiling cgh array svs include dosage altering variants such as cnvs usually defined as deletions and insertions larger than kb and shorter indels as well as dosage neutral variants such as inversions and translocations nevertheless current analytical methodologies to analyse ngs_data for cnvs are not yet mature and there are no well established pipelines protocols quality_control measures broadly there are four methods for cnv_detection using ngs_data namely i depth of coverage doc or also known as read_depth rd methods ii paired_end pem or also known as read_pair methods iii split_read sr and iv assembly based as methods the different methods are usually complementary to one another as the underlying concepts excel at detecting certain types of variants and a large proportion of discovered variants remain unique to a particular approach for example in the genomes_project cnv analysis the group applied various variations of the four methods with a total of call sets with to whom correspondence should be addressed vastly varying_degrees of false_discovery fdr as well as notable differences in terms of genomic_regions ascertained cnv size_range and breakpoint precision among the different methods this review article highlights and investigates the challenges encountered when analysing ngs_data for cnvs in particular we focus on issues_pertaining to i mappability ii gc_content bias iii quality_control measures of reads and iv difficulty in identifying duplications as the characteristics of cnvs in germline and tumour_cells are different we caution that this review_focuses largely on cnvs in the germline and issues unique to tumour cnvs also known as copy_number are not discussed ngs with its ability to perform massive_parallel in a single run is becoming increasingly popular this brings with it an unprecedented opportunity to sequence many genomes at a relatively inexpensive cost as compared with using sanger_sequencing however with billions of reads generated per individual the sheer and exponentially increasing amount of data demands for better bioinformatics support and computers with larger storage and higher computing powers no less important than the production of the data is the information_technology infrastructure and bioinformatics team needed to analyse it with speculations that the costs associated with handling storing and analysis of the data could be more than the production of the data analysing ngs_data for structural_variants is a relatively new and challenging field with no standard protocols or quality_control measures the four methods of cnv_detection are complementary comparing doc pem and sr methods used in the genomes_project each approach uniquely discovered of the cnvs these three methods require first mapping the sequenced_reads to a reference_genome as the mapped_reads are used in all downstream_analysis this first step of alignment is extremely crucial as has been shown in the article how the aligner or subsequent algorithm deals with reads in repeat regions is important for detecting variants that lie in these regions currently the problem of cnv_detection in repeated regions is still not completely solved using real_data from the genomes_project this article highlights and investigates challenges associated with current methodologies and areas of potential_biases encountered when analysing ngs_data for cnvs in particular we focus on issues_pertaining to i mappability ii gc_content bias iii quality_control measures of reads and iv difficulty in identifying duplications we feel this is a timely critical review that would aid researchers in a much needed well validated pipeline for the analysis of structural_variants
