learning subgroup specific regulatory_interactions and regulator independence with paradigm high_dimensional omics profiling provides a detailed molecular view of individual cancers however understanding the mechanisms by which tumors evade cellular defenses requires deep knowledge of the underlying cellular_pathways within each cancer sample we extended the paradigm algorithm vaske et_al bioinformatics i i a pathway analysis method for combining multiple omics_data types to learn the strength and direction of gene and protein interactions curated from the literature using genomic and mrna_expression data from samples in the cancer_genome tcga cohort we learned interactions that provided support for and relative_strength of of the curated links gene_set found that genes involved in the strongest interactions were significantly_enriched for transcriptional_regulation apop tosis cell_cycle and response to tumor_cells within the tcga breast_cancer cohort we assessed different interaction strengths between breast_cancer and found interactions associated with the myc pathway and the er_alpha network to be among the most differential between basal and luminal a subtypes paradigm with the naive_bayesian assumption produced gene activity predictions that when clustered found groups of patients with better separation in survival than both the original_version of paradigm and a version without the assumption we found that this naive_bayes assumption was valid for the vast_majority of co regulators indicating that most co regulators act independently on their shared target high_throughput have created increasingly larger sets of data capturing the molecular status of cells and these advances have had great impact in the identification and understanding of the cellular_mechanisms altered in cancer identification of key targets commonly altered within specific tumors has enabled the creation of targeted_therapies over the past_years however the response_rate of many of these drugs is still which highlights our incomplete understanding of the pathways around these drugs an example of such a resistance_mechanism is activation of the ras pathway in egfr altered colon_cancer tumors where mutated kras constitutively activates the ras cascade offering growth signals independently of the egfr pathway rendering egfr blocking therapies such as cetuximab ineffective by obtaining a more complete understanding of the key routes through which oncogenic signals travel within the cellular signaling_networks it should be possible to predict new druggable targets and identify escape routes through which tumors can evade existing treatments approaches for integrating omics_data at the level of pathways have been increasingly popular in the last few years with algorithms such as gsea spia and pathologist all capable of successfully identifying altered pathways of interest given pathways curated from literature another approach has constructed causal graphs from curated interactions in literature and used these graphs to explain expression_profiles algorithms such as aracne mindy and conexic take in gene transcriptional information and copy_number in the case of conexic to identify likely transcriptional drivers across a set of cancer samples however these approaches do not attempt to group drivers into functional_networks identifying singular targets of interest some newer pathway algorithms such as netbox and mutual_exclusivity modules in cancer memo attempt to solve the problem of data_integration in cancer to identify networks across multiple data types that are key to the oncogenic_potential of samples giena looks for dysregulated gene interactions within a single biological_pathway but does not take in to account the topology of the pathway or prior_knowledge about the direction or nature of the interactions probabilistic_graphical have been used extensively in network_analysis with landmark uses in the form of bayesian_networks and markov_random several methods have successfully learned interactions from data through many different means including relevance networks our algorithm paradigm pathway recognition algorithm using data_integration on genomic models uses a probabilistic_graphical to integrate_multiple genomic_data types on curated pathway_databases and is unique for its per sample approach that allows individual samples to be assessed alone or within the context of a cohort of interest to whom correspondence should be addressed

provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com learning sensible parameters for gene interactions is essential for paradigm to infer activities within each sample in the original implementation of paradigm expectationmaximization em parameter learning was only performed by default on observational_data parameters as the limited size of available datasets prevented robust estimation of interaction parameters when using a standard conditional_probability table with discrete variables the size of the table and therefore the number of parameters grows exponentially with the number of regulators presenting additional challenges to efficient estimation of interaction parameters however by assuming a conditional_independence of the regulators we can replace the conditional_probability table with a product of independent regulatory_factors and the number of parameters grows linearly with the number of regulators examination of statistics related to regulatory links rather than individual gene activities is a view related but not directly correlated to that which is normally examined in high_throughput studies by identifying regulatory links that have significantly different usage distributions within a phenotype of interest in the cohort we can begin to examine how different regulators within a network might produce similar cellular_phenotypes despite using entirely different pathways to accomplish them additionally these learned parameters can then be used as the basis for statistical_tests to establish how well individual samples or subsets of the cohort follow the distribution of learned parameter patterns for each regulatory node this article_describes in detail this new approach and shows the overall improvement and additional analysis capabilities when applied across the tcga data we learned regulatory_interactions on a dataset of tcga tumor_samples with gene_expression and copy_number data from tissue_types we then assessed interaction significance by a g test and interaction sign with a correlation value of the interactions in the pathway model that regulate a protein were found to be significant at an fdr of a principal_component pca of the wpmi vectors for each interaction learned across the entire tcga cohort reveals a gradient from strong_inhibition to strong activation k_means of the wpmi vectors found clusters along this gradient representing canonical interaction types ranging from strong activation to strong_inhibition of significant links were placed in a cluster where the centroid was i a j going the opposite_direction of how the link was annotated in the pathway the variety of wpmi vectors shows that em was able to learn new interaction regimes that resemble activators and inhibitors as well more complex regulatory_patterns using correlation measure see section we assessed each interaction as activation or inhibition and compared with the interaction type annotated in the pathway model there were links with both significant correlation and g scores and of those the correlation of links did not agree with the direction of regulation in the pathway this leaves links that are significant by both tests and agree with the curated links we also found that that some links had high correlation values but low significance from our g tests this usually happened in cases where either the parent or child distribution greatly favored a single state we compared these results to what could be found by a straightforward pearson_correlation of gene_expression because we can not look at expression_profiles for families and complexes we tried two different approaches for this comparison first we compared our results to the expression correlation of links not involving complexes or families of the links learned by paradigm had significant correlation and g scores and did not include complexes or families for of these links the sign of correlation_coefficient disagrees with the literature on the other hand looking only at gene_expression we found non complex non family links with significant correlation but disagreed with the sign of the pathway entry for our second comparison we eliminated complexes and families in our pathway by connecting all genes that were components of families and complexes directly to any gene regulated by those families and complexes this flattening procedure resulted in links we found that of these links had significantly correlated gene_expression and that of the links had correlation that disagreed with the direction of the link in the pathway these results indicate that the links learned by paradigm are much more in agreement with the direction of the links in literature than the correlation of gene_expression is running the pca and clustering analysis on only wpmi scores learned from tcga ovarian ov patients n and without complex and family activation regulation produced very similar results to the pca and cluster centers shown in figures a and c but found fewer significant links and a higher proportion of links that were annotated as activators and learned as inhibitors or vice_versa when we used a flat initialization of px i jy we found that the cluster centers again mapped to a gradient from activation to inhibition and there were fewer significant links and a higher proportion of link direction disagreements than with initial settings that include direction information we expected the reduction in significant links between the entire tcga cohort and just ov samples because datasetswith a larger number of samples have more evidence to support even subtle interaction trends the increase in proportion of links in clusters that do not agree with their annotation could be explained by the difference in sample number because any outliers would have less effect on probabilities calculated across the entire dataset in this setting however these changes of link significance or direction are of interest because the tcga cohort contains many different diseases and tissue_types the pathway does not include details about the tissue or disease in which a given interaction was observed in the literature so it is possible that in a different tissue or disease_state and interaction direction could change either through mutation or some other mechanism these direction changes are worth studying because they may give us some insight into the mechanism of the disease our tests with flat initialization show that even without starting the link parameters in linear activation inhibition states a gradient across these linear relationships can be learned many of the links that lose significance come from the middle cluster which has little positive_or correlation but we also lose most of the links from the clusters with the strongest activation and inhibition signals this suggests that by not using prior_knowledge about link type we lost some of our strongest interactions that could have been biologically_relevant and could also reduce the quality of our final protein activity predictions to test the naive_bayes independence_assumption presented in we ran paradigm with both the independent and codependent regulation models on the tcga ovarian_cancer we tested the conditional independence_assumption on the expectations calculated at each em step of the paradigm run at every step of training fewer co regulators were found to be dependent upon each other because of small feedback_loops in the pathway such as a transcription_factor its own transcription we expect that the independence_assumption will fail in some cases additionally it is quite common for two very similar complexes differing by only one molecule to co regulate the same child node in which case we also expect the conditional_independence test to fail despite there being little conflict consequently we divide the cases where two co regulators fail the independence test into coherent and incoherent classes as shown in additionally two co regulators may fail the independence test even if one of the co regulators is an insignificant regulator owing to the strength of the other regulator we therefore also consider the subset of cases where both co regulators are significant on their own our tests show that the initial parameters produced by the weighted vote method cause almost of child nodes to fail the conditional_independence test but as the em_algorithm learns more likely parameter_settings fewer and fewer nodes fail the test combining all of our tests shows that only of child nodes are likely to have codependent regulators in a meaningful way using the ovarian_cancer we clustered the protein activity predictions produced by the original paradigm and those from both the co dependent and independent regulation models we then performed kaplanmeier analysis on these clusters to see whether they had significantly differential survival profiles we found that the clusters produced using independent regulation model activity predictions were the most separable by their survival log_rank p we also performed this test using the independent regulation model with a flat initial setting for the px i jy parameters and found that it performed_worse than the original paradigm model again this indicates that our learning method requires prior_knowledge about the type of interaction that is lost when using a flat initial interaction setting i a test of the significance of conditional_independence of any two parents given the child ii test i and at least one of the parents that fails is significantly linked to the child iii test i and the failing triplet is incoherent iv tests i ii and iii b examples of coherent versus incoherent triplets the arrows correspond to correlation with a pointed head for positive correlation activation and a flat head for negative correlation inhibition the interactions between parents are not found in the literature so we use double sided arrows because we can not know the direction of that interactionin a tissue and setting its saturation proportional to its significance the strongest differential g scores were seen for links regulated by key cancer_genes and complexes including tp myc max hif a arnt tap a e f and ppararxra of particular interest are the links regulated by ppara rxra primarily different within gbm brain and kirc kidney and the tap a regulatory links in ov ovarian and to a lesser degree in ucec uterine endometrioid shows a plot of the wpmi signals grouped by tissue for the activating links from ppara rxra and tap a where significantly_increased weights are found on the activating diagonal indicating increased use of these links as activators in those tissues the signature of tap activity potentially indicates a female_reproductive or hormonal pattern of pathogenesis associated with p expression tap promotes the expression of cell_cycle inhibitors and inducers of apoptosis one of which is the tumor_suppressor bax which acts as an inhibitor of the activity of the oncogene bcl bcl is known to be highly_expressed in serous ovarian_cancer and our results here show that although tap is highly_expressed and is a strong promoter of bax_expression and thus bcl inhibition it is nonetheless ineffective in retarding tumorigenesis suggesting that small_molecule inhibition of bcl may be equally ineffective not surprisingly single_agent treatments of ovarian_cancer with small_molecule of bcl despite high bcl expression in serous ovarian_cancer have not succeeded to date suggesting a downstream blockade or attenuation of tap mediated activity in this type of cancer it is important to note that almost all of the serous ovarian samples here bore mutations in p perhaps suggestive of an upstream shunting of tumorigenesis as well that perhaps overcomes tap over expression or increased activity other groups have additionally shown the importance of ppararxra activity in both gbm and kirc and their sensitivity to fenofibrate a ppara agonist the tissue_specific signals identified through this analysis appear to reiterate recent biological discoveries that appear to be unique when examined in the context of the current tcga dataset the most significant links learned across the entire tcga cohort are a number of known cancer_genes including the forkhead_box transcription_factor a p and estrogen_receptor to perform a gene_set with david on the genes involved heatmap of the g score ranks colored by link correlation with red tending towards activating and blue tending towards inhibiting for visualization purposes interactions were filtered if they had a standard_deviation across all samples or did not have at least one tissue with a score of resulting in interactions out of the original i we have shown that by extending paradigm we can combine multiple omics_data to learn the strength and sign of regulatory_interactions curated from the literature the assumption of conditional_independence enables a reduction in model_complexity allows efficient estimation of regulatory parameters using existing datasets and further and we show that the independence_assumption is valid for the vast_majority of regulatory programs in addition where the independence_assumption does not hold future extensions would be able to replace the independent factors with more complex factors that properly model a co dependent regulatory program when these learned parameters are applied biological_insight can be gained from simply looking at the strongest links across a cohort of samples or by looking at how interactions change between phenotypes of interest this regulatory learning improved paradigms overall protein activity predictions resulting in better separation of survival across clusters of ovarian_cancer patients we find that though cancer_subtypes use different interactions an interaction generally has a consistent sign whenever it is used in a particular tumor this indicates that our current level of knowledge of cofactors as able to account for the cases where a gene switches the direction of activity further the concordance of our learned interaction sign and the interaction sign in databases despite the various ways that interaction sign is annotated in the biopax language across pathway_databases indicates that pathway_databases have successfully and faithfully cataloged of thousands of wetlab experiments in the literature note edges are identified by and all edges found are annotated as transcriptional_activators in the pathway
