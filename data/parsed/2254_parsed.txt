structural_bioinformatics hydropace understanding and predicting cross inhibition in serine_proteases through hydrophobic_patch centroids motivation proteinprotein_interfaces contain important information about molecular_recognition the discovery of conserved patterns is essential for understanding how substrates and inhibitors are bound and for predicting molecular binding when an inhibitor binds to different enzymes e g dissimilar sequences structures or mechanisms what we call cross inhibition identification of invariants is a difficult_task for which traditional_methods may fail results to clarify how cross inhibition happens we model the problem propose and evaluate a methodology called hydropace to detect conserved patterns interfaces are modeled as graphs of atomic apolar interactions and hydrophobic patches are computed and summarized by centroids hp centroids and their conservation is detected despite sequence and structure dissimilarity our method achieves an appropriate level of abstraction to obtain invariant properties in cross inhibition we show examples in which hp centroids successfully predicted enzymes that could be inhibited by the studied inhibitors according to brenda database enzyme inhibition occurs when a molecule binds to an enzyme thus decreasing its activity inhibitors may be proteic or non proteic they can decrease the enzymes ability to bind substrates or can lower the enzymes catalytic_activity or a combination of both inhibition is an important biochemical_mechanism that is involved in metabolism regulation it controls many intra_and pathways inflammatory and immunological processes virus_replication and many other biological_functions furthermore once this natural phenomenon is understood it might be used for biotechnological purposes including the development of drugs insecticides pesticides and disinfectants a particular case is the inhibition of peptidases on this subject the merops database is currently one of the most important peptidase to whom correspondence should be addressed repositories the merops database groups both proteases and inhibitors hierarchically into families sequence related entities and clans structure related entities a careful merops search highlighted a well known but intriguing phenomenon some protease_inhibitors lack specificity and involve different d structures and catalytic_mechanisms for instance turkey ovomucoid and englin c act in different serine peptidase clans such as pa s all trypsin like folds and sb subtilisinlike folds and soybean kunitz trypsin_inhibitor decays proteolytic_activity as much in serine peptidases as in metallopeptidases which have very different enzymatic mechanisms we call this lack of specificity cross inhibition our main_challenge in this article is to create a methodology that helps to understand and predict this phenomenon proteaseinhibitor recognition and binding are determined by a complex orchestration of interactions and entropic factors that involve the entire proteaseinhibitorsolvent system fortunately the experimental binding energetics of many proteaseinhibitor complexes have already been thermodynamically determined it is known for example that the binding of turkey ovomucoid with elastase at bullet c is characterized by a negative gibbs_free in which enthalpy change is almost negligible but entropy change is largely positive furthermore we spot a clear trend of higher apolar polar accessible_surface ratio toward interface supplementary which is an evidence of the importance of the hydrophobic_interactions in proteaseinhibitor complex formation that said we particularly focus our attention on the search for conserved hydrophobic interaction_patterns we define these patterns as invariant hydrophobic regions or patches that are in contact with the same apolar complementary parts of the inhibitor supplementary figs and we show supplementary a strong linear relationship pearsons_correlation of between the inferred solvation entropy change and the extension of hydrophobic patches measured in terms of the number of hydrophobic atoms inside them although there are many biochemical studies that analyze diversity in inhibition processes e g experimental_characterization of inhibition is a labor_intensive process the large amount of possible inhibitors for a given enzyme can make tests costly hence in silico methods can contribute to predicting inhibitorenzyme recognition despite its evident importance there are few models and algorithms that identify recognition and interaction_patterns thatin this section we present and discuss the results of the case study of serine peptidases trypsin like and subtilisin like that are cross inhibited by eglin c and turkey ovomucoid we also compare the quality of the conserved hp centroids that are obtained by the different proposed methods
