pincage probabilistic integration of cancer_genomics data for perturbed gene identification and sample classification motivation cancer_development is driven by a complex pattern of genomic and epigenomic perturbations both types of perturbations can affect_gene levels and disease outcome integrative_analysis of cancer_genomics data may therefore improve detection of perturbed genes and prediction of disease_state as different data types are usually dependent analysis based on independence assumptions will make inefficient use of the data and potentially lead to false conclusions model here we present pincage probabilistic integration of cancer_genomics data a method that uses probabilistic integration of cancer_genomics data for combined evaluation of rna_seq gene_expression and k array dna_methylation measurements of promoters as well as gene_bodies it models the dependence between expression and methylation using modular graphical_models which also allows future inclusion of additional data types results we apply our approach to a breast invasive_carcinoma dataset from the cancer_genome consortium which includes adjacent normal and cancer samples we identify new biomarker candidates of breast_cancer development ptf a rabif rag ap timm a loc and progression serpine znf pincage discriminates better between normal and tumour_tissue and between progressing and non progressing tumours in comparison with established methods that assume independence between tested data types especially when using evidence from multiple genes our method can be applied to any type of cancer or more generally to any genomic disease for which sufficient amount of molecular data is available availability_and r scripts available atcancer genomics aims to improve patient diagnosis prognosis and treatment opportunities identification and optimal use of molecular_biomarkers is key to achieve this as they may allow for stratification of clinically_relevant cancer_subtypes and prediction of clinical_outcome individual molecular_markers of different types have long been used in the cancer field however their predictive_performance is often limited which may at least in part be explained by tumour molecular_heterogeneity combined use of multiple_markers of different molecular types is generally thought to improve discriminatory_power and clinical performance however integration using standard machine_learning ml approaches often fails to deliver a performance_gain accordingly there is a need for novel integrative approaches we hypothesize that the predictive_performance of integrative approaches can be improved by including existing knowledge on the biological_relationships between the different molecular types hence we propose a model based strategy that can be extended to the increasing array of molecular_profiling data types and demonstrate its use with dna_methylation and gene_expression data both gene_expression and dna_methylation have been extensively_studied as cancer_biomarker candidates biomarker screens from individual laboratories have typically included only relatively few patients and profiled only a single data type in contrast large patient_cohorts with hundreds of patients profiled for several molecular types are now available from the international cancer genome consortium icgc and the cancer_genome tcga these datasets offer new opportunities for exploring and developing integrative predictive approaches integration can be done across both data types and genomic_loci three main strategies for data_integration exist i navenave combination of individual methods ii use of general_purpose machine_learning and iii structured integration using prior_knowledge the first and simplest strategy combines results from separate analysis methods for individual data types for instance in a sequential greedy manner by intersecting lists with significant candidates this approach however requires that a genomic marker is statistically_significant for each analysed data type alternatively p values from analyses of individual data types may be combined given independence assumptions based on either calculation of products or sums reviewed by a weakness of this approach is the assumption of independence between tested data types which is often not fulfilled the second strategy applies general_purpose ml methods to multiple molecular data types for instance methods selecting relevant_features from normalized heterogeneous data such as lasso or elastic_net have been followed by building logistic_regression lr models or performing clustering these methods typically also miss dependencies between data types some studies successfully address this e g but at the expense of interpretability individual biomarkers identification and increased variation in predictive_performance the third strategy explicitly incorporates prior_knowledge on the structure of possible interactions between data types in one study the modules of copy_number perturbation that best explained observed gene_expression variation were called as cancer drivers paradigm is another attractive integrative approach it derives patient specific pathway activities from gene_expression and copy_number and uses these to cluster tumours into subtypes the subtypes were shown to stratify patient_survival for breast_cancer and glioblastoma a more comprehensive_review of the various integrative methods including the three types discussed here is given in here we propose a structured integrative model called probabilistic integration of cancer_genomics data pincage which includes dna_methylation at individual cpg_sites and mrna_expression the model is modular and may be extended to other data types we demonstrate its use for both candidate biomarker identification and sample classification this novel method separately models the relationships between gene_expression and methylation of two gene regions promoter and gene body it also explicitly_models the distribution of the data types and the sampling of the underlying high_throughput measurements we evaluate the method on breast invasive_carcinoma brca dataset from tcga cancer_genomics data types are often integrated under a simplifying assumption of independence we have introduced pincage a flexible model for integration of multiple gene level genomic_data types based on the probabilistic_graphical formalism we applied it to three types of data gene_expression promoter_methylation and gene body methylation pincage integrates these by modelling pairwise interactions between both dna_methylation types and gene_expression this permits joint analysis and evaluation of data tuples while considering their relationships the genome_wide analysis of gene_expression and dna_methylation across tumours and an samples in the brca dataset revealed patterns and correlations that support joint analysis of data types with flexible non parametric_models our findings also suggested that regulation of expression by methylation is usually concerted with other mechanisms in the healthy system while in cancer the impact of methylation changes on expression is more limited the strength likely depends on the genomic_context with other factors such as copy_number binding by transcription_factors mutation of regulatory_elements histone_modifications or nucleosome_positioning also affecting expression we implemented pincages probability_distributions with gaussian kernels by doing so we can encode the complex and often multimodal distributions across data types relationships and groups similarly to established methods for count_based rna_seq expression analysis that introduce a gamma prior to account for the overdispersion of poisson distributed read_counts we also model the overdispersion however using the gene specific empirical priors instead this improves model fits in the analysis of cancer datasets known for high variance to our knowledge no other method models the overdispersion in the integrative context benefits of such integrated data analysis
