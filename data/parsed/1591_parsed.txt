gene_expression eoulsan a cloud_computing based framework facilitating high_throughput analyses we developed a modular and scalable framework called eoulsan based on the hadoop implementation of the mapreduce algorithm dedicated to high_throughput sequencing_data analysis eoulsan allows users to easily set up a cloud_computing cluster and automate the analysis of several samples at once using various software solutions available our tests with amazon_web demonstrated that the computation cost is linear with the number of instances booked as is the running time with the increasing amounts of data high_throughput sequencing_data analysis requires large computer clusters associated with expensive costs that are only profitable for large genomics centers outsourcing data analysis over cloud_computing infrastructure is one alternative nevertheless software that use distributed algorithm are not common among bioinformatics developers and only few solutions have been made available for sequencing_data here we present eoulsan an open_source framework to facilitate high_throughput sequencing_data by the use of distributed computation this software has been developed in order to automate the analysis of a large number of samples at once simplify the configuration of the cloud_computing infrastructure and work with various already available analysis solutions with our framework we aimed to facilitate high_throughput analysis on cloud_computing services with an automatic modular and efficient tool this approach differs from other solutions already available for distributed calculation such as myrna cloudburst or crossbow where the cloud_computing implementation is made around a unique analysis solution in addition eoulsan is also complementary to the customizable galaxy server solution as it allows for batch analyses and it contains a full automation process able to handle external file locations and distributed file system more generally we have first implemented an automated rna_seq analysis_pipeline but all the tools are already included within eoulsan for other applications such as snp_calling or chip peak analysis the java plug in system we developed as well as the full documentation we provide allow for user contribution by the integration of other available solution in eoulsan the distributed calculation process we used is based on hadoop and it can be installed on numerous cluster server configurations we made our proof_of using aws solution as it includes emr an advanced service based on ec that easily allows hadoop distributed computation solutions to be deployed however we are working to make our software independent of emr to work directly on ec services such an evolution will allow eoulsan to be run on any other cloud_computing solutions such as open_source initiatives like opennebula or openstack this would open future possibilities by creating regional genomic computer infrastructures like iplant for example to be shared among several local highthroughput_sequencing users with a dedicated high_speed network this can speed up the time transfer_process in addition this could also favor the standardization of analysis_pipelines developed from the bioinformatics community making high_throughput really accessible for a wide audience
