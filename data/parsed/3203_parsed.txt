systems_biology ncal an r package for non linear calibration non linear calibration is a widely used method for quantifying biomarkers wherein concentration_response estimated using samples of known concentrations are used to predict the bio marker concentrations in the samples of interest the r package ncal fills an important gap in the open_source stand alone software for performing non linear calibration for curve_fitting ncal provides a new implementation of a robust bayesian_hierarchical five parameter logistic_model ncal supports a simple graphical_user that can be used by laboratory scientists and contains functionality for importing data from the multiplex bead_array assay instrumentation availability the r package ncal is available from http cran r pro ject org_web ncal under gpl or later contact yfong fhcrc org supplementary_information supplementary_information is available in the form of an r package vignette at the above repository and an faq at http research fhcrc org youyifong en resources ncal html non linear calibration is a widely used method for quantifying biomarkers in biomedical_studies there are two stages in nonlinear calibration in the first stage a concentration_response is estimated for each assay run using observed outcome for standard samples with known concentrations an assay run refers to a batch of samples run closely in time and space e g all samples run on a single microplate in the second stage point_estimates and confidence bounds are estimated for the biomarker concentrations in the samples of interest many laboratories use commercial software for performing non linear calibration these include general_purpose programs like graphpad prism and statlia as well as assay specific programs like masterplex and bio plex manager for the multiplex bead_array assay which is becoming a common assay for quantifying protein concentrations besides being expensive and hard to automate these programs provide relatively simple singlecurve fitting methods furthermore they often lack proper precision estimates for the estimated concentrations the r package ncal provides two sets of curve_fitting methods the first implemented through another r package drc is an estimating equation based method that is equivalent to those available from most existing non linear calibration software the second implemented within ncal is a robust bayesian random_effects based_approach it allows borrowing of information across multiple assay runs for the same biomarker incorporates prior information regarding the curve to curve variability and provides flexible models for the experimental_noise after obtaining a curve fit via either approach ncal estimates the biomarker concentrations in the samples of interest and computes variance estimates for the estimated concentrations ncal does not have as extensive a graphical_user as its commercial counterparts do but it does contain a simple graphical_user based on the r package gwidgets that allows non r users to perform non linear calibration ncal also provides a function that imports data from the excel files of luminex results that have been output by a bio plex instruments software
