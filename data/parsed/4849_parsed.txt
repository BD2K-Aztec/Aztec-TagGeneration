genetics_and vcf networks applying genotype networks to single_nucleotide data a wealth of large_scale genome_sequencing opens the doors to new approaches to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype one such opportunity is the possibility to apply genotype networks analysis to population_genetics data genotype networks are a representation of the set of genotypes associated with a single phenotype and they allow one to estimate properties such as the robustness of the phenotype to mutations and the ability of its associated genotypes to evolve new adaptations so_far though genotype networks analysis has rarely been applied to population_genetics data to help fill this gap here we present vcf networks a tool to determine and study genotype network_structure from single_nucleotide data genotype networks can be used to describe the evolutionary properties of a set of genotypes associated with a qualitative phenotype they are derived from genotypephenotype maps and have been used in a wide_range of systems from genetic_circuits to rna_folding and to metabolic_networks matias rodrigues and wagner in these cases genotype networks were used to predict the robustness of a phenotype to mutations and the potential of the underlying genotypes to evolve new and innovative traits there have so_far been few applications of methods based on genotypephenotype maps to empirical data even though the advent of new sequencing_technologies provides large_datasets of genotype data associated with phenotypes to take advantage of such datasets we developed vcf networks a tool to apply genotype networks analysis to next_generation data the tool permits the determination of genomic_regions with high robustness of a given phenotype i e mutations in this region affect the phenotype little or have high potential to create novel phenotypes
