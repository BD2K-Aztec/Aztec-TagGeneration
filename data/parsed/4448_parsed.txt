sequence_analysis structural rna alignment by multi_objective motivation the calculation of reliable alignments for structured rna is still considered as an open_problem one approach is the incorporation of secondary_structure information into the optimization criteria by using a weighted_sum of sequence and structure components as an objective_function as it is not clear how to choose the weighting parameters we use multi_objective to calculate a set of pareto_optimal rna_sequence structure alignments the solutions in this set then represent all possible trade_offs between the different objectives independent of any previous weighting results we present a practical multi objective dynamic_programming which is a new method for the calculation of the set of pareto_optimal to the pairwise rna_sequence structure alignment problem in selected examples we show the usefulness of this approach and its advantages over state of the art single objective algorithms availability_and the source_code of our software iso c is freely_available atthe central role of rna is that of being a messenger between transcription and protein_translation however it is known that non coding rna_molecules have a wide_range of functions in the cell like catalysis of chemical_processes or in gene_regulation and it is assumed that rna played a central role in the early_stages of life as the functionality of rna_molecules is not only defined by their primary sequences but also the interaction of their base_pairs their secondary_structure is well conserved during evolution based on this observation rna can be organized into families with similar sequences and secondary_structures the rfam database is a collection of rna_sequences arranged in currently different families each represented by a multiple_alignment of its members when the sequence_similarity is too low the construction of reliable sequence_alignments is impossible in this case structural_information can be used as another criterium to improve these alignments although much work has already been put into the development of sequence alignment_methods especially those for multiple_sequences rna_sequence structure alignment can still be considered as an open_problem rna_secondary consists of base_pairs i k j k i k j k positions from to between nucleotides of an rna_sequence through stacking effects these base_pairs tend to form helices and various kinds of loops seefor an example for complexity reasons we will restrict ourselves to non crossing structures that forbid so_called pseudo knots this means that if we have two base_pairs i j and i j with i i it follows that either i j i j or i i j j there are various methods that predict a secondary_structure from a single rna_sequence by free_energy like the dynamic_programming of zuker and stiegler however it is known that the prediction of the structure of related rna_sequences can be improved by comparative_methods most structure prediction_tools only calculate noncrossing structures but there are algorithms that predict structures with pseudo knots therefore they follow a hierarchical_approach of predicting the secondary_structure first and the pseudo knots subsequently even if recent works show that tertiary_interactions emerge early in the rna folding_process and suppress incorrect structures one rna_molecule can have the ability to fold into different suboptimal structures which differ from each other in their stability mccaskill gives an efficient algorithm that calculates all secondary_structures together with their occurrence probability in a thermodynamic_equilibrium the result is a matrix of probabilities p where an entry at position i j reflects to whom correspondence should be addressed example of a rna_molecule the primary sequence is the sequence of nucleotides encircled whereas the base_pairings in light grey between nucleotides make up the secondary_structure the probability of the bases at positions i and j to form a base_pair more precisely p ij is the sum of probabilities of all secondary_structures that have a base_pair between the nucleotides at positions i and j to our knowledge sankoffs algorithm was the first to solve the alignment and folding of rna simultaneously in its pairwise version it has a time and space complexity of on and on respectively and as a consequence it is often considered too expensive for a practical_application a simplified and more efficient variant of the sankoff algorithm is foldalign which uses a restricted energy_model to reduce the time and space complexity where dynalign features the full energy_model but it reduces the number of reasonable alignments by limiting the range of positions of matching nucleotides recently even presented an exact and efficient algorithm that uses sparsification to significantly enhance the runtime behaviour another popular implementation is locarna which is based on the work of and it incorporates structural_information into the alignment process in the form of pre_calculated base_pair probabilities it finds an optimal sequence structure alignment that maximizes an objective_function which is a weighted_sum of a sequence_alignment score and the sum of base_pair probabilities of a consensus secondary_structure all these alignment_methods depend on fixed weighting parameters for their sequence and their structure objectives which have to be estimated or optimized depending on the type of rna or the degree of structure conservation a fixed weighting can lead to undesirable sequence structure alignments a change of these parameters can have a great influence on which consensus structure is considered as optimal we treat the sequence_alignment and the consensus structure calculation as separate objectives and we solve both problems simultaneously with a new multi objective dynamic_programming the result is not one single solution that is optimal in some sense but a set of pareto_optimal this technique has been applied successfully in different fields like the multi objective routing problem or the knapsack problem with multiple_criteria in the bioinformatics area construct a set of pareto_optimal alignments of biological_sequences by treating the number of gaps and the scores for mis matches as separate objectives taneda gives an evolutionary algorithm for pairwise rna sequence_alignment that incorporates rna_structure information to approximate a set of paretooptimal solutions although it also uses the theory of dominating vectors it only calculates a rough approximation of the set of pareto_optimal alignments apart from that it depends on many parameters that influence the quality of approximation as well as the runtime behaviour we now present an algorithm that calculates the exact set of pareto_optimal
