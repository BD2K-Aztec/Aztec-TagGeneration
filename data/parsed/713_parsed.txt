beta poisson_model for single_cell analyses motivation single_cell rna sequencing_technology allows detection of gene_expression at the single_cell level one typical feature of the data is a bimodality in the cellular_distribution even for highly_expressed primarily caused by a proportion of non expressing_cells the standard and the over dispersed gamma poisson_models that are commonly used in bulk cell rna sequenc ing are not able to capture this property results we introduce a beta poisson_mixture that can capture the bimodality of the single_cell gene_expression distribution we further integrate the model into the generalized_linear framework in order to perform differential_expression the whole analytical_procedure is called bpsc the results from several real single_cell rna_seq indicate that of the transcripts are well characterized by the beta poisson_model the model_fit from bpsc is better than the fit of the standard gamma poisson_model in of the transcripts moreover in differential_expression of simulated_and bpsc performs well against edger a conventional method widely used in bulk cell rna sequencing_data and against scde and mast two recent methods specifically_designed for single_cell gene_expression at single_cell level is a stochastic_process affected by extrinsic and intrinsic noise the extrinsic noise comes from the environment outside the cell such as hormones or drugs the intrinsic noise involves intra cellular_factors such as transcription_rate burst frequency the number of mrnas burst_size and degradation_rate previous_studies have introduced different models to capture the stochastic_process due to the intrinsic noise in general there are two main approaches to measure expression of genes in a single_cell i targeted and ii whole transcriptome based the formere g using qpcr or immunohistochemistryis used tois the integration of gene_expression from multiple single cells the distribution is commonly modelled by the gamma poisson_mixture or equivalently the negative_binomial this model cannot capture the bimodality of gene_expression in singlecell data recentlybriefly introduced the beta poisson_model to capture the bimodality as well as the long_tailed behavior in the distribution as an attractive feature unlike the purely empirical gamma poisson_model for bulkrna the beta poisson model_parameters introduce one biological_interpretation in terms of burst_size and burst frequency of the celllevel expression however due to computational problems with the beta poisson_model wills et_al used an alternative discrete poisson mixture a less parameterized version of the beta poisson_model to extract the information of the burst_size and frequency the model was applied for modelling of gene level expression in qpcr based datasets furthermore no details of evaluation of modeling performance were reported another attempt of using the beta_distribution to capture bimodality property of single_cell gene_expression was introduced in the batbayes model however in this approach instead of integrating it with the poisson_distribution the beta_distribution was combined with binomial_distribution to mimic the partitioning process of rna_molecules into transcripts here we develop bpsc an analysis tool based on the betapoisson model for the single_cell and implement and apply it to several scrna_seq datasets bpsc addresses practical and realistic issues such as non integer expression values or low expression values theoretically it is suitable for both transcript_level and gene level expression which is usually higher than the transcript_level expression it is worth noting that the term transcript herein includes both isoform and other types of splicing variants the beta poisson_model allows for control of the expression drop off caused by technical noises or sequencing sensitivity bpsc includes a generalized_linear glm based on the betapoisson model to perform differential_expression of singlecell rna_seq experiments using simulated_and show that bpsc performs well against edger an established method for bulk cell rna_seq and against mast and scde two recent differential_expression methods designed for single_cell rnaseq
