systems_biology epsilon an eqtl prioritization framework using similarity_measures derived from local networks motivation when genomic_data are associated with gene_expression data the resulting expression_quantitative eqtl will likely span_multiple genes eqtl prioritization techniques can be used to select the most likely causal gene affecting the expression of a target_gene from a list of candidates as an input these techniques use physical_interaction networks that often contain highly_connected genes and unreliable or irrelevant interactions that can interfere with the prioritization process we present epsilon an extendable framework for eqtl prioritization which mitigates the effect of highly_connected genes and unreliable interactions by constructing a local network before a network based similarity measure is applied to select the true causal gene results we tested the new method on three eqtl datasets derived from yeast data using three different association techniques a physical interaction_network was constructed and each eqtl in each dataset was prioritized using the epsilon approach first a local network was constructed using a k trials shortest_path algorithm followed by the calculation of a network based similarity measure three similarity_measures were evaluated random_walks the laplacian exponential diffusion kernel and the regularized commute time kernel the aim was to predict knockout interactions from a yeast knockout compendium epsilon outperformed two reference prioritization methods random_assignment and shortest_path prioritization next we found that using a local network significantly_increased prioritization performance in terms of predicted knockout pairs when compared with using exactly the same network similarity_measures on the global network with an average increase in prioritization performance of percentage_points p availability the physical interaction_network and the source_code matlab c of our implementation can be downloaded fromexpression quantitative_trait eqtl_analysis is the process of associating genetic_variation in a population with variable gene_expression to identify polymorphic genetic regions affecting gene_expression frequently genetic_markers are used to sample the genetic_diversity between individuals of an organism owing to linkage_disequilibrium and the spacing of the genetic_markers on the genome these genetic_markers represent a region on a chromosome that covers multiple genes rather than a single gene the variability in expression of the genes found to be associated with the eqtl here referred to as target_genes is most likely caused by a mutation in a single gene located on the eqtl the true causal gene yet eqtl_analysis as such is not able to distinguish this causal gene from the remainder of the genes_located on the eqtl the candidate causal_genes instead gene_prioritization or refinement methods are needed a number of prioritization methods that rank candidate_genes according to some criterion have been developed in the pastfor an extensive overview typically these methods target novel human disease_gene information about the disease under study i e in the form of a list of existing disease genes is often needed other methods target specific experiments for which additional data divided in disease control_groups are required and cannot be readily applied to the results of an eqtl_analysis where such groups are not necessarily present also some of these techniques do not allow for the incorporation of a custom gene interaction_network as only predefined networks for a limited number of organisms are available a smaller number of techniques were developed to tackle the more specific eqtl prioritization task all eqtl prioritization methods have in common that they use a physical interaction_network to define a similarity measure between a target_gene and a set of candidate causal_genes the higher the networkbased similarity between the target and the candidate causal gene the more likely the candidate corresponds to the true causal gene developed a method based on random_walks rws in a physical interaction_network an approach later refined by who extended the rw idea with an electric circuit analogy applied the pagerank algorithm to develop a gene affinity measure and stojmirovicndused the mathematical_modeling of information_flow in a network to rank candidate_genes to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint last authors according to stojmirovicnd yu it is most important to use directed relations e g proteindna_interactions in the interaction_network whenever possible they also suggest localizing the network i e excluding distant genes from the network that connects an origin the target_gene with a set of destinations the candidate causal_genes before analysis to better reflect the biological_context otherwise results of for example gene_prioritization will be highly dependent on the node degree of the genes in the network a high node degree can point to functionally useless genes so_called promiscuous genes however genes with a high node degree can also correspond to important hubs as a result simply removing genes from the network with a node degree exceeding an arbitrary threshold or heuristically downweighting the importance of relations based on the number of connections risks removing useful genes or important relations to overcome this problem we propose epsilon an eqtl prioritization framework using similarity_measures derived from local networks the main assumption underlying epsilon is that the disturbing influence of highly_connected genes and unreliable or irrelevant interactions can be controlled by reducing the global interaction_network to a local neighborhood i e a sub network connecting the target_gene and all candidate causal_genes before calculating a network based similarity measure once the local network is constructed a similarity measure between the target_gene and all candidate causal_genes can be calculated and the candidate with the highest similarity can be selected as the true causal gene we demonstrate the added value of a local approach for eqtl prioritization by plugging in established prioritization methods such as path finding and rws in the epsilon framework alternatively we also investigate a graph node kernel_based similarity measure we evaluate the performance of all methods using a gold_standard dataset derived from a knockout compendium in this manuscript we presented epsilon a framework for eqtl prioritization that ranks a number of candidate causal_genes overlapping an eqtl based on their functional_similarity with the target_gene associated with the eqtl the method consists of two steps i local network construction and ii the application of a network based similarity measure epsilon is a modular framework that allows for the incorporation of existing network construction procedures and network similarities we evaluated a k trials shortest_path network construction method together with rw and kernel_based similarity_measures using a gold_standard dataset derived from a yeast knockout compendium we were able to show that our approach the combination of local networks with network based similarity_measures outperformed random_assignment and a shortest_path reference method more interestingly the global network analogues of the network similarity_measures too were outperformed significantly p clearly showing the added value of using local over global networks we assume that constraining the global network to a local neighborhood around the target_gene and all candidate causal_genes is effectively reducing the disturbing impact of hubs and promiscuous genes highly_connected genes in the global network may still be present in the local networks but the number of interactions those genes participate in will be significantly_reduced an additional explanation of the difference between a local and global approach is the inclusion of directional information in the sub network construction even though direction information is not used for the calculation of the similarity_measures there are indications that the led kernel outperforms the rw similarity measure but more research is needed to confirm this we observed large differences in prioritization performance when different eqtl datasets were used mm npr and en especially the en eqtl seemed to be more difficult to prioritize possibly the quality of the en associations was lower than that of the other association techniques all experiments were run with and without tf filtering tf filtering is a technique used by several other authors where it is demanded that a target_gene be reached through transcription_factor interactions we were not able to detect any significant effect of tf filtering on the results obtained
