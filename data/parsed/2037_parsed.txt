sequence_analysis genomon itdetector a tool for somatic internal_tandem detection from cancer_genome data somatic internal tandem_duplications itds are known to play_important in cancer pathogenesis although recent_advances in high_throughput have enabled genome_wide detection of various types of genomic mutations including single_nucleotide indels and structural_variations only a few studies have focused on itds we have developed an analytical tool called genomon itdetector for genome_wide detection of som atic itds after evaluating the sensitivity and precision of the proposed approach using synthetic data we have demonstrated that it can successfully detect not only common itds involving flt but also a number of itds affecting other putative driver_genes in acute_myeloid exome_sequencing recent_advances in high_throughput have enabled genome_wide detection of various genomic_alterations in cancer_cells and a number of analytical_tools have been developed for detecting single_nucleotide short indels and structural_variations svs from cancer_genome data on the other hand it is widely known that an internal_tandem itd that involves several tens to several hundreds of nucleotides represents a common type of somatic alteration that plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis through either activating or inactivating affected genes in particular itds involving fms_like flt are among the most frequent genetic_lesions and are found in of patients_with aml leading to aberrant activation of the kinase and negatively affecting survival however despite their potential importance in cancer development somatic itds have been poorly focused because most current approaches are not sensitive enough to identify indels of more than several tens of base_pairs or svs within small_scale regions bp rendering itds as blind spots for most existing analytical_methods in this article we present a novel software application genomon itdetector which is specifically_designed for performing sensitive and genome_wide detection of somatic itds spanning several tens to several hundreds of base_pairs from cancer_genome data the effectiveness of genomon itdetector for detecting somatic itds was demonstrated using both synthetic and real_data still there are several remaining issues first the current approach cannot detect itds with more than two duplicates one possible solution would be to check whether the oin in the assembled contig sequence is double triple or greater of the pdns second the proposed approach is for somatic itd detection only not germ_line detection for the detection of germ_line itds alignment artifacts and germ_line itds must be effectively distinguished for this filtering use of multiple non matched control samples may provide a solution however the data cannot be used directly in our current method and this problem requires further investigation
