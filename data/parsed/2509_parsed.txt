integrating quantitative_proteomics and metabolomics with a genome_scale model motivation the availability of modern sequencing_techniques has led to a rapid increase in the amount of reconstructed metabolic_networks using these models as a platform for the analysis of high_throughput transcriptomic proteomic and metabolomic_data can provide_valuable conditional changes in the metabolic_activity of an organism while transcriptomics and proteomics provide_important the hierarchical regulation of metabolic_flux metabolomics shed light on the actual enzyme_activity through metabolic_regulation and mass action effects here we introduce a new method termed integrative omics metabolic analysis ioma that quantitatively integrates proteomic and metabolomic_data with genome_scale to more accurately_predict metabolic flux_distributions the method is formulated as a quadratic_programming qp problem that seeks a steady_state flux distribution in which flux through reactions with measured proteomic and metabolomic_data is as consistent as possible with kinetically derived flux estimations results ioma is shown to successfully predict the metabolic_state of human_erythrocytes compared to kinetic model_simulations showing a significant_advantage over the commonly used methods flux_balance and minimization of metabolic adjustment thereafter ioma is shown to correctly predict metabolic_fluxes in escherichia_coli under different gene_knockouts for which both metabolomic and proteomic_data is available achieving higher prediction_accuracy over the extant methods considering the lack of high_throughput flux measurements while high_throughput metabolomic and proteomic_data are becoming readily available we expect ioma to significantly contribute to future_research of cellular_metabolism modern genome_sequencing capabilities have led to the generation of genome_scale reconstructions for many microorganisms giving rise to more than highly curated metabolic reconstructions that have been published to date a metabolic network_reconstruction is composed of a set of biochemical_reactions and the associations between these reactions and their enzymecoding genes the constraint_based cbm computational framework serves to analyze the functionality of these genome_scale to whom correspondence should be addressed models enabling the prediction of various metabolic phenotypes in microorganism such as growth_rates nutrient uptake_rates byproduct secretions and gene_essentiality cbm has been used for a variety of applications including the comparative metabolic analyses over multiple_organisms drug_discovery metabolic_flux studies of network evolution and metabolic_engineering tasks using metabolic_models as scaffolds for the analysis of high_throughput data such as transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics suggests the possibility of inferring conditiondependent changes in the metabolic_activity of an organism developing computational_methods capable of predicting metabolic_flux by integrating these data_sources with a metabolic_network is hence a major_challenge of metabolic_network modeling previous investigations have already utilized cbm to integrate high_throughput molecular datasets with a metabolic_network in a qualitative manner the methods developed byand becker and palsson use gene_expression data to identify genes that are absent or likely to be absent in certain contexts they then search for metabolic_states that prevent or minimize the flux through the associated metabolic_reactions a recent method byconsiders data on both lowly and highly_expressed in a given context as cues for the likelihood that their associated reactions carry metabolic_flux and employs cbm to accumulate these cues into a global consistent prediction of the metabolic_state the lack of dependency on a cellular objective is a marked advantage of this approach as the latter is difficult to define for multi_cellular organisms while transcriptomics and proteomics_data provides important insight into hierarchical regulation of metabolic_flux representing the control over the maximum activity of enzymesi e vmax metabolomics may provide information on an additional level of regulation called metabolic_regulation the latter denotes the effect of metabolite_concentrations on actual enzyme_activity through mass action kinetic and allosteric_effects a previous cbm method for integrating metabolomic_data with a metabolic_network model thermodynamic based metabolic_flux tmfa derives constraints on reaction directionality from metabolite_concentration data based on thermodynamic principles another method byintegrates quantitative metabolome data with genome_scale models to identify reporter reactions defined as the set of reactions that respond to genetic or environmental_perturbations through coordinated variations in the levels of surrounding metabolites currently however there is no cbm method that enables thethis study presents a novel approach for integrating quantitative_proteomic and metabolomic_data with a genome_scale model to predict flux alterations under different perturbations based on a mechanistic_model for determining reaction rate the method predicts feasible flux_distributions while accounting for missing concentration levels of substrate and product metabolites for some enzymes for potential noise in both the proteomic and metabolomic_data and for the simplifying rate equation formalism used ioma is shown to successfully predict changes in fluxes both in e colis central_metabolism under various genetic_perturbations and in a simulated rbc kinetic_model displaying a significant_improvement versus the commonly used fba and moma methods metabolic_fluxes are the most informative and direct indices of the metabolic and physiological_state of cells tissues and hence inferring their state in different biological_contexts is probably the holy_grail of metabolic modeling however in a somewhat spiteful way while we are facing an ever increasing availability of numerous pertaining high_throughput omics_data including transcriptomic proteomic and metabolomic measurements the measurement of fluxes is still very challenging and limited to a small fraction of the reactions present in cells hence there is an emerging need to continue and develop new computational_methods for robustly inferring the flux state while capitalizing on these other available omics measurements in this context ioma presents an_important in this direction which hopefully will be followed upon by others ioma profits from the absolute_quantification of metabolites levels in contrast to fold changes that are becoming available while absolute_quantification of proteins is not necessary apart from the specific kind of reaction rate laws utilized in this work ioma can be used with a variety of rate laws including different types of regulation or enzyme saturation the only restriction is that the rate laws can be represented in the form of equation where estimates of the terms a and a can be recomputed based on available data future work for improving flux predictions could possibly utilize existing information on the thermodynamic constants of reactions to further constraint the models solution_space following another potential application of ioma is the prediction of metabolic_flux alterations associated with human metabolic_disorders as means for predicting potential clinical biomarkers encouragingly genome_scale human metabolic_models have already shown their value in this highly important clinical task e g in the case of inborn_errors but as the methods used up until now have been simple and straightforward there is certainly much room for improvement ahead to which methods like ioma are bound to serve as solid starting points
