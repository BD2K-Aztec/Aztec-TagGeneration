data_and keggparser parsing and editing kegg_pathway maps in matlab kegg_pathway is a collection of manually drawn pathway maps accompanied with kgml format files intended for use in automatic_analysis kgml files however do not contain the required information for complete reproduction of all the events indicated in the static image of a pathway map several parsers and editors of kegg_pathways exist for processing kgml files we introduce keggparsera matlab based tool for kegg_pathway parsing semiautomatic fixing editing visualization and analysis in matlab environment it also works with scilab availability_and the source_code is available atkegg pathway database is a collection of manually drawn pathway maps representing current knowledge on molecular_interaction and reaction_networks accompanied with kgml kegg markup_language files for automatic computational_analyses and modelling of metabolic and signalling_networks pathways in kgml are represented as graph objects with entry elements gene_products compounds pathways as nodes and relations between elements as edges however in most cases kgml files do not fully correspond to the static pathway images inconsistencies may include absence of event or entity labels reversed directions for some associations absence of some interactions ambiguous definitions of group nodes compounds and their interactions investigation of five randomly_chosen kegg_pathways tight_junction ubiquitin mediated proteolysis toll_like signalling autoimmune_thyroid and homologous_recombination revealed that they contain on average and inconsistencies concerned with labelling missing interactions directionality and group node definitions respectively see supplementary data why to edit kegg_pathways after kgml parsing section these inconsistencies may have significant distorting effects on pathway flows thus preprocessing of information contained in a kgml file is needed before it can be used in automatic_analysis several kgml parsers have been developed recently such as kgml ed kegggraph keggreader plugin for cytoscape http cytoscape github com kgmlreader and keggtranslator although some of these applications have the appropriate functionality for retrieving parsing visualizing and editing kgml formatted files they all suffer from the aforementioned limitations of those files moreover some of the softwares have additional drawbacks e g keggreader has reduced functionality for non metabolic_networks and kegggraph and keggtranslator do not completely support edge and node editing operations in general whichever program is chosen there is always a need for saving manually edited pathways in an appropriate format suitable for further automated analyses of pathway data as each program provides certain file_formats for pathway maps which cannot be used in matlab for automated pathway analysis a pathway editor is also needed to be developed in matlab environment in this article we introduce keggparser pathway semiautomatic parser editor which is based solely on functions contained in matlab its bioinformatics toolbox version x and image_processing toolbox x and it does not require any third_party package this tool is aimed at enriching matlabs bioinformatics toolbox functionality which is focused on solving the most contemporary bioinformatics tasks in addition we have also ported keggparser into scilab a free open_source alternative for matlab included in the source files archive
