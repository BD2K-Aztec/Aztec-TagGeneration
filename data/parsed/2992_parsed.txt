databases_and mirenvironment database providing a bridge for micrornas environmental_factors and phenotypes the interaction between genetic_factors and environmental_factors has critical roles in determining the phenotype of an organism in recent_years a number of studies have reported that the dysfunctions on microrna mirnas environmental_factors and their interactions have strong effects on phenotypes and even may result in abnormal phenotypes and diseases whereas there has been no a database linking mirnas environmental_factors and phenotypes such a resource platform is believed to be of great value in the understanding of mirnas environmental_factors especially drugs and diseases in this study we constructed the mirenvironment database which contains a comprehensive collection and curation of experimentally supported interactions among mirnas environmental_factors and phenotypes the names of mirnas phenotypes environmental_factors conditions of environmental_factors samples species evidence and references were further annotated mirenvironment represents a biomedical resource for researches on mirnas environmental_factors and diseases
