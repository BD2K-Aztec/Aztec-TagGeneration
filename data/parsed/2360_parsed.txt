imotifs an integrated sequence_motif visualization and analysis environment motivation short_sequence are an important class of models in molecular_biology used most commonly for describing transcription_factor binding site_specificity patterns high_throughput methods have been recently_developed for detecting regulatory_factor binding_sites in vivo and in vitro and consequently high_quality binding_site motif data are becoming available for increasing number of organisms and regulatory_factors development of intuitive tools for the study of sequence_motifs is therefore important imotifs is a graphical motif analysis environment that allows visualization of annotated sequence_motifs and scored motif hits in sequences it also offers motif inference with the sensitive nestedmica algorithm as well as overrepresentation and pairwise motif matching capabilities all of the analysis functionality is provided without the need to convert between file_formats or learn different command_line interfaces the application includes a bundled and graphically integrated version of the nestedmica motif inference suite that has no outside dependencies problems associated with local deployment of software are therefore avoided availability imotifs is licensed with the gnu lesser general_public v lgpl the software and its source is available at http wiki github com mz imotifs and can be run on mac os x leopard intel powerpc we also provide a cross_platform linux os x windows lgpl licensed library libxms for the perl ruby r and objective c programming_languages for input and output of xms formatted annotated sequence_motif set files contact matias until recent_years studying sequence_specificity of transcription_factors systematically has been limited to a relatively small number of organisms and transcription_factors high_throughput protein_dna assays such as protein binding microarrays bacterial one hybrid screens large chip_chip studies and advances in motif inference algorithms and tools has however caused an expansion of motif databases such as uni probe transfac and jaspar to whom correspondence should be addressed sequence_motif analysis tools can be hard to deploy and use locally many commonly used software_packages have therefore been made available as web_applications public servers can however be limited in the cpu time given to users which can rule out their use for large_scale studies data_exchange and usability can also be a challenge therefore we have created an os x based desktop software_package for sequence_motif analysis that is easy to install and update compared with previously_published desktopbased cis_regulatory sequence_analysis such as toucan or sockeye imotifs is more focused on visualization and computation of sequence_motifs although it also supports visualizing scored motif matches in sequences we have created an integrated desktop_application for short sequence_motif analysis it incorporates visualization inference alignment and comparison tools the application widens the user base of sequence_motif analysis tools and can improve the productivity of researchers working with sequence_motif data we aim to integrate with more sequence_motif analysis tools and web_services and to develop further the already included basic protein motif visualization and inference support we also encourage the introduction of a standard format for exchange of sequence_motif data by providing conversion utilities and an api for input and output of xms motif set files for a number of common bioinformatics programming_languages
