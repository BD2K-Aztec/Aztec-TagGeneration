lineage based identification of cellular_states and expression programs we present a method lineageprogram that uses the developmental lineage relationship of observed gene_expression to improve the learning of developmentally relevant cellular_states and expression programs we find that incorporating lineage information allows us to significantly improve both the predictive_power and interpretability of expression programs that are derived from expression measurements from in vitro differentiation experiments the lineage tree of a differentiation experiment is a tree graph whose nodes describe all of the unique expression states in the input expression measurements and edges describe the experimental perturbations applied to cells our method lineageprogram is based on a log linear_model with parameters that reflect changes along the lineage tree regularization with l that based_methods controls the parameters in three distinct ways the number of genes change between two cellular_states the number of unique cellular_states and the number of underlying_factors responsible for changes in cell state the model is estimated with proximal operators to quickly discover a small number of key cell states and gene_sets comparisons with existing factorization techniques such as singular_value and non_negative show that our method provides higher predictive_power in held out tests while inducing sparse and biologically_relevant gene_sets the directed differentiation of embryonic_stem es_cells into therapeutically important cell_types holds_great for regenerative_medicine identifying stage specific transcription_factor candidates for the directed differentiation of es_cells has been difficult and the computational_identification of lineage associated transcription_factor programs would significantly benefit this process lineageprogram is a new method that identifies the experimental_protocols that result in the same cellular_states it further decomposes these states into interpretable expression programs which we define to be sets of co varying genes in contrast to analyzing the correlation between genes we define a to whom correspondence should be addressed lineageprogram attempts to identify salient cellular_states and covarying gene_sets different treatments may result in the same cell state a and a after definitive endoderm while some treatments may have no effect a at stem_cell our goal is to merge and prune these types of treatments program to be sets of genes that co vary during a differentiation event analysis of developmental_expression data has revealed the existence of expression programs regulating pluripotency across many cell typesas well as lineage_specific programs we provide a principled method that discovers both types of programs lineageprogram is a log linear_model that uses latent_factors and l regularization to obtain sparse parameters structures and spectra our primary goal is to estimate expression programs that are informed and improved by lineage information to our knowledge lineageprogram is the first method to approach this problem prior work in the estimation of developmental_expression programs has used biclustering factor or topic decompositions mixture_models and self_organizing all of which simultaneously identify expression programs and sample clusters but without incorporating information from the experimental lineage as shown in studies of expression time series treating dependent expression data as independent observations can lead to significant loss of information separate prior work has focused on estimating lineage trees and lineage states in the absence of expression programs differentiation has been modeled both as a time series without branching and de_novo tree estimation the remainder of this article_presents the lineageprogram model section a comparative_analysis of lineageprogram with other methods on lineage associated expression data from motor_neuron and pancreatic development section and a conclusion about what we have learned about using lineage information section the algorithm was tested on directed differentiation experiments for murine pancreatic progenitors and motor_neurons as shown in both lines were produced using known differentiation protocols the pancreatic line has a large number of states but relatively few replicates while the motor_neuron line has multiple replicates per state the microarray measurements of the pancreatic line were performed with illumina bead arrays while the in the motor_neuron line were performed with affymetrix a microarrays we rank match the illumina data to the affymetrix data in order to reduce the data to the same scale the quantile normalization technique is described in further detail by we have presented lineageprogram a log_linear sparse regularized model and inference algorithm for lineage associated expression data that provide strong interpretability with no loss in predictive_power existing flat modeling_methods were unable to cope with the large number of leaves that occur at the ends of the differentiation experiment and significant statistical_power is lost re estimating the background cellular expression levels our biological metrics also suggest that flat factorization methods do not extract biologically_meaningful expression programs and modeling the differences between each differentiation state is necessary to estimating fine behaviors occuring during differentiation our analysis of the combined pancreas and motor_neuron data provides a computational_analysis of the pancreatic and motor_neuron differentiation_pathways that recapitulate known biological_markers and states the ability of the sparse regularization to remove spurious branches in the lineage tree suggests the use of this model to estimate novel cellular_states in later stage differentiation experiments where explicit cellular_states are less characterized although we have restricted our model to expression based data we hope to extend this framework of l regularized branching models to sequencing_data with similar structure the penalty model presented here would allow a wide_variety of log convex generative_models to incorporate lineage associated structure
