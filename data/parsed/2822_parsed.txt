genetics_and mbmdr an r package for exploring gene_gene associated with binary or quantitative_traits we describe mbmdr an r package for implementing the model based multifactor_dimensionality mb_mdr method mb_mdr has been proposed by calle et_al as a dimension_reduction method for exploring genegene_interactions in case_control studies it is an extension of the popular multifactor_dimensionality mdr method of ritchie et_al allowing a more flexible definition of risk cells in mb_mdr risk categories are defined using a regression_model which allows adjustment for covariates and main effects and in addition to the classical low_risk and high_risk categories mb_mdr considers a third category of indeterminate or not informative cells an important improvement added to the current mbmdr algorithm with respect to the original mb_mdr formulation in calle et_al and also to the classical mdr approach is the extension of the methodology to different outcome types while mb_mdr was initially proposed for binary_traits in the context of case_control the mbmdr package provides options to analyze both binary or quantitative_traits for unrelated_individuals availability http cran r project org model based multifactor_dimensionality mb_mdr has been proposed byas a dimension_reduction method for exploring genegene_interactions in casecontrol association studies mb_mdr extends the multifactor_dimensionality mdr method ofin several ways like mdr the mb_mdr method merges multilocus genotypes into a one dimensional construct but the way the genotype cells are merged differs in mb_mdr an additional noevidence category allows a more accurate categorization into high_level low_level and indeterminate or non informative cells other extensions to improve the performance and applicability of mdr have been proposed including the odds_ratio based mdr or mdr method and the generalized mdr gmdr unlike these mdr extensions mbmdr does not involve division of the data into training and to whom correspondence should be addressed learning sets and therefore does not select the best interaction model via prediction_accuracy and cross_validation consistency measures instead mb_mdr measures the association between multi_locus genotypes and the phenotype and provides a set of statistically_significant interactions instead of a single best model significance is assessed through a permutation_test this strategy has proven to be more powerful than mdr in the presence of genetic_heterogeneity submitted for publication an additional feature of mb_mdr is its flexibility for dealing with different kind of phenotypes by changing the link function of the regression_analysis mb_mdr was initially proposed for binary_traits in the context of case_control but the mbmdr package presented here has been implemented to allow for quantitative_traits mb_mdr has been successfully_applied to a set of single_nucleotide snps in inflammation related genes as a preliminary phase to identify epistatic_effects in the spanish bladder_cancer epicuro study this is a case_control conducted in spanish centers during that included cases and controls unlike mdr this approach allowed to adjust the analysis for the main bladder_cancer risk_factors smoking_status age gender and region mbmdr identified one second order interaction and five three way interactions with p while some interactions seem to be biologically sound others were unexpected and need to be replicated in independent series before validating them in the lab mb_mdr has also been applied to a study on eczema risk where the phenotype was the allergenspecific ige levels this application is specially relevant since involving a continuous response the classical mdr approach could not be used furthermore the flexible model based_approach allowed adjustment for well known established risk_factors a significant epistatic effect of two variants in fcer a on eczema risk was detected
