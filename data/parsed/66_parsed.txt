gene_expression a change_point model for identifying utr switching by next_generation motivation next_generation offers an opportunity to investigate transcriptome in an unprecedented scale recent_studies have revealed widespread alternative_polyadenylation polya in eu karyotes leading to various mrna isoforms differing in their un translated regions utr through which the stability localization and translation of mrna can be regulated however very few if any methods and tools are available for directly analyzing this special alternative rna_processing event conventional methods rely on annotation of polya_sites yet such knowledge remains incomplete and identification of polya_sites is still challenging the goal of this article is to develop methods for detecting utr switching without any prior_knowledge of polya annotations results we propose a change_point model based on a likelihood_ratio for detecting utr switching we develop a directional testing procedure for identifying dramatic shortening or lengthening events in utr while controlling mixed directional false_discovery at a nominal level to our knowledge this is the first approach to analyze utr switching directly without relying on any polya annotations simulation_studies and applications to two real_datasets reveal that our proposed method is powerful accurate and feasible for the analysis of next_generation data conclusions the proposed method will fill a void among alternative rna_processing analysis tools for transcriptome_studies it can help to obtain additional insights from rna sequencing_data by understanding gene_regulation mechanisms through the analysis of utr switching availability_and the software is implemented_in and can be freely downloaded from http utr sourceforge net the past_two have witnessed dramatic changes brought on by high_throughput technology in both statistics and the biological_sciences hybridization based microarray_technology which emerged in the late s had been widely_applied by researchers for more than a decade and led to a myriad of seminal advances during the past_few next_generation ngs has matured as a more powerful and accurate tool it is replacing the once dominant microarray_technology in all areas of application because of its affordable cost and highly_accurate digital resolution for transcriptome study the introduction of rna_seq technology along with new analytic_methods makes it possible to address an increasing number of compelling biological_questions that may not be possible using microarray_technology in particular alternative rna_splicing and processing common phenomena in eukaryotes play so critical a role in gene function regulation that they receive much attention in rna_seq analysis and motivate quite a few methodological_developments for example mixture of isoforms miso uses a probabilistic mixture_model to quantify alternative_splicing and processing and it then tests the equality of transcript_isoform ratios between samples multivariate_analysis of transcript splicing mats by using a bayesian statistical_framework offers the flexibility to identify differential alternative_splicing and processing_events that match a given userdefined pattern dexseq uses generalized_linear to test for differential usage of exons and provides reliable control of false_discoveries by taking biological_variation into account other developments include despite the success of these methods detecting untranslated_regions utr switching remains_challenging very few if any methods and tools are available for directly analyzing this special alternative rna_processing event the pre_mrna end_processing plays_a in eukaryotic mrna maturation through cis_elements in the utr of mrnas post_transcriptional frequently occurs and determines the stability localization and translation of mrna these roles are mediated by interactions with rna_binding and micrornas mirnas over half of mammalian genes contain alternative cleavage and polyadenylation or polya_sites which lead to various mrna isoforms differing in their utrs alternative cleavage and polyadenylation apa in utr including shortening and lengthening events have recently been identified as global phenomena under different cell conditions and different species they have also to whom correspondence should be addressed drawn much attention in cancer studies in contrast with the increasingly_recognized importance of apa computational_methods and tools for the apa analysis using rna_seq are underdeveloped in unraveling apa regulation ji and colleagues scored relative expressions by taking the ratio of short_reads density in extended and common regions as defined by distal and proximal polya_sites respectively a higher score therefore indicated higher_abundance of long utr isoform a similar approach was taken in a recent tandem utr analysis where the statistical_significance was assessed by fishers_exact for the switch score under different conditions the same group further improved the approach and implemented a new computational_tool miso specifically tandem utr was treated as special alternative processing and thus the quantification of expression_level for each isoform can be estimated by computing percent spliced isoform these existing_methods however have one critical drawback namely they rely on prior_knowledge of annotated polya_sites for example miso constructs utr isoform based on polya_sites information collected from the polya site database it is noted that the polya_sites from the current database are computationally inferred from cdna complementary_dna est expressed_sequence sequences it is far from complete and may also contain false_positive therefore these approaches that depend on polya information may not be precise or powerful because of incomplete_information of all potential cleavage_sites on utr in this article we propose using a change_point model for identifying utr switching to our knowledge this is the first available method that allows investigators to directly analyze utr length changes without being dependent on polya site information to determine_whether a utr is shortening or lengthening to a certain extent we further develop an additional testing procedure to make directional decisions we show that this directional procedure can control the mixed directional fdr mdfdr at a pre specified nominal level simulation_studies in various settings and applications to two real ngs_datasets have demonstrated that our proposed change_point model and the testing framework are powerful and accurate the methods developed in this article have been implemented using java in a computationally_efficient and user_friendly software_package available from http utr sourceforge net this tool will allow investigators to analyze next_generation data in an effective and efficient way the rest of the article is organized as follows first we introduce a change_point model based on a likelihood_ratio followed by an iterative procedure for computing p values we then present a new directional testing procedure for identifying dramatic shortening or lengthening events while controlling mdfdr at a nominal level we perform simulation_studies to investigate numerical performance of the proposed method moreover we apply the proposed method to analyze two real rna sequencing_datasets for identifying genes with length changes in their utrs finally we conclude and discuss the results and methods
