systems_biology grn sbml automated encoding and annotation of inferred gene_regulatory complying with sbml grn sbml automatically encodes gene_regulatory derived from several inference tools in systems_biology providing a graphical_user the networks can be annotated via the simple object access protocol soap based application_programming of biomart central portal and minimum information required in the annotation of models registry additionally we provide an r package which processes the output of supported inference algorithms and automatically passes all required parameters to grn sbml therefore grn sbml closes a gap in the processing pipeline between the inference of gene_regulatory and their subsequent analysis visualization and storage understanding the complex interaction processes within biological_networks is one of the driving_forces in the research of systems_biology one of the important processes is the regulation of gene_expression which provides information about the function and behavior of the biological system under investigation to this end mathematical_models are frequently used to elucidate the complex nature of these processes to make these models accessible to other researchers to ensure interoperability and to permit their further development and reuse mathematical_models should be represented in a standardized format by now the de facto standard for the storage exchange and use of quantitative_models is the xml_based systems_biology sbml typically sbml is used to represent complex models at the biochemical_reaction level which describe the underlying biological_processes in a mechanistic in depth manner however in the field of dynamic gene_regulatory grn_inference the applied approaches often use phenomenological modeling import of text_files or by using the simple object access protocol soap based application_programming of biomart central portal and miriam registry relations between the genes in a network can also be annotated using pubmed identifiers this is particularly important for networks that were inferred using prior_knowledge because the annotation refers to the knowledges original source although the format to process networks is often similar across different algorithms we found that the interpretation of the inferred networks often differs regarding the currently supported algorithms species are used to denote for genes while rules or events are used to represent the mathematical framework in this way we can use reactions for the visualization allowing to display structural_features used i e by tilartype of algorithms see_supplementary for details however proper annotation that allows a correct interpretation of the network model still depends on algorithm specific parsers therefore grn sbml has a modular_architecture that supports the implementation of parsers for both new and currently unsupported algorithms without the need to change core_functions of the program a key achievement of this project is the development of grn sbml a tool that provides a framework for the automated encoding of grn models in sbml in compliance with the specifications of the standard this is a mandatory step toward interoperability exchangeability and proper storing of the inferred networks grn sbml automatically annotates the networks corresponding to the interpretation of the model and allows easy and up to date annotation of its components via diverse web resources we used the sbml layout extension to provide visualization of different levels of abstraction of the models this is especially helpful when working with large and complex_networks therefore grn sbml closes the gap in the processing pipeline between network_inference and a wide_range of subsequent network processing and visualization_tools in a typical network_inference approach gene_expression that was pre processed and analyzed i e by using r is used for automated network_inference to derive new testable biological hypothesis grn sbml offers the possibility to automatically encode the inferred models in sbml and therefore makes them accessible for diverse processing visualization and simulation tools the automated annotation with sbo terms and go terms allows easy interpretation of the models additional annotation of the enclosed species can be added by accessing the biomart central portal
