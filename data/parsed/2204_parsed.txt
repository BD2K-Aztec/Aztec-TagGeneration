databases_and hippdb a database of readily targeted helical protein_protein hippdb catalogs every proteinprotein_interaction whose structure is available in the protein_data and which exhibits one or more helices at the interface the web_site accepts queries on variables such as helix length and sequence and it provides computational alanine_scanning and change in solvent_accessible values for every interfacial residue hippdb is intended to serve as a starting_point for structure based small_molecule and peptidomi metic drug_development availability_and hippdb is freely_available on the web at http www nyu edu projects arora hippdb the web_site is implemented in php mysql and apache source_code freely_available for download atproteinprotein interactions ppis mediate fundamental signaling_pathways and cellular_processes although ppis are highly_promising pharmaceutical targets they are not preferred targets in conventional drug_development because of their extended flat interfaces in particular compound libraries for high_throughput that offer attractive lead_compounds for enzymatic targets lack the topological and functional complexity necessary for ppi inhibition one successful method to inhibit ppis is the mimicry of secondary_structure motifs that contribute to complex formation often a subset of the residues at a proteinprotein interface can contribute significantly to the binding interaction because solubility and specificity are eternal problems in drug_design it is advantageous to identify and prioritize most important residues leaving less important positions free for fine_tuning conventional computational_methods to predict important residues include alanine_scanning and solvent_accessible sasa analysis alanine_scanning provides the change in g resulting from a contact residue being mutated to alanine while a sasa value describes how much of the residue is buried from solvent on binding we have previously_developed a scoring strategy to rank protein interfaces by their promise for synthetic inhibition and designed inhibitors of formerly undruggable ppis to follow_up this work we sought to derive a readily_accessible resource for the chemical_biology community research groups with potent small_molecule scaffolds might be interested in small interfaces with hotspot residues in two consecutive positions or in the i and i positions whereas those developing peptoid or beta peptide foldamers might be more interested in long interfaces with high total g hippdba database of helical interfaces in ppislists all the helical ppis in the protein_data pdb and catalogs computational alanine_scanning results g in rosetta energy units and sasa for each interfacial residue we expect this dataset will be a useful resource for ppi inhibition depicts a typical workflow in hippdb the user might first search for interface helices found in humans by constraining the organism name next the user might trim the results for complexes with exactly three hotspot residues then for helices residues long then for a g average by clicking on the pdb codes that result the user can view any of the five complexes fitting these criteria in jmol with their hotspot residues displayed in wireframe from multiprotein entries in the pdb files of two protein_chains were produced and subjected to alanine_scanning of these interfaces we found helices of four residues or longer with the two hotspots necessary to qualify for the database a qualifying alpha_helix is on average residues long and contains hotspots the end_to distance separating these hotspots is residues on average the three best hotspot residues sum to a g of in rosetta energy units and the helix overall contributes of the chains total g and of its sasa the rational_design of ppi inhibitors involves a systematic analysis of native interactions by cataloging the results of this analysis for every known structure and by describing secondorder metrics to help prioritize design efforts this database will eliminate often reduplicated effort and greatly accelerate the design process in this way hippdb complements existing resources such as pocketquery and hotsprint the former of which catalogues regions of high solvent burial and the latter of which highlights evolutionary_conservation to evaluate the role functional or structural of individual hotspots a typical hippdb query the five resulting complexes are depicted with the qualifying chain in green and the partner chain in orange ycr is the native p mdm complex fdo and jzo are complexes of p like synthetic_peptides with mdm and g and jzr are complexes of synthetic_peptides with mdm
