genome_analysis gsds an upgraded gene feature visualization server visualizing genes structure and annotated features helps biologists to investigate their function and evolution intuitively the gene structure display server gsds has been widely used by more than users since its first publication in here we reported the upgraded gsds with a newly_designed interface supports for more types of annotation_features and formats as well as an integrated visual editor for editing the generated figure moreover a user specified phylogenetic_tree can be added to facilitate further evolutionary_analysis the full source_code is also available for downloading availability_and web_server and source_code are freely_available gsds the visualization of gene features such as composition and position of exons and introns for genes offers visual presentation for biologists to integrate annotation and also helps them to produce highquality figures for publication thus several web_servers software including fancygene geca featurestack gsdraw gpviz and genepainter have been developed recently designing to generate high_quality figures suitable for publication we developed an online gene structure display server gsds which supported three input_formats including sequences accession_number of genbank and exon positions with more than million hits annually gsds has been widely used by world_wide scientists in the functional and evolutionary study of gene_families according to the feedbacks from gsds users we developed the upgraded gsds compared with the previous version gsds supports two more widely used annotation formats providing more comprehensive support for annotation files to aid biologists generating suitable figures for publication gsds offers a powerful interactive interface users can customize the size shape and color of annotation_features after their initial render and even fine_tune each element through an integrated visual editor to facilitate evolutionary_analysis a user specified phylogenetic_tree can be added to thefinally the generated figure can be exported as either vector graphic in svg and pdf format or raster graphic in png format
