genome_analysis svgenes a library for rendering genomic_features in scalable vector graphic format motivation drawing genomic_features in attractive and informative ways is a key task in visualization of genomics data scalable_vector svg format is a modern and flexible open standard that provides advanced features including modular graphic design advanced web interactivity and animation within a suitable client svgs do not suffer from loss of image_quality on re scaling and provide the ability to edit individual_elements of a graphic on the whole object level independent of the whole image these features make svg a potentially useful format for the preparation of publication quality figures including genomic objects such as genes or sequencing_coverage and for web_applications that require rich user_interaction with the graphical elements results svgenes is a ruby language library that uses svg primi tives to render typical genomic glyphs through a simple and flexible ruby interface the library implements a simple page object that spaces and contains horizontal track objects that in turn style colour and positions features within them tracks are the level at which visual_information is supplied providing the full styling capability of the svg standard genomic entities like genes transcripts and histograms are modelled in glyph objects that are attached to a track and take advantage of svg primitives to render the gen_omic features in a track as any of a selection of defined glyphs the feature model within svgenes is simple but flexible and not dependent on particular existing gene feature formats meaning graphics for any existing datasets can easily be created without need for conversion visualization analysis and communication of genome data is an important task in genomics numerous desktop computer programs exist for rendering images of genomic_data usually in analytic pipelines including artemis genome_browsers such as gbrowse jbrowse savant and igv thorvaldsdottir provide interactive_visualization of the data for whole genomes and draft assemblies output from these is typically limited to an exported bitmap or screen grab in the programs particular fixed style graphics libraries such as gd and imagemagick have been used in projects like bioperl and bioruby to create uniquely styled bitmap images like png and jpeg programmatically biorubys bio graphics package has similar functionality to bio svgenes and relies on external libraries such as cairo pango and imagemagick the bio graphics module in biopython also supports output in svg through the use of third_party software reportlab http www reportlab com bitmap images are limited in that they are not easy to re annotate re scale and often cannot be reproduced for publication or presentation with high_fidelity because of limitations of the original bitmaps bitmaps can be difficult to manipulate and are not easily amenable to the addition of interactive features interactive graphics can be provided in web_browsers through javascript libraries such as d js but there are no such libraries available specifically for easy rendering of genomic_data scalable_vector svg is an xml_based graphic standard under development by the world_wide consortium that provides many advantages for those seeking to produce rich attractive images svg is a vector format so does not suffer image_quality degradation on rescaling has advanced image_features such as alpha masks and filter effects web interactivity and can be styled with cascading style sheets furthermore as a textbased format svg is well suited for searching and indexing in databases and is amenable to lossless_compression svg can be rendered by modern web_browsers and graphics software including adobes illustrator and the open_source inkscape programs svg output is available from some applications cgview and circos are good tools for viewing circular genomes in particular genomediagram is designed to display large_amounts of comparative_genomics data mgv is a database driven web_application designed specifically for microbial data and annotationsketch which is dependant on third_party software svgenes is a pure ruby language library that allows a user to set styles for tracks of genomic_features and will automatically layout and generate svg images composed of several pre defined genomics glyphs including genes transcripts data and single nucleotide features to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work svgenes is a useful and flexible library for creating easily manipulated high_quality web friendly images of genomic_data quickly and easily in svg format without embedding a bitmap the library can be used for visualization at many levels in highthroughput pipelines and web_applications but individual users preparing figures for publication will also find the library extremely useful as the individual_elements of the images can be independently manipulated and annotated and composited
