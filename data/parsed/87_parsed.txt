a comprehensive computational_model of facilitated diffusion in prokaryotes motivation gene activity is mediated by site_specific transcription_factors tfs their binding to defined regions in the genome determines the rate at which their target_genes are transcribed results we present a comprehensive computational_model of the search_process of tf for their genomic target_site s the computational_model considers the dna_sequence various tf species and the interaction of the individual_molecules with the dna or between themselves we also demonstrate a systematic approach how to parametrize the system using available experimental_data contact originally it was believed that transcription_factors tfs find their target_sites only through d diffusion and the association rate would follow the smoluchowski limit were the first to observe that the rate at which the lac_repressor locates its target_site is much faster than the rate predicted by the smoluchowski limit and hypothesized that a different mechanism was involved in this process in their seminal work von thoroughly investigated this process from both a theoretical and experimental perspective and concluded that tf molecules use the facilitated diffusion_mechanism to locate their target_sites this facilitated diffusion_mechanism assumes a combination between d diffusion in the cytoplasm and an d random_walk on the dna this leads to reduction of dimensionality in the search_process and consequently speeds up the search in addition three main types of movements on the dna were proposed i sliding ii hopping and iii jumping sliding and hopping are both mechanisms of d random_walk but the difference between them is that during hopping the molecules lose contact with the dna whereas during sliding the molecules keep contact with the dna on the other hand jumping is a mechanism which assumes that the molecules do not only lose contact with the dna for a short time interval as in the case of hopping but they completely release into the cytoplasm where they spend a longer to whom correspondence should be addressed time until they bind to the dna uncorrelated with respect to the unbinding position the existence of the d random_walk in vivo was recently confirmed by the authors of that study used fluorescent lac_repressor tetrameters and visualize their movement in a live escherichia_coli cell confirming that the molecules spend of the time bound to the dna there are still missing pieces in our understanding of the facilitated diffusion_mechanism one approach to address these questions consists of building a computational_tool able to simulate the relevant molecules in a cell and the entire dna_sequence this type of approach can address several questions e g how crowding can influence the search_process at genome_wide level in a dynamical context and not as static barriers in addition one could investigate systems with real affinity landscapes which is not possible through analytical_tools in this article we present a computational_model for stochastic_simulation of the search_process of tfs for their target_sites on the dna the model considers each tf molecule as an independent object which can move freely in the bacterial cytoplasm but which also can bind to the dna and perform an d random_walk the dna_molecule is modelled as a string of nucleotides which leads to specific affinity between a tf molecule and dna at the position where the molecule is bound we also go through the literature and systematically infer each microscopic parameter of the model from experimentally macroscopic measurements finally we developed an implementation of the proposed model which is available in zabet and adryan previously facilitated diffusion was modelled mainly analytically e g although these types of models brought new insights into the mechanism they mainly lack the capability to integrate real dna_sequence a nonuiniform tf affinity landscape and or dynamic crowding mobile roadblocks nevertheless computational_models are able to surpass these shortcomings stochastic_simulations have revolutionized the way theoretical biologists can nowadays deal with problems that are not easily amenable to experimental_measurements tf target finding belongs to a class of spatio_temporal problems that in a first approximation may be addressed with tools that simulate d diffusion e g smoldyn
