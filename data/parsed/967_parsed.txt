systems_biology chromaligner a web_server for chromatogram alignment chromaligner is a tool for chromatogram alignment to align retention time for chromatographic_methods coupled to spectrophotometers such as high_performance and capillary_electrophoresis for metabolomics works chromaligner resolves peak shifts by a constrained chromatogram alignment for a collection of chromatograms and a set of defined peaks chromaligner aligns the chromatograms on defined peaks using correlation warping cow chromaligner is faster than the original cow algorithm by k times where k is the number of defined peaks in a chromatogram it also provides alignments based on known component peaks to reach the best results for further chemometric analysis availability chromaligner is freely_accessible at http cmdd csie
