systems_biology deciphering kinase_substrate relationships by analysis of domain specific phosphorylation network motivation in silico prediction of site_specific kinasesubstrate relationships ssksrs is crucial for deciphering phosphorylation_networks by linking kinomes to phosphoproteomes however currently available predictors for ssksrs give rise to a large number of false_positive because they use only a short sequence stretch around phosphosite as determinants of kinase specificity and do not consider the biological_context of kinasesubstrate recognition results based on the analysis of domain specific kinasesubstrate relationships we have constructed a domain level phosphorylation network that implicitly incorporates various contextual_factors it reveals preferential phosphorylation of specific domains by certain kinases these novel correlations have been implemented in phosnetconstruct an automated program for predicting target kinases for a substrate protein phosnetconstruct distinguishes cognate kinasesubstrate pairs from a large number of non cognate combinations benchmarking on independent datasets using various statistical_measures demonstrates the superior_performance of phosnetconstruct over ssksr based predictors phosphorylation of a variety of proteins by ser_thr or tyr kinases is one of the major post_translational which regulates signal_transduction in different metabolic and diseaserelated processes within a cell therefore a detailed understanding of protein phosphorylation_networks is crucial for decoding the molecular basis of various cellular_processes however an exponential_increase in kinome information and identification of variety of phosphoproteins across different organisms has made complete experimental_characterization of phosphorylation_networks enormously difficult even though several sequence as well as structure based_methods are available for prediction of site_specific kinasesubstrate relationships ssksrs they are ideally designed for identification of phosphosites in a given substrate protein of a kinase hence straightforward application of these methods to decipher phosphorylation_networks by prediction of kinases that can potentially phosphorylate a given substrate protein can lead to the accumulation of false_positive this is because every protein irrespective of whether it is actually phosphorylated is treated as a putative substrate it is well known that approximately only one third of the entire proteome is phosphorylated and phosphorylation_events are part of dynamic and directional protein_interaction the context dependent factors that are likely to govern the kinasesubstrate recognition process are cellular_localization coregulation of interacting pairs of proteins and also the presence of other docking interacting domains in the same polypeptide or coevolution of kinasesubstrate pairs as interacting domains however these contextual_factors remain outside the purview of the sequence_motif based_methods for prediction of ssksrs owing to the consideration of small stretches of amino_acids on substrates as determinants of kinase specificity therefore recently_developed approaches like networkin and igps have combined motif profilebased predictions with information about the functional association between kinases and substrates derived from string or other databases containing experimental proteinprotein_interaction ppi_information these studies have demonstrated that inclusion of interaction context leads to improved_prediction of ssksrs however direct information about functional association or ppis are only available for a limited number of kinasesubstrate pairs and hence it is necessary to explore alternate approaches for prediction of phosphorylation_networks by inclusion of context dependent interaction probability for a kinasesubstrate pair several contextual_factors are likely to better correlate with sequence signatures at the globular_domain level rather than signatures in short_sequence domain level sequence signatures in polypeptide_chains are assigned using pfam or interpro type functional_domain definitions these are derived from the hmm profiles_obtained from multiple_sequence of related proteins in fact earlier_studies byhave demonstrated that correlated interpro domain level sequence signatures could be used as markers of ppis liu and tozeren have also attempted to predict substrates of kinases based on co occurrence of pairs of interacting domains therefore in this study we have constructed a domain level kinasesubstrate network based on pfam finn to whom correspondence should be addressed domain analysis of the experimentally_identified mammalian kinasesubstrate pairs available in phosphositeplus and recently_published activity based human phosphorylation network systematic analysis of this kinasephosphodomain network has revealed novel patterns of preferential phosphorylation of certain pfam domains by specific kinases we also demonstrate that these preferential domain specific kinase_substrate relationships dsksrs can be used to distinguish cognate kinasesubstrate pairs from all other non cognate combinations extensive benchmarking on a completely_independent test_set indicates that by using dsksrs it is possible to predict putative target kinases that are likely to phosphorylate given substrate proteins shows various steps involved in the compilation of phosphorylation data and construction of an experimentally_identified domain phosphorylation network to have a significant number of phosphorylation_events for each kinasesubstrate pair in the dataset kinasesubstrate pairs were selected from phosphositeplus with the criterion that each of the protein_kinases had at least substrate proteins this resulted in substrate proteins phosphorylated by different protein_kinases the domain compositions for each of these substrate proteins and their target protein_kinases were deciphered using pfam functional_domain definitions phosphorylation_sites on each of the substrate proteins were mapped onto the corresponding pfam functional_domains resulting in unique phosphodomains supplementary data s and s further details are given in supplementary methods domain phosphorylation profiles were represented by a binary matrix of dimension where each element consisted of or depending on whether a selected domain is phosphorylated by a given kinase the phosphorylation patterns of interdomain linker stretches were also represented by a similar matrix of dimensions the distance between a pair of kinases in terms of their domain phosphorylation profiles was computed using the jaccard coefficient between domain phosphorylation vectors followed by hierarchical_clustering and the result was represented as a heat map using the pheatmap module of r package www r project org in this work we have used experimentally_identified kinase_substrate pairs and their pfam domain_composition to analyze dsksrs and constructed a domain based kinasesubstrate interaction_network experimentally_identified phosphosites on substrate proteins have been mapped onto pfam domains or interdomain linker regions interestingly degree_distribution of kinases as well as domains of this network shows a power_law type behavior and our analysis reveals presence of a small number of highly_connected hub kinases and hub domains this suggests that only a few kinases can phosphorylate a large number of pfam domains while most kinases phosphorylate only a few pfam domains and vice_versa the differential specificities of various kinases for different pfam domains have been quantified in the form of er of kinasedomain pairs our analysis of dsksrs indicates that different pfam domains are preferentially phosphorylated by a limited number of specific kinases only similarly we have also computed er values for kinase auxiliary domain pairs which represent preference of a kinase to phosphorylate a substrate protein because of enriched occurrences of the given auxiliary domain even if the auxiliary domain is not phosphorylated by the kinase short sequence_motif based_approaches for deciphering ssksrs have their origin in the use of peptide library data which obviously lacks contextual_information hence prediction of phosphorylation_networks based on ssksrs results in a large number of false_positive ksrs on the other hand dsksrs derived in this work implicitly incorporate various context dependent features second pfam domains are essentially longer signature motifs and thus they become more specific this helps in eliminating false_positive kinasesubstrate pairs that arise in ssksr based_predictions therefore we have incorporated these dsksrs into a web_based automated computational_tool phosnetconstruct for genome_wide identification of protein phosphorylation_networks using these er values phosnetconstruct distinguishes cognate kinasedomain pairs from a large number of non cognate combinations benchmarking on completely_independent test datasets indicates that performance of phosnetconstruct is superior to ssksr based predictors like gps and netphosk however igps that incorporates ppi_information is the only approach that attains a comparable trade_off between sensitivity_and thus our benchmarking results also suggest that dsksr derived by us has implicitly incorporated context dependent information which methods like igps and networkin incorporate by including direct ppis therefore our work demonstrates that even in cases where information about ppi is not available phosnetconstruct can generate a potential list of cognate kinasesubstrate pairs by filtering out a large number of non cognate combinations and subsequently exact phosphosites can be identified using ssksr predictors like gps and netphosk
