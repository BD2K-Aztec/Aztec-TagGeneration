sbwt memory_efficient implementation of the hardware acceleration friendly schindler transform for the fast biological sequence mapping motivation the full text index in minute space fm_index derived from the burrowswheeler_transform bwt is broadly used for fast string matching in large_genomes or a huge set of sequencing_reads several graphic processing unit gpu accelerated aligners based on the fm_index have been proposed recently however the construction of the index is still handled by central_processing cpu only parallelized in data level e g by performing block wise suffix sorting in gpu or not scalable for large_genomes results to fulfill the need for a more practical hardware parallelizable indexing and matching approach we herein propose sbwt based on a bwt variant i e schindler transform that can be built with highly simplified hardware acceleration friendly algorithms and still suffices accurate and fast string matching in repetitive references in our tests the implementation achieves significant speedups in indexing and searching compared with other bwt based tools and can be applied to a variety of domains availability_and sbwt is implemented in c with cpu only and gpu accelerated versions sbwt is open_source and is available atindex structures such as the full text index in minute space fm_index derived from the burrowswheeler_transform bwt and enhanced_suffix have been widely used in ngs applications for mapping short_reads to the references recently the biological_applications of the fm_index are expanding the fm_index has been used to compress ngs_data and de_novo these applications require dynamic construction of the indexes based on reads for instance in the construction of the overlap_graph for doing de_novo as demonstrated by simpson and durbin the suboptimal performance of
