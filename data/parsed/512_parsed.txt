structural_bioinformatics assemble an interactive graphical tool to analyze and build rna architectures at the d and d levels assemble is an intuitive graphical_interface to analyze manipulate and build complex d rna architectures it provides several advanced and unique features within the framework of a semi_automated modeling process that can be performed by homology and ab_initio with or without electron_density those include the interactive editing of a secondary_structure and a searchable embedded library of annotated tertiary_structures assemble helps users with performing recurrent and otherwise tedious tasks in structural rna research availability_and assemble is released under an open_source mit_license and is freely_available bioinformatics org assemble it is implemented in the java language and runs on macosx linux and windows operating_systems rna_molecules are able to adopt intricate d folds the number of rna_tertiary has increased_dramatically together with genomic sequence_data these structural data have sharpened our understanding of rna_structure and folding by exploiting this body of knowledge d architectures of rna_molecules can be produced using various molecular_modeling strategies such theoretical approaches have proven to be valuable in the past for understanding folding and function we describe here a new graphical tool assemble which combines automated and manual protocols within an iterative modeling process the modeling can be performed either ab_initio or by homology on the basis of sequence_alignment chemical probing_data and electron_density derived by crystallography or cryo_electron
