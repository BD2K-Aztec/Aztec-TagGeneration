infernal fold faster rna homology_searches infernal builds probabilistic profiles of the sequence and secondary_structure of an rna family called covariance models cms from structurally annotated multiple_sequence given as input infernal uses cms to search for new family_members in sequence_databases and to create potentially large multiple_sequence version of infernal introduces a new filter pipeline for rna homology_search based on accelerated profile hidden_markov hmm methods and hmm banded cm alignment_methods this enables fold acceleration over the previous version and fold acceleration over exhaustive non filtered cm searches availability source_code documentation and the benchmark are downloadable from http infernal janelia org infernal is freely licensed under the gnu gplv and should be portable to any posix compliant operating system including linux and mac os x documentation includes a users guide with a tutorial a discussion of file_formats and user options and additional details on methods implemented in the software contact many structural rnas conserve their sequence and secondary_structure and the most effective rna homology_search and alignment tools incorporate both types of conservation into their scoring_systems covariance models cms are profile stochastic_context probabilistic_models of the conserved_sequence and secondary_structure of an rna family analogous to sequence_based profile_hidden hmms commonly used for protein sequence_analysis with added complexity necessary for modeling rna_secondary infernal implements methods for constructing cms from input structurally annotated rna alignments or single sequences and for using those models to search for and align homologous rnas compared with the previous version infernal accelerates typical rna homology_searches fold using a filter pipeline based on accelerated profile hmm methods the hmmer project and constrained cm alignment_algorithms the increased speed comes at a negligible cost to sensitivity additionally version implements specialized algorithms for structural_alignment of truncated rna_sequences commonly found in sequencing_reads which were prone to misalignment in previous versions
