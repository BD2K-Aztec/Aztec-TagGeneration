systems_biology bionetcad design simulation and experimental_validation of synthetic biochemical_networks motivation synthetic_biology studies how to design and construct biological_systems with functions that do not exist in nature biochemical_networks although easier to control have been used less frequently than genetic_networks as a base to build a synthetic system to date no clear engineering principles exist to design such cell_free biochemical_networks results we describe a methodology for the construction of synthetic biochemical_networks based on three main steps design simulation and experimental_validation we developed bionetcad to help users to go through these steps bionetcad allows designing abstract networks that can be implemented thanks to compubioticdb a database of parts for synthetic_biology bionetcad enables also simulations with the hsim software and the classical ordinary_differential ode we demonstrate with a case study that bionetcad can rationalize and reduce further experimental_validation during the construction of a biochemical_network availability_and bionetcad is freely_available www sysdiag cnrs fr bionetcad it is implemented_in and supported on ms windows compubioticdb is freely_accessible atsynthetic biology focuses on designing biological_systems that are characterized by non natural functions and wide_ranging domains of application from bio compatible devices biofuels drugs production creation of smart therapeutic systems to genetically_modified organisms for environmental purposes to this aim engineering principles i e a rigorous methodology that includes several key_steps such as specifications design modeling to whom correspondence should be addressed fabrication and quality_control are commonly used a pioneer example is the biobricks project which focuses on the design and construction of genetic_circuits and on their expression in host_cells to produce a useful behavior or compound to help in this long_term goal the registry of standard biological_parts was initiated by the massachusetts institute of technology http partsregistry org main page in order to conceptualize standardize organize in a hierarchy and register compatible dna parts another exciting approach is the use of biological_parts such as enzymes and metabolites as signals and compounds to reproduce logic operations like those performed by electronic circuits given the complex nature of the biological_material most of the engineering principles have not been exploited as yet for the construction of artificial biological_systems moreover all the current achievements are hand made approaches that are difficult to generalize the clear necessity to develop concepts methods and technologies to support synthetic_biology projects has been emphasized repeatedly and particularly the lack of computer_aided design cad tools that could facilitate the conceptualization design and simulation of such synthetic systems ideally cad tools should be linked to registries of standardized modular and re usable biological_parts since well defined independent parts will ease the efficient development of synthetic biological_systems several computational_tools that specifically support the design of artificial gene_circuits are currently available for instance biojade is a graphical design tool to engineer genetic_systems by graphical_representation of abstract components like promoters ribosome binding_sites coding_sequences etc genocad is a genetic design web_tool based on context free grammar and a library of genetic_parts which allows the design of an easily downloadable dna_sequence tinkercell http www tinkercell com is a synthetic_biology cad tool for visually constructing and analyzing biological_networks it allows the design and the simulation of biological_networks from a hierarchy of parts and modules that can be defined by the user most of the currently available cad applications for synthetic_biology aim to develop genetic_networks to be implemented in modified microorganisms however the use of host_cells produces noise and not controllable behaviors leading to poorly robustpage
