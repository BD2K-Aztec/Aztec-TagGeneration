sequence_analysis bseqc quality_control of bisulfite sequencing_experiments motivation bisulfite_sequencing bs_seq has emerged as the gold_standard to study genome_wide at single_nucleotide quality_control qc is a critical step in the analysis_pipeline to ensure that bs_seq data are of high_quality and suitable for subsequent analysis although several qc tools are available for next_generation data most of them were not designed to handle qc issues specific to bs_seq protocols therefore there is a strong need for a dedicated qc tool to evaluate and remove potential technical biases in bs_seq experiments results we developed a package named bseqc to comprehensively evaluate the quality of bs_seq experiments and automatically trim nucleotides with potential technical biases that may result in inaccurate methylation estimation bseqc takes standard sam bam_files as input and generates bias free sam bam_files for downstream_analysis evaluation based on real bs_seq data indicates that the use of the bias free sam bam_file substantially improves the quantification of methylation_level availability_and bseqc is freely_available at http code google comdna methylation an epigenetic_modification affecting the organization and function of the genome plays an important role in several key_biological including transcriptional_regulation x_chromosome genomic_imprinting silencing of repetitive_elements and chromatin_structure bisulfite_conversion followed by next_generation bs_seq has emerged as a powerful technique for detecting genome_wide at single_nucleotide ideally bs_seq experiment should be able to directly and exactly quantify the methylation_level of every cytosine in the genome however current bs_seq protocols possess several intrinsic technical biases which may impact methylation_level estimation these biases include overhang end repair bisulfite_conversion failure sequencing into the adaptor and low sequencing quality although the last two biases are also present in other next_generation data the first two biases i e end repair and bisulfite_conversion failure are highly_specific to bs_seq protocols bs_seq reads with the first two biases can be perfectly mapped to the reference_genome however they will result in biased methylation estimation first after sonication the overhangs of dna_fragments are normally end repaired with unmethylated_cytosines to restore the double_stranded illumina wgbs for methylation analysis guide this may introduce artificially low methylation rates at both ends of the dna_fragments second bisulfite_conversion failure is known to be enriched at the end of reads most likely caused by the re annealing of sequences adjacent to the methylated adapters in bisulfite_conversion this may bring in artificially high methylation rates at the end of reads most quality_control qc tools such as htseqtools and fastqc only focus on the general sequence quality and adaptor trimming or other next_generation applications such as rna_seq to the best of our knowledge bsmooth and bis snp are the only two tools that support qc specific to bs_seq however their qc functions are highly limited the qc model in bsmooth was designed to work with its own alignment and analysis_pipeline and thus cannot take standard bam sam_files as input furthermore bsmooth can detect but not correct the biases bis snp only supports the correction of bisulfite_conversion failure because bs_seq experiments are widely used and the resulting data will continue to grow_exponentially in the near future there is a strong need for a dedicated qc tool to assess and improve the quality of bs_seq experiments bseqc the tool we developed is focused on the technical biases specific to bs_seq experiments bseqc can automatically evaluate and remove the biases based on a user_defined statistical cutoff evaluation based on real bs_seq data indicates that after bias removal the quantification of methylation_level is significantly_improved we demonstrated the capabilities of bseqc using two publicly_available datasets i paired_end wgbs from mouse es derived neuronal progenitor_cells mnpc and ii single_end wgbs from h human es_cells after reads mapping using bsmap we observed the end repair bias in the of ae strand supplementary and the bisulfite_conversion failure in the strand in the m bias plots of paired_end mnpc data this observation indicates that different dna_strands may exhibit different technical biases in bs_seq experiments supplementary note s as expected the bisulfite_conversion failure is more obvious in non cpg cytosine m bias plots supplementary in the single_end h data we used bsmap to remove adaptor and low quality nucleotides during mapping however there are still biases in the of strands of both replicates probably indicating residual adapters and low quality nucleotides that cannot be fully removed by conventional qc approaches supplementary in addition we observed different biases in different read_length in h data supplementary because there is no ground_truth for methylation estimation we decided to use the concordance between two replicates to evaluate the performance of bseqc bias trimming as expected the agreement of methylation_level distributions between two read mates derived from the same paired_end mnpc data is significantly_increased after bseqc trimming especially in high methylation_levels the kullbackleibler distance a measurement of difference between two probability_distributions decreases from to after bseqc trimming similar improvement can also be observed in single_end h data supplementary rrbs data supplementary and mouse npc data supplementary together we conclude that the usage of bseqc can significantly improve the methylation estimation
