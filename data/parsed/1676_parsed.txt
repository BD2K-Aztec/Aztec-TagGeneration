excess positional_mutual predicts both local and allosteric mutations affecting beta_lactamase drug_resistance motivation bacterial_resistance to antibiotics particularly plasmid_encoded resistance to beta lac tam drugs poses an increasing threat_to point_mutations to beta_lactamase enzymes can greatly alter the level of resistance conferred but predicting the effects of such mutations has been challenging due to the large combinatorial space involved and the subtle relationships of distant residues to catalytic_function therefore we desire an information_theoretic metric to sensitively and robustly detect both local and distant residues that affect substrate con formation and catalytic_activity results here we report the use of positional_mutual in multiple microsecond length molecular_dynamics md_simulations to predict residues linked to catalytic_activity of the ctx m beta_lactamase we find that motions of the bound drug are relatively isolated from motions of the protein as a whole which we interpret in the context of prior theories of catalysis in order to robustly identify residues that are weakly_coupled to drug motions but nonetheless affect catalysis we utilize an excess mutual_information metric we predict such residues for the cephalosporin antibiotic cefotaxime nine of these have previously been tested_experimentally and all decrease both enzyme rate_constants and empirical drug_resistance we prospectively validate our method by testing eight high_scoring mutations and eight low scoring controls in bacteria six of eight predicted mutations decrease cefotaxime resistance greater than fold while only one control shows such an effect the ability to prospectively predict new variants affecting bacterial drug_resistance is of great interest to clinical and epidemiological_surveillance beta_lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that confer resistance to a broad range of clinically used antibiotics that share a common chemical core_structure use of these drugs has led to the emergence of beta_lactamases with a broad_spectrum of activity that render many classes of antibiotics ineffective in the past this has spurred the development of new beta_lactam but that pipeline has slowed in recent decades creating a clinical problem of highly resistant infections understanding the determinants of activity and specificity in beta_lactamases is key to both monitoring the emergence of further resistance and the targeted design of new antibacterial_agents here we focus on the ctx m family a group of extended_spectrum that have spread globally in recent_years and utilize a catalytic_mechanism roughly analogous to serine_proteases ctx m enzymes are currently the most prevalent extended_spectrum in both hospital associated and community_acquired and are thus of substantial clinical_concern cant on and even when the resulting infections are treatable presence of a ctx m enzyme greatly_increases the morbidity resulting from bacterial_infection cant on and although the key catalytic_residues in ctx m enzymes are well known we wish to understand the basis for modulation of activity and ligand specificity in these enzymes even though comprehensive mutagenesis of ctx m has not yet been experimentally feasible reports of individual mutations show that single_point can alter drug spectrum and catalytic_activity such point mutants have been identified in clinical_isolates of bacteria as well as laboratory mutagenesis experiments a comprehensive experimental understanding of how mutations affect beta_lactamase drug_resistance has been hindered by the combinatorial magnitude of the problem even for point_mutations on ctx m enzymes alone rigorous quantitation of how mutants affect activity against a large panel of drugs is extremely resourceintensive entailing the screening of mutants residues amino_acid changes against multiple antibiotics therefore we wish to identify residues that may contribute to activity and specificity but are not absolutely_essential to function prediction of such residues can guide a more targeted set of mutagenesis experiments in designing such an approach we wish to consider all residues in the protein not simply those in direct contact with the drug or previously_identified via serendipitous mutations we have chosen to predict residues modulating antibiotic_resistance in ctx m enzymes based on analysis of molecular_dynamics md_simulations we hypothesize that the conformational_dynamics of the enzyme and its substrate will yield insight into catalytic_activity even though we do not consider catalysis explicitly in classical md_simulations unlike reactive methods classical md_simulations have been previously used to predict or explain mutations in a number of enzyme_systems to predict individual_residues to mutate we seek to identify the influence of individual atoms on catalytic_activity rather than overall conformational_substates of the enzyme md_simulations provide a means to quantify this influence by measuring positional relatedness between protein atoms and a bound drug based on the hypothesis that the conformation and orientation of the drug and its environment are related to catalytic_activity we sample conformations from md_simulations which estimate a boltzmann weighted ensemble positional_mutual provides a robust non linear metric to quantify relatedness of positional displacement in md_simulations normalized covariance_matrices have also been used for such measurements but such approaches are restricted by a linear correlation approximation which is less desirable for detecting subtle yet important motions mutual_information quantifies how much knowledge of the probability_distribution of positional displacement for one atom i affects the distribution for another atom j and thus provides a much more general means of detecting relatedness although positional_mutual has been used to analyze large_scale movements in a manner analogous to principal_components here we desire a more focused approach to predict residues important to catalytic_activity we score by mutual_information to drug conformation this is corrected for bulk protein movement yielding excess mutual_information ii drug ii protein background where i i j denotes the mutual_information between residues i and j such a metric encapsulates the precise question how related is movement of atom i to the drug conformation this metric is designed to identify functionally_important that meet this criterion it is of course not designed to detect residues that might not be motionally correlated with the drug but still important to catalysis simulations and analysis were performed on the ctx m beta_lactamase in complex with one of two antibiotics cefotaxime and meropenem ctx m enzymes hydrolyze antibiotics by way of an acyl_enzyme where the antibiotic is covalently_bound to the enzyme ctx m is able to efficiently hydrolyze cefotaxime whereas it only forms the acyl intermediate for meropenem without completing hydrolysis the conformational_dynamics of this intermediate may thus yield insight into the residues important for hydrolytic specificity in these enzymes the positional_mutual matrices for both ctx m meropenem and ctx m cefotaxime complexes yield important insight regarding the organization of these enzymes we then score residues that may affect catalytic_activity of ctx m using excess mutual_information these predictions yield a set of residues that have previously been identified as affecting catalytic_activity and a set of novel previously untested predictions to validate our predictions we tested the top scoring residues for ctxm meropenem and ctx m cefotaxime via alanine mutagenesis a common means to assess the effect of ablating a residue side chain six of these eight mutants had a fold decrease in cefotaxime resistance while only one of the four lowest scoring residues for ctx structures of ctx m drug complexes the overlaid structures of ctxm acylated to meropenem brown online and cefotaxime violet online are rendered in panel a with a close up of the drug binding_pocket in panel b protein is rendered in cartoon form and drug in sticks these structures were used for md_simulations that served as the basis for positional_mutual calculations m meropenem and ctx m cefotaxime similarly decreased resistance we used positional_mutual to analyze the conformational_dynamics of ctx m with a bound antibiotic either cefotaxime or meropenem based on md_simulations multiple microsecond length simulations were used to obtain good statistical sampling of positional motions of the enzyme drug complex mutual_information provides a non linear analogue to measure correlated motions this approach identifies pairs and networks of atoms that are dynamically related and thus statistically interact either directly_or when applied to the active_site of an enzyme it thus enables a unified analysis of short range and longrange interactions that may influence catalysis and in this case drug_resistance furthermore by measuring the excess mutual_information of protein atoms to the drug compared to the rest of the protein we identified residues that may influence the dynamics of the bound beta_lactam ring and potentially subsequent drug hydrolysis we have developed an excess mutual_information metric to predict residues important for drug hydrolysis in the ctx m beta_lactamase enzyme based on md_simulations we initially_developed excess positional_mutual to score protein residues on the influenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein that influence low_affinity binding of sialoglycans here we show howwere located outside the drug binding_pocket as plotted in panel c none of near background mutants yellow and one of the lowest scoring mutants orange showed a fold decrease in drug_resistance excess mutual_information can be used in a much more sensitive and targeted fashion detecting motions of an enzyme that are weakly but significantly coupled to dynamics of a bound substrate and prospectively predicting and testing mutants that affect enzyme_function this marks a substantial expansion on the scope of problems for which excess mutual_information can predict mutational_effects from initial work on relatively floppy low_affinity ligand_binding it was not obvious that mutual_information would successfully predict sites of mutation in a relatively rigid beta_lactamase enzyme although positional_mutual has been used very productively to identify conformational_substates of a protein use of excess mutual_information allows a much more targeted measurement of how individual_residues are related to ligand motion in a manner that is robust even in the presence of weak coupling as we have shown excess mutual_information identifies residues where mutation alters k cat even though these residues are not strongly related to ligand or binding_pocket motions in the full n symmetric uncertainty matrix our primary goal in developing excess mutual_information is to obtain a metric that can predict both binding_pocket mutations and allosteric ones in a single integrated analysis since many structure based_approaches concentrate on the ligand_binding our prediction of both proximate and distant residues demonstrates the power of such an approach another motivation for the use of positional excess mutual_information is that it provides an empirical measurement of positional relatedness that can be complementary to mutational_analysis yet leverages state of the art classical md force_fields for both force calculation and sampling of statistical ensembles of conformations in contrast to methods that compute energy based coupling of protein residues analyses of md trajectories naturally incorporate entropic terms and yield a free_energy based coupling of protein residue motions our analysis identified several previously untested mutations predicted to alter the catalytic_activity and drug_resistance conferred by ctx m we tested a set of these prospective predictions utilizing bacterial drug_resistance as a measure of enzyme_function comparing to low scoring mutations the predicted high_scoring mutations had a much greater effect on enzyme_function than midscoring or low scoring controls showing a fold drop in resistance versus in the aggregate control_groups p via ks test furthermore these mutations that alter drug_resistance are located both within and outside the drug binding_pocket with highscoring mutations as far as a away meeting our design_criteria of a single global analysis to identify both local and allosteric mutants the ability to anticipate altered drug_resistance of new variants is of great utility for clinical surveillance of ctx m beta_lactamases as well as drug_development efforts
