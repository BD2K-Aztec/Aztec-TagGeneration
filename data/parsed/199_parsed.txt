genome_analysis alea a toolbox for allele specific epigenomics analysis the assessment of expression and epigenomic status using sequen_cing based_methods provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify and correlate allelic differences with epigenomic status we present alea a computational toolbox for allele specific epigenomics analysis which incorporates allelic_variation data within existing resources allowing for the identification of significant associations between epigenetic_modifications and specific allelic_variants in human and mouse cells alea provides a customizable pipeline of command_line for allele specific analysis of next_generation data chip_seq rna_seq etc that takes the raw_sequencing and produces separate allelic tracks ready to be viewed on genome_browsers the pipeline has been validated using human and hybrid mouse chip_seq and rna_seq availability the package test data and usage instructions are available online ateach diploid cell consists of two near identical copies of the genome despite the similarity of these paternally and maternally contributed genomes they differ in certain genomic_loci due to heterozygous variants such as single_nucleotide snps indels and structural_variations which can be used to find allele specific as epigenetic variations as events may occur everywhere including regions devoid of heterozygous variants however computational_tools can only focus on heterozygous loci where the allelic differences are distinguishable alleleseq is a computational_pipeline for phasing heterozygous variants from trio father mother and child data constructing diploid personal genome and aligning short_sequencing to maternal and paternal genomes iaseq uses a machine_learning approach to find the allelic_imbalance by jointly analyzing multiple chip_seq and by improving the as inference using correlations among them allim is a more recent as tool for rna_seq analysis of f individuals that generates a polymorphism aware diploid reference_genome from trio genomic and or transcriptomic sequences and corrects the residual mapping bias when measuring the allelic expression imbalance what limits application of these tools for as epigenomics studies is that the majority of genomic_datasets are generated from single patient samples which do not include genomic_data from the parents of the patients also it is not always practical or desirable to sequence multiple epigenomic marks for each patient as required by iaseq to address these limitations we developed a new pipeline alea for as epigenomics analysis alea takes_advantage of the available genomic resources for human the genomes_project consortium and mouse the mouse genomes_project to reconstruct diploid in silico genomes for human or hybrid mice under study then for each accompanying chip_seq or rnaseq dataset alea generates two wiggle track format files from short_reads aligned differentially to each haplotype
