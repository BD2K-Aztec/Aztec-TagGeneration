sparse distance based learning for simultaneous multiclass classification and feature_selection of metagenomic_data motivation direct_sequencing of microbes in human ecosystems the human_microbiome has complemented single_genome cultivation and sequencing to understand and explore the impact of commensal microbes on human_health as sequencing_technologies improve and costs decline the sophistication of data has outgrown available computational_methods while several existing machine_learning have been adapted for analyzing microbiome data recently there is not yet an efficient and dedicated algorithm available for multiclass classification of human_microbiota results by combining instance based and model based learning we propose a novel sparse distance based learning method for simultaneous class_prediction and feature variable or taxa which is used interchangeably selection from multiple treatment populations on the basis of s rrna sequence count_data our proposed method simultaneously minimizes the intraclass distance and maximizes the interclass distance with many fewer estimated parameters than other methods it is very efficient for problems with small_sample and unbalanced classes which are common in metagenomic_studies we implemented this method in a matlab toolbox called metadistance we also propose several approaches for data_normalization and variance stabilization transformation in metadistance we validate this method on several real and simulated s rrna datasets to show that it outperforms_existing for classifying metagenomic_data this article is the first to address simultaneous multifeature selection and class_prediction with metagenomic count_data availability the matlab toolbox is freely_available online atthe human_body is inhabited by on the order of bacteria collectively known as the human_microbiota which contains times more genes the microbiome than in the human_genome to whom correspondence should be addressed since these microbes interact with our bodies and provide functions lacking in our genome changes in the microbial_community are thought to impact our health given the vast number of genes in the microbiome and our inability to sequence all of them a marker gene is often used for comparison among samples the s rrna gene is the most common marker gene used since it is universally present and well conserved among prokaryotes sequencing of s rrna in an environment containing a mixed_population allows the surveying of community_structure without biases from culture based_methods at a relatively low_cost whole_genome shotgun wgs sequencing of the community a metagenome on the other hand can provide estimates of functional_capabilities of microbiome but the cost is substantially_higher a main promise of metagenomics is that it will accelerate the discovery of novel genes and new drug_target and provide new insights into diseases with unknown etiologies the first step of s rrna metagenomic_analysis usually involves the classification of sequences by organism to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset from millions of sequences to thousands of organisms in the process the number of sequences classified to each organism is kept to provide an estimate on organism abundance classification of sequences are done by comparing sequences from a sample to s rrna from known taxa or by clustering of similar sequences into operational_taxonomic otu which represent an unnamed taxon the end result is a series of sequence read_counts associated with taxa in the sample a popular software_package for assigning s rrna to known taxa based on k_mer frequencies is called ribosomal database project rdp classifier in addition to sequence classification software such as mothur and qiime provides diversity metrics and sample comparison statistics allowing comparison of microbiome profiles using alpha within community and beta across communities diversities for graphical comparison megan can compare the otu composition of frequency normalized samples from these analyses we can figure out what organisms are in each of the samples or classes of samples while these tools can be used to compare and cluster samples based on microbiome profiles they do not allow for the identification of differentially_abundant microbes in samples therefore the important question of which organisms by virtue of their presence absence or relative_abundance distinguish one
