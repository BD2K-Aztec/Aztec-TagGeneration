h pop and h popg heuristic partitioning algorithms for single individual haplotyping of polyploids motivation some economically_important plants including wheat and cotton have more than two copies of each chromosome with the decreasing cost and increasing read_length of next_generation reconstructing the multiple haplotypes of a polyploid genome from its sequence_reads becomes practical however the computational challenge in polyploid haplotyping is much greater than that in diploid haplotyping and there are few related methods results this paper models the polyploid haplotyping problem as an optimal poly partition problem of the reads called the polyploid balanced optimal partition pbop model for the reads sequenced from a k ploid genome the model tries to divide the reads into k groups such that the difference between the reads of the same group is minimized while the difference between the reads of different groups is maximized when the genotype_information is available the model is extended to the polyploid balanced optimal partition with genotype constraint pbopg problem these models are all np_hard we propose two heuristic_algorithms h pop and h popg based on dynamic_programming and a strategy of limiting the number of intermediate solutions at each iteration to solve the two models respectively extensive experimental_results on simulated_and show that our algorithms can solve the models effectively and are much faster and more accurate than the recent state of the art polyploid haplotyping algorithms the experiments also show that our algorithms can deal with long_reads and deep read_coverage effectively and accurately furthermore h pop might be applied to help determine the ploidy of an organism availability https github com minzhuxie h popg contact we use both real_data and simulated_data to compare the performance of our algorithms h pop h popg and three recent single individual polyplotyping algorithms hapcompass haptree and sdhap besides aligned snp reads all algorithms except h pop and sdhap require genotype_information as an additional input the weight w is set as for h pop and h popg unless otherwise specified all tests are conducted on some bit nodes with ghz cpu and gb ram of a linux cluster and each result on simulated_data is the average of repeated tests with the same parameters with the rapid development of sequencing_technologies reconstructing the multiple haplotypes of a polyploid from dna sequencing_reads is becoming more and more practical in this paper we modeled polyploid haplotyping as a combinatorial_optimization to partition the input reads called the polyploid balanced optimal partition pbop problem since the problem is np_hard we developed a heuristic_algorithm hpop for it when the genotype_information is available we also proposed a genotype constrained version called pbopg of the problem and designed a corresponding heuristic_algorithm h popg note that these methods are very different from our previous methods for dealing with diploids since they consider the distance between the consensus haplotypes of different groups while the previous methods for diploids calculates the distance between reads belonging to different groups we compared our algorithms with three recent state of the art polyploid haplotyping algorithms sdhap haptree and hapcompass on both simulated_and our extensive test results showed that hpopg was generally more accurate in reconstructing haplotypes than sdhap haptree and hapcompass and h pop was able to achieve comparable though slightly worse performance without the genotype_information furthermore h popg and h pop ran much faster than sdhap haptree and hapcompass and could effectively handle long_reads and deep read_coverage our experiments on real_data also showed that h pop could be used to infer the number of chromosomes of an organism i e its ploidy since when the parameter k is set smaller than the ploidy of the organism the mec rate of h pop would be much larger than the sequencing_error
