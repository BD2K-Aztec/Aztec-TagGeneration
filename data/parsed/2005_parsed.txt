genome_assembly from synthetic long_read clouds motivation despite rapid progress in sequencing_technology assembling de_novo the genomes of new species as well as reconstructing complex metagenomes remains major technological challenges new synthetic long_read slr technologies promise significant advances towards these goals however their applicability is limited by high sequencing requirements and the inability of current assembly paradigms to cope with combinations of short and long_reads results here we introduce architect a new de_novo scaffolder aimed at slr technologies unlike previous assembly strategies architect does not require a costly subassembly step instead it assembles genomes directly from the slrs underlying short_reads which we refer to as read clouds this enables a to fold reduction in sequencing requirements and a fold increase in assembly contiguity on both genomic and metagenomic_datasets relative to state of the art assembly strategies aimed directly at fully subassembled long_reads availability_and our source_code is freely_available at https github com kule shov architect genome sequencing_technology has had an enormous impact on modern science and medicine information gleaned from the genome has become a crucial ingredient in numerous industrial and medical_applications such as breeding disease resistant crops identifying infectious microbes or diagnosing human health_problems yet despite rapid progress in sequencing_technology fully reconstructing de_novo the genomes of new organisms or complex metagenomes still remains a major technological challenge the main obstacle in de_novo remains sequencing read_length current_technologies can only read short hundredbase substrings of the genome recovering the original sequence from these substrings is impossible as they fundamentally cannot resolve the true position of repetitive_sequences that are longer than their own length this results in highly fragmented assemblies that need to be further improved with more sophisticated and expensive techniques recently new synthetic long_read slr technologies have offered great promise towards making inexpensive and accurate de_novo a reality these technologies exhibit read_lengths in the tens of kilobases and theoretically have the power to reconstruct a large fraction of an organisms genome nonetheless slrs have not yet realized their full potential most existing_approaches involve a two stage process in which long fragments are first assembled from short_reads and then the genome is assembled from the long fragments such strategies typically require prohibitively large_amounts of short_read for each long fragment in some cases attaining this high_level of coverage may not even be feasible in addition long_reads often must be complemented by short_reads e g to compensate for sequencing bias yet there are currently very few assemblers that can effectively handle both types of data here we introduce architect a new de_novo scaffolder for slr technologies that aims to address these shortcomings unlike previous assembly strategies architect does not require a costly subassembly step instead it assembles genomes directly from the slrs underlying short_reads moreover by dealing only with short_reads it avoids difficulties that arise from jointly assembling reads of highly differing lengths in practice architect leads to a to fold reduction in sequencing requirements and up to a fold increase in assembly contiguity compared with current state of the art assembly strategies aimed directly at fully subassembled long_reads we demonstrate the improvements offered by architect on the genomes of drosophila_melanogaster and caenorhabditis_elegans as well as on two metagenomic_samples the synthetic mock community from the human_microbiome and a bona_fide human_gut metagenome from a healthy male individual our results suggest that architect may lower the cost of accurate de_novo and facilitate the v c the author published_by assembly_quality a summary of our results can be found in at a high_level architect outperforms alternative assembly strategies and produces genome_assemblies that are up to five times longer than approaches based on shotgun and subassembled slrs moreover architect achieves this performance with only of the sequencing requirements of standard long_read based_methods
