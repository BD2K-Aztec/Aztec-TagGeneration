unicarb db a database resource for glycomic discovery glycosylation is one of the most important post_translational of proteins known to be involved in pathogen recognition innate_immune and protection of epithelial membranes however when compared to the tools and databases available for the processing of high_throughput proteomic_data the glycomic domain is severely lacking while tools to assist the analysis of mass_spectrometry ms and hplc are continuously improving there are few resources available to support liquid_chromatography lc_ms techniques for glycan_structure profiling here we present a platform for presenting oligosaccharide structures and fragment data characterized by lcms ms strategies the database is annotated with high_quality datasets and is designed to extend and reinforce those standards and ontologies developed by existing glycomics databases availability http www unicarbglycosylation is a major post_translational of proteins that involves the addition of sugar_chains to proteins and lipids a highly complex non template driven process that generates a diverse glycome for glycoproteins the extent of microheterogeneity and macroheterogeneity makes the identification of glycosylation_sites and glycan structure_determination a challenging analytical problem diverse structural_modifications can range from a few monosaccharide residues to heavily branched oligosaccharides including modification by non carbohydrate substituents as well as different linkages and anomeric configurations over the past_few analytical_techniques that allow the effective characterization of glycan_structures have advanced in contrast to genomics and proteomics glycan_structures are not template derived and glycomics thus requires well constructed sets of databases to capture glycan_structure and related data that are frequently reported in literature it is accepted that glycoinformatics is in its infancy but there has been a concerted_effort to design glycoinformatic resources to support analytical technologies in the form of a variety of databases tools and web_services reviewed by frank and
