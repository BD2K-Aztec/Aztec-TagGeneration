bacom in silico detection of genomic deletion types and correction of normal_cell in copy_number data motivation identification of somatic dna_copy cnas and significant consensus events sces in cancer_genomes is a main task in discovering potential cancer driving genes such as oncogenes_and the recent development of snp_array technology has facilitated studies on copy_number changes at a genome_wide scale with high_resolution however existing copy_number analysis methods are oblivious to normal_cell and cannot distinguish between contributions of cancerous and normal cells to the measured copy_number signals this contamination could significantly confound downstream_analysis of cnas and affect the power to detect sces in clinical samples results we report here a statistically principled in silico approach bayesian_analysis of copy_number mixtures bacom to accurately estimate genomic deletion type and normal_tissue contamination and accordingly recover the true copy_number profile in cancer_cells we tested the proposed method on two simulated_datasets two prostate_cancer datasets and the cancer_genome high_grade ovarian dataset and obtained very promising results supported by the ground_truth and biological_plausibility moreover based on a large number of comparative simulation_studies the proposed method gives significantly_improved power to detect sces after in silico correction of normal_tissue contamination we develop a cross_platform open_source java_application that implements the whole pipeline of copy_number analysis of heterogeneous cancer tissues including relevant processing_steps we also provide an r interface bacomr for running bacom within the r environment making it straightforward to include in existing data pipelines dna_copy change is an important form of structural_variation in the human_genome somatic copy_number cnas are key genetic_events in the development and progression of human_cancers and frequently contribute to tumorigenesis the coverage of copy_number changes varies from a few hundred to several million nucleotide_bases and somatic cnas in tumors_exhibit highly complex patterns the advance of oligonucleotide based single_nucleotide snp_arrays provides a high_density and allelic specific genomic profile and enables researchers to study copy_number changes on a genomewide scale for instance affymetrix offers several dna analysis arrays for snp_genotyping and copy_number cnv analysis and the newest affymetrix genome_wide human snp_array features million genetic_markers including more than snps and more than probes for detecting cnvs or cnas quantitative analysis of somatic cnas has found broad application in cancer research although molecular analysis of tumors in their native_tissue environment provides the most accurate picture of their in vivo state tissue_samples often consist of mixed cancer and normal cells and accordingly the observed snp intensity signals are the weighted_sum of the copy_numbers contributed from both cancer and normal cells this tissue_heterogeneity inherited in the measured copy_number signals could significantly confound subsequent marker identification and molecular diagnosis rooted in cancer_cells e g true copy_number estimation consensus region detection cna association studies and detection of loss_of and homozygous_deletion experimental methods for minimizing normal_cell such as cell enrichment or purification are prohibitively_expensive inconvenient and prone to errors here we ask whether it is possible to computationally correct normal_tissue contamination by estimating the proportions of normal and cancer_cells and recovering the true copy_number profiles of cancer_cells based on the observed snp intensity signals frompage
